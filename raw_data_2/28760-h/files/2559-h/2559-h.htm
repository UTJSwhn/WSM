    <h2>
      PREFACE:
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Forsyte Saga&rdquo; was the title originally destined for that
      part of it which is called &ldquo;The Man of Property&rdquo;; and to adopt
      it for the collected chronicles of the Forsyte family has indulged the
      Forsytean tenacity that is in all of us. The word Saga might be objected
      to on the ground that it connotes the heroic and that there is little
      heroism in these pages. But it is used with a suitable irony; and, after
      all, this long tale, though it may deal with folk in frock coats,
      furbelows, and a gilt-edged period, is not devoid of the essential heat of
      conflict. Discounting for the gigantic stature and blood-thirstiness of
      old days, as they have come down to us in fairy-tale and legend, the folk
      of the old Sagas were Forsytes, assuredly, in their possessive instincts,
      and as little proof against the inroads of beauty and passion as Swithin,
      Soames, or even Young Jolyon. And if heroic figures, in days that never
      were, seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion unbecoming to
      a Forsyte of the Victorian era, we may be sure that tribal instinct was
      even then the prime force, and that &ldquo;family&rdquo; and the sense of
      home and property counted as they do to this day, for all the recent
      efforts to &ldquo;talk them out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So many people have written and claimed that their families were the
      originals of the Forsytes that one has been almost encouraged to believe
      in the typicality of an imagined species. Manners change and modes evolve,
      and &ldquo;Timothy&rsquo;s on the Bayswater Road&rdquo; becomes a nest of
      the unbelievable in all except essentials; we shall not look upon its like
      again, nor perhaps on such a one as James or Old Jolyon. And yet the
      figures of Insurance Societies and the utterances of Judges reassure us
      daily that our earthly paradise is still a rich preserve, where the wild
      raiders, Beauty and Passion, come stealing in, filching security from
      beneath our noses. As surely as a dog will bark at a brass band, so will
      the essential Soames in human nature ever rise up uneasily against the
      dissolution which hovers round the folds of ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the dead Past bury its dead&rdquo; would be a better saying if
      the Past ever died. The persistence of the Past is one of those
      tragi-comic blessings which each new age denies, coming cocksure on to the
      stage to mouth its claim to a perfect novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no Age is so new as that! Human Nature, under its changing pretensions
      and clothes, is and ever will be very much of a Forsyte, and might, after
      all, be a much worse animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back on the Victorian era, whose ripeness, decline, and &lsquo;fall-of&rsquo;
      is in some sort pictured in &ldquo;The Forsyte Saga,&rdquo; we see now
      that we have but jumped out of a frying-pan into a fire. It would be
      difficult to substantiate a claim that the case of England was better in
      1913 than it was in 1886, when the Forsytes assembled at Old Jolyon&rsquo;s
      to celebrate the engagement of June to Philip Bosinney. And in 1920, when
      again the clan gathered to bless the marriage of Fleur with Michael Mont,
      the state of England is as surely too molten and bankrupt as in the
      eighties it was too congealed and low-percented. If these chronicles had
      been a really scientific study of transition one would have dwelt probably
      on such factors as the invention of bicycle, motor-car, and
      flying-machine; the arrival of a cheap Press; the decline of country life
      and increase of the towns; the birth of the Cinema. Men are, in fact,
      quite unable to control their own inventions; they at best develop
      adaptability to the new conditions those inventions create.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this long tale is no scientific study of a period; it is rather an
      intimate incarnation of the disturbance that Beauty effects in the lives
      of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure of Irene, never, as the reader may possibly have observed,
      present, except through the senses of other characters, is a concretion of
      disturbing Beauty impinging on a possessive world.
    </p>
    <p>
      One has noticed that readers, as they wade on through the salt waters of
      the Saga, are inclined more and more to pity Soames, and to think that in
      doing so they are in revolt against the mood of his creator. Far from it!
      He, too, pities Soames, the tragedy of whose life is the very simple,
      uncontrollable tragedy of being unlovable, without quite a thick enough
      skin to be thoroughly unconscious of the fact. Not even Fleur loves Soames
      as he feels he ought to be loved. But in pitying Soames, readers incline,
      perhaps, to animus against Irene: After all, they think, he wasn&rsquo;t a
      bad fellow, it wasn&rsquo;t his fault; she ought to have forgiven him, and
      so on!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, taking sides, they lose perception of the simple truth, which
      underlies the whole story, that where sex attraction is utterly and
      definitely lacking in one partner to a union, no amount of pity, or
      reason, or duty, or what not, can overcome a repulsion implicit in Nature.
      Whether it ought to, or no, is beside the point; because in fact it never
      does. And where Irene seems hard and cruel, as in the Bois de Boulogne, or
      the Goupenor Gallery, she is but wisely realistic&mdash;knowing that the
      least concession is the inch which precedes the impossible, the repulsive
      ell.
    </p>
    <p>
      A criticism one might pass on the last phase of the Saga is the complaint
      that Irene and Jolyon those rebels against property&mdash;claim spiritual
      property in their son Jon. But it would be hypercriticism, as the tale is
      told. No father and mother could have let the boy marry Fleur without
      knowledge of the facts; and the facts determine Jon, not the persuasion of
      his parents. Moreover, Jolyon&rsquo;s persuasion is not on his own
      account, but on Irene&rsquo;s, and Irene&rsquo;s persuasion becomes a
      reiterated: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think of me, think of yourself!&rdquo; That
      Jon, knowing the facts, can realise his mother&rsquo;s feelings, will
      hardly with justice be held proof that she is, after all, a Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though the impingement of Beauty and the claims of Freedom on a
      possessive world are the main prepossessions of the Forsyte Saga, it
      cannot be absolved from the charge of embalming the upper-middle class. As
      the old Egyptians placed around their mummies the necessaries of a future
      existence, so I have endeavoured to lay beside the figures of Aunts Ann
      and Juley and Hester, of Timothy and Swithin, of Old Jolyon and James, and
      of their sons, that which shall guarantee them a little life here-after, a
      little balm in the hurried Gilead of a dissolving &ldquo;Progress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If the upper-middle class, with other classes, is destined to &ldquo;move
      on&rdquo; into amorphism, here, pickled in these pages, it lies under
      glass for strollers in the wide and ill-arranged museum of Letters. Here
      it rests, preserved in its own juice: The Sense of Property. 1922.

      CHAPTER I&mdash;&rsquo;AT HOME&rsquo; AT OLD JOLYON&rsquo;S
    </h2>
    <p>
      Those privileged to be present at a family festival of the Forsytes have
      seen that charming and instructive sight&mdash;an upper middle-class
      family in full plumage. But whosoever of these favoured persons has
      possessed the gift of psychological analysis (a talent without monetary
      value and properly ignored by the Forsytes), has witnessed a spectacle,
      not only delightful in itself, but illustrative of an obscure human
      problem. In plainer words, he has gleaned from a gathering of this family&mdash;no
      branch of which had a liking for the other, between no three members of
      whom existed anything worthy of the name of sympathy&mdash;evidence of
      that mysterious concrete tenacity which renders a family so formidable a
      unit of society, so clear a reproduction of society in miniature. He has
      been admitted to a vision of the dim roads of social progress, has
      understood something of patriarchal life, of the swarmings of savage
      hordes, of the rise and fall of nations. He is like one who, having
      watched a tree grow from its planting&mdash;a paragon of tenacity,
      insulation, and success, amidst the deaths of a hundred other plants less
      fibrous, sappy, and persistent&mdash;one day will see it flourishing with
      bland, full foliage, in an almost repugnant prosperity, at the summit of
      its efflorescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On June 15, eighteen eighty-six, about four of the afternoon, the observer
      who chanced to be present at the house of old Jolyon Forsyte in Stanhope
      Gate, might have seen the highest efflorescence of the Forsytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the occasion of an &lsquo;at home&rsquo; to celebrate the
      engagement of Miss June Forsyte, old Jolyon&rsquo;s granddaughter, to Mr.
      Philip Bosinney. In the bravery of light gloves, buff waistcoats, feathers
      and frocks, the family were present, even Aunt Ann, who now but seldom
      left the corner of her brother Timothy&rsquo;s green drawing-room, where,
      under the aegis of a plume of dyed pampas grass in a light blue vase, she
      sat all day reading and knitting, surrounded by the effigies of three
      generations of Forsytes. Even Aunt Ann was there; her inflexible back, and
      the dignity of her calm old face personifying the rigid possessiveness of
      the family idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a Forsyte was engaged, married, or born, the Forsytes were present;
      when a Forsyte died&mdash;but no Forsyte had as yet died; they did not
      die; death being contrary to their principles, they took precautions
      against it, the instinctive precautions of highly vitalized persons who
      resent encroachments on their property.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the Forsytes mingling that day with the crowd of other guests, there
      was a more than ordinarily groomed look, an alert, inquisitive assurance,
      a brilliant respectability, as though they were attired in defiance of
      something. The habitual sniff on the face of Soames Forsyte had spread
      through their ranks; they were on their guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subconscious offensiveness of their attitude has constituted old
      Jolyon&rsquo;s &lsquo;home&rsquo; the psychological moment of the family
      history, made it the prelude of their drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Forsytes were resentful of something, not individually, but as a
      family; this resentment expressed itself in an added perfection of
      raiment, an exuberance of family cordiality, an exaggeration of family
      importance, and&mdash;the sniff. Danger&mdash;so indispensable in bringing
      out the fundamental quality of any society, group, or individual&mdash;was
      what the Forsytes scented; the premonition of danger put a burnish on
      their armour. For the first time, as a family, they appeared to have an
      instinct of being in contact, with some strange and unsafe thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over against the piano a man of bulk and stature was wearing two
      waistcoats on his wide chest, two waistcoats and a ruby pin, instead of
      the single satin waistcoat and diamond pin of more usual occasions, and
      his shaven, square, old face, the colour of pale leather, with pale eyes,
      had its most dignified look, above his satin stock. This was Swithin
      Forsyte. Close to the window, where he could get more than his fair share
      of fresh air, the other twin, James&mdash;the fat and the lean of it, old
      Jolyon called these brothers&mdash;like the bulky Swithin, over six feet
      in height, but very lean, as though destined from his birth to strike a
      balance and maintain an average, brooded over the scene with his permanent
      stoop; his grey eyes had an air of fixed absorption in some secret worry,
      broken at intervals by a rapid, shifting scrutiny of surrounding facts;
      his cheeks, thinned by two parallel folds, and a long, clean-shaven upper
      lip, were framed within Dundreary whiskers. In his hands he turned and
      turned a piece of china. Not far off, listening to a lady in brown, his
      only son Soames, pale and well-shaved, dark-haired, rather bald, had poked
      his chin up sideways, carrying his nose with that aforesaid appearance of
      &lsquo;sniff,&rsquo; as though despising an egg which he knew he could not
      digest. Behind him his cousin, the tall George, son of the fifth Forsyte,
      Roger, had a Quilpish look on his fleshy face, pondering one of his
      sardonic jests. Something inherent to the occasion had affected them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated in a row close to one another were three ladies&mdash;Aunts Ann,
      Hester (the two Forsyte maids), and Juley (short for Julia), who not in
      first youth had so far forgotten herself as to marry Septimus Small, a man
      of poor constitution. She had survived him for many years. With her elder
      and younger sister she lived now in the house of Timothy, her sixth and
      youngest brother, on the Bayswater Road. Each of these ladies held fans in
      their hands, and each with some touch of colour, some emphatic feather or
      brooch, testified to the solemnity of the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of the room, under the chandelier, as became a host, stood
      the head of the family, old Jolyon himself. Eighty years of age, with his
      fine, white hair, his dome-like forehead, his little, dark grey eyes, and
      an immense white moustache, which drooped and spread below the level of
      his strong jaw, he had a patriarchal look, and in spite of lean cheeks and
      hollows at his temples, seemed master of perennial youth. He held himself
      extremely upright, and his shrewd, steady eyes had lost none of their
      clear shining. Thus he gave an impression of superiority to the doubts and
      dislikes of smaller men. Having had his own way for innumerable years, he
      had earned a prescriptive right to it. It would never have occurred to old
      Jolyon that it was necessary to wear a look of doubt or of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between him and the four other brothers who were present, James, Swithin,
      Nicholas, and Roger, there was much difference, much similarity. In turn,
      each of these four brothers was very different from the other, yet they,
      too, were alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the varying features and expression of those five faces could be
      marked a certain steadfastness of chin, underlying surface distinctions,
      marking a racial stamp, too prehistoric to trace, too remote and permanent
      to discuss&mdash;the very hall-mark and guarantee of the family fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the younger generation, in the tall, bull-like George, in pallid
      strenuous Archibald, in young Nicholas with his sweet and tentative
      obstinacy, in the grave and foppishly determined Eustace, there was this
      same stamp&mdash;less meaningful perhaps, but unmistakable&mdash;a sign of
      something ineradicable in the family soul. At one time or another during
      the afternoon, all these faces, so dissimilar and so alike, had worn an
      expression of distrust, the object of which was undoubtedly the man whose
      acquaintance they were thus assembled to make. Philip Bosinney was known
      to be a young man without fortune, but Forsyte girls had become engaged to
      such before, and had actually married them. It was not altogether for this
      reason, therefore, that the minds of the Forsytes misgave them. They could
      not have explained the origin of a misgiving obscured by the mist of
      family gossip. A story was undoubtedly told that he had paid his duty call
      to Aunts Ann, Juley, and Hester, in a soft grey hat&mdash;a soft grey hat,
      not even a new one&mdash;a dusty thing with a shapeless crown. &ldquo;So,
      extraordinary, my dear&mdash;so odd,&rdquo; Aunt Hester, passing through
      the little, dark hall (she was rather short-sighted), had tried to &lsquo;shoo&rsquo;
      it off a chair, taking it for a strange, disreputable cat&mdash;Tommy had
      such disgraceful friends! She was disturbed when it did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like an artist for ever seeking to discover the significant trifle which
      embodies the whole character of a scene, or place, or person, so those
      unconscious artists&mdash;the Forsytes had fastened by intuition on this
      hat; it was their significant trifle, the detail in which was embedded the
      meaning of the whole matter; for each had asked himself: &ldquo;Come, now,
      should I have paid that visit in that hat?&rdquo; and each had answered
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and some, with more imagination than others, had added:
      &ldquo;It would never have come into my head!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George, on hearing the story, grinned. The hat had obviously been worn as
      a practical joke! He himself was a connoisseur of such. &ldquo;Very
      haughty!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the wild Buccaneer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And this mot, the &lsquo;Buccaneer,&rsquo; was bandied from mouth to
      mouth, till it became the favourite mode of alluding to Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her aunts reproached June afterwards about the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think you ought to let him, dear!&rdquo; they had
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      June had answered in her imperious brisk way, like the little embodiment
      of will she was: &ldquo;Oh! what does it matter? Phil never knows what he&rsquo;s
      got on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had credited an answer so outrageous. A man not to know what he had
      on? No, no! What indeed was this young man, who, in becoming engaged to
      June, old Jolyon&rsquo;s acknowledged heiress, had done so well for
      himself? He was an architect, not in itself a sufficient reason for
      wearing such a hat. None of the Forsytes happened to be architects, but
      one of them knew two architects who would never have worn such a hat upon
      a call of ceremony in the London season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dangerous&mdash;ah, dangerous! June, of course, had not seen this, but,
      though not yet nineteen, she was notorious. Had she not said to Mrs.
      Soames&mdash;who was always so beautifully dressed&mdash;that feathers
      were vulgar? Mrs. Soames had actually given up wearing feathers, so
      dreadfully downright was dear June!
    </p>
    <p>
      These misgivings, this disapproval, and perfectly genuine distrust, did
      not prevent the Forsytes from gathering to old Jolyon&rsquo;s invitation.
      An &lsquo;At Home&rsquo; at Stanhope Gate was a great rarity; none had
      been held for twelve years, not indeed, since old Mrs. Jolyon had died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had there been so full an assembly, for, mysteriously united in
      spite of all their differences, they had taken arms against a common
      peril. Like cattle when a dog comes into the field, they stood head to
      head and shoulder to shoulder, prepared to run upon and trample the
      invader to death. They had come, too, no doubt, to get some notion of what
      sort of presents they would ultimately be expected to give; for though the
      question of wedding gifts was usually graduated in this way: &lsquo;What
      are you givin&rsquo;. Nicholas is givin&rsquo; spoons!&rsquo;&mdash;so
      very much depended on the bridegroom. If he were sleek, well-brushed,
      prosperous-looking, it was more necessary to give him nice things; he
      would expect them. In the end each gave exactly what was right and proper,
      by a species of family adjustment arrived at as prices are arrived at on
      the Stock Exchange&mdash;the exact niceties being regulated at Timothy&rsquo;s
      commodious, red-brick residence in Bayswater, overlooking the Park, where
      dwelt Aunts Ann, Juley, and Hester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The uneasiness of the Forsyte family has been justified by the simple
      mention of the hat. How impossible and wrong would it have been for any
      family, with the regard for appearances which should ever characterize the
      great upper middle-class, to feel otherwise than uneasy!
    </p>
    <p>
      The author of the uneasiness stood talking to June by the further door;
      his curly hair had a rumpled appearance, as though he found what was going
      on around him unusual. He had an air, too, of having a joke all to
      himself. George, speaking aside to his brother, Eustace, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks as if he might make a bolt of it&mdash;the dashing Buccaneer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This &lsquo;very singular-looking man,&rsquo; as Mrs. Small afterwards
      called him, was of medium height and strong build, with a pale, brown
      face, a dust-coloured moustache, very prominent cheek-bones, and hollow
      checks. His forehead sloped back towards the crown of his head, and bulged
      out in bumps over the eyes, like foreheads seen in the Lion-house at the
      Zoo. He had sherry-coloured eyes, disconcertingly inattentive at times.
      Old Jolyon&rsquo;s coachman, after driving June and Bosinney to the
      theatre, had remarked to the butler:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno what to make of &lsquo;im. Looks to me for all the world
      like an &lsquo;alf-tame leopard.&rdquo; And every now and then a Forsyte
      would come up, sidle round, and take a look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      June stood in front, fending off this idle curiosity&mdash;a little bit of
      a thing, as somebody once said, &lsquo;all hair and spirit,&rsquo; with
      fearless blue eyes, a firm jaw, and a bright colour, whose face and body
      seemed too slender for her crown of red-gold hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall woman, with a beautiful figure, which some member of the family had
      once compared to a heathen goddess, stood looking at these two with a
      shadowy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands, gloved in French grey, were crossed one over the other, her
      grave, charming face held to one side, and the eyes of all men near were
      fastened on it. Her figure swayed, so balanced that the very air seemed to
      set it moving. There was warmth, but little colour, in her cheeks; her
      large, dark eyes were soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was at her lips&mdash;asking a question, giving an answer, with
      that shadowy smile&mdash;that men looked; they were sensitive lips,
      sensuous and sweet, and through them seemed to come warmth and perfume
      like the warmth and perfume of a flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engaged couple thus scrutinized were unconscious of this passive
      goddess. It was Bosinney who first noticed her, and asked her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      June took her lover up to the woman with the beautiful figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irene is my greatest chum,&rdquo; she said: &ldquo;Please be good
      friends, you two!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the little lady&rsquo;s command they all three smiled; and while they
      were smiling, Soames Forsyte, silently appearing from behind the woman
      with the beautiful figure, who was his wife, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! introduce me too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was seldom, indeed, far from Irene&rsquo;s side at public functions,
      and even when separated by the exigencies of social intercourse, could be
      seen following her about with his eyes, in which were strange expressions
      of watchfulness and longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the window his father, James, was still scrutinizing the marks on the
      piece of china.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder at Jolyon&rsquo;s allowing this engagement,&rdquo; he said
      to Aunt Ann. &ldquo;They tell me there&rsquo;s no chance of their getting
      married for years. This young Bosinney&rdquo; (he made the word a dactyl
      in opposition to general usage of a short o) &ldquo;has got nothing. When
      Winifred married Dartie, I made him bring every penny into settlement&mdash;lucky
      thing, too&mdash;they&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; had nothing by this time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Ann looked up from her velvet chair. Grey curls banded her forehead,
      curls that, unchanged for decades, had extinguished in the family all
      sense of time. She made no reply, for she rarely spoke, husbanding her
      aged voice; but to James, uneasy of conscience, her look was as good as an
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help Irene&rsquo;s
      having no money. Soames was in such a hurry; he got quite thin dancing
      attendance on her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting the bowl pettishly down on the piano, he let his eyes wander to
      the group by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion,&rdquo; he said unexpectedly, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s
      just as well as it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Ann did not ask him to explain this strange utterance. She knew what
      he was thinking. If Irene had no money she would not be so foolish as to
      do anything wrong; for they said&mdash;they said&mdash;she had been asking
      for a separate room; but, of course, Soames had not....
    </p>
    <p>
      James interrupted her reverie:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;was Timothy? Hadn&rsquo;t he
      come with them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Through Aunt Ann&rsquo;s compressed lips a tender smile forced its way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t think it wise, with so much of this diphtheria
      about; and he so liable to take things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, HE takes good care of himself. I can&rsquo;t afford to take
      the care of myself that he does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it easy to say which, of admiration, envy, or contempt, was
      dominant in that remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy, indeed, was seldom seen. The baby of the family, a publisher by
      profession, he had some years before, when business was at full tide,
      scented out the stagnation which, indeed, had not yet come, but which
      ultimately, as all agreed, was bound to set in, and, selling his share in
      a firm engaged mainly in the production of religious books, had invested
      the quite conspicuous proceeds in three per cent. consols. By this act he
      had at once assumed an isolated position, no other Forsyte being content
      with less than four per cent. for his money; and this isolation had slowly
      and surely undermined a spirit perhaps better than commonly endowed with
      caution. He had become almost a myth&mdash;a kind of incarnation of
      security haunting the background of the Forsyte universe. He had never
      committed the imprudence of marrying, or encumbering himself in any way
      with children.
    </p>
    <p>
      James resumed, tapping the piece of china:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t real old Worcester. I s&rsquo;pose Jolyon&rsquo;s
      told you something about the young man. From all I can learn, he&rsquo;s
      got no business, no income, and no connection worth speaking of; but then,
      I know nothing&mdash;nobody tells me anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Ann shook her head. Over her square-chinned, aquiline old face a
      trembling passed; the spidery fingers of her hands pressed against each
      other and interlaced, as though she were subtly recharging her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eldest by some years of all the Forsytes, she held a peculiar position
      amongst them. Opportunists and egotists one and all&mdash;though not,
      indeed, more so than their neighbours&mdash;they quailed before her
      incorruptible figure, and, when opportunities were too strong, what could
      they do but avoid her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Twisting his long, thin legs, James went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolyon, he will have his own way. He&rsquo;s got no children&rdquo;&mdash;and
      stopped, recollecting the continued existence of old Jolyon&rsquo;s son,
      young Jolyon, June&rsquo;s father, who had made such a mess of it, and
      done for himself by deserting his wife and child and running away with
      that foreign governess. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he resumed hastily, &ldquo;if
      he likes to do these things, I s&rsquo;pose he can afford to. Now, what&rsquo;s
      he going to give her? I s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;ll give her a thousand a
      year; he&rsquo;s got nobody else to leave his money to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stretched out his hand to meet that of a dapper, clean-shaven man, with
      hardly a hair on his head, a long, broken nose, full lips, and cold grey
      eyes under rectangular brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Nick,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas Forsyte, with his bird-like rapidity and the look of a
      preternaturally sage schoolboy (he had made a large fortune, quite
      legitimately, out of the companies of which he was a director), placed
      within that cold palm the tips of his still colder fingers and hastily
      withdrew them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bad,&rdquo; he said, pouting&mdash;&ldquo;been bad all
      the week; don&rsquo;t sleep at night. The doctor can&rsquo;t tell why. He&rsquo;s
      a clever fellow, or I shouldn&rsquo;t have him, but I get nothing out of
      him but bills.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctors!&rdquo; said James, coming down sharp on his words: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      had all the doctors in London for one or another of us. There&rsquo;s no
      satisfaction to be got out of them; they&rsquo;ll tell you anything. There&rsquo;s
      Swithin, now. What good have they done him? There he is; he&rsquo;s bigger
      than ever; he&rsquo;s enormous; they can&rsquo;t get his weight down. Look
      at him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin Forsyte, tall, square, and broad, with a chest like a pouter
      pigeon&rsquo;s in its plumage of bright waistcoats, came strutting towards
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;how are you?&rdquo; he said in his dandified way,
      aspirating the &lsquo;h&rsquo; strongly (this difficult letter was almost
      absolutely safe in his keeping)&mdash;&ldquo;how are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Each brother wore an air of aggravation as he looked at the other two,
      knowing by experience that they would try to eclipse his ailments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were just saying,&rdquo; said James, &ldquo;that you don&rsquo;t
      get any thinner.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin protruded his pale round eyes with the effort of hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinner? I&rsquo;m in good case,&rdquo; he said, leaning a little
      forward, &ldquo;not one of your thread-papers like you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, afraid of losing the expansion of his chest, he leaned back again
      into a state of immobility, for he prized nothing so highly as a
      distinguished appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Ann turned her old eyes from one to the other. Indulgent and severe
      was her look. In turn the three brothers looked at Ann. She was getting
      shaky. Wonderful woman! Eighty-six if a day; might live another ten years,
      and had never been strong. Swithin and James, the twins, were only
      seventy-five, Nicholas a mere baby of seventy or so. All were strong, and
      the inference was comforting. Of all forms of property their respective
      healths naturally concerned them most.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very well in myself,&rdquo; proceeded James, &ldquo;but
      my nerves are out of order. The least thing worries me to death. I shall
      have to go to Bath.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bath!&rdquo; said Nicholas. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried Harrogate. That&rsquo;s
      no good. What I want is sea air. There&rsquo;s nothing like Yarmouth. Now,
      when I go there I sleep....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My liver&rsquo;s very bad,&rdquo; interrupted Swithin slowly.
      &ldquo;Dreadful pain here;&rdquo; and he placed his hand on his right
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want of exercise,&rdquo; muttered James, his eyes on the china. He
      quickly added: &ldquo;I get a pain there, too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin reddened, a resemblance to a turkey-cock coming upon his old face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exercise!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I take plenty: I never use the
      lift at the Club.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; James hurried out. &ldquo;I know
      nothing about anybody; nobody tells me anything....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin fixed him with a stare:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you do for a pain there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take a compound....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, uncle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June stood before him, her resolute small face raised from her little
      height to his great height, and her hand outheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brightness faded from James&rsquo;s visage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he said, brooding over her. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re
      going to Wales to-morrow to visit your young man&rsquo;s aunts? You&rsquo;ll
      have a lot of rain there. This isn&rsquo;t real old Worcester.&rdquo; He
      tapped the bowl. &ldquo;Now, that set I gave your mother when she married
      was the genuine thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June shook hands one by one with her three great-uncles, and turned to
      Aunt Ann. A very sweet look had come into the old lady&rsquo;s face, she
      kissed the girl&rsquo;s check with trembling fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and so you&rsquo;re going
      for a whole month!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl passed on, and Aunt Ann looked after her slim little figure. The
      old lady&rsquo;s round, steel grey eyes, over which a film like a bird&rsquo;s
      was beginning to come, followed her wistfully amongst the bustling crowd,
      for people were beginning to say good-bye; and her finger-tips, pressing
      and pressing against each other, were busy again with the recharging of
      her will against that inevitable ultimate departure of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;everybody&rsquo;s been most kind;
      quite a lot of people come to congratulate her. She ought to be very
      happy.&rsquo; Amongst the throng of people by the door, the well-dressed
      throng drawn from the families of lawyers and doctors, from the Stock
      Exchange, and all the innumerable avocations of the upper-middle class&mdash;there
      were only some twenty percent of Forsytes; but to Aunt Ann they seemed all
      Forsytes&mdash;and certainly there was not much difference&mdash;she saw
      only her own flesh and blood. It was her world, this family, and she knew
      no other, had never perhaps known any other. All their little secrets,
      illnesses, engagements, and marriages, how they were getting on, and
      whether they were making money&mdash;all this was her property, her
      delight, her life; beyond this only a vague, shadowy mist of facts and
      persons of no real significance. This it was that she would have to lay
      down when it came to her turn to die; this which gave to her that
      importance, that secret self-importance, without which none of us can bear
      to live; and to this she clung wistfully, with a greed that grew each day!
      If life were slipping away from her, this she would retain to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of June&rsquo;s father, young Jolyon, who had run away with
      that foreign girl. And what a sad blow to his father and to them all. Such
      a promising young fellow! A sad blow, though there had been no public
      scandal, most fortunately, Jo&rsquo;s wife seeking for no divorce! A long
      time ago! And when June&rsquo;s mother died, six years ago, Jo had married
      that woman, and they had two children now, so she had heard. Still, he had
      forfeited his right to be there, had cheated her of the complete
      fulfilment of her family pride, deprived her of the rightful pleasure of
      seeing and kissing him of whom she had been so proud, such a promising
      young fellow! The thought rankled with the bitterness of a long-inflicted
      injury in her tenacious old heart. A little water stood in her eyes. With
      a handkerchief of the finest lawn she wiped them stealthily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Aunt Ann?&rdquo; said a voice behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames Forsyte, flat-shouldered, clean-shaven, flat-cheeked, flat-waisted,
      yet with something round and secret about his whole appearance, looked
      downwards and aslant at Aunt Ann, as though trying to see through the side
      of his own nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of the engagement?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Ann&rsquo;s eyes rested on him proudly; of all the nephews since
      young Jolyon&rsquo;s departure from the family nest, he was now her
      favourite, for she recognised in him a sure trustee of the family soul
      that must so soon slip beyond her keeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nice for the young man,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s
      a good-looking young fellow; but I doubt if he&rsquo;s quite the right
      lover for dear June.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames touched the edge of a gold-lacquered lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll tame him,&rdquo; he said, stealthily wetting his
      finger and rubbing it on the knobby bulbs. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s genuine old
      lacquer; you can&rsquo;t get it nowadays. It&rsquo;d do well in a sale at
      Jobson&rsquo;s.&rdquo; He spoke with relish, as though he felt that he was
      cheering up his old aunt. It was seldom he was so confidential. &ldquo;I
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind having it myself,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;you can
      always get your price for old lacquer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so clever with all those things,&rdquo; said Aunt Ann.
      &ldquo;And how is dear Irene?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames&rsquo;s smile died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Complains she can&rsquo;t
      sleep; she sleeps a great deal better than I do,&rdquo; and he looked at
      his wife, who was talking to Bosinney by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Ann sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it will be just as well for her
      not to see so much of June. She&rsquo;s such a decided character, dear
      June!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames flushed; his flushes passed rapidly over his flat cheeks and
      centered between his eyes, where they remained, the stamp of disturbing
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what she sees in that little flibbertigibbet,&rdquo;
      he burst out, but noticing that they were no longer alone, he turned and
      again began examining the lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me Jolyon&rsquo;s bought another house,&rdquo; said his
      father&rsquo;s voice close by; &ldquo;he must have a lot of money&mdash;he
      must have more money than he knows what to do with! Montpellier Square,
      they say; close to Soames! They never told me, Irene never tells me
      anything!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital position, not two minutes from me,&rdquo; said the voice of
      Swithin, &ldquo;and from my rooms I can drive to the Club in eight.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The position of their houses was of vital importance to the Forsytes, nor
      was this remarkable, since the whole spirit of their success was embodied
      therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their father, of farming stock, had come from Dorsetshire near the
      beginning of the century.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Superior Dosset Forsyte, as he was called by his intimates, had
      been a stonemason by trade, and risen to the position of a master-builder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of his life he moved to London, where, building on until
      he died, he was buried at Highgate. He left over thirty thousand pounds
      between his ten children. Old Jolyon alluded to him, if at all, as &lsquo;A
      hard, thick sort of man; not much refinement about him.&rsquo; The second
      generation of Forsytes felt indeed that he was not greatly to their
      credit. The only aristocratic trait they could find in his character was a
      habit of drinking Madeira.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester, an authority on family history, described him thus: &ldquo;I
      don&rsquo;t recollect that he ever did anything; at least, not in my time.
      He was er&mdash;an owner of houses, my dear. His hair about your Uncle
      Swithin&rsquo;s colour; rather a square build. Tall? No&mdash;not very
      tall&rdquo; (he had been five feet five, with a mottled face); &ldquo;a
      fresh-coloured man. I remember he used to drink Madeira; but ask your Aunt
      Ann. What was his father? He&mdash;er&mdash;had to do with the land down
      in Dorsetshire, by the sea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James once went down to see for himself what sort of place this was that
      they had come from. He found two old farms, with a cart track rutted into
      the pink earth, leading down to a mill by the beach; a little grey church
      with a buttressed outer wall, and a smaller and greyer chapel. The stream
      which worked the mill came bubbling down in a dozen rivulets, and pigs
      were hunting round that estuary. A haze hovered over the prospect. Down
      this hollow, with their feet deep in the mud and their faces towards the
      sea, it appeared that the primeval Forsytes had been content to walk
      Sunday after Sunday for hundreds of years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or no James had cherished hopes of an inheritance, or of something
      rather distinguished to be found down there, he came back to town in a
      poor way, and went about with a pathetic attempt at making the best of a
      bad job.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s very little to be had out of that,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;regular country little place, old as the hills....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Its age was felt to be a comfort. Old Jolyon, in whom a desperate honesty
      welled up at times, would allude to his ancestors as: &ldquo;Yeomen&mdash;I
      suppose very small beer.&rdquo; Yet he would repeat the word &lsquo;yeomen&rsquo;
      as if it afforded him consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had all done so well for themselves, these Forsytes, that they were
      all what is called &lsquo;of a certain position.&rsquo; They had shares in
      all sorts of things, not as yet&mdash;with the exception of Timothy&mdash;in
      consols, for they had no dread in life like that of 3 per cent. for their
      money. They collected pictures, too, and were supporters of such
      charitable institutions as might be beneficial to their sick domestics.
      From their father, the builder, they inherited a talent for bricks and
      mortar. Originally, perhaps, members of some primitive sect, they were now
      in the natural course of things members of the Church of England, and
      caused their wives and children to attend with some regularity the more
      fashionable churches of the Metropolis. To have doubted their Christianity
      would have caused them both pain and surprise. Some of them paid for pews,
      thus expressing in the most practical form their sympathy with the
      teachings of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their residences, placed at stated intervals round the park, watched like
      sentinels, lest the fair heart of this London, where their desires were
      fixed, should slip from their clutches, and leave them lower in their own
      estimations.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was old Jolyon in Stanhope Place; the Jameses in Park Lane; Swithin
      in the lonely glory of orange and blue chambers in Hyde Park Mansions&mdash;he
      had never married, not he&mdash;the Soamses in their nest off
      Knightsbridge; the Rogers in Prince&rsquo;s Gardens (Roger was that
      remarkable Forsyte who had conceived and carried out the notion of
      bringing up his four sons to a new profession. &ldquo;Collect house
      property, nothing like it,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;I never did
      anything else&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Haymans again&mdash;Mrs. Hayman was the one married Forsyte sister&mdash;in
      a house high up on Campden Hill, shaped like a giraffe, and so tall that
      it gave the observer a crick in the neck; the Nicholases in Ladbroke
      Grove, a spacious abode and a great bargain; and last, but not least,
      Timothy&rsquo;s on the Bayswater Road, where Ann, and Juley, and Hester,
      lived under his protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this time James was musing, and now he inquired of his host and
      brother what he had given for that house in Montpellier Square. He himself
      had had his eye on a house there for the last two years, but they wanted
      such a price.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon recounted the details of his purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-two years to run?&rdquo; repeated James; &ldquo;The very
      house I was after&mdash;you&rsquo;ve given too much for it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I want it,&rdquo; said James hastily; &ldquo;it
      wouldn&rsquo;t suit my purpose at that price. Soames knows the house, well&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
      tell you it&rsquo;s too dear&mdash;his opinion&rsquo;s worth having.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said old Jolyon, &ldquo;care a fig for his
      opinion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; murmured James, &ldquo;you will have your own way&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a good opinion. Good-bye! We&rsquo;re going to drive down to Hurlingham.
      They tell me June&rsquo;s going to Wales. You&rsquo;ll be lonely tomorrow.
      What&rsquo;ll you do with yourself? You&rsquo;d better come and dine with
      us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon refused. He went down to the front door and saw them into their
      barouche, and twinkled at them, having already forgotten his spleen&mdash;Mrs.
      James facing the horses, tall and majestic with auburn hair; on her left,
      Irene&mdash;the two husbands, father and son, sitting forward, as though
      they expected something, opposite their wives. Bobbing and bounding upon
      the spring cushions, silent, swaying to each motion of their chariot, old
      Jolyon watched them drive away under the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the drive the silence was broken by Mrs. James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see such a collection of rumty-too people?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, glancing at her beneath his eyelids, nodded, and he saw Irene
      steal at him one of her unfathomable looks. It is likely enough that each
      branch of the Forsyte family made that remark as they drove away from old
      Jolyon&rsquo;s &lsquo;At Home!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the last of the departing guests the fourth and fifth brothers,
      Nicholas and Roger, walked away together, directing their steps alongside
      Hyde Park towards the Praed Street Station of the Underground. Like all
      other Forsytes of a certain age they kept carriages of their own, and
      never took cabs if by any means they could avoid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was bright, the trees of the Park in the full beauty of mid-June
      foliage; the brothers did not seem to notice phenomena, which contributed,
      nevertheless, to the jauntiness of promenade and conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Roger, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a good-lookin&rsquo;
      woman, that wife of Soames&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;m told they don&rsquo;t get
      on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This brother had a high forehead, and the freshest colour of any of the
      Forsytes; his light grey eyes measured the street frontage of the houses
      by the way, and now and then he would level his, umbrella and take a
      &lsquo;lunar,&rsquo; as he expressed it, of the varying heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;d no money,&rdquo; replied Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself had married a good deal of money, of which, it being then the
      golden age before the Married Women&rsquo;s Property Act, he had
      mercifully been enabled to make a successful use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was her father?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heron was his name, a Professor, so they tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no money in that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say her mother&rsquo;s father was cement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger&rsquo;s face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he went bankrupt,&rdquo; went on Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Roger, &ldquo;Soames will have trouble with
      her; you mark my words, he&rsquo;ll have trouble&mdash;she&rsquo;s got a
      foreign look.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas licked his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a pretty woman,&rdquo; and he waved aside a
      crossing-sweeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he get hold of her?&rdquo; asked Roger presently. &ldquo;She
      must cost him a pretty penny in dress!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann tells me,&rdquo; replied Nicholas, &ldquo;he was half-cracked
      about her. She refused him five times. James, he&rsquo;s nervous about it,
      I can see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Roger again; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for James; he
      had trouble with Dartie.&rdquo; His pleasant colour was heightened by
      exercise, he swung his umbrella to the level of his eye more frequently
      than ever. Nicholas&rsquo;s face also wore a pleasant look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too pale for me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but her figures capital!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call her distinguished-looking,&rdquo; he said at last&mdash;it
      was the highest praise in the Forsyte vocabulary. &ldquo;That young
      Bosinney will never do any good for himself. They say at Burkitt&rsquo;s
      he&rsquo;s one of these artistic chaps&mdash;got an idea of improving
      English architecture; there&rsquo;s no money in that! I should like to
      hear what Timothy would say to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What class are you going? I go second.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No second for me,&rdquo; said Nicholas;&mdash;&ldquo;you never know
      what you may catch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a first-class ticket to Notting Hill Gate; Roger a second to South
      Kensington. The train coming in a minute later, the two brothers parted
      and entered their respective compartments. Each felt aggrieved that the
      other had not modified his habits to secure his society a little longer;
      but as Roger voiced it in his thoughts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always a stubborn beggar, Nick!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Nicholas expressed it to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cantankerous chap Roger&mdash;always was!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little sentimentality about the Forsytes. In that great London,
      which they had conquered and become merged in, what time had they to be
      sentimental?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;OLD JOLYON GOES TO THE OPERA
    </h2>
    <p>
      At five o&rsquo;clock the following day old Jolyon sat alone, a cigar
      between his lips, and on a table by his side a cup of tea. He was tired,
      and before he had finished his cigar he fell asleep. A fly settled on his
      hair, his breathing sounded heavy in the drowsy silence, his upper lip
      under the white moustache puffed in and out. From between the fingers of
      his veined and wrinkled hand the cigar, dropping on the empty hearth,
      burned itself out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gloomy little study, with windows of stained glass to exclude the
      view, was full of dark green velvet and heavily-carved mahogany&mdash;a
      suite of which old Jolyon was wont to say: &lsquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder
      if it made a big price some day!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was pleasant to think that in the after life he could get more for
      things than he had given.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the rich brown atmosphere peculiar to back rooms in the mansion of a
      Forsyte, the Rembrandtesque effect of his great head, with its white hair,
      against the cushion of his high-backed seat, was spoiled by the moustache,
      which imparted a somewhat military look to his face. An old clock that had
      been with him since before his marriage forty years ago kept with its
      ticking a jealous record of the seconds slipping away forever from its old
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never cared for this room, hardly going into it from one year&rsquo;s
      end to another, except to take cigars from the Japanese cabinet in the
      corner, and the room now had its revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      His temples, curving like thatches over the hollows beneath, his
      cheek-bones and chin, all were sharpened in his sleep, and there had come
      upon his face the confession that he was an old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke. June had gone! James had said he would be lonely. James had
      always been a poor thing. He recollected with satisfaction that he had
      bought that house over James&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serve him right for sticking at the price; the only thing the fellow
      thought of was money. Had he given too much, though? It wanted a lot of
      doing to&mdash;He dared say he would want all his money before he had done
      with this affair of June&rsquo;s. He ought never to have allowed the
      engagement. She had met this Bosinney at the house of Baynes, Baynes and
      Bildeboy, the architects. He believed that Baynes, whom he knew&mdash;a
      bit of an old woman&mdash;was the young man&rsquo;s uncle by marriage.
      After that she&rsquo;d been always running after him; and when she took a
      thing into her head there was no stopping her. She was continually taking
      up with &lsquo;lame ducks&rsquo; of one sort or another. This fellow had
      no money, but she must needs become engaged to him&mdash;a harumscarum,
      unpractical chap, who would get himself into no end of difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come to him one day in her slap-dash way and told him; and, as if
      it were any consolation, she had added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so splendid; he&rsquo;s often lived on cocoa for a week!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he wants you to live on cocoa too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; he is getting into the swim now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon had taken his cigar from under his white moustaches, stained by
      coffee at the edge, and looked at her, that little slip of a thing who had
      got such a grip of his heart. He knew more about &lsquo;swims&rsquo; than
      his granddaughter. But she, having clasped her hands on his knees, rubbed
      her chin against him, making a sound like a purring cat. And, knocking the
      ash off his cigar, he had exploded in nervous desperation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all alike: you won&rsquo;t be satisfied till you&rsquo;ve
      got what you want. If you must come to grief, you must; I wash my hands of
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So, he had washed his hands of it, making the condition that they should
      not marry until Bosinney had at least four hundred a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be able to give you very much,&rdquo; he had said, a
      formula to which June was not unaccustomed. &ldquo;Perhaps this What&rsquo;s-his-name
      will provide the cocoa.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly seen anything of her since it began. A bad business! He had
      no notion of giving her a lot of money to enable a fellow he knew nothing
      about to live on in idleness. He had seen that sort of thing before; no
      good ever came of it. Worst of all, he had no hope of shaking her
      resolution; she was as obstinate as a mule, always had been from a child.
      He didn&rsquo;t see where it was to end. They must cut their coat
      according to their cloth. He would not give way till he saw young Bosinney
      with an income of his own. That June would have trouble with the fellow
      was as plain as a pikestaff; he had no more idea of money than a cow. As
      to this rushing down to Wales to visit the young man&rsquo;s aunts, he
      fully expected they were old cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, motionless, old Jolyon stared at the wall; but for his open eyes, he
      might have been asleep.... The idea of supposing that young cub Soames
      could give him advice! He had always been a cub, with his nose in the air!
      He would be setting up as a man of property next, with a place in the
      country! A man of property! H&rsquo;mph! Like his father, he was always
      nosing out bargains, a cold-blooded young beggar!
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and, going to the cabinet, began methodically stocking his
      cigar-case from a bundle fresh in. They were not bad at the price, but you
      couldn&rsquo;t get a good cigar, nowadays, nothing to hold a candle to
      those old Superfinos of Hanson and Bridger&rsquo;s. That was a cigar!
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought, like some stealing perfume, carried him back to those
      wonderful nights at Richmond when after dinner he sat smoking on the
      terrace of the Crown and Sceptre with Nicholas Treffry and Traquair and
      Jack Herring and Anthony Thornworthy. How good his cigars were then! Poor
      old Nick!&mdash;dead, and Jack Herring&mdash;dead, and Traquair&mdash;dead
      of that wife of his, and Thornworthy&mdash;awfully shaky (no wonder, with
      his appetite).
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the company of those days he himself alone seemed left, except
      Swithin, of course, and he so outrageously big there was no doing anything
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Difficult to believe it was so long ago; he felt young still! Of all his
      thoughts, as he stood there counting his cigars, this was the most
      poignant, the most bitter. With his white head and his loneliness he had
      remained young and green at heart. And those Sunday afternoons on
      Hampstead Heath, when young Jolyon and he went for a stretch along the
      Spaniard&rsquo;s Road to Highgate, to Child&rsquo;s Hill, and back over
      the Heath again to dine at Jack Straw&rsquo;s Castle&mdash;how delicious
      his cigars were then! And such weather! There was no weather now.
    </p>
    <p>
      When June was a toddler of five, and every other Sunday he took her to the
      Zoo, away from the society of those two good women, her mother and her
      grandmother, and at the top of the bear den baited his umbrella with buns
      for her favourite bears, how sweet his cigars were then!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cigars! He had not even succeeded in out-living his palate&mdash;the
      famous palate that in the fifties men swore by, and speaking of him, said:
      &ldquo;Forsyte&rsquo;s the best palate in London!&rdquo; The palate that
      in a sense had made his fortune&mdash;the fortune of the celebrated tea
      men, Forsyte and Treffry, whose tea, like no other man&rsquo;s tea, had a
      romantic aroma, the charm of a quite singular genuineness. About the house
      of Forsyte and Treffry in the City had clung an air of enterprise and
      mystery, of special dealings in special ships, at special ports, with
      special Orientals.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had worked at that business! Men did work in those days! these young
      pups hardly knew the meaning of the word. He had gone into every detail,
      known everything that went on, sometimes sat up all night over it. And he
      had always chosen his agents himself, prided himself on it. His eye for
      men, he used to say, had been the secret of his success, and the exercise
      of this masterful power of selection had been the only part of it all that
      he had really liked. Not a career for a man of his ability. Even now, when
      the business had been turned into a Limited Liability Company, and was
      declining (he had got out of his shares long ago), he felt a sharp chagrin
      in thinking of that time. How much better he might have done! He would
      have succeeded splendidly at the Bar! He had even thought of standing for
      Parliament. How often had not Nicholas Treffry said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could do anything, Jo, if you weren&rsquo;t so d-damned careful
      of yourself!&rdquo; Dear old Nick! Such a good fellow, but a racketty
      chap! The notorious Treffry! He had never taken any care of himself. So he
      was dead. Old Jolyon counted his cigars with a steady hand, and it came
      into his mind to wonder if perhaps he had been too careful of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the cigar-case in the breast of his coat, buttoned it in, and
      walked up the long flights to his bedroom, leaning on one foot and the
      other, and helping himself by the bannister. The house was too big. After
      June was married, if she ever did marry this fellow, as he supposed she
      would, he would let it and go into rooms. What was the use of keeping half
      a dozen servants eating their heads off?
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler came to the ring of his bell&mdash;a large man with a beard, a
      soft tread, and a peculiar capacity for silence. Old Jolyon told him to
      put his dress clothes out; he was going to dine at the Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long had the carriage been back from taking Miss June to the station?
      Since two? Then let him come round at half-past six!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Club which old Jolyon entered on the stroke of seven was one of those
      political institutions of the upper middle class which have seen better
      days. In spite of being talked about, perhaps in consequence of being
      talked about, it betrayed a disappointing vitality. People had grown tired
      of saying that the &lsquo;Disunion&rsquo; was on its last legs. Old Jolyon
      would say it, too, yet disregarded the fact in a manner truly irritating
      to well-constituted Clubmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you keep your name on?&rdquo; Swithin often asked him with
      profound vexation. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you join the &lsquo;Polyglot&rsquo;.
      You can&rsquo;t get a wine like our Heidsieck under twenty shillin&rsquo;
      a bottle anywhere in London;&rdquo; and, dropping his voice, he added:
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only five hundred dozen left. I drink it every night
      of my life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think of it,&rdquo; old Jolyon would answer; but when he
      did think of it there was always the question of fifty guineas entrance
      fee, and it would take him four or five years to get in. He continued to
      think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too old to be a Liberal, had long ceased to believe in the
      political doctrines of his Club, had even been known to allude to them as
      &lsquo;wretched stuff,&rsquo; and it afforded him pleasure to continue a
      member in the teeth of principles so opposed to his own. He had always had
      a contempt for the place, having joined it many years ago when they
      refused to have him at the &lsquo;Hotch Potch&rsquo; owing to his being
      &lsquo;in trade.&rsquo; As if he were not as good as any of them! He
      naturally despised the Club that did take him. The members were a poor
      lot, many of them in the City&mdash;stockbrokers, solicitors, auctioneers&mdash;what
      not! Like most men of strong character but not too much originality, old
      Jolyon set small store by the class to which he belonged. Faithfully he
      followed their customs, social and otherwise, and secretly he thought them
      &lsquo;a common lot.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Years and philosophy, of which he had his share, had dimmed the
      recollection of his defeat at the &lsquo;Hotch Potch&rsquo;. and now in
      his thoughts it was enshrined as the Queen of Clubs. He would have been a
      member all these years himself, but, owing to the slipshod way his
      proposer, Jack Herring, had gone to work, they had not known what they
      were doing in keeping him out. Why! they had taken his son Jo at once, and
      he believed the boy was still a member; he had received a letter dated
      from there eight years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been near the &lsquo;Disunion&rsquo; for months, and the house
      had undergone the piebald decoration which people bestow on old houses and
      old ships when anxious to sell them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beastly colour, the smoking-room!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;The
      dining-room is good!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Its gloomy chocolate, picked out with light green, took his fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ordered dinner, and sat down in the very corner, at the very table
      perhaps! (things did not progress much at the &lsquo;Disunion,&rsquo; a
      Club of almost Radical principles) at which he and young Jolyon used to
      sit twenty-five years ago, when he was taking the latter to Drury Lane,
      during his holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy had loved the theatre, and old Jolyon recalled how he used to sit
      opposite, concealing his excitement under a careful but transparent
      nonchalance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ordered himself, too, the very dinner the boy had always chosen-soup,
      whitebait, cutlets, and a tart. Ah! if he were only opposite now!
    </p>
    <p>
      The two had not met for fourteen years. And not for the first time during
      those fourteen years old Jolyon wondered whether he had been a little to
      blame in the matter of his son. An unfortunate love-affair with that
      precious flirt Danae Thornworthy (now Danae Pellew), Anthony Thornworthy&rsquo;s
      daughter, had thrown him on the rebound into the arms of June&rsquo;s
      mother. He ought perhaps to have put a spoke in the wheel of their
      marriage; they were too young; but after that experience of Jo&rsquo;s
      susceptibility he had been only too anxious to see him married. And in
      four years the crash had come! To have approved his son&rsquo;s conduct in
      that crash was, of course, impossible; reason and training&mdash;that
      combination of potent factors which stood for his principles&mdash;told
      him of this impossibility, and his heart cried out. The grim
      remorselessness of that business had no pity for hearts. There was June,
      the atom with flaming hair, who had climbed all over him, twined and
      twisted herself about him&mdash;about his heart that was made to be the
      plaything and beloved resort of tiny, helpless things. With characteristic
      insight he saw he must part with one or with the other; no half-measures
      could serve in such a situation. In that lay its tragedy. And the tiny,
      helpless thing prevailed. He would not run with the hare and hunt with the
      hounds, and so to his son he said good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      That good-bye had lasted until now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had proposed to continue a reduced allowance to young Jolyon, but this
      had been refused, and perhaps that refusal had hurt him more than
      anything, for with it had gone the last outlet of his penned-in affection;
      and there had come such tangible and solid proof of rupture as only a
      transaction in property, a bestowal or refusal of such, could supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dinner tasted flat. His pint of champagne was dry and bitter stuff,
      not like the Veuve Clicquots of old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over his cup of coffee, he bethought him that he would go to the opera. In
      the Times, therefore&mdash;he had a distrust of other papers&mdash;he read
      the announcement for the evening. It was &lsquo;Fidelio.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mercifully not one of those new-fangled German pantomimes by that fellow
      Wagner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting on his ancient opera hat, which, with its brim flattened by use,
      and huge capacity, looked like an emblem of greater days, and, pulling out
      an old pair of very thin lavender kid gloves smelling strongly of Russia
      leather, from habitual proximity to the cigar-case in the pocket of his
      overcoat, he stepped into a hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab rattled gaily along the streets, and old Jolyon was struck by
      their unwonted animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The hotels must be doing a tremendous business,&rsquo; he thought.
      A few years ago there had been none of these big hotels. He made a
      satisfactory reflection on some property he had in the neighbourhood. It
      must be going up in value by leaps and bounds! What traffic!
    </p>
    <p>
      But from that he began indulging in one of those strange impersonal
      speculations, so uncharacteristic of a Forsyte, wherein lay, in part, the
      secret of his supremacy amongst them. What atoms men were, and what a lot
      of them! And what would become of them all?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stumbled as he got out of the cab, gave the man his exact fare, walked
      up to the ticket office to take his stall, and stood there with his purse
      in his hand&mdash;he always carried his money in a purse, never having
      approved of that habit of carrying it loosely in the pockets, as so many
      young men did nowadays. The official leaned out, like an old dog from a
      kennel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said in a surprised voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Mr.
      Jolyon Forsyte! So it is! Haven&rsquo;t seen you, sir, for years. Dear me!
      Times aren&rsquo;t what they were. Why! you and your brother, and that
      auctioneer&mdash;Mr. Traquair, and Mr. Nicholas Treffry&mdash;you used to
      have six or seven stalls here regular every season. And how are you, sir?
      We don&rsquo;t get younger!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour in old Jolyon&rsquo;s eyes deepened; he paid his guinea. They
      had not forgotten him. He marched in, to the sounds of the overture, like
      an old war-horse to battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Folding his opera hat, he sat down, drew out his lavender gloves in the
      old way, and took up his glasses for a long look round the house. Dropping
      them at last on his folded hat, he fixed his eyes on the curtain. More
      poignantly than ever he felt that it was all over and done with him. Where
      were all the women, the pretty women, the house used to be so full of?
      Where was that old feeling in the heart as he waited for one of those
      great singers? Where that sensation of the intoxication of life and of his
      own power to enjoy it all?
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest opera-goer of his day! There was no opera now! That fellow
      Wagner had ruined everything; no melody left, nor any voices to sing it.
      Ah! the wonderful singers! Gone! He sat watching the old scenes acted, a
      numb feeling at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the curl of silver over his ear to the pose of his foot in its
      elastic-sided patent boot, there was nothing clumsy or weak about old
      Jolyon. He was as upright&mdash;very nearly&mdash;as in those old times
      when he came every night; his sight was as good&mdash;almost as good. But
      what a feeling of weariness and disillusion!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been in the habit all his life of enjoying things, even imperfect
      things&mdash;and there had been many imperfect things&mdash;he had enjoyed
      them all with moderation, so as to keep himself young. But now he was
      deserted by his power of enjoyment, by his philosophy, and left with this
      dreadful feeling that it was all done with. Not even the Prisoners&rsquo;
      Chorus, nor Florian&rsquo;s Song, had the power to dispel the gloom of his
      loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Jo were only with him! The boy must be forty by now. He had wasted
      fourteen years out of the life of his only son. And Jo was no longer a
      social pariah. He was married. Old Jolyon had been unable to refrain from
      marking his appreciation of the action by enclosing his son a cheque for
      L500. The cheque had been returned in a letter from the &lsquo;Hotch
      Potch,&rsquo; couched in these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MY DEAREST FATHER,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your generous gift was welcome as a sign that you might think worse
      of me. I return it, but should you think fit to invest it for the benefit
      of the little chap (we call him Jolly), who bears our Christian and, by
      courtesy, our surname, I shall be very glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope with all my heart that your health is as good as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your loving son,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jo.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was like the boy. He had always been an amiable chap. Old
      Jolyon had sent this reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;MY DEAR JO,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The sum (L500) stands in my books for the benefit of your boy,
      under the name of Jolyon Forsyte, and will be duly-credited with interest
      at 5 per cent. I hope that you are doing well. My health remains good at
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With love, I am,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your affectionate Father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;JOLYON FORSYTE.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And every year on the 1st of January he had added a hundred and the
      interest. The sum was mounting up&mdash;next New Year&rsquo;s Day it would
      be fifteen hundred and odd pounds! And it is difficult to say how much
      satisfaction he had got out of that yearly transaction. But the
      correspondence had ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his love for his son, in spite of an instinct, partly
      constitutional, partly the result, as in thousands of his class, of the
      continual handling and watching of affairs, prompting him to judge conduct
      by results rather than by principle, there was at the bottom of his heart
      a sort of uneasiness. His son ought, under the circumstances, to have gone
      to the dogs; that law was laid down in all the novels, sermons, and plays
      he had ever read, heard, or witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After receiving the cheque back there seemed to him to be something wrong
      somewhere. Why had his son not gone to the dogs? But, then, who could
      tell?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard, of course&mdash;in fact, he had made it his business to find
      out&mdash;that Jo lived in St. John&rsquo;s Wood, that he had a little
      house in Wistaria Avenue with a garden, and took his wife about with him
      into society&mdash;a queer sort of society, no doubt&mdash;and that they
      had two children&mdash;the little chap they called Jolly (considering the
      circumstances the name struck him as cynical, and old Jolyon both feared
      and disliked cynicism), and a girl called Holly, born since the marriage.
      Who could tell what his son&rsquo;s circumstances really were? He had
      capitalized the income he had inherited from his mother&rsquo;s father and
      joined Lloyd&rsquo;s as an underwriter; he painted pictures, too&mdash;water-colours.
      Old Jolyon knew this, for he had surreptitiously bought them from time to
      time, after chancing to see his son&rsquo;s name signed at the bottom of a
      representation of the river Thames in a dealer&rsquo;s window. He thought
      them bad, and did not hang them because of the signature; he kept them
      locked up in a drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great opera-house a terrible yearning came on him to see his son.
      He remembered the days when he had been wont to slide him, in a brown
      holland suit, to and fro under the arch of his legs; the times when he ran
      beside the boy&rsquo;s pony, teaching him to ride; the day he first took
      him to school. He had been a loving, lovable little chap! After he went to
      Eton he had acquired, perhaps, a little too much of that desirable manner
      which old Jolyon knew was only to be obtained at such places and at great
      expense; but he had always been companionable. Always a companion, even
      after Cambridge&mdash;a little far off, perhaps, owing to the advantages
      he had received. Old Jolyon&rsquo;s feeling towards our public schools and
      &lsquo;Varsities never wavered, and he retained touchingly his attitude of
      admiration and mistrust towards a system appropriate to the highest in the
      land, of which he had not himself been privileged to partake.... Now that
      June had gone and left, or as good as left him, it would have been a
      comfort to see his son again. Guilty of this treason to his family, his
      principles, his class, old Jolyon fixed his eyes on the singer. A poor
      thing&mdash;a wretched poor thing! And the Florian a perfect stick!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over. They were easily pleased nowadays!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the crowded street he snapped up a cab under the very nose of a stout
      and much younger gentleman, who had already assumed it to be his own. His
      route lay through Pall Mall, and at the corner, instead of going through
      the Green Park, the cabman turned to drive up St. James&rsquo;s Street.
      Old Jolyon put his hand through the trap (he could not bear being taken
      out of his way); in turning, however, he found himself opposite the
      &lsquo;Hotch Potch,&rsquo; and the yearning that had been secretly with
      him the whole evening prevailed. He called to the driver to stop. He would
      go in and ask if Jo still belonged there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in. The hall looked exactly as it did when he used to dine there
      with Jack Herring, and they had the best cook in London; and he looked
      round with the shrewd, straight glance that had caused him all his life to
      be better served than most men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jolyon Forsyte still a member here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; in the Club now, sir. What name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon was taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And having spoken, he took his stand, back to the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon, on the point of leaving the Club, had put on his hat, and
      was in the act of crossing the hall, as the porter met him. He was no
      longer young, with hair going grey, and face&mdash;a narrower replica of
      his father&rsquo;s, with the same large drooping moustache&mdash;decidedly
      worn. He turned pale. This meeting was terrible after all those years, for
      nothing in the world was so terrible as a scene. They met and crossed
      hands without a word. Then, with a quaver in his voice, the father said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, my boy?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The son answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Dad?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon&rsquo;s hand trembled in its thin lavender glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going my way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can give you
      a lift.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And as though in the habit of taking each other home every night they went
      out and stepped into the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      To old Jolyon it seemed that his son had grown. &lsquo;More of a man
      altogether,&rsquo; was his comment. Over the natural amiability of that
      son&rsquo;s face had come a rather sardonic mask, as though he had found
      in the circumstances of his life the necessity for armour. The features
      were certainly those of a Forsyte, but the expression was more the
      introspective look of a student or philosopher. He had no doubt been
      obliged to look into himself a good deal in the course of those fifteen
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      To young Jolyon the first sight of his father was undoubtedly a shock&mdash;he
      looked so worn and old. But in the cab he seemed hardly to have changed,
      still having the calm look so well remembered, still being upright and
      keen-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look well, Dad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Middling,&rdquo; old Jolyon answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the prey of an anxiety that he found he must put into words. Having
      got his son back like this, he felt he must know what was his financial
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should like to hear what sort of water
      you&rsquo;re in. I suppose you&rsquo;re in debt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put it this way that his son might find it easier to confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon answered in his ironical voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I&rsquo;m not in debt!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon saw that he was angry, and touched his hand. He had run a risk.
      It was worth it, however, and Jo had never been sulky with him. They drove
      on, without speaking again, to Stanhope Gate. Old Jolyon invited him in,
      but young Jolyon shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;June&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; said his father hastily: &ldquo;went
      of to-day on a visit. I suppose you know that she&rsquo;s engaged to be
      married?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Already?&rdquo; murmured young Jolyon&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon stepped out, and, in paying the cab fare, for the first time in
      his life gave the driver a sovereign in mistake for a shilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing the coin in his mouth, the cabman whipped his horse secretly on
      the underneath and hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon turned the key softly in the lock, pushed open the door, and
      beckoned. His son saw him gravely hanging up his coat, with an expression
      on his face like that of a boy who intends to steal cherries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the dining-room was open, the gas turned low; a spirit-urn
      hissed on a tea-tray, and close to it a cynical looking cat had fallen
      asleep on the dining-table. Old Jolyon &lsquo;shoo&rsquo;d&rsquo; her off
      at once. The incident was a relief to his feelings; he rattled his opera
      hat behind the animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got fleas,&rdquo; he said, following her out of the
      room. Through the door in the hall leading to the basement he called
      &ldquo;Hssst!&rdquo; several times, as though assisting the cat&rsquo;s
      departure, till by some strange coincidence the butler appeared below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go to bed, Parfitt,&rdquo; said old Jolyon. &ldquo;I will
      lock up and put out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he again entered the dining-room the cat unfortunately preceded him,
      with her tail in the air, proclaiming that she had seen through this
      manouevre for suppressing the butler from the first....
    </p>
    <p>
      A fatality had dogged old Jolyon&rsquo;s domestic stratagems all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon could not help smiling. He was very well versed in irony, and
      everything that evening seemed to him ironical. The episode of the cat;
      the announcement of his own daughter&rsquo;s engagement. So he had no more
      part or parcel in her than he had in the Puss! And the poetical justice of
      this appealed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is June like now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a little thing,&rdquo; returned old Jolyon; &ldquo;they
      say she&rsquo;s like me, but that&rsquo;s their folly. She&rsquo;s more
      like your mother&mdash;the same eyes and hair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! and she is pretty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon was too much of a Forsyte to praise anything freely; especially
      anything for which he had a genuine admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad looking&mdash;a regular Forsyte chin. It&rsquo;ll be lonely
      here when she&rsquo;s gone, Jo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The look on his face again gave young Jolyon the shock he had felt on
      first seeing his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do with yourself, Dad? I suppose she&rsquo;s wrapped
      up in him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do with myself?&rdquo; repeated old Jolyon with an angry break in
      his voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be miserable work living here alone. I don&rsquo;t
      know how it&rsquo;s to end. I wish to goodness....&rdquo; He checked
      himself, and added: &ldquo;The question is, what had I better do with this
      house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon looked round the room. It was peculiarly vast and dreary,
      decorated with the enormous pictures of still life that he remembered as a
      boy&mdash;sleeping dogs with their noses resting on bunches of carrots,
      together with onions and grapes lying side by side in mild surprise. The
      house was a white elephant, but he could not conceive of his father living
      in a smaller place; and all the more did it all seem ironical.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his great chair with the book-rest sat old Jolyon, the figurehead of
      his family and class and creed, with his white head and dome-like
      forehead, the representative of moderation, and order, and love of
      property. As lonely an old man as there was in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he sat in the gloomy comfort of the room, a puppet in the power of
      great forces that cared nothing for family or class or creed, but moved,
      machine-like, with dread processes to inscrutable ends. This was how it
      struck young Jolyon, who had the impersonal eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor old Dad! So this was the end, the purpose to which he had lived
      with such magnificent moderation! To be lonely, and grow older and older,
      yearning for a soul to speak to!
    </p>
    <p>
      In his turn old Jolyon looked back at his son. He wanted to talk about
      many things that he had been unable to talk about all these years. It had
      been impossible to seriously confide in June his conviction that property
      in the Soho quarter would go up in value; his uneasiness about that
      tremendous silence of Pippin, the superintendent of the New Colliery
      Company, of which he had so long been chairman; his disgust at the steady
      fall in American Golgothas, or even to discuss how, by some sort of
      settlement, he could best avoid the payment of those death duties which
      would follow his decease. Under the influence, however, of a cup of tea,
      which he seemed to stir indefinitely, he began to speak at last. A new
      vista of life was thus opened up, a promised land of talk, where he could
      find a harbour against the waves of anticipation and regret; where he
      could soothe his soul with the opium of devising how to round off his
      property and make eternal the only part of him that was to remain alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon was a good listener; it was his great quality. He kept his
      eyes fixed on his father&rsquo;s face, putting a question now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck one before old Jolyon had finished, and at the sound of
      its striking his principles came back. He took out his watch with a look
      of surprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go to bed, Jo,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon rose and held out his hand to help his father up. The old
      face looked worn and hollow again; the eyes were steadily averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my boy; take care of yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment passed, and young Jolyon, turning on his, heel, marched out at
      the door. He could hardly see; his smile quavered. Never in all the
      fifteen years since he had first found out that life was no simple
      business, had he found it so singularly complicated.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;DINNER AT SWITHIN&rsquo;S
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Swithin&rsquo;s orange and light-blue dining-room, facing the Park, the
      round table was laid for twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cut-glass chandelier filled with lighted candles hung like a giant
      stalactite above its centre, radiating over large gilt-framed mirrors,
      slabs of marble on the tops of side-tables, and heavy gold chairs with
      crewel worked seats. Everything betokened that love of beauty so deeply
      implanted in each family which has had its own way to make into Society,
      out of the more vulgar heart of Nature. Swithin had indeed an impatience
      of simplicity, a love of ormolu, which had always stamped him amongst his
      associates as a man of great, if somewhat luxurious taste; and out of the
      knowledge that no one could possibly enter his rooms without perceiving
      him to be a man of wealth, he had derived a solid and prolonged happiness
      such as perhaps no other circumstance in life had afforded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since his retirement from land agency, a profession deplorable in his
      estimation, especially as to its auctioneering department, he had
      abandoned himself to naturally aristocratic tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfect luxury of his latter days had embedded him like a fly in
      sugar; and his mind, where very little took place from morning till night,
      was the junction of two curiously opposite emotions, a lingering and
      sturdy satisfaction that he had made his own way and his own fortune, and
      a sense that a man of his distinction should never have been allowed to
      soil his mind with work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the sideboard in a white waistcoat with large gold and onyx
      buttons, watching his valet screw the necks of three champagne bottles
      deeper into ice-pails. Between the points of his stand-up collar, which&mdash;though
      it hurt him to move&mdash;he would on no account have had altered, the
      pale flesh of his under chin remained immovable. His eyes roved from
      bottle to bottle. He was debating, and he argued like this: Jolyon drinks
      a glass, perhaps two, he&rsquo;s so careful of himself. James, he can&rsquo;t
      take his wine nowadays. Nicholas&mdash;Fanny and he would swill water he
      shouldn&rsquo;t wonder! Soames didn&rsquo;t count; these young nephews&mdash;Soames
      was thirty-one&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t drink! But Bosinney?
    </p>
    <p>
      Encountering in the name of this stranger something outside the range of
      his philosophy, Swithin paused. A misgiving arose within him! It was
      impossible to tell! June was only a girl, in love too! Emily (Mrs. James)
      liked a good glass of champagne. It was too dry for Juley, poor old soul,
      she had no palate. As to Hatty Chessman! The thought of this old friend
      caused a cloud of thought to obscure the perfect glassiness of his eyes:
      He shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she drank half a bottle!
    </p>
    <p>
      But in thinking of his remaining guest, an expression like that of a cat
      who is just going to purr stole over his old face: Mrs. Soames! She mightn&rsquo;t
      take much, but she would appreciate what she drank; it was a pleasure to
      give her good wine! A pretty woman&mdash;and sympathetic to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of her was like champagne itself! A pleasure to give a good
      wine to a young woman who looked so well, who knew how to dress, with
      charming manners, quite distinguished&mdash;a pleasure to entertain her.
      Between the points of his collar he gave his head the first small, painful
      oscillation of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adolf!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Put in another bottle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself might drink a good deal, for, thanks to that prescription of
      Blight&rsquo;s, he found himself extremely well, and he had been careful
      to take no lunch. He had not felt so well for weeks. Puffing out his lower
      lip, he gave his last instructions:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adolf, the least touch of the West India when you come to the ham.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing into the anteroom, he sat down on the edge of a chair, with his
      knees apart; and his tall, bulky form was wrapped at once in an expectant,
      strange, primeval immobility. He was ready to rise at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice. He had not given a dinner-party for months. This dinner in honour
      of June&rsquo;s engagement had seemed a bore at first (among Forsytes the
      custom of solemnizing engagements by feasts was religiously observed), but
      the labours of sending invitations and ordering the repast over, he felt
      pleasantly stimulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus sitting, a watch in his hand, fat, and smooth, and golden, like a
      flattened globe of butter, he thought of nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long man, with side whiskers, who had once been in Swithin&rsquo;s
      service, but was now a greengrocer, entered and proclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Chessman, Mrs. Septimus Small!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two ladies advanced. The one in front, habited entirely in red, had large,
      settled patches of the same colour in her cheeks, and a hard, dashing eye.
      She walked at Swithin, holding out a hand cased in a long,
      primrose-coloured glove:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Swithin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for
      ages. How are you? Why, my dear boy, how stout you&rsquo;re getting!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fixity of Swithin&rsquo;s eye alone betrayed emotion. A dumb and
      grumbling anger swelled his bosom. It was vulgar to be stout, to talk of
      being stout; he had a chest, nothing more. Turning to his sister, he
      grasped her hand, and said in a tone of command:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Juley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Septimus Small was the tallest of the four sisters; her good, round
      old face had gone a little sour; an innumerable pout clung all over it, as
      if it had been encased in an iron wire mask up to that evening, which,
      being suddenly removed, left little rolls of mutinous flesh all over her
      countenance. Even her eyes were pouting. It was thus that she recorded her
      permanent resentment at the loss of Septimus Small.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had quite a reputation for saying the wrong thing, and, tenacious like
      all her breed, she would hold to it when she had said it, and add to it
      another wrong thing, and so on. With the decease of her husband the family
      tenacity, the family matter-of-factness, had gone sterile within her. A
      great talker, when allowed, she would converse without the faintest
      animation for hours together, relating, with epic monotony, the
      innumerable occasions on which Fortune had misused her; nor did she ever
      perceive that her hearers sympathized with Fortune, for her heart was
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having sat, poor soul, long by the bedside of Small (a man of poor
      constitution), she had acquired, the habit, and there were countless
      subsequent occasions when she had sat immense periods of time to amuse
      sick people, children, and other helpless persons, and she could never
      divest herself of the feeling that the world was the most ungrateful place
      anybody could live in. Sunday after Sunday she sat at the feet of that
      extremely witty preacher, the Rev. Thomas Scoles, who exercised a great
      influence over her; but she succeeded in convincing everybody that even
      this was a misfortune. She had passed into a proverb in the family, and
      when anybody was observed to be peculiarly distressing, he was known as a
      regular &lsquo;Juley.&rsquo; The habit of her mind would have killed
      anybody but a Forsyte at forty; but she was seventy-two, and had never
      looked better. And one felt that there were capacities for enjoyment about
      her which might yet come out. She owned three canaries, the cat Tommy, and
      half a parrot&mdash;in common with her sister Hester;&mdash;and these poor
      creatures (kept carefully out of Timothy&rsquo;s way&mdash;he was nervous
      about animals), unlike human beings, recognising that she could not help
      being blighted, attached themselves to her passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sombrely magnificent this evening in black bombazine, with a mauve
      front cut in a shy triangle, and crowned with a black velvet ribbon round
      the base of her thin throat; black and mauve for evening wear was esteemed
      very chaste by nearly every Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pouting at Swithin, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann has been asking for you. You haven&rsquo;t been near us for an
      age!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin put his thumbs within the armholes of his waistcoat, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ann&rsquo;s getting very shaky; she ought to have a doctor!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Forsyte!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicholas Forsyte, cocking his rectangular eyebrows, wore a smile. He had
      succeeded during the day in bringing to fruition a scheme for the
      employment of a tribe from Upper India in the gold-mines of Ceylon. A pet
      plan, carried at last in the teeth of great difficulties&mdash;he was
      justly pleased. It would double the output of his mines, and, as he had
      often forcibly argued, all experience tended to show that a man must die;
      and whether he died of a miserable old age in his own country, or
      prematurely of damp in the bottom of a foreign mine, was surely of little
      consequence, provided that by a change in his mode of life he benefited
      the British Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      His ability was undoubted. Raising his broken nose towards his listener,
      he would add:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For want of a few hundred of these fellows we haven&rsquo;t paid a
      dividend for years, and look at the price of the shares. I can&rsquo;t get
      ten shillings for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been at Yarmouth, too, and had come back feeling that he had added
      at least ten years to his own life. He grasped Swithin&rsquo;s hand,
      exclaiming in a jocular voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so here we are again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Nicholas, an effete woman, smiled a smile of frightened jollity
      behind his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. James Forsyte! Mr. and Mrs. Soames Forsyte!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin drew his heels together, his deportment ever admirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, James, well Emily! How are you, Soames? How do you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand enclosed Irene&rsquo;s, and his eyes swelled. She was a pretty
      woman&mdash;a little too pale, but her figure, her eyes, her teeth! Too
      good for that chap Soames!
    </p>
    <p>
      The gods had given Irene dark brown eyes and golden hair, that strange
      combination, provocative of men&rsquo;s glances, which is said to be the
      mark of a weak character. And the full, soft pallor of her neck and
      shoulders, above a gold-coloured frock, gave to her personality an
      alluring strangeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stood behind, his eyes fastened on his wife&rsquo;s neck. The hands
      of Swithin&rsquo;s watch, which he still held open in his hand, had left
      eight behind; it was half an hour beyond his dinner-time&mdash;he had had
      no lunch&mdash;and a strange primeval impatience surged up within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like Jolyon to be late!&rdquo; he said to Irene,
      with uncontrollable vexation. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;ll be June keeping
      him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People in love are always late,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin stared at her; a dusky orange dyed his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve no business to be. Some fashionable nonsense!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And behind this outburst the inarticulate violence of primitive
      generations seemed to mutter and grumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you think of my new star, Uncle Swithin,&rdquo; said
      Irene softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the lace in the bosom of her dress was shining a five-pointed star,
      made of eleven diamonds. Swithin looked at the star. He had a pretty taste
      in stones; no question could have been more sympathetically devised to
      distract his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who gave you that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no change in her face, but Swithin&rsquo;s pale eyes bulged as
      though he might suddenly have been afflicted with insight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;re dull at home,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Any
      day you like to come and dine with me, I&rsquo;ll give you as good a
      bottle of wine as you&rsquo;ll get in London.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss June Forsyte&mdash;Mr. Jolyon Forsyte!... Mr. Boswainey!...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin moved his arm, and said in a rumbling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner, now&mdash;dinner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took in Irene, on the ground that he had not entertained her since she
      was a bride. June was the portion of Bosinney, who was placed between
      Irene and his fiancee. On the other side of June was James with Mrs.
      Nicholas, then old Jolyon with Mrs. James, Nicholas with Hatty Chessman,
      Soames with Mrs. Small, completing, the circle to Swithin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Family dinners of the Forsytes observe certain traditions. There are, for
      instance, no hors d&rsquo;oeuvre. The reason for this is unknown. Theory
      among the younger members traces it to the disgraceful price of oysters;
      it is more probably due to a desire to come to the point, to a good
      practical sense deciding at once that hors d&rsquo;oeuvre are but poor
      things. The Jameses alone, unable to withstand a custom almost universal
      in Park Lane, are now and then unfaithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silent, almost morose, inattention to each other succeeds to the
      subsidence into their seats, lasting till well into the first entree, but
      interspersed with remarks such as, &ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s bad again; I can&rsquo;t
      tell what&rsquo;s the matter with him!&rdquo; &ldquo;I suppose Ann doesn&rsquo;t
      come down in the mornings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of
      your doctor, Fanny?&rdquo; &ldquo;Stubbs?&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a
      quack!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Winifred? She&rsquo;s got too many children.
      Four, isn&rsquo;t it? She&rsquo;s as thin as a lath!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;What
      d&rsquo;you give for this sherry, Swithin? Too dry for me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the second glass of champagne, a kind of hum makes itself heard,
      which, when divested of casual accessories and resolved into its primal
      element, is found to be James telling a story, and this goes on for a long
      time, encroaching sometimes even upon what must universally be recognised
      as the crowning point of a Forsyte feast&mdash;&rsquo;the saddle of
      mutton.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No Forsyte has given a dinner without providing a saddle of mutton. There
      is something in its succulent solidity which makes it suitable to people
      &lsquo;of a certain position.&rsquo; It is nourishing and tasty; the sort
      of thing a man remembers eating. It has a past and a future, like a
      deposit paid into a bank; and it is something that can be argued about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each branch of the family tenaciously held to a particular locality&mdash;old
      Jolyon swearing by Dartmoor, James by Welsh, Swithin by Southdown,
      Nicholas maintaining that people might sneer, but there was nothing like
      New Zealand! As for Roger, the &lsquo;original&rsquo; of the brothers, he
      had been obliged to invent a locality of his own, and with an ingenuity
      worthy of a man who had devised a new profession for his sons, he had
      discovered a shop where they sold German; on being remonstrated with, he
      had proved his point by producing a butcher&rsquo;s bill, which showed
      that he paid more than any of the others. It was on this occasion that old
      Jolyon, turning to June, had said in one of his bursts of philosophy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon it, they&rsquo;re a cranky lot, the Forsytes&mdash;and
      you&rsquo;ll find it out, as you grow older!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy alone held apart, for though he ate saddle of mutton heartily, he
      was, he said, afraid of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To anyone interested psychologically in Forsytes, this great
      saddle-of-mutton trait is of prime importance; not only does it illustrate
      their tenacity, both collectively and as individuals, but it marks them as
      belonging in fibre and instincts to that great class which believes in
      nourishment and flavour, and yields to no sentimental craving for beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Younger members of the family indeed would have done without a joint
      altogether, preferring guinea-fowl, or lobster salad&mdash;something which
      appealed to the imagination, and had less nourishment&mdash;but these were
      females; or, if not, had been corrupted by their wives, or by mothers, who
      having been forced to eat saddle of mutton throughout their married lives,
      had passed a secret hostility towards it into the fibre of their sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great saddle-of-mutton controversy at an end, a Tewkesbury ham
      commenced, together with the least touch of West Indian&mdash;Swithin was
      so long over this course that he caused a block in the progress of the
      dinner. To devote himself to it with better heart, he paused in his
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his seat by Mrs. Septimus Small Soames was watching. He had a reason
      of his own connected with a pet building scheme, for observing Bosinney.
      The architect might do for his purpose; he looked clever, as he sat
      leaning back in his chair, moodily making little ramparts with
      bread-crumbs. Soames noted his dress clothes to be well cut, but too
      small, as though made many years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw him turn to Irene and say something and her face sparkle as he
      often saw it sparkle at other people&mdash;never at himself. He tried to
      catch what they were saying, but Aunt Juley was speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadn&rsquo;t that always seemed very extraordinary to Soames? Only last
      Sunday dear Mr. Scole, had been so witty in his sermon, so sarcastic,
      &ldquo;For what,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;shall it profit a man if he
      gain his own soul, but lose all his property?&rdquo; That, he had said,
      was the motto of the middle-class; now, what had he meant by that? Of
      course, it might be what middle-class people believed&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t
      know; what did Soames think?
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered abstractedly: &ldquo;How should I know? Scoles is a humbug,
      though, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; For Bosinney was looking round the table,
      as if pointing out the peculiarities of the guests, and Soames wondered
      what he was saying. By her smile Irene was evidently agreeing with his
      remarks. She seemed always to agree with other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were turned on himself; Soames dropped his glance at once. The
      smile had died off her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      A humbug? But what did Soames mean? If Mr. Scoles was a humbug, a
      clergyman&mdash;then anybody might be&mdash;it was frightful!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and so they are!&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Aunt Juley&rsquo;s momentary and horrified silence he caught some
      words of Irene&rsquo;s that sounded like: &lsquo;Abandon hope, all ye who
      enter here!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Swithin had finished his ham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you go for your mushrooms?&rdquo; he was saying to Irene
      in a voice like a courtier&rsquo;s; &ldquo;you ought to go to Smileybob&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
      give &lsquo;em you fresh. These little men, they won&rsquo;t take the
      trouble!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene turned to answer him, and Soames saw Bosinney watching her and
      smiling to himself. A curious smile the fellow had. A half-simple
      arrangement, like a child who smiles when he is pleased. As for George&rsquo;s
      nickname&mdash;&rsquo;The Buccaneer&rsquo;&mdash;he did not think much of
      that. And, seeing Bosinney turn to June, Soames smiled too, but
      sardonically&mdash;he did not like June, who was not looking too pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not surprising, for she had just held the following conversation
      with James:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I stayed on the river on my way home, Uncle James, and saw a
      beautiful site for a house.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James, a slow and thorough eater, stopped the process of mastication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now, where was that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close to Pangbourne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James placed a piece of ham in his mouth, and June waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t know whether the land about there was
      freehold?&rdquo; he asked at last. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know anything
      about the price of land about there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said June; &ldquo;I made inquiries.&rdquo; Her little
      resolute face under its copper crown was suspiciously eager and aglow.
    </p>
    <p>
      James regarded her with the air of an inquisitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? You&rsquo;re not thinking of buying land!&rdquo; he
      ejaculated, dropping his fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      June was greatly encouraged by his interest. It had long been her pet plan
      that her uncles should benefit themselves and Bosinney by building
      country-houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought it would be such a
      splendid place for&mdash;you or&mdash;someone to build a country-house!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James looked at her sideways, and placed a second piece of ham in his
      mouth....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land ought to be very dear about there,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      What June had taken for personal interest was only the impersonal
      excitement of every Forsyte who hears of something eligible in danger of
      passing into other hands. But she refused to see the disappearance of her
      chance, and continued to press her point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to go into the country, Uncle James. I wish I had a lot
      of money, I wouldn&rsquo;t live another day in London.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James was stirred to the depths of his long thin figure; he had no idea
      his niece held such downright views.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go into the country?&rdquo; repeated June;
      &ldquo;it would do you a lot of good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; began James in a fluster. &ldquo;Buying land&mdash;what
      good d&rsquo;you suppose I can do buying land, building houses?&mdash;I
      couldn&rsquo;t get four per cent. for my money!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that matter? You&rsquo;d get fresh air.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fresh air!&rdquo; exclaimed James; &ldquo;what should I do with
      fresh air,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought anybody liked to have fresh air,&rdquo; said
      June scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      James wiped his napkin all over his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know the value of money,&rdquo; he said, avoiding
      her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! and I hope I never shall!&rdquo; and, biting her lip with
      inexpressible mortification, poor June was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why were her own relations so rich, and Phil never knew where the money
      was coming from for to-morrow&rsquo;s tobacco. Why couldn&rsquo;t they do
      something for him? But they were so selfish. Why couldn&rsquo;t they build
      country-houses? She had all that naive dogmatism which is so pathetic, and
      sometimes achieves such great results. Bosinney, to whom she turned in her
      discomfiture, was talking to Irene, and a chill fell on June&rsquo;s
      spirit. Her eyes grew steady with anger, like old Jolyon&rsquo;s when his
      will was crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, too, was much disturbed. He felt as though someone had threatened
      his right to invest his money at five per cent. Jolyon had spoiled her.
      None of his girls would have said such a thing. James had always been
      exceedingly liberal to his children, and the consciousness of this made
      him feel it all the more deeply. He trifled moodily with his strawberries,
      then, deluging them with cream, he ate them quickly; they, at all events,
      should not escape him.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder he was upset. Engaged for fifty-four years (he had been admitted
      a solicitor on the earliest day sanctioned by the law) in arranging
      mortgages, preserving investments at a dead level of high and safe
      interest, conducting negotiations on the principle of securing the utmost
      possible out of other people compatible with safety to his clients and
      himself, in calculations as to the exact pecuniary possibilities of all
      the relations of life, he had come at last to think purely in terms of
      money. Money was now his light, his medium for seeing, that without which
      he was really unable to see, really not cognisant of phenomena; and to
      have this thing, &ldquo;I hope I shall never know the value of money!&rdquo;
      said to his face, saddened and exasperated him. He knew it to be nonsense,
      or it would have frightened him. What was the world coming to! Suddenly
      recollecting the story of young Jolyon, however, he felt a little
      comforted, for what could you expect with a father like that! This turned
      his thoughts into a channel still less pleasant. What was all this talk
      about Soames and Irene?
    </p>
    <p>
      As in all self-respecting families, an emporium had been established where
      family secrets were bartered, and family stock priced. It was known on
      Forsyte &lsquo;Change that Irene regretted her marriage. Her regret was
      disapproved of. She ought to have known her own mind; no dependable woman
      made these mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      James reflected sourly that they had a nice house (rather small) in an
      excellent position, no children, and no money troubles. Soames was
      reserved about his affairs, but he must be getting a very warm man. He had
      a capital income from the business&mdash;for Soames, like his father, was
      a member of that well-known firm of solicitors, Forsyte, Bustard and
      Forsyte&mdash;and had always been very careful. He had done quite
      unusually well with some mortgages he had taken up, too&mdash;a little
      timely foreclosure&mdash;most lucky hits!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no reason why Irene should not be happy, yet they said she&rsquo;d
      been asking for a separate room. He knew where that ended. It wasn&rsquo;t
      as if Soames drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      James looked at his daughter-in-law. That unseen glance of his was cold
      and dubious. Appeal and fear were in it, and a sense of personal
      grievance. Why should he be worried like this? It was very likely all
      nonsense; women were funny things! They exaggerated so, you didn&rsquo;t
      know what to believe; and then, nobody told him anything, he had to find
      out everything for himself. Again he looked furtively at Irene, and across
      from her to Soames. The latter, listening to Aunt Juley, was looking up,
      under his brows in the direction of Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s fond of her, I know,&rsquo; thought James. &lsquo;Look
      at the way he&rsquo;s always giving her things.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the extraordinary unreasonableness of her disaffection struck him with
      increased force.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pity, too, she was a taking little thing, and he, James, would be
      really quite fond of her if she&rsquo;d only let him. She had taken up
      lately with June; that was doing her no good, that was certainly doing her
      no good. She was getting to have opinions of her own. He didn&rsquo;t know
      what she wanted with anything of the sort. She&rsquo;d a good home, and
      everything she could wish for. He felt that her friends ought to be chosen
      for her. To go on like this was dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      June, indeed, with her habit of championing the unfortunate, had dragged
      from Irene a confession, and, in return, had preached the necessity of
      facing the evil, by separation, if need be. But in the face of these
      exhortations, Irene had kept a brooding silence, as though she found
      terrible the thought of this struggle carried through in cold blood. He
      would never give her up, she had said to June.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; June cried; &ldquo;let him do what he likes&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      only to stick to it!&rdquo; And she had not scrupled to say something of
      this sort at Timothy&rsquo;s; James, when he heard of it, had felt a
      natural indignation and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if Irene were to take it into her head to&mdash;he could hardly frame
      the thought&mdash;to leave Soames? But he felt this thought so unbearable
      that he at once put it away; the shady visions it conjured up, the sound
      of family tongues buzzing in his ears, the horror of the conspicuous
      happening so close to him, to one of his own children! Luckily, she had no
      money&mdash;a beggarly fifty pound a year! And he thought of the deceased
      Heron, who had had nothing to leave her, with contempt. Brooding over his
      glass, his long legs twisted under the table, he quite omitted to rise
      when the ladies left the room. He would have to speak to Soames&mdash;would
      have to put him on his guard; they could not go on like this, now that
      such a contingency had occurred to him. And he noticed with sour disfavour
      that June had left her wine-glasses full of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That little, thing&rsquo;s at the bottom of it all,&rsquo; he
      mused; &lsquo;Irene&rsquo;d never have thought of it herself.&rsquo; James
      was a man of imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Swithin roused him from his reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave four hundred pounds for it,&rdquo; he was saying. &ldquo;Of
      course it&rsquo;s a regular work of art.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred! H&rsquo;m! that&rsquo;s a lot of money!&rdquo; chimed
      in Nicholas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object alluded to was an elaborate group of statuary in Italian
      marble, which, placed upon a lofty stand (also of marble), diffused an
      atmosphere of culture throughout the room. The subsidiary figures, of
      which there were six, female, nude, and of highly ornate workmanship, were
      all pointing towards the central figure, also nude, and female, who was
      pointing at herself; and all this gave the observer a very pleasant sense
      of her extreme value. Aunt Juley, nearly opposite, had had the greatest
      difficulty in not looking at it all the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon spoke; it was he who had started the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred fiddlesticks! Don&rsquo;t tell me you gave four
      hundred for that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the points of his collar Swithin&rsquo;s chin made the second
      painful oscillatory movement of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four-hundred-pounds, of English money; not a farthing less. I don&rsquo;t
      regret it. It&rsquo;s not common English&mdash;it&rsquo;s genuine modern
      Italian!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames raised the corner of his lip in a smile, and looked across at
      Bosinney. The architect was grinning behind the fumes of his cigarette.
      Now, indeed, he looked more like a buccaneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of work about it,&rdquo; remarked James
      hastily, who was really moved by the size of the group. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d
      sell well at Jobson&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor foreign dey-vil that made it,&rdquo; went on Swithin,
      &ldquo;asked me five hundred&mdash;I gave him four. It&rsquo;s worth
      eight. Looked half-starved, poor dey-vil!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; chimed in Nicholas suddenly, &ldquo;poor, seedy-lookin&rsquo;
      chaps, these artists; it&rsquo;s a wonder to me how they live. Now, there&rsquo;s
      young Flageoletti, that Fanny and the girls are always hav&rsquo;in&rsquo;
      in, to play the fiddle; if he makes a hundred a year it&rsquo;s as much as
      ever he does!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James shook his head. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
      how they live!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon had risen, and, cigar in mouth, went to inspect the group at
      close quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t have given two for it!&rdquo; he pronounced at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames saw his father and Nicholas glance at each other anxiously; and, on
      the other side of Swithin, Bosinney, still shrouded in smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder what he thinks of it?&rsquo; thought Soames, who knew well
      enough that this group was hopelessly vieux jeu; hopelessly of the last
      generation. There was no longer any sale at Jobson&rsquo;s for such works
      of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin&rsquo;s answer came at last. &ldquo;You never knew anything about
      a statue. You&rsquo;ve got your pictures, and that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon walked back to his seat, puffing his cigar. It was not likely
      that he was going to be drawn into an argument with an obstinate beggar
      like Swithin, pig-headed as a mule, who had never known a statue from a&mdash;-straw
      hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stucco!&rdquo; was all he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had long been physically impossible for Swithin to start; his fist came
      down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stucco! I should like to see anything you&rsquo;ve got in your
      house half as good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And behind his speech seemed to sound again that rumbling violence of
      primitive generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was James who saved the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what do you say, Mr. Bosinney? You&rsquo;re an architect; you
      ought to know all about statues and things!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every eye was turned upon Bosinney; all waited with a strange, suspicious
      look for his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Soames, speaking for the first time, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Bosinney, what do you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney replied coolly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The work is a remarkable one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His words were addressed to Swithin, his eyes smiled slyly at old Jolyon;
      only Soames remained unsatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remarkable for what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For its naivete&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer was followed by an impressive silence; Swithin alone was not
      sure whether a compliment was intended.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;PROJECTION OF THE HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soames Forsyte walked out of his green-painted front door three days after
      the dinner at Swithin&rsquo;s, and looking back from across the Square,
      confirmed his impression that the house wanted painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had left his wife sitting on the sofa in the drawing-room, her hands
      crossed in her lap, manifestly waiting for him to go out. This was not
      unusual. It happened, in fact, every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not understand what she found wrong with him. It was not as if he
      drank! Did he run into debt, or gamble, or swear; was he violent; were his
      friends rackety; did he stay out at night? On the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The profound, subdued aversion which he felt in his wife was a mystery to
      him, and a source of the most terrible irritation. That she had made a
      mistake, and did not love him, had tried to love him and could not love
      him, was obviously no reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      He that could imagine so outlandish a cause for his wife&rsquo;s not
      getting on with him was certainly no Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames was forced, therefore, to set the blame entirely down to his wife.
      He had never met a woman so capable of inspiring affection. They could not
      go anywhere without his seeing how all the men were attracted by her;
      their looks, manners, voices, betrayed it; her behaviour under this
      attention had been beyond reproach. That she was one of those women&mdash;not
      too common in the Anglo-Saxon race&mdash;born to be loved and to love, who
      when not loving are not living, had certainly never even occurred to him.
      Her power of attraction, he regarded as part of her value as his property;
      but it made him, indeed, suspect that she could give as well as receive;
      and she gave him nothing! &lsquo;Then why did she marry me?&rsquo; was his
      continual thought. He had forgotten his courtship; that year and a half
      when he had besieged and lain in wait for her, devising schemes for her
      entertainment, giving her presents, proposing to her periodically, and
      keeping her other admirers away with his perpetual presence. He had
      forgotten the day when, adroitly taking advantage of an acute phase of her
      dislike to her home surroundings, he crowned his labours with success. If
      he remembered anything, it was the dainty capriciousness with which the
      gold-haired, dark-eyed girl had treated him. He certainly did not remember
      the look on her face&mdash;strange, passive, appealing&mdash;when suddenly
      one day she had yielded, and said that she would marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been one of those real devoted wooings which books and people
      praise, when the lover is at length rewarded for hammering the iron till
      it is malleable, and all must be happy ever after as the wedding bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames walked eastwards, mousing doggedly along on the shady side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house wanted doing, up, unless he decided to move into the country,
      and build.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the hundredth time that month he turned over this problem. There was
      no use in rushing into things! He was very comfortably off, with an
      increasing income getting on for three thousand a year; but his invested
      capital was not perhaps so large as his father believed&mdash;James had a
      tendency to expect that his children should be better off than they were.
      &lsquo;I can manage eight thousand easily enough,&rsquo; he thought,
      &lsquo;without calling in either Robertson&rsquo;s or Nicholl&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stopped to look in at a picture shop, for Soames was an &lsquo;amateur&rsquo;
      of pictures, and had a little-room in No. 62, Montpellier Square, full of
      canvases, stacked against the wall, which he had no room to hang. He
      brought them home with him on his way back from the City, generally after
      dark, and would enter this room on Sunday afternoons, to spend hours
      turning the pictures to the light, examining the marks on their backs, and
      occasionally making notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were nearly all landscapes with figures in the foreground, a sign of
      some mysterious revolt against London, its tall houses, its interminable
      streets, where his life and the lives of his breed and class were passed.
      Every now and then he would take one or two pictures away with him in a
      cab, and stop at Jobson&rsquo;s on his way into the City.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rarely showed them to anyone; Irene, whose opinion he secretly
      respected and perhaps for that reason never solicited, had only been into
      the room on rare occasions, in discharge of some wifely duty. She was not
      asked to look at the pictures, and she never did. To Soames this was
      another grievance. He hated that pride of hers, and secretly dreaded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the plate-glass window of the picture shop his image stood and looked
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sleek hair under the brim of the tall hat had a sheen like the hat
      itself; his cheeks, pale and flat, the line of his clean-shaven lips, his
      firm chin with its greyish shaven tinge, and the buttoned strictness of
      his black cut-away coat, conveyed an appearance of reserve and secrecy, of
      imperturbable, enforced composure; but his eyes, cold,&mdash;grey,
      strained&mdash;looking, with a line in the brow between them, examined him
      wistfully, as if they knew of a secret weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noted the subjects of the pictures, the names of the painters, made a
      calculation of their values, but without the satisfaction he usually
      derived from this inward appraisement, and walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 62 would do well enough for another year, if he decided to build! The
      times were good for building, money had not been so dear for years; and
      the site he had seen at Robin Hill, when he had gone down there in the
      spring to inspect the Nicholl mortgage&mdash;what could be better! Within
      twelve miles of Hyde Park Corner, the value of the land certain to go up,
      would always fetch more than he gave for it; so that a house, if built in
      really good style, was a first-class investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion of being the one member of his family with a country house
      weighed but little with him; for to a true Forsyte, sentiment, even the
      sentiment of social position, was a luxury only to be indulged in after
      his appetite for more material pleasure had been satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get Irene out of London, away from opportunities of going about and
      seeing people, away from her friends and those who put ideas into her
      head! That was the thing! She was too thick with June! June disliked him.
      He returned the sentiment. They were of the same blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be everything to get Irene out of town. The house would please
      her, she would enjoy messing about with the decoration, she was very
      artistic!
    </p>
    <p>
      The house must be in good style, something that would always be certain to
      command a price, something unique, like that last house of Parkes, which
      had a tower; but Parkes had himself said that his architect was ruinous.
      You never knew where you were with those fellows; if they had a name they
      ran you into no end of expense and were conceited into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a common architect was no good&mdash;the memory of Parkes&rsquo; tower
      precluded the employment of a common architect:
    </p>
    <p>
      This was why he had thought of Bosinney. Since the dinner at Swithin&rsquo;s
      he had made enquiries, the result of which had been meagre, but
      encouraging: &ldquo;One of the new school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As clever as you like&mdash;a bit&mdash;a bit up in the air!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been able to discover what houses Bosinney had built, nor what
      his charges were. The impression he gathered was that he would be able to
      make his own terms. The more he reflected on the idea, the more he liked
      it. It would be keeping the thing in the family, with Forsytes almost an
      instinct; and he would be able to get &lsquo;favoured-nation,&rsquo; if
      not nominal terms&mdash;only fair, considering the chance to Bosinney of
      displaying his talents, for this house must be no common edifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames reflected complacently on the work it would be sure to bring the
      young man; for, like every Forsyte, he could be a thorough optimist when
      there was anything to be had out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney&rsquo;s office was in Sloane Street, close at, hand, so that he
      would be able to keep his eye continually on the plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, Irene would not be to likely to object to leave London if her
      greatest friend&rsquo;s lover were given the job. June&rsquo;s marriage
      might depend on it. Irene could not decently stand in the way of June&rsquo;s
      marriage; she would never do that, he knew her too well. And June would be
      pleased; of this he saw the advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney looked clever, but he had also&mdash;and&mdash;it was one of his
      great attractions&mdash;an air as if he did not quite know on which side
      his bread were buttered; he should be easy to deal with in money matters.
      Soames made this reflection in no defrauding spirit; it was the natural
      attitude of his mind&mdash;of the mind of any good business man&mdash;of
      all those thousands of good business men through whom he was threading his
      way up Ludgate Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he fulfilled the inscrutable laws of his great class&mdash;of human
      nature itself&mdash;when he reflected, with a sense of comfort, that
      Bosinney would be easy to deal with in money matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he elbowed his way on, his eyes, which he usually kept fixed on the
      ground before his feet, were attracted upwards by the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s.
      It had a peculiar fascination for him, that old dome, and not once, but
      twice or three times a week, would he halt in his daily pilgrimage to
      enter beneath and stop in the side aisles for five or ten minutes,
      scrutinizing the names and epitaphs on the monuments. The attraction for
      him of this great church was inexplicable, unless it enabled him to
      concentrate his thoughts on the business of the day. If any affair of
      particular moment, or demanding peculiar acuteness, was weighing on his
      mind, he invariably went in, to wander with mouse-like attention from
      epitaph to epitaph. Then retiring in the same noiseless way, he would hold
      steadily on up Cheapside, a thought more of dogged purpose in his gait, as
      though he had seen something which he had made up his mind to buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in this morning, but, instead of stealing from monument to
      monument, turned his eyes upwards to the columns and spacings of the
      walls, and remained motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      His uplifted face, with the awed and wistful look which faces take on
      themselves in church, was whitened to a chalky hue in the vast building.
      His gloved hands were clasped in front over the handle of his umbrella. He
      lifted them. Some sacred inspiration perhaps had come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I must have room to hang my
      pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, on his return from the City, he called at Bosinney&rsquo;s
      office. He found the architect in his shirt-sleeves, smoking a pipe, and
      ruling off lines on a plan. Soames refused a drink, and came at once to
      the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve nothing better to do on Sunday, come down with me
      to Robin Hill, and give me your opinion on a building site.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to build?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t speak of it. I
      just want your opinion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said the architect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames peered about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather high up here,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any information he could gather about the nature and scope of Bosinney&rsquo;s
      business would be all to the good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does well enough for me so far,&rdquo; answered the architect.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re accustomed to the swells.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked out his pipe, but replaced it empty between his teeth; it
      assisted him perhaps to carry on the conversation. Soames noted a hollow
      in each cheek, made as it were by suction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you pay for an office like this?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifty too much,&rdquo; replied Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer impressed Soames favourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call for
      you&mdash;on Sunday about eleven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The following Sunday therefore he called for Bosinney in a hansom, and
      drove him to the station. On arriving at Robin Hill, they found no cab,
      and started to walk the mile and a half to the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 1st of August&mdash;a perfect day, with a burning sun and
      cloudless sky&mdash;and in the straight, narrow road leading up the hill
      their feet kicked up a yellow dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gravel soil,&rdquo; remarked Soames, and sideways he glanced at the
      coat Bosinney wore. Into the side-pockets of this coat were thrust bundles
      of papers, and under one arm was carried a queer-looking stick. Soames
      noted these and other peculiarities.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one but a clever man, or, indeed, a buccaneer, would have taken such
      liberties with his appearance; and though these eccentricities were
      revolting to Soames, he derived a certain satisfaction from them, as
      evidence of qualities by which he must inevitably profit. If the fellow
      could build houses, what did his clothes matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I want this house to be a
      surprise, so don&rsquo;t say anything about it. I never talk of my affairs
      until they&rsquo;re carried through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let women into your plans,&rdquo; pursued Soames, &ldquo;and you
      never know where it&rsquo;ll end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Said Bosinney, &ldquo;women are the devil!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This feeling had long been at the&mdash;bottom of Soames&rsquo;s heart; he
      had never, however, put it into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he Muttered, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;re beginning to....&rdquo;
      He stopped, but added, with an uncontrollable burst of spite: &ldquo;June&rsquo;s
      got a temper of her own&mdash;always had.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A temper&rsquo;s not a bad thing in an angel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had never called Irene an angel. He could not so have violated his
      best instincts, letting other people into the secret of her value, and
      giving himself away. He made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had struck into a half-made road across a warren. A cart-track led at
      right-angles to a gravel pit, beyond which the chimneys of a cottage rose
      amongst a clump of trees at the border of a thick wood. Tussocks of
      feathery grass covered the rough surface of the ground, and out of these
      the larks soared into the haze of sunshine. On the far horizon, over a
      countless succession of fields and hedges, rose a line of downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames led till they had crossed to the far side, and there he stopped. It
      was the chosen site; but now that he was about to divulge the spot to
      another he had become uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The agent lives in that cottage,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll
      give us some lunch&mdash;we&rsquo;d better have lunch before we go into
      this matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He again took the lead to the cottage, where the agent, a tall man named
      Oliver, with a heavy face and grizzled beard, welcomed them. During lunch,
      which Soames hardly touched, he kept looking at Bosinney, and once or
      twice passed his silk handkerchief stealthily over his forehead. The meal
      came to an end at last, and Bosinney rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;ve got business to talk over,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go and nose about a bit.&rdquo; Without waiting for
      a reply he strolled out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames was solicitor to this estate, and he spent nearly an hour in the
      agent&rsquo;s company, looking at ground-plans and discussing the Nicholl
      and other mortgages; it was as it were by an afterthought that he brought
      up the question of the building site.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your people,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ought to come down in their
      price to me, considering that I shall be the first to build.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site you&rsquo;ve fixed on, Sir, he said, &ldquo;is the cheapest we&rsquo;ve
      got. Sites at the top of the slope are dearer by a good bit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not decided; it&rsquo;s
      quite possible I shan&rsquo;t build at all. The ground rent&rsquo;s very
      high.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Forsyte, I shall be sorry if you go off, and I think you&rsquo;ll
      make a mistake, Sir. There&rsquo;s not a bit of land near London with such
      a view as this, nor one that&rsquo;s cheaper, all things considered; we&rsquo;ve
      only to advertise, to get a mob of people after it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other. Their faces said very plainly: &lsquo;I respect
      you as a man of business; and you can&rsquo;t expect me to believe a word
      you say.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, repeated Soames, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind; the thing
      will very likely go off!&rdquo; With these words, taking up his umbrella,
      he put his chilly hand into the agent&rsquo;s, withdrew it without the
      faintest pressure, and went out into the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly back towards the site in deep thought. His instinct told
      him that what the agent had said was true. A cheap site. And the beauty of
      it was, that he knew the agent did not really think it cheap; so that his
      own intuitive knowledge was a victory over the agent&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cheap or not, I mean to have it,&rsquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The larks sprang up in front of his feet, the air was full of butterflies,
      a sweet fragrance rose from the wild grasses. The sappy scent of the
      bracken stole forth from the wood, where, hidden in the depths, pigeons
      were cooing, and from afar on the warm breeze, came the rhythmic chiming
      of church bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames walked with his eyes on the ground, his lips opening and closing as
      though in anticipation of a delicious morsel. But when he arrived at the
      site, Bosinney was nowhere to be seen. After waiting some little time, he
      crossed the warren in the direction of the slope. He would have shouted,
      but dreaded the sound of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warren was as lonely as a prairie, its silence only broken by the
      rustle of rabbits bolting to their holes, and the song of the larks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, the pioneer-leader of the great Forsyte army advancing to the
      civilization of this wilderness, felt his spirit daunted by the
      loneliness, by the invisible singing, and the hot, sweet air. He had begun
      to retrace his steps when he at last caught sight of Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      The architect was sprawling under a large oak tree, whose trunk, with a
      huge spread of bough and foliage, ragged with age, stood on the verge of
      the rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had to touch him on the shoulder before he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo! Forsyte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the very
      place for your house! Look here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stood and looked, then he said, coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be very clever, but this site will cost me half as much
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang the cost, man. Look at the view!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost from their feet stretched ripe corn, dipping to a small dark copse
      beyond. A plain of fields and hedges spread to the distant grey-bluedowns.
      In a silver streak to the right could be seen the line of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky was so blue, and the sun so bright, that an eternal summer seemed
      to reign over this prospect. Thistledown floated round them, enraptured by
      the serenity, of the ether. The heat danced over the corn, and, pervading
      all, was a soft, insensible hum, like the murmur of bright minutes holding
      revel between earth and heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked. In spite of himself, something swelled in his breast. To
      live here in sight of all this, to be able to point it out to his friends,
      to talk of it, to possess it! His cheeks flushed. The warmth, the
      radiance, the glow, were sinking into his senses as, four years before,
      Irene&rsquo;s beauty had sunk into his senses and made him long for her.
      He stole a glance at Bosinney, whose eyes, the eyes of the coachman&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;half-tame leopard,&rsquo; seemed running wild over the landscape.
      The sunlight had caught the promontories of the fellow&rsquo;s face, the
      bumpy cheekbones, the point of his chin, the vertical ridges above his
      brow; and Soames watched this rugged, enthusiastic, careless face with an
      unpleasant feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long, soft ripple of wind flowed over the corn, and brought a puff of
      warm air into their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could build you a teaser here,&rdquo; said Bosinney, breaking the
      silence at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; replied Soames, drily. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
      got to pay for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For about eight thousand I could build you a palace.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had become very pale&mdash;a struggle was going on within him. He
      dropped his eyes, and said stubbornly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And slowly, with his mousing walk, he led the way back to the first site.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent some time there going into particulars of the projected house,
      and then Soames returned to the agent&rsquo;s cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came out in about half an hour, and, joining Bosinney, started for the
      station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, hardly opening his lips, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      taken that site of yours, after all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And again he was silent, confusedly debating how it was that this fellow,
      whom by habit he despised, should have overborne his own decision.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;A FORSYTE MENAGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Like the enlightened thousands of his class and generation in this great
      city of London, who no longer believe in red velvet chairs, and know that
      groups of modern Italian marble are &lsquo;vieux jeu,&rsquo; Soames
      Forsyte inhabited a house which did what it could. It owned a copper door
      knocker of individual design, windows which had been altered to open
      outwards, hanging flower boxes filled with fuchsias, and at the back (a
      great feature) a little court tiled with jade-green tiles, and surrounded
      by pink hydrangeas in peacock-blue tubs. Here, under a parchment-coloured
      Japanese sunshade covering the whole end, inhabitants or visitors could be
      screened from the eyes of the curious while they drank tea and examined at
      their leisure the latest of Soames&rsquo;s little silver boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inner decoration favoured the First Empire and William Morris. For its
      size, the house was commodious; there were countless nooks resembling
      birds&rsquo; nests, and little things made of silver were deposited like
      eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this general perfection two kinds of fastidiousness were at war. There
      lived here a mistress who would have dwelt daintily on a desert island; a
      master whose daintiness was, as it were, an investment, cultivated by the
      owner for his advancement, in accordance with the laws of competition.
      This competitive daintiness had caused Soames in his Marlborough days to
      be the first boy into white waistcoats in summer, and corduroy waistcoats
      in winter, had prevented him from ever appearing in public with his tie
      climbing up his collar, and induced him to dust his patent leather boots
      before a great multitude assembled on Speech Day to hear him recite
      Moliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skin-like immaculateness had grown over Soames, as over many Londoners;
      impossible to conceive of him with a hair out of place, a tie deviating
      one-eighth of an inch from the perpendicular, a collar unglossed! He would
      not have gone without a bath for worlds&mdash;it was the fashion to take
      baths; and how bitter was his scorn of people who omitted them!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Irene could be imagined, like some nymph, bathing in wayside streams,
      for the joy of the freshness and of seeing her own fair body.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this conflict throughout the house the woman had gone to the wall. As
      in the struggle between Saxon and Celt still going on within the nation,
      the more impressionable and receptive temperament had had forced on it a
      conventional superstructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the house had acquired a close resemblance to hundreds of other
      houses with the same high aspirations, having become: &lsquo;That very
      charming little house of the Soames Forsytes, quite individual, my dear&mdash;really
      elegant.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For Soames Forsyte&mdash;read James Peabody, Thomas Atkins, or Emmanuel
      Spagnoletti, the name in fact of any upper-middle class Englishman in
      London with any pretensions to taste; and though the decoration be
      different, the phrase is just.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of August 8, a week after the expedition to Robin Hill, in
      the dining-room of this house&mdash;&rsquo;quite individual, my dear&mdash;really
      elegant&rsquo;&mdash;Soames and Irene were seated at dinner. A hot dinner
      on Sundays was a little distinguishing elegance common to this house and
      many others. Early in married life Soames had laid down the rule: &lsquo;The
      servants must give us hot dinner on Sundays&mdash;they&rsquo;ve nothing to
      do but play the concertina.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The custom had produced no revolution. For&mdash;to Soames a rather
      deplorable sign&mdash;servants were devoted to Irene, who, in defiance of
      all safe tradition, appeared to recognise their right to a share in the
      weaknesses of human nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happy pair were seated, not opposite each other, but rectangularly, at
      the handsome rosewood table; they dined without a cloth&mdash;a
      distinguishing elegance&mdash;and so far had not spoken a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames liked to talk during dinner about business, or what he had been
      buying, and so long as he talked Irene&rsquo;s silence did not distress
      him. This evening he had found it impossible to talk. The decision to
      build had been weighing on his mind all the week, and he had made up his
      mind to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      His nervousness about this disclosure irritated him profoundly; she had no
      business to make him feel like that&mdash;a wife and a husband being one
      person. She had not looked at him once since they sat down; and he
      wondered what on earth she had been thinking about all the time. It was
      hard, when a man worked as he did, making money for her&mdash;yes, and
      with an ache in his heart&mdash;that she should sit there, looking&mdash;looking
      as if she saw the walls of the room closing in. It was enough to make a
      man get up and leave the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light from the rose-shaded lamp fell on her neck and arms&mdash;Soames
      liked her to dine in a low dress, it gave him an inexpressible feeling of
      superiority to the majority of his acquaintance, whose wives were
      contented with their best high frocks or with tea-gowns, when they dined
      at home. Under that rosy light her amber-coloured hair and fair skin made
      strange contrast with her dark brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could a man own anything prettier than this dining-table with its deep
      tints, the starry, soft-petalled roses, the ruby-coloured glass, and
      quaint silver furnishing; could a man own anything prettier than the woman
      who sat at it? Gratitude was no virtue among Forsytes, who, competitive,
      and full of common-sense, had no occasion for it; and Soames only
      experienced a sense of exasperation amounting to pain, that he did not own
      her as it was his right to own her, that he could not, as by stretching
      out his hand to that rose, pluck her and sniff the very secrets of her
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of his other property, out of all the things he had collected, his
      silver, his pictures, his houses, his investments, he got a secret and
      intimate feeling; out of her he got none.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this house of his there was writing on every wall. His business-like
      temperament protested against a mysterious warning that she was not made
      for him. He had married this woman, conquered her, made her his own, and
      it seemed to him contrary to the most fundamental of all laws, the law of
      possession, that he could do no more than own her body&mdash;if indeed he
      could do that, which he was beginning to doubt. If any one had asked him
      if he wanted to own her soul, the question would have seemed to him both
      ridiculous and sentimental. But he did so want, and the writing said he
      never would.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was ever silent, passive, gracefully averse; as though terrified lest
      by word, motion, or sign she might lead him to believe that she was fond
      of him; and he asked himself: Must I always go on like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most novel readers of his generation (and Soames was a great novel
      reader), literature coloured his view of life; and he had imbibed the
      belief that it was only a question of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end the husband always gained the affection of his wife. Even in
      those cases&mdash;a class of book he was not very fond of&mdash;which
      ended in tragedy, the wife always died with poignant regrets on her lips,
      or if it were the husband who died&mdash;unpleasant thought&mdash;threw
      herself on his body in an agony of remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He often took Irene to the theatre, instinctively choosing the modern
      Society Plays with the modern Society conjugal problem, so fortunately
      different from any conjugal problem in real life. He found that they too
      always ended in the same way, even when there was a lover in the case.
      While he was watching the play Soames often sympathized with the lover;
      but before he reached home again, driving with Irene in a hansom, he saw
      that this would not do, and he was glad the play had ended as it had.
      There was one class of husband that had just then come into fashion, the
      strong, rather rough, but extremely sound man, who was peculiarly
      successful at the end of the play; with this person Soames was really not
      in sympathy, and had it not been for his own position, would have
      expressed his disgust with the fellow. But he was so conscious of how
      vital to himself was the necessity for being a successful, even a &lsquo;strong,&rsquo;
      husband, that he never spoke of a distaste born perhaps by the perverse
      processes of Nature out of a secret fund of brutality in himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Irene&rsquo;s silence this evening was exceptional. He had never
      before seen such an expression on her face. And since it is always the
      unusual which alarms, Soames was alarmed. He ate his savoury, and hurried
      the maid as she swept off the crumbs with the silver sweeper. When she had
      left the room, he filled his glass with wine and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody been here this afternoon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;June.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she want?&rdquo; It was an axiom with the Forsytes that
      people did not go anywhere unless they wanted something. &ldquo;Came to
      talk about her lover, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; continued Soames, &ldquo;as if she were
      sweeter on him than he is on her. She&rsquo;s always following him about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s eyes made him feel uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no business to say such a thing!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Anybody can see it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cannot. And if they could, it&rsquo;s disgraceful to say so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames&rsquo;s composure gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pretty wife!&rdquo; he said. But secretly he
      wondered at the heat of her reply; it was unlike her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      cracked about June! I can tell you one thing: now that she has the
      Buccaneer in tow, she doesn&rsquo;t care twopence about you, and, you&rsquo;ll
      find it out. But you won&rsquo;t see so much of her in future; we&rsquo;re
      going to live in the country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been glad to get his news out under cover of this burst of
      irritation. He had expected a cry of dismay; the silence with which his
      pronouncement was received alarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem interested,&rdquo; he was obliged to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it already.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;June.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did she know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene did not answer. Baffled and uncomfortable, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine thing for Bosinney, it&rsquo;ll be the making of
      him. I suppose she&rsquo;s told you all about it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause, and then Soames said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t want to, go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t tell what you want. You never seem contented
      here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have my wishes anything to do with it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the vase of roses and left the room. Soames remained seated. Was
      it for this that he had signed that contract? Was it for this that he was
      going to spend some ten thousand pounds? Bosinney&rsquo;s phrase came back
      to him: &ldquo;Women are the devil!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But presently he grew calmer. It might have, been worse. She might have
      flared up. He had expected something more than this. It was lucky, after
      all, that June had broken the ice for him. She must have wormed it out of
      Bosinney; he might have known she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted his cigarette. After all, Irene had not made a scene! She would
      come round&mdash;that was the best of her; she was cold, but not sulky.
      And, puffing the cigarette smoke at a lady-bird on the shining table, he
      plunged into a reverie about the house. It was no good worrying; he would
      go and make it up presently. She would be sitting out there in the dark,
      under the Japanese sunshade, knitting. A beautiful, warm night....
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, June had come in that afternoon with shining eyes, and the
      words: &ldquo;Soames is a brick! It&rsquo;s splendid for Phil&mdash;the
      very thing for him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s face remaining dark and puzzled, she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your new house at Robin Hill, of course. What? Don&rsquo;t you
      know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! then, I suppose I oughtn&rsquo;t to have told you!&rdquo;
      Looking impatiently at her friend, she cried: &ldquo;You look as if you
      didn&rsquo;t care. Don&rsquo;t you see, it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve&rsquo;
      been praying for&mdash;the very chance he&rsquo;s been wanting all this
      time. Now you&rsquo;ll see what he can do;&rdquo; and thereupon she poured
      out the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since her own engagement she had not seemed much interested in her friend&rsquo;s
      position; the hours she spent with Irene were given to confidences of her
      own; and at times, for all her affectionate pity, it was impossible to
      keep out of her smile a trace of compassionate contempt for the woman who
      had made such a mistake in her life&mdash;such a vast, ridiculous mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s to have all the decorations as well&mdash;a free hand.
      It&rsquo;s perfect&mdash;&rdquo; June broke into laughter, her little
      figure quivered gleefully; she raised her hand, and struck a blow at a
      muslin curtain. &ldquo;Do you, know I even asked Uncle James....&rdquo;
      But, with a sudden dislike to mentioning that incident, she stopped; and
      presently, finding her friend so unresponsive, went away. She looked back
      from the pavement, and Irene was still standing in the doorway. In
      response to her farewell wave, Irene put her hand to her brow, and,
      turning slowly, shut the door....
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames went to the drawing-room presently, and peered at her through the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the shadow of the Japanese sunshade she was sitting very still, the
      lace on her white shoulders stirring with the soft rise and fall of her
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But about this silent creature sitting there so motionless, in the dark,
      there seemed a warmth, a hidden fervour of feeling, as if the whole of her
      being had been stirred, and some change were taking place in its very
      depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole back to the dining-room unnoticed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;JAMES AT LARGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was not long before Soames&rsquo;s determination to build went the
      round of the family, and created the flutter that any decision connected
      with property should make among Forsytes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not his fault, for he had been determined that no one should know.
      June, in the fulness of her heart, had told Mrs. Small, giving her leave
      only to tell Aunt Ann&mdash;she thought it would cheer her, the poor old
      sweet! for Aunt Ann had kept her room now for many days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small told Aunt Ann at once, who, smiling as she lay back on her
      pillows, said in her distinct, trembling old voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very nice for dear June; but I hope they will be careful&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      rather dangerous!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was left alone again, a frown, like a cloud presaging a rainy
      morrow, crossed her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was lying there so many days the process of recharging her will
      went on all the time; it spread to her face, too, and tightening movements
      were always in action at the corners of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid Smither, who had been in her service since girlhood, and was
      spoken of as &ldquo;Smither&mdash;a good girl&mdash;but so slow!&rdquo;&mdash;the
      maid Smither performed every morning with extreme punctiliousness the
      crowning ceremony of that ancient toilet. Taking from the recesses of
      their pure white band-box those flat, grey curls, the insignia of personal
      dignity, she placed them securely in her mistress&rsquo;s hands, and
      turned her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      And every day Aunts Juley and Hester were required to come and report on
      Timothy; what news there was of Nicholas; whether dear June had succeeded
      in getting Jolyon to shorten the engagement, now that Mr. Bosinney was
      building Soames a house; whether young Roger&rsquo;s wife was really&mdash;expecting;
      how the operation on Archie had succeeded; and what Swithin had done about
      that empty house in Wigmore Street, where the tenant had lost all his
      money and treated him so badly; above all, about Soames; was Irene still&mdash;still
      asking for a separate room? And every morning Smither was told: &ldquo;I
      shall be coming down this afternoon, Smither, about two o&rsquo;clock. I
      shall want your arm, after all these days in bed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After telling Aunt Ann, Mrs. Small had spoken of the house in the
      strictest confidence to Mrs. Nicholas, who in her turn had asked Winifred
      Dartie for confirmation, supposing, of course, that, being Soames&rsquo;s
      sister, she would know all about it. Through her it had in due course come
      round to the ears of James. He had been a good deal agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;told him anything.&rdquo; And,
      rather than go direct to Soames himself, of whose taciturnity he was
      afraid, he took his umbrella and went round to Timothy&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Mrs. Septimus and Hester (who had been told&mdash;she was so
      safe, she found it tiring to talk) ready, and indeed eager, to discuss the
      news. It was very good of dear Soames, they thought, to employ Mr.
      Bosinney, but rather risky. What had George named him? &lsquo;The
      Buccaneer&rsquo; How droll! But George was always droll! However, it would
      be all in the family they supposed they must really look upon Mr. Bosinney
      as belonging to the family, though it seemed strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      James here broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows anything about him. I don&rsquo;t see what Soames
      wants with a young man like that. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Irene
      had put her oar in. I shall speak to....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soames,&rdquo; interposed Aunt Juley, &ldquo;told Mr. Bosinney that
      he didn&rsquo;t wish it mentioned. He wouldn&rsquo;t like it to be talked
      about, I&rsquo;m sure, and if Timothy knew he would be very vexed, I....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James put his hand behind his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting very deaf. I suppose
      I don&rsquo;t hear people. Emily&rsquo;s got a bad toe. We shan&rsquo;t be
      able to start for Wales till the end of the month. There&rsquo;s always
      something!&rdquo; And, having got what he wanted, he took his hat and went
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fine afternoon, and he walked across the Park towards Soames&rsquo;s,
      where he intended to dine, for Emily&rsquo;s toe kept her in bed, and
      Rachel and Cicely were on a visit to the country. He took the slanting
      path from the Bayswater side of the Row to the Knightsbridge Gate, across
      a pasture of short, burnt grass, dotted with blackened sheep, strewn with
      seated couples and strange waifs; lying prone on their faces, like corpses
      on a field over which the wave of battle has rolled.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked rapidly, his head bent, looking neither to right nor, left. The
      appearance of this park, the centre of his own battle-field, where he had
      all his life been fighting, excited no thought or speculation in his mind.
      These corpses flung down, there, from out the press and turmoil of the
      struggle, these pairs of lovers sitting cheek by jowl for an hour of idle
      Elysium snatched from the monotony of their treadmill, awakened no fancies
      in his mind; he had outlived that kind of imagination; his nose, like the
      nose of a sheep, was fastened to the pastures on which he browsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his tenants had lately shown a disposition to be behind-hand in his
      rent, and it had become a grave question whether he had not better turn
      him out at once, and so run the risk of not re-letting before Christmas.
      Swithin had just been let in very badly, but it had served him right&mdash;he
      had held on too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered this as he walked steadily, holding his umbrella carefully by
      the wood, just below the crook of the handle, so as to keep the ferule off
      the ground, and not fray the silk in the middle. And, with his thin, high
      shoulders stooped, his long legs moving with swift mechanical precision,
      this passage through the Park, where the sun shone with a clear flame on
      so much idleness&mdash;on so many human evidences of the remorseless
      battle of Property, raging beyond its ring&mdash;was like the flight of
      some land bird across the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a touch on the arm as he came out at Albert Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Soames, who, crossing from the shady side of Piccadilly, where he
      had been walking home from the office, had suddenly appeared alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s in bed,&rdquo; said James; &ldquo;I was, just
      coming to you, but I suppose I shall be in the way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The outward relations between James and his son were marked by a lack of
      sentiment peculiarly Forsytean, but for all that the two were by no means
      unattached. Perhaps they regarded one another as an investment; certainly
      they were solicitous of each other&rsquo;s welfare, glad of each other&rsquo;s
      company. They had never exchanged two words upon the more intimate
      problems of life, or revealed in each other&rsquo;s presence the existence
      of any deep feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something beyond the power of word-analysis bound them together, something
      hidden deep in the fibre of nations and families&mdash;for blood, they
      say, is thicker than water&mdash;and neither of them was a cold-blooded
      man. Indeed, in James love of his children was now the prime motive of his
      existence. To have creatures who were parts of himself, to whom he might
      transmit the money he saved, was at the root of his saving; and, at
      seventy-five, what was left that could give him pleasure, but&mdash;saving?
      The kernel of life was in this saving for his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Than James Forsyte, notwithstanding all his &lsquo;Jonah-isms,&rsquo;
      there was no saner man (if the leading symptom of sanity, as we are told,
      is self-preservation, though without doubt Timothy went too far) in all
      this London, of which he owned so much, and loved with such a dumb love,
      as the centre of his opportunities. He had the marvellous instinctive
      sanity of the middle class. In him&mdash;more than in Jolyon, with his
      masterful will and his moments of tenderness and philosophy&mdash;more
      than in Swithin, the martyr to crankiness&mdash;Nicholas, the sufferer
      from ability&mdash;and Roger, the victim of enterprise&mdash;beat the true
      pulse of compromise; of all the brothers he was least remarkable in mind
      and person, and for that reason more likely to live for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      To James, more than to any of the others, was &ldquo;the family&rdquo;
      significant and dear. There had always been something primitive and cosy
      in his attitude towards life; he loved the family hearth, he loved gossip,
      and he loved grumbling. All his decisions were formed of a cream which he
      skimmed off the family mind; and, through that family, off the minds of
      thousands of other families of similar fibre. Year after year, week after
      week, he went to Timothy&rsquo;s, and in his brother&rsquo;s front
      drawing-room&mdash;his legs twisted, his long white whiskers framing his
      clean-shaven mouth&mdash;would sit watching the family pot simmer, the
      cream rising to the top; and he would go away sheltered, refreshed,
      comforted, with an indefinable sense of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the adamant of his self-preserving instinct there was much real
      softness in James; a visit to Timothy&rsquo;s was like an hour spent in
      the lap of a mother; and the deep craving he himself had for the
      protection of the family wing reacted in turn on his feelings towards his
      own children; it was a nightmare to him to think of them exposed to the
      treatment of the world, in money, health, or reputation. When his old
      friend John Street&rsquo;s son volunteered for special service, he shook
      his head querulously, and wondered what John Street was about to allow it;
      and when young Street was assagaied, he took it so much to heart that he
      made a point of calling everywhere with the special object of saying: He
      knew how it would be&mdash;he&rsquo;d no patience with them!
    </p>
    <p>
      When his son-in-law Dartie had that financial crisis, due to speculation
      in Oil Shares, James made himself ill worrying over it; the knell of all
      prosperity seemed to have sounded. It took him three months and a visit to
      Baden-Baden to get better; there was something terrible in the idea that
      but for his, James&rsquo;s, money, Dartie&rsquo;s name might have appeared
      in the Bankruptcy List.
    </p>
    <p>
      Composed of a physiological mixture so sound that if he had an earache he
      thought he was dying, he regarded the occasional ailments of his wife and
      children as in the nature of personal grievances, special interventions of
      Providence for the purpose of destroying his peace of mind; but he did not
      believe at all in the ailments of people outside his own immediate family,
      affirming them in every case to be due to neglected liver.
    </p>
    <p>
      His universal comment was: &ldquo;What can they expect? I have it myself,
      if I&rsquo;m not careful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went to Soames&rsquo;s that evening he felt that life was hard on
      him: There was Emily with a bad toe, and Rachel gadding about in the
      country; he got no sympathy from anybody; and Ann, she was ill&mdash;he
      did not believe she would last through the summer; he had called there
      three times now without her being able to see him! And this idea of Soames&rsquo;s,
      building a house, that would have to be looked into. As to the trouble
      with Irene, he didn&rsquo;t know what was to come of that&mdash;anything
      might come of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered 62, Montpellier Square with the fullest intentions of being
      miserable. It was already half-past seven, and Irene, dressed for dinner,
      was seated in the drawing-room. She was wearing her gold-coloured frock&mdash;for,
      having been displayed at a dinner-party, a soiree, and a dance, it was now
      to be worn at home&mdash;and she had adorned the bosom with a cascade of
      lace, on which James&rsquo;s eyes riveted themselves at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you get your things?&rdquo; he said in an aggravated
      voice. &ldquo;I never see Rachel and Cicely looking half so well. That
      rose-point, now&mdash;that&rsquo;s not real!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene came close, to prove to him that he was in error.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, in spite of himself, James felt the influence of her deference, of
      the faint seductive perfume exhaling from her. No self-respecting Forsyte
      surrendered at a blow; so he merely said: He didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;he
      expected she was spending a pretty penny on dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gong sounded, and, putting her white arm within his, Irene took him
      into the dining-room. She seated him in Soames&rsquo;s usual place, round
      the corner on her left. The light fell softly there, so that he would not
      be worried by the gradual dying of the day; and she began to talk to him
      about himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, over James came a change, like the mellowing that steals upon a
      fruit in the sun; a sense of being caressed, and praised, and petted, and
      all without the bestowal of a single caress or word of praise. He felt
      that what he was eating was agreeing with him; he could not get that
      feeling at home; he did not know when he had enjoyed a glass of champagne
      so much, and, on inquiring the brand and price, was surprised to find that
      it was one of which he had a large stock himself, but could never drink;
      he instantly formed the resolution to let his wine merchant know that he
      had been swindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up from his food, he remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a lot of nice things about the place. Now, what did
      you give for that sugar-sifter? Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it was worth
      money!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was particularly pleased with the appearance of a picture, on the wall
      opposite, which he himself had given them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no idea it was so good!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rose to go into the drawing-room, and James followed Irene closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I call a capital little dinner,&rdquo; he
      murmured, breathing pleasantly down on her shoulder; &ldquo;nothing heavy&mdash;and
      not too Frenchified. But I can&rsquo;t get it at home. I pay my cook sixty
      pounds a year, but she can&rsquo;t give me a dinner like that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had as yet made no allusion to the building of the house, nor did he
      when Soames, pleading the excuse of business, betook himself to the room
      at the top, where he kept his pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      James was left alone with his daughter-in-law. The glow of the wine, and
      of an excellent liqueur, was still within him. He felt quite warm towards
      her. She was really a taking little thing; she listened to you, and seemed
      to understand what you were saying; and, while talking, he kept examining
      her figure, from her bronze-coloured shoes to the waved gold of her hair.
      She was leaning back in an Empire chair, her shoulders poised against the
      top&mdash;her body, flexibly straight and unsupported from the hips,
      swaying when she moved, as though giving to the arms of a lover. Her lips
      were smiling, her eyes half-closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have been a recognition of danger in the very charm of her
      attitude, or a twang of digestion, that caused a sudden dumbness to fall
      on James. He did not remember ever having been quite alone with Irene
      before. And, as he looked at her, an odd feeling crept over him, as though
      he had come across something strange and foreign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what was she thinking about&mdash;sitting back like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus when he spoke it was in a sharper voice, as if he had been awakened
      from a pleasant dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you do with yourself all day?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      never come round to Park Lane!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to be making very lame excuses, and James did not look at her.
      He did not want to believe that she was really avoiding them&mdash;it
      would mean too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect the fact is, you haven&rsquo;t time,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always about with June. I expect you&rsquo;re useful
      to her with her young man, chaperoning, and one thing and another. They
      tell me she&rsquo;s never at home now; your Uncle Jolyon he doesn&rsquo;t
      like it, I fancy, being left so much alone as he is. They tell me she&rsquo;s
      always hanging about for this young Bosinney; I suppose he comes here
      every day. Now, what do you think of him? D&rsquo;you think he knows his
      own mind? He seems to me a poor thing. I should say the grey mare was the
      better horse!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour deepened in Irene&rsquo;s face; and James watched her
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t quite understand Mr. Bosinney,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t understand him!&rdquo; James hummed out: &ldquo;Why
      not?&mdash;you can see he&rsquo;s one of these artistic chaps. They say he&rsquo;s
      clever&mdash;they all think they&rsquo;re clever. You know more about him
      than I do,&rdquo; he added; and again his suspicious glance rested on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is designing a house for Soames,&rdquo; she said softly,
      evidently trying to smooth things over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That brings me to what I was going to say,&rdquo; continued James;
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Soames wants with a young man like that;
      why doesn&rsquo;t he go to a first-rate man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Bosinney is first-rate!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James rose, and took a turn with bent head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you young people,
      you all stick together; you all think you know best!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Halting his tall, lank figure before her, he raised a finger, and levelled
      it at her bosom, as though bringing an indictment against her beauty:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I can say is, these artistic people, or whatever they call
      themselves, they&rsquo;re as unreliable as they can be; and my advice to
      you is, don&rsquo;t you have too much to do with him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene smiled; and in the curve of her lips was a strange provocation. She
      seemed to have lost her deference. Her breast rose and fell as though with
      secret anger; she drew her hands inwards from their rest on the arms of
      her chair until the tips of her fingers met, and her dark eyes looked
      unfathomably at James.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter gloomily scrutinized the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you my opinion,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a pity you
      haven&rsquo;t got a child to think about, and occupy you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A brooding look came instantly on Irene&rsquo;s face, and even James
      became conscious of the rigidity that took possession of her whole figure
      beneath the softness of its silk and lace clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was frightened by the effect he had produced, and like most men with
      but little courage, he sought at once to justify himself by bullying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to care about going about. Why don&rsquo;t you
      drive down to Hurlingham with us? And go to the theatre now and then. At
      your time of life you ought to take an interest in things. You&rsquo;re a
      young woman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The brooding look darkened on her face; he grew nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know nothing about it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;nobody tells
      me anything. Soames ought to be able to take care of himself. If he can&rsquo;t
      take care of himself he mustn&rsquo;t look to me&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Biting the corner of his forefinger he stole a cold, sharp look at his
      daughter-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      He encountered her eyes fixed on his own, so dark and deep, that he
      stopped, and broke into a gentle perspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I must be going,&rdquo; he said after a short pause, and a
      minute later rose, with a slight appearance of surprise, as though he had
      expected to be asked to stop. Giving his hand to Irene, he allowed himself
      to be conducted to the door, and let out into the street. He would not
      have a cab, he would walk, Irene was to say good-night to Soames for him,
      and if she wanted a little gaiety, well, he would drive her down to
      Richmond any day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked home, and going upstairs, woke Emily out of the first sleep she
      had had for four and twenty hours, to tell her that it was his impression
      things were in a bad way at Soames&rsquo;s; on this theme he descanted for
      half an hour, until at last, saying that he would not sleep a wink, he
      turned on his side and instantly began to snore.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Montpellier Square Soames, who had come from the picture room, stood
      invisible at the top of the stairs, watching Irene sort the letters
      brought by the last post. She turned back into the drawing-room; but in a
      minute came out, and stood as if listening. Then she came stealing up the
      stairs, with a kitten in her arms. He could see her face bent over the
      little beast, which was purring against her neck. Why couldn&rsquo;t she
      look at him like that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she saw him, and her face changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any letters for me?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood aside, and without another word she passed on into the bedroom.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;OLD JOLYON&rsquo;S PECCADILLO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon came out of Lord&rsquo;s cricket ground that same afternoon
      with the intention of going home. He had not reached Hamilton Terrace
      before he changed his mind, and hailing a cab, gave the driver an address
      in Wistaria Avenue. He had taken a resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      June had hardly been at home at all that week; she had given him nothing
      of her company for a long time past, not, in fact, since she had become
      engaged to Bosinney. He never asked her for her company. It was not his
      habit to ask people for things! She had just that one idea now&mdash;Bosinney
      and his affairs&mdash;and she left him stranded in his great house, with a
      parcel of servants, and not a soul to speak to from morning to night. His
      Club was closed for cleaning; his Boards in recess; there was nothing,
      therefore, to take him into the City. June had wanted him to go away; she
      would not go herself, because Bosinney was in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where was he to go by himself? He could not go abroad alone; the sea
      upset his liver; he hated hotels. Roger went to a hydropathic&mdash;he was
      not going to begin that at his time of life, those new-fangled places we&rsquo;re
      all humbug!
    </p>
    <p>
      With such formulas he clothed to himself the desolation of his spirit; the
      lines down his face deepening, his eyes day by day looking forth with the
      melancholy which sat so strangely on a face wont to be strong and serene.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so that afternoon he took this journey through St. John&rsquo;s Wood,
      in the golden-light that sprinkled the rounded green bushes of the acacia&rsquo;s
      before the little houses, in the summer sunshine that seemed holding a
      revel over the little gardens; and he looked about him with interest; for
      this was a district which no Forsyte entered without open disapproval and
      secret curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cab stopped in front of a small house of that peculiar buff colour
      which implies a long immunity from paint. It had an outer gate, and a
      rustic approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped out, his bearing extremely composed; his massive head, with its
      drooping moustache and wings of white hair, very upright, under an
      excessively large top hat; his glance firm, a little angry. He had been
      driven into this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Jolyon Forsyte at home?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes sir!&mdash;what name shall I say, if you please, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon could not help twinkling at the little maid as he gave his
      name. She seemed to him such a funny little toad!
    </p>
    <p>
      And he followed her through the dark hall, into a small double,
      drawing-room, where the furniture was covered in chintz, and the little
      maid placed him in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in the garden, sir; if you&rsquo;ll kindly take a
      seat, I&rsquo;ll tell them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon sat down in the chintz-covered chair, and looked around him.
      The whole place seemed to him, as he would have expressed it, pokey; there
      was a certain&mdash;he could not tell exactly what&mdash;air of
      shabbiness, or rather of making two ends meet, about everything. As far as
      he could see, not a single piece of furniture was worth a five-pound note.
      The walls, distempered rather a long time ago, were decorated with
      water-colour sketches; across the ceiling meandered a long crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      These little houses were all old, second-rate concerns; he should hope the
      rent was under a hundred a year; it hurt him more than he could have said,
      to think of a Forsyte&mdash;his own son living in such a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little maid came back. Would he please to go down into the garden?
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon marched out through the French windows. In descending the steps
      he noticed that they wanted painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon, his wife, his two children, and his dog Balthasar, were all
      out there under a pear-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      This walk towards them was the most courageous act of old Jolyon&rsquo;s
      life; but no muscle of his face moved, no nervous gesture betrayed him. He
      kept his deep-set eyes steadily on the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those two minutes he demonstrated to perfection all that unconscious
      soundness, balance, and vitality of fibre that made, of him and so many
      others of his class the core of the nation. In the unostentatious conduct
      of their own affairs, to the neglect of everything else, they typified the
      essential individualism, born in the Briton from the natural isolation of
      his country&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog Balthasar sniffed round the edges of his trousers; this friendly
      and cynical mongrel&mdash;offspring of a liaison between a Russian poodle
      and a fox-terrier&mdash;had a nose for the unusual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange greetings over, old Jolyon seated himself in a wicker chair,
      and his two grandchildren, one on each side of his knees, looked at him
      silently, never having seen so old a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were unlike, as though recognising the difference set between them by
      the circumstances of their births. Jolly, the child of sin, pudgy-faced,
      with his tow-coloured hair brushed off his forehead, and a dimple in his
      chin, had an air of stubborn amiability, and the eyes of a Forsyte; little
      Holly, the child of wedlock, was a dark-skinned, solemn soul, with her
      mother&rsquo;s, grey and wistful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog Balthasar, having walked round the three small flower-beds, to
      show his extreme contempt for things at large, had also taken a seat in
      front of old Jolyon, and, oscillating a tail curled by Nature tightly over
      his back, was staring up with eyes that did not blink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the garden, that sense of things being pokey haunted old Jolyon;
      the wicker chair creaked under his weight; the garden-beds looked &lsquo;daverdy&rsquo;.
      on the far side, under the smut-stained wall, cats had made a path.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he and his grandchildren thus regarded each other with the peculiar
      scrutiny, curious yet trustful, that passes between the very young and the
      very old, young Jolyon watched his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour had deepened in her thin, oval face, with its straight brows,
      and large, grey eyes. Her hair, brushed in fine, high curves back from her
      forehead, was going grey, like his own, and this greyness made the sudden
      vivid colour in her cheeks painfully pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look on her face, such as he had never seen there before, such as she
      had always hidden from him, was full of secret resentments, and longings,
      and fears. Her eyes, under their twitching brows, stared painfully. And
      she was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jolly alone sustained the conversation; he had many possessions, and was
      anxious that his unknown friend with extremely large moustaches, and hands
      all covered with blue veins, who sat with legs crossed like his own father
      (a habit he was himself trying to acquire), should know it; but being a
      Forsyte, though not yet quite eight years old, he made no mention of the
      thing at the moment dearest to his heart&mdash;a camp of soldiers in a
      shop-window, which his father had promised to buy. No doubt it seemed to
      him too precious; a tempting of Providence to mention it yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the sunlight played through the leaves on that little party of the
      three generations grouped tranquilly under the pear-tree, which had long
      borne no fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon&rsquo;s furrowed face was reddening patchily, as old men&rsquo;s
      faces redden in the sun. He took one of Jolly&rsquo;s hands in his own;
      the boy climbed on to his knee; and little Holly, mesmerized by this
      sight, crept up to them; the sound of the dog Balthasar&rsquo;s scratching
      arose rhythmically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly young Mrs. Jolyon got up and hurried indoors. A minute later her
      husband muttered an excuse, and followed. Old Jolyon was left alone with
      his grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Nature with her quaint irony began working in him one of her strange
      revolutions, following her cyclic laws into the depths of his heart. And
      that tenderness for little children, that passion for the beginnings of
      life which had once made him forsake his son and follow June, now worked
      in him to forsake June and follow these littler things. Youth, like a
      flame, burned ever in his breast, and to youth he turned, to the round
      little limbs, so reckless, that wanted care, to the small round faces so
      unreasonably solemn or bright, to the treble tongues, and the shrill,
      chuckling laughter, to the insistent tugging hands, and the feel of small
      bodies against his legs, to all that was young and young, and once more
      young. And his eyes grew soft, his voice, and thin-veined hands soft, and
      soft his heart within him. And to those small creatures he became at once
      a place of pleasure, a place where they were secure, and could talk and
      laugh and play; till, like sunshine, there radiated from old Jolyon&rsquo;s
      wicker chair the perfect gaiety of three hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with young Jolyon following to his wife&rsquo;s room it was different.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her seated on a chair before her dressing-glass, with her hands
      before her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her shoulders were shaking with sobs. This passion of hers for suffering
      was mysterious to him. He had been through a hundred of these moods; how
      he had survived them he never knew, for he could never believe they were
      moods, and that the last hour of his partnership had not struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the night she would be sure to throw her arms round his neck and say:
      &ldquo;Oh! Jo, how I make you suffer!&rdquo; as she had done a hundred
      times before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached out his hand, and, unseen, slipped his razor-case into his
      pocket. &lsquo;I cannot stay here,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I must go
      down!&rsquo; Without a word he left the room, and went back to the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon had little Holly on his knee; she had taken possession of his
      watch; Jolly, very red in the face, was trying to show that he could stand
      on his head. The dog Balthasar, as close as he might be to the tea-table,
      had fixed his eyes on the cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon felt a malicious desire to cut their enjoyment short.
    </p>
    <p>
      What business had his father to come and upset his wife like this? It was
      a shock, after all these years! He ought to have known; he ought to have
      given them warning; but when did a Forsyte ever imagine that his conduct
      could upset anybody! And in his thoughts he did old Jolyon wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke sharply to the children, and told them to go in to their tea.
      Greatly surprised, for they had never heard their father speak sharply
      before, they went off, hand in hand, little Holly looking back over her
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon poured out the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s not the thing today,&rdquo; he said, but he knew
      well enough that his father had penetrated the cause of that sudden
      withdrawal, and almost hated the old man for sitting there so calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a nice little house here,&rdquo; said old Jolyon
      with a shrewd look; &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve taken a lease of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the neighbourhood,&rdquo; said old Jolyon;
      &ldquo;a ramshackle lot.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon replied: &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;re a ramshackle lot."&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was now only broken by the sound of the dog Balthasar&rsquo;s
      scratching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon said simply: &ldquo;I suppose I oughtn&rsquo;t to have come
      here, Jo; but I get so lonely!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words young Jolyon got up and put his hand on his father&rsquo;s
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next house someone was playing over and over again: &lsquo;La Donna
      mobile&rsquo; on an untuned piano; and the little garden had fallen into
      shade, the sun now only reached the wall at the end, whereon basked a
      crouching cat, her yellow eyes turned sleepily down on the dog Balthasar.
      There was a drowsy hum of very distant traffic; the creepered trellis
      round the garden shut out everything but sky, and house, and pear-tree,
      with its top branches still gilded by the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time they sat there, talking but little. Then old Jolyon rose to
      go, and not a word was said about his coming again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked away very sadly. What a poor miserable place; and he thought of
      the great, empty house in Stanhope Gate, fit residence for a Forsyte, with
      its huge billiard-room and drawing-room that no one entered from one week&rsquo;s
      end to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      That woman, whose face he had rather liked, was too thin-skinned by half;
      she gave Jo a bad time he knew! And those sweet children! Ah! what a piece
      of awful folly!
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked towards the Edgware Road, between rows of little houses, all
      suggesting to him (erroneously no doubt, but the prejudices of a Forsyte
      are sacred) shady histories of some sort or kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society, forsooth, the chattering hags and jackanapes&mdash;had set
      themselves up to pass judgment on his flesh and blood! A parcel of old
      women! He stumped his umbrella on the ground, as though to drive it into
      the heart of that unfortunate body, which had dared to ostracize his son
      and his son&rsquo;s son, in whom he could have lived again!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stumped his umbrella fiercely; yet he himself had followed Society&rsquo;s
      behaviour for fifteen years&mdash;had only today been false to it!
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of June, and her dead mother, and the whole story, with all his
      old bitterness. A wretched business!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a long time reaching Stanhope Gate, for, with native perversity,
      being extremely tired, he walked the whole way.
    </p>
    <p>
      After washing his hands in the lavatory downstairs, he went to the
      dining-room to wait for dinner, the only room he used when June was out&mdash;it
      was less lonely so. The evening paper had not yet come; he had finished
      the Times, there was therefore nothing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room faced the backwater of traffic, and was very silent. He disliked
      dogs, but a dog even would have been company. His gaze, travelling round
      the walls, rested on a picture entitled: &lsquo;Group of Dutch fishing
      boats at sunset&rsquo;. the chef d&rsquo;oeuvre of his collection. It gave
      him no pleasure. He closed his eyes. He was lonely! He oughtn&rsquo;t to
      complain, he knew, but he couldn&rsquo;t help it: He was a poor thing&mdash;had
      always been a poor thing&mdash;no pluck! Such was his thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler came to lay the table for dinner, and seeing his master
      apparently asleep, exercised extreme caution in his movements. This
      bearded man also wore a moustache, which had given rise to grave doubts in
      the minds of many members&mdash;of the family&mdash;, especially those
      who, like Soames, had been to public schools, and were accustomed to
      niceness in such matters. Could he really be considered a butler? Playful
      spirits alluded to him as: &lsquo;Uncle Jolyon&rsquo;s Nonconformist&rsquo;.
      George, the acknowledged wag, had named him: &lsquo;Sankey.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved to and fro between the great polished sideboard and the great
      polished table inimitably sleek and soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon watched him, feigning sleep. The fellow was a sneak&mdash;he
      had always thought so&mdash;who cared about nothing but rattling through
      his work, and getting out to his betting or his woman or goodness knew
      what! A slug! Fat too! And didn&rsquo;t care a pin about his master!
    </p>
    <p>
      But then against his will, came one of those moments of philosophy which
      made old Jolyon different from other Forsytes:
    </p>
    <p>
      After all why should the man care? He wasn&rsquo;t paid to care, and why
      expect it? In this world people couldn&rsquo;t look for affection unless
      they paid for it. It might be different in the next&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t
      know&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t tell! And again he shut his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relentless and stealthy, the butler pursued his labours, taking things
      from the various compartments of the sideboard. His back seemed always
      turned to old Jolyon; thus, he robbed his operations of the unseemliness
      of being carried on in his master&rsquo;s presence; now and then he
      furtively breathed on the silver, and wiped it with a piece of chamois
      leather. He appeared to pore over the quantities of wine in the decanters,
      which he carried carefully and rather high, letting his head droop over
      them protectingly. When he had finished, he stood for over a minute
      watching his master, and in his greenish eyes there was a look of
      contempt:
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, this master of his was an old buffer, who hadn&rsquo;t much
      left in him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soft as a tom-cat, he crossed the room to press the bell. His orders were
      &lsquo;dinner at seven.&rsquo; What if his master were asleep; he would
      soon have him out of that; there was the night to sleep in! He had himself
      to think of, for he was due at his Club at half-past eight!
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the ring, appeared a page boy with a silver soup tureen. The
      butler took it from his hands and placed it on the table, then, standing
      by the open door, as though about to usher company into the room, he said
      in a solemn voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner is on the table, sir!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly old Jolyon got up out of his chair, and sat down at the table to
      eat his dinner.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;PLANS OF THE HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Forsytes, as is generally admitted, have shells, like that extremely
      useful little animal which is made into Turkish delight, in other words,
      they are never seen, or if seen would not be recognised, without habitats,
      composed of circumstance, property, acquaintances, and wives, which seem
      to move along with them in their passage through a world composed of
      thousands of other Forsytes with their habitats. Without a habitat a
      Forsyte is inconceivable&mdash;he would be like a novel without a plot,
      which is well-known to be an anomaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Forsyte eyes Bosinney appeared to have no habitat, he seemed one of
      those rare and unfortunate men who go through life surrounded by
      circumstance, property, acquaintances, and wives that do not belong to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      His rooms in Sloane Street, on the top floor, outside which, on a plate,
      was his name, &lsquo;Philip Baynes Bosinney, Architect,&rsquo; were not
      those of a Forsyte.&mdash;He had no sitting-room apart from his office,
      but a large recess had been screened off to conceal the necessaries of
      life&mdash;a couch, an easy chair, his pipes, spirit case, novels and
      slippers. The business part of the room had the usual furniture; an open
      cupboard with pigeon-holes, a round oak table, a folding wash-stand, some
      hard chairs, a standing desk of large dimensions covered with drawings and
      designs. June had twice been to tea there under the chaperonage of his
      aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was believed to have a bedroom at the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as the family had been able to ascertain his income, it consisted
      of two consulting appointments at twenty pounds a year, together with an
      odd fee once in a way, and&mdash;more worthy item&mdash;a private annuity
      under his father&rsquo;s will of one hundred and fifty pounds a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had transpired concerning that father was not so reassuring. It
      appeared that he had been a Lincolnshire country doctor of Cornish
      extraction, striking appearance, and Byronic tendencies&mdash;a well-known
      figure, in fact, in his county. Bosinney&rsquo;s uncle by marriage,
      Baynes, of Baynes and Bildeboy, a Forsyte in instincts if not in name, had
      but little that was worthy to relate of his brother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An odd fellow!&rsquo; he would say: &lsquo;always spoke of his
      three eldest boys as &lsquo;good creatures, but so dull&rsquo;. they&rsquo;re
      all doing capitally in the Indian Civil! Philip was the only one he liked.
      I&rsquo;ve heard him talk in the queerest way; he once said to me: &lsquo;My
      dear fellow, never let your poor wife know what you&rsquo;re thinking of!
      But I didn&rsquo;t follow his advice; not I! An eccentric man! He would
      say to Phil: &lsquo;Whether you live like a gentleman or not, my boy, be
      sure you die like one! and he had himself embalmed in a frock coat suit,
      with a satin cravat and a diamond pin. Oh, quite an original, I can assure
      you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Bosinney himself Baynes would speak warmly, with a certain compassion:
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a streak of his father&rsquo;s Byronism. Why, look
      at the way he threw up his chances when he left my office; going off like
      that for six months with a knapsack, and all for what?&mdash;to study
      foreign architecture&mdash;foreign! What could he expect? And there he is&mdash;a
      clever young fellow&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t make his hundred a year! Now this
      engagement is the best thing that could have happened&mdash;keep him
      steady; he&rsquo;s one of those that go to bed all day and stay up all
      night, simply because they&rsquo;ve no method; but no vice about him&mdash;not
      an ounce of vice. Old Forsyte&rsquo;s a rich man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Baynes made himself extremely pleasant to June, who frequently visited
      his house in Lowndes Square at this period.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This house of your cousin&rsquo;s&mdash;what a capital man of
      business&mdash;is the very thing for Philip,&rdquo; he would say to her;
      &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t expect to see too much of him just now, my dear
      young lady. The good cause&mdash;the good cause! The young man must make
      his way. When I was his age I was at work day and night. My dear wife used
      to say to me, &lsquo;Bobby, don&rsquo;t work too hard, think of your
      health&rsquo;. but I never spared myself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June had complained that her lover found no time to come to Stanhope Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time he came again they had not been together a quarter of an
      hour before, by one of those coincidences of which she was a mistress,
      Mrs. Septimus Small arrived. Thereon Bosinney rose and hid himself,
      according to previous arrangement, in the little study, to wait for her
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Aunt Juley, &ldquo;how thin he is! I&rsquo;ve
      often noticed it with engaged people; but you mustn&rsquo;t let it get
      worse. There&rsquo;s Barlow&rsquo;s extract of veal; it did your Uncle
      Swithin a lot of good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June, her little figure erect before the hearth, her small face quivering
      grimly, for she regarded her aunt&rsquo;s untimely visit in the light of a
      personal injury, replied with scorn:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s busy; people who can do anything
      worth doing are never fat!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley pouted; she herself had always been thin, but the only pleasure
      she derived from the fact was the opportunity of longing to be stouter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; she said mournfully, &ldquo;that you
      ought to let them call him &lsquo;The Buccaneer&rsquo;. people might think
      it odd, now that he&rsquo;s going to build a house for Soames. I do hope
      he will be careful; it&rsquo;s so important for him. Soames has such good
      taste!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taste!&rdquo; cried June, flaring up at once; &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t
      give that for his taste, or any of the family&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small was taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Uncle Swithin,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;always had beautiful
      taste! And Soames&rsquo;s little house is lovely; you don&rsquo;t mean to
      say you don&rsquo;t think so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;mph!&rdquo; said June, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s only because
      Irene&rsquo;s there!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley tried to say something pleasant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how will dear Irene like living in the country?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June gazed at her intently, with a look in her eyes as if her conscience
      had suddenly leaped up into them; it passed; and an even more intent look
      took its place, as if she had stared that conscience out of countenance.
      She replied imperiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;ll like it; why shouldn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small grew nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I thought she mightn&rsquo;t
      like to leave her friends. Your Uncle James says she doesn&rsquo;t take
      enough interest in life. We think&mdash;I mean Timothy thinks&mdash;she
      ought to go out more. I expect you&rsquo;ll miss her very much!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June clasped her hands behind her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Uncle Timothy wouldn&rsquo;t
      talk about what doesn&rsquo;t concern him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley rose to the full height of her tall figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never talks about what doesn&rsquo;t concern him,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      June was instantly compunctious; she ran to her aunt and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, auntie; but I wish they&rsquo;d let Irene
      alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley, unable to think of anything further on the subject that would
      be suitable, was silent; she prepared for departure, hooking her black
      silk cape across her chest, and, taking up her green reticule:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is your dear grandfather?&rdquo; she asked in the hall,
      &ldquo;I expect he&rsquo;s very lonely now that all your time is taken up
      with Mr. Bosinney.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She bent and kissed her niece hungrily, and with little, mincing steps
      passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears sprang up in June&rsquo;s eyes; running into the little study,
      where Bosinney was sitting at the table drawing birds on the back of an
      envelope, she sank down by his side and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Phil! it&rsquo;s all so horrid!&rdquo; Her heart was as warm as
      the colour of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following Sunday morning, while Soames was shaving, a message was
      brought him to the effect that Mr. Bosinney was below, and would be glad
      to see him. Opening the door into his wife&rsquo;s room, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosinney&rsquo;s downstairs. Just go and entertain him while I
      finish shaving. I&rsquo;ll be down in a minute. It&rsquo;s about the
      plans, I expect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene looked at him, without reply, put the finishing touch to her dress
      and went downstairs. He could not make her out about this house. She had
      said nothing against it, and, as far as Bosinney was concerned, seemed
      friendly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the window of his dressing-room he could see them talking together in
      the little court below. He hurried on with his shaving, cutting his chin
      twice. He heard them laugh, and thought to himself: &ldquo;Well, they get
      on all right, anyway!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he expected, Bosinney had come round to fetch him to look at the plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his hat and went over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plans were spread on the oak table in the architect&rsquo;s room; and
      pale, imperturbable, inquiring, Soames bent over them for a long time
      without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said at last in a puzzled voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an odd sort of house!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A rectangular house of two stories was designed in a quadrangle round a
      covered-in court. This court, encircled by a gallery on the upper floor,
      was roofed with a glass roof, supported by eight columns running up from
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed, to Forsyte eyes, an odd house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of room cut to waste,&rdquo; pursued Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney began to walk about, and Soames did not like the expression on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The principle of this house,&rdquo; said the architect, &ldquo;was
      that you should have room to breathe&mdash;like a gentleman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames extended his finger and thumb, as if measuring the extent of the
      distinction he should acquire; and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes; I see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The peculiar look came into Bosinney&rsquo;s face which marked all his
      enthusiasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to plan you a house here with some self-respect of
      its own. If you don&rsquo;t like it, you&rsquo;d better say so. It&rsquo;s
      certainly the last thing to be considered&mdash;who wants self-respect in
      a house, when you can squeeze in an extra lavatory?&rdquo; He put his
      finger suddenly down on the left division of the centre oblong: &ldquo;You
      can swing a cat here. This is for your pictures, divided from this court
      by curtains; draw them back and you&rsquo;ll have a space of fifty-one by
      twenty-three six. This double-faced stove in the centre, here, looks one
      way towards the court, one way towards the picture room; this end wall is
      all window; You&rsquo;ve a southeast light from that, a north light from
      the court. The rest of your pictures you can hang round the gallery
      upstairs, or in the other rooms.&rdquo; &ldquo;In architecture,&rdquo; he
      went on&mdash;and though looking at Soames he did not seem to see him,
      which gave Soames an unpleasant feeling&mdash;&ldquo;as in life, you&rsquo;ll
      get no self-respect without regularity. Fellows tell you that&rsquo;s old
      fashioned. It appears to be peculiar any way; it never occurs to us to
      embody the main principle of life in our buildings; we load our houses
      with decoration, gimcracks, corners, anything to distract the eye. On the
      contrary the eye should rest; get your effects with a few strong lines.
      The whole thing is regularity there&rsquo;s no self-respect without it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, the unconscious ironist, fixed his gaze on Bosinney&rsquo;s tie,
      which was far from being in the perpendicular; he was unshaven too, and
      his dress not remarkable for order. Architecture appeared to have
      exhausted his regularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it look like a barrack?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not at once receive a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see what it is,&rdquo; said Bosinney, &ldquo;you want one of
      Littlemaster&rsquo;s houses&mdash;one of the pretty and commodious sort,
      where the servants will live in garrets, and the front door be sunk so
      that you may come up again. By all means try Littlemaster, you&rsquo;ll
      find him a capital fellow, I&rsquo;ve known him all my life!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames was alarmed. He had really been struck by the plans, and the
      concealment of his satisfaction had been merely instinctive. It was
      difficult for him to pay a compliment. He despised people who were lavish
      with their praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself now in the embarrassing position of one who must pay a
      compliment or run the risk of losing a good thing. Bosinney was just the
      fellow who might tear up the plans and refuse to act for him; a kind of
      grown-up child!
    </p>
    <p>
      This grown-up childishness, to which he felt so superior, exercised a
      peculiar and almost mesmeric effect on Soames, for he had never felt
      anything like it in himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he stammered at last, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s,
      certainly original.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had such a private distrust and even dislike of the word &lsquo;original&rsquo;
      that he felt he had not really given himself away by this remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney seemed pleased. It was the sort of thing that would please a
      fellow like that! And his success encouraged Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;a big place,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Space, air, light,&rdquo; he heard Bosinney murmur, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t
      live like a gentleman in one of Littlemaster&rsquo;s&mdash;he builds for
      manufacturers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames made a deprecating movement; he had been identified with a
      gentleman; not for a good deal of money now would he be classed with
      manufacturers. But his innate distrust of general principles revived. What
      the deuce was the good of talking about regularity and self-respect? It
      looked to him as if the house would be cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Irene can&rsquo;t stand the cold!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Bosinney sarcastically. &ldquo;Your wife? She doesn&rsquo;t
      like the cold? I&rsquo;ll see to that; she shan&rsquo;t be cold. Look
      here!&rdquo; he pointed, to four marks at regular intervals on the walls
      of the court. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given you hot-water pipes in aluminium
      casings; you can get them with very good designs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked suspiciously at these marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well, all this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s
      it going to cost?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The architect took a sheet of paper from his pocket:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house, of course, should be built entirely of stone, but, as I
      thought you wouldn&rsquo;t stand that, I&rsquo;ve compromised for a
      facing. It ought to have a copper roof, but I&rsquo;ve made it green
      slate. As it is, including metal work, it&rsquo;ll cost you eight thousand
      five hundred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight thousand five hundred?&rdquo; said Soames. &ldquo;Why, I gave
      you an outside limit of eight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done for a penny less,&rdquo; replied Bosinney
      coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take it or leave it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the only way, probably, that such a proposition could have been
      made to Soames. He was nonplussed. Conscience told him to throw the whole
      thing up. But the design was good, and he knew it&mdash;there was
      completeness about it, and dignity; the servants&rsquo; apartments were
      excellent too. He would gain credit by living in a house like that&mdash;with
      such individual features, yet perfectly well-arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued poring over the plans, while Bosinney went into his bedroom
      to shave and dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two walked back to Montpellier Square in silence, Soames watching him
      out of the corner of his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Buccaneer was rather a good-looking fellow&mdash;so he thought&mdash;when
      he was properly got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene was bending over her flowers when the two men came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke of sending across the Park to fetch June.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve still got business
      to talk over!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At lunch he was almost cordial, and kept pressing Bosinney to eat. He was
      pleased to see the architect in such high spirits, and left him to spend
      the afternoon with Irene, while he stole off to his pictures, after his
      Sunday habit. At tea-time he came down to the drawing-room, and found them
      talking, as he expressed it, nineteen to the dozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unobserved in the doorway, he congratulated himself that things were
      taking the right turn. It was lucky she and Bosinney got on; she seemed to
      be falling into line with the idea of the new house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quiet meditation among his pictures had decided him to spring the five
      hundred if necessary; but he hoped that the afternoon might have softened
      Bosinney&rsquo;s estimates. It was so purely a matter which Bosinney could
      remedy if he liked; there must be a dozen ways in which he could cheapen
      the production of a house without spoiling the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awaited, therefore, his opportunity till Irene was handing the
      architect his first cup of tea. A chink of sunshine through the lace of
      the blinds warmed her cheek, shone in the gold of her hair, and in her
      soft eyes. Possibly the same gleam deepened Bosinney&rsquo;s colour, gave
      the rather startled look to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames hated sunshine, and he at once got up, to draw the blind. Then he
      took his own cup of tea from his wife, and said, more coldly than he had
      intended:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see your way to do it for eight thousand after all?
      There must be a lot of little things you could alter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney drank off his tea at a gulp, put down his cup, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames saw that his suggestion had touched some unintelligible point of
      personal vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he agreed, with sulky resignation; &ldquo;you must
      have it your own way, I suppose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Bosinney rose to go, and Soames rose too, to see him
      off the premises. The architect seemed in absurdly high spirits. After
      watching him walk away at a swinging pace, Soames returned moodily to the
      drawing-room, where Irene was putting away the music, and, moved by an
      uncontrollable spasm of curiosity, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think of &lsquo;The Buccaneer&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the carpet while waiting for her answer, and he had to wait
      some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s good-looking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene smiled. And it seemed to Soames that she was mocking him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;very.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;DEATH OF AUNT ANN
    </h2>
    <p>
      There came a morning at the end of September when Aunt Ann was unable to
      take from Smither&rsquo;s hands the insignia of personal dignity. After
      one look at the old face, the doctor, hurriedly sent for, announced that
      Miss Forsyte had passed away in her sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunts Juley and Hester were overwhelmed by the shock. They had never
      imagined such an ending. Indeed, it is doubtful whether they had ever
      realized that an ending was bound to come. Secretly they felt it
      unreasonable of Ann to have left them like this without a word, without
      even a struggle. It was unlike her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps what really affected them so profoundly was the thought that a
      Forsyte should have let go her grasp on life. If one, then why not all!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a full hour before they could make up their minds to tell Timothy.
      If only it could be kept from him! If only it could be broken to him by
      degrees!
    </p>
    <p>
      And long they stood outside his door whispering together. And when it was
      over they whispered together again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would feel it more, they were afraid, as time went on. Still, he had
      taken it better than could have been expected. He would keep his bed, of
      course!
    </p>
    <p>
      They separated, crying quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley stayed in her room, prostrated by the blow. Her face,
      discoloured by tears, was divided into compartments by the little ridges
      of pouting flesh which had swollen with emotion. It was impossible to
      conceive of life without Ann, who had lived with her for seventy-three
      years, broken only by the short interregnum of her married life, which
      seemed now so unreal. At fixed intervals she went to her drawer, and took
      from beneath the lavender bags a fresh pocket-handkerchief. Her warm heart
      could not bear the thought that Ann was lying there so cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester, the silent, the patient, that backwater of the family energy,
      sat in the drawing-room, where the blinds were drawn; and she, too, had
      wept at first, but quietly, without visible effect. Her guiding principle,
      the conservation of energy, did not abandon her in sorrow. She sat, slim,
      motionless, studying the grate, her hands idle in the lap of her black
      silk dress. They would want to rouse her into doing something, no doubt.
      As if there were any good in that! Doing something would not bring back
      Ann! Why worry her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Five o&rsquo;clock brought three of the brothers, Jolyon and James and
      Swithin; Nicholas was at Yarmouth, and Roger had a bad attack of gout.
      Mrs. Hayman had been by herself earlier in the day, and, after seeing Ann,
      had gone away, leaving a message for Timothy&mdash;which was kept from him&mdash;that
      she ought to have been told sooner. In fact, there was a feeling amongst
      them all that they ought to have been told sooner, as though they had
      missed something; and James said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew how it&rsquo;d be; I told you she wouldn&rsquo;t last
      through the summer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester made no reply; it was nearly October, but what was the good of
      arguing; some people were never satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent up to tell her sister that the brothers were there. Mrs. Small
      came down at once. She had bathed her face, which was still swollen, and
      though she looked severely at Swithin&rsquo;s trousers, for they were of
      light blue&mdash;he had come straight from the club, where the news had
      reached him&mdash;she wore a more cheerful expression than usual, the
      instinct for doing the wrong thing being even now too strong for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently all five went up to look at the body. Under the pure white sheet
      a quilted counter-pane had been placed, for now, more than ever, Aunt Ann
      had need of warmth; and, the pillows removed, her spine and head rested
      flat, with the semblance of their life-long inflexibility; the coif
      banding the top of her brow was drawn on either side to the level of the
      ears, and between it and the sheet her face, almost as white, was turned
      with closed eyes to the faces of her brothers and sisters. In its
      extraordinary peace the face was stronger than ever, nearly all bone now
      under the scarce-wrinkled parchment of skin&mdash;square jaw and chin,
      cheekbones, forehead with hollow temples, chiselled nose&mdash;the
      fortress of an unconquerable spirit that had yielded to death, and in its
      upward sightlessness seemed trying to regain that spirit, to regain the
      guardianship it had just laid down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin took but one look at the face, and left the room; the sight, he
      said afterwards, made him very queer. He went downstairs shaking the whole
      house, and, seizing his hat, clambered into his brougham, without giving
      any directions to the coachman. He was driven home, and all the evening
      sat in his chair without moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could take nothing for dinner but a partridge, with an imperial pint of
      champagne....
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon stood at the bottom of the bed, his hands folded in front of
      him. He alone of those in the room remembered the death of his mother, and
      though he looked at Ann, it was of that he was thinking. Ann was an old
      woman, but death had come to her at last&mdash;death came to all! His face
      did not move, his gaze seemed travelling from very far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester stood beside him. She did not cry now, tears were exhausted&mdash;her
      nature refused to permit a further escape of force; she twisted her hands,
      looking not at Ann, but from side to side, seeking some way of escaping
      the effort of realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the brothers and sisters James manifested the most emotion. Tears
      rolled down the parallel furrows of his thin face; where he should go now
      to tell his troubles he did not know; Juley was no good, Hester worse than
      useless! He felt Ann&rsquo;s death more than he had ever thought he
      should; this would upset him for weeks!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Aunt Hester stole out, and Aunt Juley began moving about, doing
      &lsquo;what was necessary,&rsquo; so that twice she knocked against
      something. Old Jolyon, roused from his reverie, that reverie of the long,
      long past, looked sternly at her, and went away. James alone was left by
      the bedside; glancing stealthily round, to see that he was not observed,
      he twisted his long body down, placed a kiss on the dead forehead, then
      he, too, hastily left the room. Encountering Smither in the hall, he began
      to ask her about the funeral, and, finding that she knew nothing,
      complained bitterly that, if they didn&rsquo;t take care, everything would
      go wrong. She had better send for Mr. Soames&mdash;he knew all about that
      sort of thing; her master was very much upset, he supposed&mdash;he would
      want looking after; as for her mistresses, they were no good&mdash;they
      had no gumption! They would be ill too, he shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. She had
      better send for the doctor; it was best to take things in time. He didn&rsquo;t
      think his sister Ann had had the best opinion; if she&rsquo;d had Blank
      she would have been alive now. Smither might send to Park Lane any time
      she wanted advice. Of course, his carriage was at their service for the
      funeral. He supposed she hadn&rsquo;t such a thing as a glass of claret
      and a biscuit&mdash;he had had no lunch!
    </p>
    <p>
      The days before the funeral passed quietly. It had long been known, of
      course, that Aunt Ann had left her little property to Timothy. There was,
      therefore, no reason for the slightest agitation. Soames, who was sole
      executor, took charge of all arrangements, and in due course sent out the
      following invitation to every male member of the family:
    </p>
    <p>
      To...........
    </p>
    <p>
      Your presence is requested at the funeral of Miss Ann Forsyte, in Highgate
      Cemetery, at noon of Oct. 1st. Carriages will meet at &ldquo;The Bower,&rdquo;
      Bayswater Road, at 10.45. No flowers by request. &lsquo;R.S.V.P.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning came, cold, with a high, grey, London sky, and at half-past
      ten the first carriage, that of James, drove up. It contained James and
      his son-in-law Dartie, a fine man, with a square chest, buttoned very
      tightly into a frock coat, and a sallow, fattish face adorned with dark,
      well-curled moustaches, and that incorrigible commencement of whisker
      which, eluding the strictest attempts at shaving, seems the mark of
      something deeply ingrained in the personality of the shaver, being
      especially noticeable in men who speculate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, in his capacity of executor, received the guests, for Timothy
      still kept his bed; he would get up after the funeral; and Aunts Juley and
      Hester would not be coming down till all was over, when it was understood
      there would be lunch for anyone who cared to come back. The next to arrive
      was Roger, still limping from the gout, and encircled by three of his sons&mdash;young
      Roger, Eustace, and Thomas. George, the remaining son, arrived almost
      immediately afterwards in a hansom, and paused in the hall to ask Soames
      how he found undertaking pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      They disliked each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came two Haymans&mdash;Giles and Jesse perfectly silent, and very
      well dressed, with special creases down their evening trousers. Then old
      Jolyon alone. Next, Nicholas, with a healthy colour in his face, and a
      carefully veiled sprightliness in every movement of his head and body. One
      of his sons followed him, meek and subdued. Swithin Forsyte, and Bosinney
      arrived at the same moment,&mdash;and stood&mdash;bowing precedence to
      each other,&mdash;but on the door opening they tried to enter together;
      they renewed their apologies in the hall, and, Swithin, settling his
      stock, which had become disarranged in the struggle, very slowly mounted
      the stairs. The other Hayman; two married sons of Nicholas, together with
      Tweetyman, Spender, and Warry, the husbands of married Forsyte and Hayman
      daughters. The company was then complete, twenty-one in all, not a male
      member of the family being absent but Timothy and young Jolyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the scarlet and green drawing-room, whose apparel made so vivid a
      setting for their unaccustomed costumes, each tried nervously to find a
      seat, desirous of hiding the emphatic blackness of his trousers. There
      seemed a sort of indecency in that blackness and in the colour of their
      gloves&mdash;a sort of exaggeration of the feelings; and many cast shocked
      looks of secret envy at &lsquo;the Buccaneer,&rsquo; who had no gloves,
      and was wearing grey trousers. A subdued hum of conversation rose, no one
      speaking of the departed, but each asking after the other, as though
      thereby casting an indirect libation to this event, which they had come to
      honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      And presently James said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think we ought to be starting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They went downstairs, and, two and two, as they had been told off in
      strict precedence, mounted the carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hearse started at a foot&rsquo;s pace; the carriages moved slowly
      after. In the first went old Jolyon with Nicholas; in the second, the
      twins, Swithin and James; in the third, Roger and young Roger; Soames,
      young Nicholas, George, and Bosinney followed in the fourth. Each of the
      other carriages, eight in all, held three or four of the family; behind
      them came the doctor&rsquo;s brougham; then, at a decent interval, cabs
      containing family clerks and servants; and at the very end, one containing
      nobody at all, but bringing the total cortege up to the number of
      thirteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      So long as the procession kept to the highway of the Bayswater Road, it
      retained the foot&rsquo;s-pace, but, turning into less important
      thorough-fares, it soon broke into a trot, and so proceeded, with
      intervals of walking in the more fashionable streets, until it arrived. In
      the first carriage old Jolyon and Nicholas were talking of their wills. In
      the second the twins, after a single attempt, had lapsed into complete
      silence; both were rather deaf, and the exertion of making themselves
      heard was too great. Only once James broke this silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to be looking about for some ground somewhere. What
      arrangements have you made, Swithin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Swithin, fixing him with a dreadful stare, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about such things!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third carriage a disjointed conversation was carried on in the
      intervals of looking out to see how far they had got, George remarking,
      &ldquo;Well, it was really time that the poor old lady went.&rdquo; He
      didn&rsquo;t believe in people living beyond seventy, Young Nicholas
      replied mildly that the rule didn&rsquo;t seem to apply to the Forsytes.
      George said he himself intended to commit suicide at sixty. Young
      Nicholas, smiling and stroking a long chin, didn&rsquo;t think his father
      would like that theory; he had made a lot of money since he was sixty.
      Well, seventy was the outside limit; it was then time, George said, for
      them to go and leave their money to their children. Soames, hitherto
      silent, here joined in; he had not forgotten the remark about the &lsquo;undertaking,&rsquo;
      and, lifting his eyelids almost imperceptibly, said it was all very well
      for people who never made money to talk. He himself intended to live as
      long as he could. This was a hit at George, who was notoriously hard up.
      Bosinney muttered abstractedly &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; and, George
      yawning, the conversation dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon arriving, the coffin was borne into the chapel, and, two by two, the
      mourners filed in behind it. This guard of men, all attached to the dead
      by the bond of kinship, was an impressive and singular sight in the great
      city of London, with its overwhelming diversity of life, its innumerable
      vocations, pleasures, duties, its terrible hardness, its terrible call to
      individualism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family had gathered to triumph over all this, to give a show of
      tenacious unity, to illustrate gloriously that law of property underlying
      the growth of their tree, by which it had thriven and spread, trunk and
      branches, the sap flowing through all, the full growth reached at the
      appointed time. The spirit of the old woman lying in her last sleep had
      called them to this demonstration. It was her final appeal to that unity
      which had been their strength&mdash;it was her final triumph that she had
      died while the tree was yet whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was spared the watching of the branches jut out beyond the point of
      balance. She could not look into the hearts of her followers. The same law
      that had worked in her, bringing her up from a tall, straight-backed slip
      of a girl to a woman strong and grown, from a woman grown to a woman old,
      angular, feeble, almost witchlike, with individuality all sharpened and
      sharpened, as all rounding from the world&rsquo;s contact fell off from
      her&mdash;that same law would work, was working, in the family she had
      watched like a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seen it young, and growing, she had seen it strong and grown, and
      before her old eyes had time or strength to see any more, she died. She
      would have tried, and who knows but she might have kept it young and
      strong, with her old fingers, her trembling kisses&mdash;a little longer;
      alas! not even Aunt Ann could fight with Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pride comes before a fall!&rsquo; In accordance with this, the
      greatest of Nature&rsquo;s ironies, the Forsyte family had gathered for a
      last proud pageant before they fell. Their faces to right and left, in
      single lines, were turned for the most part impassively toward the ground,
      guardians of their thoughts; but here and there, one looking upward, with
      a line between his brows, searched to see some sight on the chapel walls
      too much for him, to be listening to something that appalled. And the
      responses, low-muttered, in voices through which rose the same tone, the
      same unseizable family ring, sounded weird, as though murmured in hurried
      duplication by a single person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service in the chapel over, the mourners filed up again to guard the
      body to the tomb. The vault stood open, and, round it, men in black were
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that high and sacred field, where thousands of the upper middle class
      lay in their last sleep, the eyes of the Forsytes travelled down across
      the flocks of graves. There&mdash;spreading to the distance, lay London,
      with no sun over it, mourning the loss of its daughter, mourning with this
      family, so dear, the loss of her who was mother and guardian. A hundred
      thousand spires and houses, blurred in the great grey web of property, lay
      there like prostrate worshippers before the grave of this, the oldest
      Forsyte of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words, a sprinkle of earth, the thrusting of the coffin home, and
      Aunt Ann had passed to her last rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Round the vault, trustees of that passing, the five brothers stood, with
      white heads bowed; they would see that Ann was comfortable where she was
      going. Her little property must stay behind, but otherwise, all that could
      be should be done....
    </p>
    <p>
      Then severally, each stood aside, and putting on his hat, turned back to
      inspect the new inscription on the marble of the family vault:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ANN FORSYTE,
     THE DAUGHTER OF THE ABOVE JOLYON AND ANN FORSYTE,
     WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE THE 27TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 1886,
     AGED EIGHTY-SEVEN YEARS AND FOUR DAYS
</pre>
    <p>
      Soon perhaps, someone else would be wanting an inscription. It was strange
      and intolerable, for they had not thought somehow, that Forsytes could
      die. And one and all they had a longing to get away from this painfulness,
      this ceremony which had reminded them of things they could not bear to
      think about&mdash;to get away quickly and go about their business and
      forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was cold, too; the wind, like some slow, disintegrating force, blowing
      up the hill over the graves, struck them with its chilly breath; they
      began to split into groups, and as quickly as possible to fill the waiting
      carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin said he should go back to lunch at Timothy&rsquo;s, and he offered
      to take anybody with him in his brougham. It was considered a doubtful
      privilege to drive with Swithin in his brougham, which was not a large
      one; nobody accepted, and he went off alone. James and Roger followed
      immediately after; they also would drop in to lunch. The others gradually
      melted away, Old Jolyon taking three nephews to fill up his carriage; he
      had a want of those young faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, who had to arrange some details in the cemetery office, walked
      away with Bosinney. He had much to talk over with him, and, having
      finished his business, they strolled to Hampstead, lunched together at the
      Spaniard&rsquo;s Inn, and spent a long time in going into practical
      details connected with the building of the house; they then proceeded to
      the tram-line, and came as far as the Marble Arch, where Bosinney went off
      to Stanhope Gate to see June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames felt in excellent spirits when he arrived home, and confided to
      Irene at dinner that he had had a good talk with Bosinney, who really
      seemed a sensible fellow; they had had a capital walk too, which had done
      his liver good&mdash;he had been short of exercise for a long time&mdash;and
      altogether a very satisfactory day. If only it hadn&rsquo;t been for poor
      Aunt Ann, he would have taken her to the theatre; as it was, they must
      make the best of an evening at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Buccaneer asked after you more than once,&rdquo; he said
      suddenly. And moved by some inexplicable desire to assert his
      proprietorship, he rose from his chair and planted a kiss on his wife&rsquo;s
      shoulder.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;PROGRESS OF THE HOUSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The winter had been an open one. Things in the trade were slack; and as
      Soames had reflected before making up his mind, it had been a good time
      for building. The shell of the house at Robin Hill was thus completed by
      the end of April.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that there was something to be seen for his money, he had been coming
      down once, twice, even three times a week, and would mouse about among the
      debris for hours, careful never to soil his clothes, moving silently
      through the unfinished brickwork of doorways, or circling round the
      columns in the central court.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he would stand before them for minutes&rsquo; together, as though
      peering into the real quality of their substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On April 30 he had an appointment with Bosinney to go over the accounts,
      and five minutes before the proper time he entered the tent which the
      architect had pitched for himself close to the old oak tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accounts were already prepared on a folding table, and with a nod
      Soames sat down to study them. It was some time before he raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make them out,&rdquo; he said at last; &ldquo;they
      come to nearly seven hundred more than they ought.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a glance at Bosinney&rsquo;s face he went on quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you only make a firm stand against these builder chaps you&rsquo;ll
      get them down. They stick you with everything if you don&rsquo;t look
      sharp.... Take ten per cent. off all round. I shan&rsquo;t mind it&rsquo;s
      coming out a hundred or so over the mark!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney shook his head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken off every farthing I can!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames pushed back the table with a movement of anger, which sent the
      account sheets fluttering to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then all I can say is,&rdquo; he flustered out, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      made a pretty mess of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you a dozen times,&rdquo; Bosinney answered
      sharply, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;d be extras. I&rsquo;ve pointed them out
      to you over and over again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; growled Soames: &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have
      objected to a ten pound note here and there. How was I to know that by
      &lsquo;extras&rsquo; you meant seven hundred pounds?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The qualities of both men had contributed to this not-inconsiderable
      discrepancy. On the one hand, the architect&rsquo;s devotion to his idea,
      to the image of a house which he had created and believed in&mdash;had
      made him nervous of being stopped, or forced to the use of makeshifts; on
      the other, Soames&rsquo; not less true and wholehearted devotion to the
      very best article that could be obtained for the money, had rendered him
      averse to believing that things worth thirteen shillings could not be
      bought with twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d never undertaken your house,&rdquo; said Bosinney
      suddenly. &ldquo;You come down here worrying me out of my life. You want
      double the value for your money anybody else would, and now that you&rsquo;ve
      got a house that for its size is not to be beaten in the county, you don&rsquo;t
      want to pay for it. If you&rsquo;re anxious to be off your bargain, I
      daresay I can find the balance above the estimates myself, but I&rsquo;m d&mdash;&mdash;d
      if I do another stroke of work for you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames regained his composure. Knowing that Bosinney had no capital, he
      regarded this as a wild suggestion. He saw, too, that he would be kept
      indefinitely out of this house on which he had set his heart, and just at
      the crucial point when the architect&rsquo;s personal care made all the
      difference. In the meantime there was Irene to be thought of! She had been
      very queer lately. He really believed it was only because she had taken to
      Bosinney that she tolerated the idea of the house at all. It would not do
      to make an open breach with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t get into a rage,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m
      willing to put up with it, I suppose you needn&rsquo;t cry out. All I
      meant was that when you tell me a thing is going to cost so much, I like
      to&mdash;well, in fact, I&mdash;like to know where I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; said Bosinney, and Soames was both annoyed and
      surprised by the shrewdness of his glance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got my
      services dirt cheap. For the kind of work I&rsquo;ve put into this house,
      and the amount of time I&rsquo;ve given to it, you&rsquo;d have had to pay
      Littlemaster or some other fool four times as much. What you want, in
      fact, is a first-rate man for a fourth-rate fee, and that&rsquo;s exactly
      what you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames saw that he really meant what he said, and, angry though he was,
      the consequences of a row rose before him too vividly. He saw his house
      unfinished, his wife rebellious, himself a laughingstock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go over it,&rdquo; he said sulkily, &ldquo;and see how
      the money&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; assented Bosinney. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll hurry
      up, if you don&rsquo;t mind. I have to get back in time to take June to
      the theatre.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames cast a stealthy look at him, and said: &ldquo;Coming to our place,
      I suppose to meet her?&rdquo; He was always coming to their place!
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been rain the night before-a spring rain, and the earth smelt of
      sap and wild grasses. The warm, soft breeze swung the leaves and the
      golden buds of the old oak tree, and in the sunshine the blackbirds were
      whistling their hearts out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a spring day as breathes into a man an ineffable yearning, a
      painful sweetness, a longing that makes him stand motionless, looking at
      the leaves or grass, and fling out his arms to embrace he knows not what.
      The earth gave forth a fainting warmth, stealing up through the chilly
      garment in which winter had wrapped her. It was her long caress of
      invitation, to draw men down to lie within her arms, to roll their bodies
      on her, and put their lips to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      On just such a day as this Soames had got from Irene the promise he had
      asked her for so often. Seated on the fallen trunk of a tree, he had
      promised for the twentieth time that if their marriage were not a success,
      she should be as free as if she had never married him!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you swear it?&rdquo; she had said. A few days back she had
      reminded him of that oath. He had answered: &ldquo;Nonsense! I couldn&rsquo;t
      have sworn any such thing!&rdquo; By some awkward fatality he remembered
      it now. What queer things men would swear for the sake of women! He would
      have sworn it at any time to gain her! He would swear it now, if thereby
      he could touch her&mdash;but nobody could touch her, she was cold-hearted!
    </p>
    <p>
      And memories crowded on him with the fresh, sweet savour of the spring
      wind-memories of his courtship.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring of the year 1881 he was visiting his old school-fellow and
      client, George Liversedge, of Branksome, who, with the view of developing
      his pine-woods in the neighbourhood of Bournemouth, had placed the
      formation of the company necessary to the scheme in Soames&rsquo;s hands.
      Mrs. Liversedge, with a sense of the fitness of things, had given a
      musical tea in his honour. Later in the course of this function, which
      Soames, no musician, had regarded as an unmitigated bore, his eye had been
      caught by the face of a girl dressed in mourning, standing by herself. The
      lines of her tall, as yet rather thin figure, showed through the wispy,
      clinging stuff of her black dress, her black-gloved hands were crossed in
      front of her, her lips slightly parted, and her large, dark eyes wandered
      from face to face. Her hair, done low on her neck, seemed to gleam above
      her black collar like coils of shining metal. And as Soames stood looking
      at her, the sensation that most men have felt at one time or another went
      stealing through him&mdash;a peculiar satisfaction of the senses, a
      peculiar certainty, which novelists and old ladies call love at first
      sight. Still stealthily watching her, he at once made his way to his
      hostess, and stood doggedly waiting for the music to cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that girl with yellow hair and dark eyes?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&mdash;oh! Irene Heron. Her father, Professor Heron, died this
      year. She lives with her stepmother. She&rsquo;s a nice girl, a pretty
      girl, but no money!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Introduce me, please,&rdquo; said Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very little that he found to say, nor did he find her responsive to
      that little. But he went away with the resolution to see her again. He
      effected his object by chance, meeting her on the pier with her
      stepmother, who had the habit of walking there from twelve to one of a
      forenoon. Soames made this lady&rsquo;s acquaintance with alacrity, nor
      was it long before he perceived in her the ally he was looking for. His
      keen scent for the commercial side of family life soon told him that Irene
      cost her stepmother more than the fifty pounds a year she brought her; it
      also told him that Mrs. Heron, a woman yet in the prime of life, desired
      to be married again. The strange ripening beauty of her stepdaughter stood
      in the way of this desirable consummation. And Soames, in his stealthy
      tenacity, laid his plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Bournemouth without having given himself away, but in a month&rsquo;s
      time came back, and this time he spoke, not to the girl, but to her
      stepmother. He had made up his mind, he said; he would wait any time. And
      he had long to wait, watching Irene bloom, the lines of her young figure
      softening, the stronger blood deepening the gleam of her eyes, and warming
      her face to a creamy glow; and at each visit he proposed to her, and when
      that visit was at an end, took her refusal away with him, back to London,
      sore at heart, but steadfast and silent as the grave. He tried to come at
      the secret springs of her resistance; only once had he a gleam of light.
      It was at one of those assembly dances, which afford the only outlet to
      the passions of the population of seaside watering-places. He was sitting
      with her in an embrasure, his senses tingling with the contact of the
      waltz. She had looked at him over her, slowly waving fan; and he had lost
      his head. Seizing that moving wrist, he pressed his lips to the flesh of
      her arm. And she had shuddered&mdash;to this day he had not forgotten that
      shudder&mdash;nor the look so passionately averse she had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year after that she had yielded. What had made her yield he could never
      make out; and from Mrs. Heron, a woman of some diplomatic talent, he
      learnt nothing. Once after they were married he asked her, &ldquo;What
      made you refuse me so often?&rdquo; She had answered by a strange silence.
      An enigma to him from the day that he first saw her, she was an enigma to
      him still....
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney was waiting for him at the door; and on his rugged, good-looking,
      face was a queer, yearning, yet happy look, as though he too saw a promise
      of bliss in the spring sky, sniffed a coming happiness in the spring air.
      Soames looked at him waiting there. What was the matter with the fellow
      that he looked so happy? What was he waiting for with that smile on his
      lips and in his eyes? Soames could not see that for which Bosinney was
      waiting as he stood there drinking in the flower-scented wind. And once
      more he felt baffled in the presence of this man whom by habit he
      despised. He hastened on to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only colour for those tiles,&rdquo; he heard Bosinney say,&mdash;&ldquo;is
      ruby with a grey tint in the stuff, to give a transparent effect. I should
      like Irene&rsquo;s opinion. I&rsquo;m ordering the purple leather curtains
      for the doorway of this court; and if you distemper the drawing-room ivory
      cream over paper, you&rsquo;ll get an illusive look. You want to aim all
      through the decorations at what I call charm.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames said: &ldquo;You mean that my wife has charm!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney evaded the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have a clump of iris plants in the centre of that court.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled superciliously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look into Beech&rsquo;s some time,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;and see what&rsquo;s appropriate!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They found little else to say to each other, but on the way to the Station
      Soames asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you find Irene very artistic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The abrupt answer was as distinct a snub as saying:
      &ldquo;If you want to discuss her you can do it with someone else!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the slow, sulky anger Soames had felt all the afternoon burned the
      brighter within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke again till they were close to the Station, then Soames
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you expect to have finished?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the end of June, if you really wish me to decorate as well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded. &ldquo;But you quite understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
      the house is costing me a lot beyond what I contemplated. I may as well
      tell you that I should have thrown it up, only I&rsquo;m not in the habit
      of giving up what I&rsquo;ve set my mind on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney made no reply. And Soames gave him askance a look of dogged
      dislike&mdash;for in spite of his fastidious air and that supercilious,
      dandified taciturnity, Soames, with his set lips and squared chin, was not
      unlike a bulldog....
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at seven o&rsquo;clock that evening, June arrived at 62, Montpellier
      Square, the maid Bilson told her that Mr. Bosinney was in the
      drawing-room; the mistress&mdash;she said&mdash;was dressing, and would be
      down in a minute. She would tell her that Miss June was here.
    </p>
    <p>
      June stopped her at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Bilson,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just go in.
      You, needn&rsquo;t hurry Mrs. Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She took off her cloak, and Bilson, with an understanding look, did not
      even open the drawing-room door for her, but ran downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      June paused for a moment to look at herself in the little old-fashioned
      silver mirror above the oaken rug chest&mdash;a slim, imperious young
      figure, with a small resolute face, in a white frock, cut moon-shaped at
      the base of a neck too slender for her crown of twisted red-gold hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the drawing-room door softly, meaning to take him by surprise.
      The room was filled with a sweet hot scent of flowering azaleas.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a long breath of the perfume, and heard Bosinney&rsquo;s voice,
      not in the room, but quite close, saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! there were such heaps of things I wanted to talk about, and now
      we shan&rsquo;t have time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s voice answered: &ldquo;Why not at dinner?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can one talk....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June&rsquo;s first thought was to go away, but instead she crossed to the
      long window opening on the little court. It was from there that the scent
      of the azaleas came, and, standing with their backs to her, their faces
      buried in the golden-pink blossoms, stood her lover and Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent but unashamed, with flaming cheeks and angry eyes, the girl
      watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on Sunday by yourself&mdash;We can go over the house together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June saw Irene look up at him through her screen of blossoms. It was not
      the look of a coquette, but&mdash;far worse to the watching girl&mdash;of
      a woman fearful lest that look should say too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve promised to go for a drive with Uncle....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The big one! Make him bring you; it&rsquo;s only ten miles&mdash;the
      very thing for his horses.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Uncle Swithin!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of the azalea scent drifted into June&rsquo;s face; she felt sick
      and dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do! ah! do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see you there&mdash;I thought you&rsquo;d like to help
      me....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer seemed to the girl to come softly with a tremble from amongst
      the blossoms: &ldquo;So I do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And she stepped into the open space of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stuffy it is here!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear
      this scent!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, so angry and direct, swept both their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you talking about the house? I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet, you
      know&mdash;shall we all go on Sunday?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From Irene&rsquo;s face the colour had flown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going for a drive that day with Uncle Swithin,&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Swithin! What does he matter? You can throw him over!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the habit of throwing people over!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of footsteps and June saw Soames standing just behind
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! if you are all ready,&rdquo; said Irene, looking from one to
      the other with a strange smile, &ldquo;dinner is too!&rdquo;
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;JUNE&rsquo;S TREAT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Dinner began in silence; the women facing one another, and the men.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In silence the soup was finished&mdash;excellent, if a little thick; and
      fish was brought. In silence it was handed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney ventured: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first spring day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene echoed softly: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;the first spring day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spring!&rdquo; said June: &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t a breath of air!&rdquo;
      No one replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fish was taken away, a fine fresh sole from Dover. And Bilson brought
      champagne, a bottle swathed around the neck with white....
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it dry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Cutlets were handed, each pink-frilled about the legs. They were refused
      by June, and silence fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take a cutlet, June; there&rsquo;s
      nothing coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But June again refused, so they were borne away. And then Irene asked:
      &ldquo;Phil, have you heard my blackbird?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney answered: &ldquo;Rather&mdash;he&rsquo;s got a hunting-song. As I
      came round I heard him in the Square.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a darling!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Salad, sir?&rdquo; Spring chicken was removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Soames was speaking: &ldquo;The asparagus is very poor. Bosinney,
      glass of sherry with your sweet? June, you&rsquo;re drinking nothing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June said: &ldquo;You know I never do. Wine&rsquo;s such horrid stuff!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An apple charlotte came upon a silver dish, and smilingly Irene said:
      &ldquo;The azaleas are so wonderful this year!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Bosinney murmured: &ldquo;Wonderful! The scent&rsquo;s
      extraordinary!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June said: &ldquo;How can you like the scent? Sugar, please, Bilson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sugar was handed her, and Soames remarked: &ldquo;This charlottes good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The charlotte was removed. Long silence followed. Irene, beckoning, said:
      &ldquo;Take out the azalea, Bilson. Miss June can&rsquo;t bear the scent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; let it stay,&rdquo; said June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olives from France, with Russian caviare, were placed on little plates.
      And Soames remarked: &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we have the Spanish?&rdquo;
      But no one answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The olives were removed. Lifting her tumbler June demanded: &ldquo;Give me
      some water, please.&rdquo; Water was given her. A silver tray was brought,
      with German plums. There was a lengthy pause. In perfect harmony all were
      eating them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney counted up the stones: &ldquo;This year&mdash;next year&mdash;some
      time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene finished softly: &ldquo;Never! There was such a glorious sunset. The
      sky&rsquo;s all ruby still&mdash;so beautiful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered: &ldquo;Underneath the dark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes had met, and June cried scornfully: &ldquo;A London sunset!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Egyptian cigarettes were handed in a silver box. Soames, taking one,
      remarked: &ldquo;What time&rsquo;s your play begin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No one replied, and Turkish coffee followed in enamelled cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene, smiling quietly, said: &ldquo;If only....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what?&rdquo; said June.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only it could always be the spring!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Brandy was handed; it was pale and old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames said: &ldquo;Bosinney, better take some brandy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney took a glass; they all arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want a cab?&rdquo; asked Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      June answered: &ldquo;No! My cloaks please, Bilson.&rdquo; Her cloak was
      brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene, from the window, murmured: &ldquo;Such a lovely night! The stars
      are coming out!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames added: &ldquo;Well, I hope you&rsquo;ll both enjoy yourselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From the door June answered: &ldquo;Thanks. Come, Phil.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney cried: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled a sneering smile, and said: &ldquo;I wish you luck!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the door Irene watched them go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney called: &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; she answered softly....
    </p>
    <p>
      June made her lover take her on the top of a &lsquo;bus, saying she wanted
      air, and there sat silent, with her face to the breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver turned once or twice, with the intention of venturing a remark,
      but thought better of it. They were a lively couple! The spring had got
      into his blood, too; he felt the need for letting steam escape, and
      clucked his tongue, flourishing his whip, wheeling his horses, and even
      they, poor things, had smelled the spring, and for a brief half-hour
      spurned the pavement with happy hoofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole town was alive; the boughs, curled upward with their decking of
      young leaves, awaited some gift the breeze could bring. New-lighted lamps
      were gaining mastery, and the faces of the crowd showed pale under that
      glare, while on high the great white clouds slid swiftly, softly, over the
      purple sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men in, evening dress had thrown back overcoats, stepping jauntily up the
      steps of Clubs; working folk loitered; and women&mdash;those women who at
      that time of night are solitary&mdash;solitary and moving eastward in a
      stream&mdash;swung slowly along, with expectation in their gait, dreaming
      of good wine and a good supper, or&mdash;for an unwonted minute, of kisses
      given for love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those countless figures, going their ways under the lamps and the
      moving-sky, had one and all received some restless blessing from the stir
      of spring. And one and all, like those clubmen with their opened coats,
      had shed something of caste, and creed, and custom, and by the cock of
      their hats, the pace of their walk, their laughter, or their silence,
      revealed their common kinship under the passionate heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney and June entered the theatre in silence, and mounted to their
      seats in the upper boxes. The piece had just begun, and the half-darkened
      house, with its rows of creatures peering all one way, resembled a great
      garden of flowers turning their faces to the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      June had never before been in the upper boxes. From the age of fifteen she
      had habitually accompanied her grandfather to the stalls, and not common
      stalls, but the best seats in the house, towards the centre of the third
      row, booked by old Jolyon, at Grogan and Boyne&rsquo;s, on his way home
      from the City, long before the day; carried in his overcoat pocket,
      together with his cigar-case and his old kid gloves, and handed to June to
      keep till the appointed night. And in those stalls&mdash;an erect old
      figure with a serene white head, a little figure, strenuous and eager,
      with a red-gold head&mdash;they would sit through every kind of play, and
      on the way home old Jolyon would say of the principal actor: &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s
      a poor stick! You should have seen little Bobson!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had looked forward to this evening with keen delight; it was stolen,
      chaperone-less, undreamed of at Stanhope Gate, where she was supposed to
      be at Soames&rsquo;. She had expected reward for her subterfuge, planned
      for her lover&rsquo;s sake; she had expected it to break up the thick,
      chilly cloud, and make the relations between them which of late had been
      so puzzling, so tormenting&mdash;sunny and simple again as they had been
      before the winter. She had come with the intention of saying something
      definite; and she looked at the stage with a furrow between her brows,
      seeing nothing, her hands squeezed together in her lap. A swarm of jealous
      suspicions stung and stung her.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Bosinney was conscious of her trouble he made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain dropped. The first act had come to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully hot here!&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;I should
      like to go out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very white, and she knew&mdash;for with her nerves thus sharpened
      she saw everything&mdash;that he was both uneasy and compunctious.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of the theatre an open balcony hung over the street; she took
      possession of this, and stood leaning there without a word, waiting for
      him to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she could bear it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say something to you, Phil,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The defensive tone of his voice brought the colour flying to her cheek,
      the words flying to her lips: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t give me a chance to
      be nice to you; you haven&rsquo;t for ages now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney stared down at the street. He made no answer....
    </p>
    <p>
      June cried passionately: &ldquo;You know I want to do everything for you&mdash;that
      I want to be everything to you....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A hum rose from the street, and, piercing it with a sharp &lsquo;ping,&rsquo;
      the bell sounded for the raising of the curtain. June did not stir. A
      desperate struggle was going on within her. Should she put everything to
      the proof? Should she challenge directly that influence, that attraction
      which was driving him away from her? It was her nature to challenge, and
      she said: &ldquo;Phil, take me to see the house on Sunday!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a smile quivering and breaking on her lips, and trying, how hard, not
      to show that she was watching, she searched his face, saw it waver and
      hesitate, saw a troubled line come between his brows, the blood rush into
      his face. He answered: &ldquo;Not Sunday, dear; some other day!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not Sunday? I shouldn&rsquo;t be in the way on Sunday.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made an evident effort, and said: &ldquo;I have an engagement.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to take....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes grew angry; he shrugged his shoulders, and answered: &ldquo;An
      engagement that will prevent my taking you to see the house!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June bit her lip till the blood came, and walked back to her seat without
      another word, but she could not help the tears of rage rolling down her
      face. The house had been mercifully darkened for a crisis, and no one
      could see her trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in this world of Forsytes let no man think himself immune from
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the third row behind, Euphemia, Nicholas&rsquo;s youngest daughter,
      with her married-sister, Mrs. Tweetyman, were watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reported at Timothy&rsquo;s, how they had seen June and her fiance at
      the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the stalls?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, not in the....&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh!
      in the dress circle, of course. That seemed to be quite fashionable
      nowadays with young people!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well&mdash;not exactly. In the.... Anyway, that engagement wouldn&rsquo;t
      last long. They had never seen anyone look so thunder and lightningy as
      that little June! With tears of enjoyment in their eyes, they related how
      she had kicked a man&rsquo;s hat as she returned to her seat in the middle
      of an act, and how the man had looked. Euphemia had a noted, silent laugh,
      terminating most disappointingly in squeaks; and when Mrs. Small, holding
      up her hands, said: &ldquo;My dear! Kicked a ha-at?&rdquo; she let out
      such a number of these that she had to be recovered with smelling-salts.
      As she went away she said to Mrs. Tweetyman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kicked a&mdash;ha-at! Oh! I shall die.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For &lsquo;that little June&rsquo; this evening, that was to have been
      &lsquo;her treat,&rsquo; was the most miserable she had ever spent. God
      knows she tried to stifle her pride, her suspicion, her jealousy!
    </p>
    <p>
      She parted from Bosinney at old Jolyon&rsquo;s door without breaking down;
      the feeling that her lover must be conquered was strong enough to sustain
      her till his retiring footsteps brought home the true extent of her
      wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noiseless &lsquo;Sankey&rsquo; let her in. She would have slipped up
      to her own room, but old Jolyon, who had heard her entrance, was in the
      dining-room doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in and have your milk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been
      kept hot for you. You&rsquo;re very late. Where have you been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June stood at the fireplace, with a foot on the fender and an arm on the
      mantelpiece, as her grandfather had done when he came in that night of the
      opera. She was too near a breakdown to care what she told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We dined at Soames&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! the man of property! His wife there and Bosinney?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon&rsquo;s glance was fixed on her with the penetrating gaze from
      which it was difficult to hide; but she was not looking at him, and when
      she turned her face, he dropped his scrutiny at once. He had seen enough,
      and too much. He bent down to lift the cup of milk for her from the
      hearth, and, turning away, grumbled: &ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to stay out
      so late; it makes you fit for nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was invisible now behind his paper, which he turned with a vicious
      crackle; but when June came up to kiss him, he said: &ldquo;Good-night, my
      darling,&rdquo; in a tone so tremulous and unexpected, that it was all the
      girl could do to get out of the room without breaking into the fit of
      sobbing which lasted her well on into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door was closed, old Jolyon dropped his paper, and stared long
      and anxiously in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The beggar!&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;I always knew she&rsquo;d
      have trouble with him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Uneasy doubts and suspicions, the more poignant that he felt himself
      powerless to check or control the march of events, came crowding upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the fellow going to jilt her? He longed to go and say to him: &ldquo;Look
      here, you sir! Are you going to jilt my grand-daughter?&rdquo; But how
      could he? Knowing little or nothing, he was yet certain, with his unerring
      astuteness, that there was something going on. He suspected Bosinney of
      being too much at Montpellier Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This fellow,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;may not be a scamp; his face
      is not a bad one, but he&rsquo;s a queer fish. I don&rsquo;t know what to
      make of him. I shall never know what to make of him! They tell me he works
      like a nigger, but I see no good coming of it. He&rsquo;s unpractical, he
      has no method. When he comes here, he sits as glum as a monkey. If I ask
      him what wine he&rsquo;ll have, he says: &ldquo;Thanks, any wine.&rdquo;
      If I offer him a cigar, he smokes it as if it were a twopenny German
      thing. I never see him looking at June as he ought to look at her; and
      yet, he&rsquo;s not after her money. If she were to make a sign, he&rsquo;d
      be off his bargain to-morrow. But she won&rsquo;t&mdash;not she! She&rsquo;ll
      stick to him! She&rsquo;s as obstinate as fate&mdash;She&rsquo;ll never
      let go!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sighing deeply, he turned the paper; in its columns, perchance he might
      find consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And upstairs in her room June sat at her open window, where the spring
      wind came, after its revel across the Park, to cool her hot cheeks and
      burn her heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;DRIVE WITH SWITHIN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two lines of a certain song in a certain famous old school&rsquo;s
      songbook run as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How the buttons on his blue frock shone, tra-la-la! How he carolled
      and he sang, like a bird!...&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin did not exactly carol and sing like a bird, but he felt almost
      like endeavouring to hum a tune, as he stepped out of Hyde Park Mansions,
      and contemplated his horses drawn up before the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was as balmy as a day in June, and to complete the simile of
      the old song, he had put on a blue frock-coat, dispensing with an
      overcoat, after sending Adolf down three times to make sure that there was
      not the least suspicion of east in the wind; and the frock-coat was
      buttoned so tightly around his personable form, that, if the buttons did
      not shine, they might pardonably have done so. Majestic on the pavement he
      fitted on a pair of dog-skin gloves; with his large bell-shaped top hat,
      and his great stature and bulk he looked too primeval for a Forsyte. His
      thick white hair, on which Adolf had bestowed a touch of pomatum, exhaled
      the fragrance of opoponax and cigars&mdash;the celebrated Swithin brand,
      for which he paid one hundred and forty shillings the hundred, and of
      which old Jolyon had unkindly said, he wouldn&rsquo;t smoke them as a
      gift; they wanted the stomach of a horse!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adolf!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sare!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The new plaid rug!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He would never teach that fellow to look smart; and Mrs. Soames he felt
      sure, had an eye!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The phaeton hood down; I am going&mdash;to&mdash;drive&mdash;a&mdash;lady!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretty woman would want to show off her frock; and well&mdash;he was
      going to drive a lady! It was like a new beginning to the good old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ages since he had driven a woman! The last time, if he remembered, it had
      been Juley; the poor old soul had been as nervous as a cat the whole time,
      and so put him out of patience that, as he dropped her in the Bayswater
      Road, he had said: &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m d&mdash;-d if I ever drive you
      again!&rdquo; And he never had, not he!
    </p>
    <p>
      Going up to his horses&rsquo; heads, he examined their bits; not that he
      knew anything about bits&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t pay his coachman sixty
      pounds a year to do his work for him, that had never been his principle.
      Indeed, his reputation as a horsey man rested mainly on the fact that
      once, on Derby Day, he had been welshed by some thimble-riggers. But
      someone at the Club, after seeing him drive his greys up to the door&mdash;he
      always drove grey horses, you got more style for the money, some thought&mdash;had
      called him &lsquo;Four-in-hand Forsyte.&rsquo; The name having reached his
      ears through that fellow Nicholas Treffry, old Jolyon&rsquo;s dead
      partner, the great driving man notorious for more carriage accidents than
      any man in the kingdom&mdash;Swithin had ever after conceived it right to
      act up to it. The name had taken his fancy, not because he had ever driven
      four-in-hand, or was ever likely to, but because of something
      distinguished in the sound. Four-in-hand Forsyte! Not bad! Born too soon,
      Swithin had missed his vocation. Coming upon London twenty years later, he
      could not have failed to have become a stockbroker, but at the time when
      he was obliged to select, this great profession had not as yet became the
      chief glory of the upper-middle class. He had literally been forced into
      land agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in the driving seat, with the reins handed to him, and blinking over
      his pale old cheeks in the full sunlight, he took a slow look round&mdash;Adolf
      was already up behind; the cockaded groom at the horses&rsquo; heads stood
      ready to let go; everything was prepared for the signal, and Swithin gave
      it. The equipage dashed forward, and before you could say Jack Robinson,
      with a rattle and flourish drew up at Soames&rsquo; door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene came out at once, and stepped in&mdash;he afterward described it at
      Timothy&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;as light as&mdash;er&mdash;Taglioni, no fuss
      about it, no wanting this or wanting that;&rdquo; and above all, Swithin
      dwelt on this, staring at Mrs. Septimus in a way that disconcerted her a
      good deal, &ldquo;no silly nervousness!&rdquo; To Aunt Hester he portrayed
      Irene&rsquo;s hat. &ldquo;Not one of your great flopping things, sprawling
      about, and catching the dust, that women are so fond of nowadays, but a
      neat little&mdash;&rdquo; he made a circular motion of his hand, &ldquo;white
      veil&mdash;capital taste.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it made of?&rdquo; inquired Aunt Hester, who manifested a
      languid but permanent excitement at any mention of dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Made of?&rdquo; returned Swithin; &ldquo;now how should I know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank into silence so profound that Aunt Hester began to be afraid he
      had fallen into a trance. She did not try to rouse him herself, it not
      being her custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish somebody would come,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
      like the look of him!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly Swithin returned to life. &ldquo;Made of&rdquo; he wheezed
      out slowly, &ldquo;what should it be made of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not gone four miles before Swithin received the impression that
      Irene liked driving with him. Her face was so soft behind that white veil,
      and her dark eyes shone so in the spring light, and whenever he spoke she
      raised them to him and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday morning Soames had found her at her writing-table with a note
      written to Swithin, putting him off. Why did she want to put him off? he
      asked. She might put her own people off when she liked, he would not have
      her putting off his people!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had looked at him intently, had torn up the note, and said: &ldquo;Very
      well!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she began writing another. He took a casual glance presently, and
      saw that it was addressed to Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you writing to him about?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene, looking at him again with that intent look, said quietly: &ldquo;Something
      he wanted me to do for him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Soames,&mdash;&ldquo;Commissions!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your work cut out if you begin that sort of
      thing!&rdquo; He said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin opened his eyes at the mention of Robin Hill; it was a long way
      for his horses, and he always dined at half-past seven, before the rush at
      the Club began; the new chef took more trouble with an early dinner&mdash;a
      lazy rascal!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would like to have a look at the house, however. A house appealed to
      any Forsyte, and especially to one who had been an auctioneer. After all
      he said the distance was nothing. When he was a younger man he had had
      rooms at Richmond for many years, kept his carriage and pair there, and
      drove them up and down to business every day of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four-in-hand Forsyte they called him! His T-cart, his horses had been
      known from Hyde Park Corner to the Star and Garter. The Duke of Z....
      wanted to get hold of them, would have given him double the money, but he
      had kept them; know a good thing when you have it, eh? A look of solemn
      pride came portentously on his shaven square old face, he rolled his head
      in his stand-up collar, like a turkey-cock preening himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was really&mdash;a charming woman! He enlarged upon her frock
      afterwards to Aunt Juley, who held up her hands at his way of putting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fitted her like a skin&mdash;tight as a drum; that was how he liked
      &lsquo;em, all of a piece, none of your daverdy, scarecrow women! He gazed
      at Mrs. Septimus Small, who took after James&mdash;long and thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s style about her,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;fit for a
      king! And she&rsquo;s so quiet with it too!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She seems to have made quite a conquest of you, any way,&rdquo;
      drawled Aunt Hester from her corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin heard extremely well when anybody attacked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know a&mdash;pretty&mdash;woman
      when I see one, and all I can say is, I don&rsquo;t see the young man
      about that&rsquo;s fit for her; but perhaps&mdash;you&mdash;do, come,
      perhaps&mdash;you-do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; murmured Aunt Hester, &ldquo;ask Juley!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before they reached Robin Hill, however, the unaccustomed airing had
      made him terribly sleepy; he drove with his eyes closed, a life-time of
      deportment alone keeping his tall and bulky form from falling askew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney, who was watching, came out to meet them, and all three entered
      the house together; Swithin in front making play with a stout gold-mounted
      Malacca cane, put into his hand by Adolf, for his knees were feeling the
      effects of their long stay in the same position. He had assumed his fur
      coat, to guard against the draughts of the unfinished house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staircase&mdash;he said&mdash;was handsome! the baronial style! They
      would want some statuary about! He came to a standstill between the
      columns of the doorway into the inner court, and held out his cane
      inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was this to be&mdash;this vestibule, or whatever they called it? But
      gazing at the skylight, inspiration came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the billiard-room!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When told it was to be a tiled court with plants in the centre, he turned
      to Irene:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waste this on plants? You take my advice and have a billiard table
      here!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene smiled. She had lifted her veil, banding it like a nun&rsquo;s coif
      across her forehead, and the smile of her dark eyes below this seemed to
      Swithin more charming than ever. He nodded. She would take his advice he
      saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had little to say of the drawing or dining-rooms, which he described as
      &ldquo;spacious&rdquo;; but fell into such raptures as he permitted to a
      man of his dignity, in the wine-cellar, to which he descended by stone
      steps, Bosinney going first with a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have room here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for six or
      seven hundred dozen&mdash;a very pooty little cellar!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney having expressed the wish to show them the house from the copse
      below, Swithin came to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fine view from here,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;you
      haven&rsquo;t such a thing as a chair?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A chair was brought him from Bosinney&rsquo;s tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go down,&rdquo; he said blandly; &ldquo;you two! I&rsquo;ll sit
      here and look at the view.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down by the oak tree, in the sun; square and upright, with one hand
      stretched out, resting on the nob of his cane, the other planted on his
      knee; his fur coat thrown open, his hat, roofing with its flat top the
      pale square of his face; his stare, very blank, fixed on the landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded to them as they went off down through the fields. He was,
      indeed, not sorry to be left thus for a quiet moment of reflection. The
      air was balmy, not too much heat in the sun; the prospect a fine one, a
      remarka.... His head fell a little to one side; he jerked it up and
      thought: Odd! He&mdash;ah! They were waving to him from the bottom! He put
      up his hand, and moved it more than once. They were active&mdash;the
      prospect was remar.... His head fell to the left, he jerked it up at once;
      it fell to the right. It remained there; he was asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      And asleep, a sentinel on the&mdash;top of the rise, he appeared to rule
      over this prospect&mdash;remarkable&mdash;like some image blocked out by
      the special artist, of primeval Forsytes in pagan days, to record the
      domination of mind over matter!
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the unnumbered generations of his yeoman ancestors, wont of a
      Sunday to stand akimbo surveying their little plots of land, their grey
      unmoving eyes hiding their instinct with its hidden roots of violence,
      their instinct for possession to the exclusion of all the world&mdash;all
      these unnumbered generations seemed to sit there with him on the top of
      the rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But from him, thus slumbering, his jealous Forsyte spirit travelled far,
      into God-knows-what jungle of fancies; with those two young people, to see
      what they were doing down there in the copse&mdash;in the copse where the
      spring was running riot with the scent of sap and bursting buds, the song
      of birds innumerable, a carpet of bluebells and sweet growing things, and
      the sun caught like gold in the tops of the trees; to see what they were
      doing, walking along there so close together on the path that was too
      narrow; walking along there so close that they were always touching; to
      watch Irene&rsquo;s eyes, like dark thieves, stealing the heart out of the
      spring. And a great unseen chaperon, his spirit was there, stopping with
      them to look at the little furry corpse of a mole, not dead an hour, with
      his mushroom-and-silver coat untouched by the rain or dew; watching over
      Irene&rsquo;s bent head, and the soft look of her pitying eyes; and over
      that young man&rsquo;s head, gazing at her so hard, so strangely. Walking
      on with them, too, across the open space where a wood-cutter had been at
      work, where the bluebells were trampled down, and a trunk had swayed and
      staggered down from its gashed stump. Climbing it with them, over, and on
      to the very edge of the copse, whence there stretched an undiscovered
      country, from far away in which came the sounds, &lsquo;Cuckoo-cuckoo!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent, standing with them there, and uneasy at their silence! Very queer,
      very strange!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then back again, as though guilty, through the wood&mdash;back to the
      cutting, still silent, amongst the songs of birds that never ceased, and
      the wild scent&mdash;hum! what was it&mdash;like that herb they put in&mdash;back
      to the log across the path....
    </p>
    <p>
      And then unseen, uneasy, flapping above them, trying to make noises, his
      Forsyte spirit watched her balanced on the log, her pretty figure swaying,
      smiling down at that young man gazing up with such strange, shining eyes,
      slipping now&mdash;a&mdash;ah! falling, o&mdash;oh! sliding&mdash;down his
      breast; her soft, warm body clutched, her head bent back from his lips;
      his kiss; her recoil; his cry: &ldquo;You must know&mdash;I love you!&rdquo;
      Must know&mdash;indeed, a pretty...? Love! Hah!
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin awoke; virtue had gone out of him. He had a taste in his mouth.
      Where was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Damme! He had been asleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had dreamed something about a new soup, with a taste of mint in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those young people&mdash;where had they got to? His left leg had pins and
      needles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adolf!&rdquo; The rascal was not there; the rascal was asleep
      somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, tall, square, bulky in his fur, looking anxiously down over
      the fields, and presently he saw them coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene was in front; that young fellow&mdash;what had they nicknamed him&mdash;&rsquo;The
      Buccaneer?&rsquo; looked precious hangdog there behind her; had got a flea
      in his ear, he shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Serve him right, taking her down
      all that way to look at the house! The proper place to look at a house
      from was the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw him. He extended his arm, and moved it spasmodically to encourage
      them. But they had stopped. What were they standing there for, talking&mdash;talking?
      They came on again. She had been, giving him a rub, he had not the least
      doubt of it, and no wonder, over a house like that&mdash;a great ugly
      thing, not the sort of house he was accustomed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked intently at their faces, with his pale, immovable stare. That
      young man looked very queer!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never make anything of this!&rdquo; he said tartly,
      pointing at the mansion;&mdash;&ldquo;too newfangled!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney gazed at him as though he had not heard; and Swithin afterwards
      described him to Aunt Hester as &ldquo;an extravagant sort of fellow very
      odd way of looking at you&mdash;a bumpy beggar!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What gave rise to this sudden piece of psychology he did not state;
      possibly Bosinney&rsquo;s, prominent forehead and cheekbones and chin, or
      something hungry in his face, which quarrelled with Swithin&rsquo;s
      conception of the calm satiety that should characterize the perfect
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brightened up at the mention of tea. He had a contempt for tea&mdash;his
      brother Jolyon had been in tea; made a lot of money by it&mdash;but he was
      so thirsty, and had such a taste in his mouth, that he was prepared to
      drink anything. He longed to inform Irene of the taste in his mouth&mdash;she
      was so sympathetic&mdash;but it would not be a distinguished thing to do;
      he rolled his tongue round, and faintly smacked it against his palate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a far corner of the tent Adolf was bending his cat-like moustaches over
      a kettle. He left it at once to draw the cork of a pint-bottle of
      champagne. Swithin smiled, and, nodding at Bosinney, said: &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re
      quite a Monte Cristo!&rdquo; This celebrated novel&mdash;one of the
      half-dozen he had read&mdash;had produced an extraordinary impression on
      his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking his glass from the table, he held it away from him to scrutinize
      the colour; thirsty as he was, it was not likely that he was going to
      drink trash! Then, placing it to his lips, he took a sip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very nice wine,&rdquo; he said at last, passing it before his
      nose; &ldquo;not the equal of my Heidsieck!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that the idea came to him which he afterwards
      imparted at Timothy&rsquo;s in this nutshell: &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder a bit if that architect chap were sweet upon Mrs. Soames!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And from this moment his pale, round eyes never ceased to bulge with the
      interest of his discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow,&rdquo; he said to Mrs. Septimus, &ldquo;follows her
      about with his eyes like a dog&mdash;the bumpy beggar! I don&rsquo;t
      wonder at it&mdash;she&rsquo;s a very charming woman, and, I should say,
      the pink of discretion!&rdquo; A vague consciousness of perfume caging
      about Irene, like that from a flower with half-closed petals and a
      passionate heart, moved him to the creation of this image. &ldquo;But I
      wasn&rsquo;t sure of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;till I saw him pick up her
      handkerchief.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small&rsquo;s eyes boiled with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he give it her back?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it back?&rdquo; said Swithin: &ldquo;I saw him slobber on it
      when he thought I wasn&rsquo;t looking!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small gasped&mdash;too interested to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she gave him no encouragement,&rdquo; went on Swithin; he
      stopped, and stared for a minute or two in the way that alarmed Aunt
      Hester so&mdash;he had suddenly recollected that, as they were starting
      back in the phaeton, she had given Bosinney her hand a second time, and
      let it stay there too.... He had touched his horses smartly with the whip,
      anxious to get her all to himself. But she had looked back, and she had
      not answered his first question; neither had he been able to see her face&mdash;she
      had kept it hanging down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is somewhere a picture, which Swithin has not seen, of a man sitting
      on a rock, and by him, immersed in the still, green water, a sea-nymph
      lying on her back, with her hand on her naked breast. She has a half-smile
      on her face&mdash;a smile of hopeless surrender and of secret joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated by Swithin&rsquo;s side, Irene may have been smiling like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, warmed by champagne, he had her all to himself, he unbosomed himself
      of his wrongs; of his smothered resentment against the new chef at the
      club; his worry over the house in Wigmore Street, where the rascally
      tenant had gone bankrupt through helping his brother-in-law as if charity
      did not begin at home; of his deafness, too, and that pain he sometimes
      got in his right side. She listened, her eyes swimming under their lids.
      He thought she was thinking deeply of his troubles, and pitied himself
      terribly. Yet in his fur coat, with frogs across the breast, his top hat
      aslant, driving this beautiful woman, he had never felt more
      distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      A coster, however, taking his girl for a Sunday airing, seemed to have the
      same impression about himself. This person had flogged his donkey into a
      gallop alongside, and sat, upright as a waxwork, in his shallopy chariot,
      his chin settled pompously on a red handkerchief, like Swithin&rsquo;s on
      his full cravat; while his girl, with the ends of a fly-blown boa floating
      out behind, aped a woman of fashion. Her swain moved a stick with a ragged
      bit of string dangling from the end, reproducing with strange fidelity the
      circular flourish of Swithin&rsquo;s whip, and rolled his head at his lady
      with a leer that had a weird likeness to Swithin&rsquo;s primeval stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though for a time unconscious of the lowly ruffian&rsquo;s presence,
      Swithin presently took it into his head that he was being guyed. He laid
      his whip-lash across the mares flank. The two chariots, however, by some
      unfortunate fatality continued abreast. Swithin&rsquo;s yellow, puffy face
      grew red; he raised his whip to lash the costermonger, but was saved from
      so far forgetting his dignity by a special intervention of Providence. A
      carriage driving out through a gate forced phaeton and donkey-cart into
      proximity; the wheels grated, the lighter vehicle skidded, and was
      overturned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin did not look round. On no account would he have pulled up to help
      the ruffian. Serve him right if he had broken his neck!
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not if he would. The greys had taken alarm. The phaeton swung
      from side to side, and people raised frightened faces as they went dashing
      past. Swithin&rsquo;s great arms, stretched at full length, tugged at the
      reins. His cheeks were puffed, his lips compressed, his swollen face was
      of a dull, angry red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene had her hand on the rail, and at every lurch she gripped it tightly.
      Swithin heard her ask:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we going to have an accident, Uncle Swithin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He gasped out between his pants: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing; a&mdash;little
      fresh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been in an accident.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you move!&rdquo; He took a look at her. She was
      smiling, perfectly calm. &ldquo;Sit still,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Never
      fear, I&rsquo;ll get you home!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the midst of all his terrible efforts, he was surprised to hear her
      answer in a voice not like her own:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I never get home!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage giving a terrific lurch, Swithin&rsquo;s exclamation was
      jerked back into his throat. The horses, winded by the rise of a hill, now
      steadied to a trot, and finally stopped of their own accord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&rdquo;&mdash;Swithin described it at Timothy&rsquo;s&mdash;&ldquo;I
      pulled &lsquo;em up, there she was as cool as myself. God bless my soul!
      she behaved as if she didn&rsquo;t care whether she broke her neck or not!
      What was it she said: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I never get home?&rdquo;
      Leaning over the handle of his cane, he wheezed out, to Mrs. Small&rsquo;s
      terror: &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not altogether surprised, with a finickin&rsquo;
      feller like young Soames for a husband!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not occur to him to wonder what Bosinney had done after they had
      left him there alone; whether he had gone wandering about like the dog to
      which Swithin had compared him; wandering down to that copse where the
      spring was still in riot, the cuckoo still calling from afar; gone down
      there with her handkerchief pressed to lips, its fragrance mingling with
      the scent of mint and thyme. Gone down there with such a wild, exquisite
      pain in his heart that he could have cried out among the trees. Or what,
      indeed, the fellow had done. In fact, till he came to Timothy&rsquo;s,
      Swithin had forgotten all about him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;JAMES GOES TO SEE FOR HIMSELF
    </h2>
    <p>
      Those ignorant of Forsyte &lsquo;Change would not, perhaps, foresee all
      the stir made by Irene&rsquo;s visit to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Swithin had related at Timothy&rsquo;s the full story of his
      memorable drive, the same, with the least suspicion of curiosity, the
      merest touch of malice, and a real desire to do good, was passed on to
      June.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what a dreadful thing to say, my dear!&rdquo; ended Aunt Juley;
      &ldquo;that about not going home. What did she mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange recital for the girl. She heard it flushing painfully,
      and, suddenly, with a curt handshake, took her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost rude!&rdquo; Mrs. Small said to Aunt Hester, when June was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proper construction was put on her reception of the news. She was
      upset. Something was therefore very wrong. Odd! She and Irene had been
      such friends!
    </p>
    <p>
      It all tallied too well with whispers and hints that had been going about
      for some time past. Recollections of Euphemia&rsquo;s account of the visit
      to the theatre&mdash;Mr. Bosinney always at Soames&rsquo;s? Oh, indeed!
      Yes, of course, he would be about the house! Nothing open. Only upon the
      greatest, the most important provocation was it necessary to say anything
      open on Forsyte &lsquo;Change. This machine was too nicely adjusted; a
      hint, the merest trifling expression of regret or doubt, sufficed to set
      the family soul so sympathetic&mdash;vibrating. No one desired that harm
      should come of these vibrations&mdash;far from it; they were set in motion
      with the best intentions, with the feeling, that each member of the family
      had a stake in the family soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      And much kindness lay at the bottom of the gossip; it would frequently
      result in visits of condolence being made, in accordance with the customs
      of Society, thereby conferring a real benefit upon the sufferers, and
      affording consolation to the sound, who felt pleasantly that someone at
      all events was suffering from that from which they themselves were not
      suffering. In fact, it was simply a desire to keep things well-aired, the
      desire which animates the Public Press, that brought James, for instance,
      into communication with Mrs. Septimus, Mrs. Septimus, with the little
      Nicholases, the little Nicholases with who-knows-whom, and so on. That
      great class to which they had risen, and now belonged, demanded a certain
      candour, a still more certain reticence. This combination guaranteed their
      membership.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the younger Forsytes felt, very naturally, and would openly
      declare, that they did not want their affairs pried into; but so powerful
      was the invisible, magnetic current of family gossip, that for the life of
      them they could not help knowing all about everything. It was felt to be
      hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them (young Roger) had made an heroic attempt to free the rising
      generation, by speaking of Timothy as an &lsquo;old cat.&rsquo; The effort
      had justly recoiled upon himself; the words, coming round in the most
      delicate way to Aunt Juley&rsquo;s ears, were repeated by her in a shocked
      voice to Mrs. Roger, whence they returned again to young Roger.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after all, it was only the wrong-doers who suffered; as, for
      instance, George, when he lost all that money playing billiards; or young
      Roger himself, when he was so dreadfully near to marrying the girl to
      whom, it was whispered, he was already married by the laws of Nature; or
      again Irene, who was thought, rather than said, to be in danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was not only pleasant but salutary. And it made so many hours go
      lightly at Timothy&rsquo;s in the Bayswater Road; so many hours that must
      otherwise have been sterile and heavy to those three who lived there; and
      Timothy&rsquo;s was but one of hundreds of such homes in this City of
      London&mdash;the homes of neutral persons of the secure classes, who are
      out of the battle themselves, and must find their reason for existing, in
      the battles of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the sweetness of family gossip, it must indeed have been lonely
      there. Rumours and tales, reports, surmises&mdash;were they not the
      children of the house, as dear and precious as the prattling babes the
      brother and sisters had missed in their own journey? To talk about them
      was as near as they could get to the possession of all those children and
      grandchildren, after whom their soft hearts yearned. For though it is
      doubtful whether Timothy&rsquo;s heart yearned, it is indubitable that at
      the arrival of each fresh Forsyte child he was quite upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Useless for young Roger to say, &ldquo;Old cat!&rdquo; for Euphemia to
      hold up her hands and cry: &ldquo;Oh! those three!&rdquo; and break into
      her silent laugh with the squeak at the end. Useless, and not too kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation which at this stage might seem, and especially to Forsyte
      eyes, strange&mdash;not to say &lsquo;impossible&rsquo;&mdash;was, in view
      of certain facts, not so strange after all. Some things had been lost
      sight of. And first, in the security bred of many harmless marriages, it
      had been forgotten that Love is no hot-house flower, but a wild plant,
      born of a wet night, born of an hour of sunshine; sprung from wild seed,
      blown along the road by a wild wind. A wild plant that, when it blooms by
      chance within the hedge of our gardens, we call a flower; and when it
      blooms outside we call a weed; but, flower or weed, whose scent and colour
      are always, wild! And further&mdash;the facts and figures of their own
      lives being against the perception of this truth&mdash;it was not
      generally recognised by Forsytes that, where, this wild plant springs, men
      and women are but moths around the pale, flame-like blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long since young Jolyon&rsquo;s escapade&mdash;there was danger of
      a tradition again arising that people in their position never cross the
      hedge to pluck that flower; that one could reckon on having love, like
      measles, once in due season, and getting over it comfortably for all time&mdash;as
      with measles, on a soothing mixture of butter and honey&mdash;in the arms
      of wedlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all those whom this strange rumour about Bosinney and Mrs. Soames
      reached, James was the most affected. He had long forgotten how he had
      hovered, lanky and pale, in side whiskers of chestnut hue, round Emily, in
      the days of his own courtship. He had long forgotten the small house in
      the purlieus of Mayfair, where he had spent the early days of his married
      life, or rather, he had long forgotten the early days, not the small
      house,&mdash;a Forsyte never forgot a house&mdash;he had afterwards sold
      it at a clear profit of four hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had long forgotten those days, with their hopes and fears and doubts
      about the prudence of the match (for Emily, though pretty, had nothing,
      and he himself at that time was making a bare thousand a year), and that
      strange, irresistible attraction which had drawn him on, till he felt he
      must die if he could not marry the girl with the fair hair, looped so
      neatly back, the fair arms emerging from a skin-tight bodice, the fair
      form decorously shielded by a cage of really stupendous circumference.
    </p>
    <p>
      James had passed through the fire, but he had passed also through the
      river of years which washes out the fire; he had experienced the saddest
      experience of all&mdash;forgetfulness of what it was like to be in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forgotten! Forgotten so long, that he had forgotten even that he had
      forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now this rumour had come upon him, this rumour about his son&rsquo;s
      wife; very vague, a shadow dodging among the palpable, straightforward
      appearances of things, unreal, unintelligible as a ghost, but carrying
      with it, like a ghost, inexplicable terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to bring it home to his mind, but it was no more use than trying
      to apply to himself one of those tragedies he read of daily in his evening
      paper. He simply could not. There could be nothing in it. It was all their
      nonsense. She didn&rsquo;t get on with Soames as well as she might, but
      she was a good little thing&mdash;a good little thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the not inconsiderable majority of men, James relished a nice little
      bit of scandal, and would say, in a matter-of-fact tone, licking his lips,
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;she and young Dyson; they tell me they&rsquo;re
      living at Monte Carlo!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the significance of an affair of this sort&mdash;of its past, its
      present, or its future&mdash;had never struck him. What it meant, what
      torture and raptures had gone to its construction, what slow,
      overmastering fate had lurked within the facts, very naked, sometimes
      sordid, but generally spicy, presented to his gaze. He was not in the
      habit of blaming, praising, drawing deductions, or generalizing at all
      about such things; he simply listened rather greedily, and repeated what
      he was told, finding considerable benefit from the practice, as from the
      consumption of a sherry and bitters before a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, that such a thing&mdash;or rather the rumour, the breath of
      it&mdash;had come near him personally, he felt as in a fog, which filled
      his mouth full of a bad, thick flavour, and made it difficult to draw
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scandal! A possible scandal!
    </p>
    <p>
      To repeat this word to himself thus was the only way in which he could
      focus or make it thinkable. He had forgotten the sensations necessary for
      understanding the progress, fate, or meaning of any such business; he
      simply could no longer grasp the possibilities of people running any risk
      for the sake of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst all those persons of his acquaintance, who went into the City day
      after day and did their business there, whatever it was, and in their
      leisure moments bought shares, and houses, and ate dinners, and played
      games, as he was told, it would have seemed to him ridiculous to suppose
      that there were any who would run risks for the sake of anything so
      recondite, so figurative, as passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passion! He seemed, indeed, to have heard of it, and rules such as &lsquo;A
      young man and a young woman ought never to be trusted together&rsquo; were
      fixed in his mind as the parallels of latitude are fixed on a map (for all
      Forsytes, when it comes to &lsquo;bed-rock&rsquo; matters of fact, have
      quite a fine taste in realism); but as to anything else&mdash;well, he
      could only appreciate it at all through the catch-word &lsquo;scandal.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! but there was no truth in it&mdash;could not be. He was not afraid;
      she was really a good little thing. But there it was when you got a thing
      like that into your mind. And James was of a nervous temperament&mdash;one
      of those men whom things will not leave alone, who suffer tortures from
      anticipation and indecision. For fear of letting something slip that he
      might otherwise secure, he was physically unable to make up his mind until
      absolutely certain that, by not making it up, he would suffer loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      In life, however, there were many occasions when the business of making up
      his mind did not even rest with himself, and this was one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could he do? Talk it over with Soames? That would only make matters
      worse. And, after all, there was nothing in it, he felt sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all that house. He had mistrusted the idea from the first. What did
      Soames want to go into the country for? And, if he must go spending a lot
      of money building himself a house, why not have a first-rate man, instead
      of this young Bosinney, whom nobody knew anything about? He had told them
      how it would be. And he had heard that the house was costing Soames a
      pretty penny beyond what he had reckoned on spending.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fact, more than any other, brought home to James the real danger of
      the situation. It was always like this with these &lsquo;artistic&rsquo;
      chaps; a sensible man should have nothing to say to them. He had warned
      Irene, too. And see what had come of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      And it suddenly sprang into James&rsquo;s mind that he ought to go and see
      for himself. In the midst of that fog of uneasiness in which his mind was
      enveloped the notion that he could go and look at the house afforded him
      inexplicable satisfaction. It may have been simply the decision to do
      something&mdash;more possibly the fact that he was going to look at a
      house&mdash;that gave him relief. He felt that in staring at an edifice of
      bricks and mortar, of wood and stone, built by the suspected man himself,
      he would be looking into the heart of that rumour about Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without saying a word, therefore, to anyone, he took a hansom to the
      station and proceeded by train to Robin Hill; thence&mdash;there being no
      &lsquo;flies,&rsquo; in accordance with the custom of the neighbourhood&mdash;he
      found himself obliged to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started slowly up the hill, his angular knees and high shoulders bent
      complainingly, his eyes fixed on his feet, yet, neat for all that, in his
      high hat and his frock-coat, on which was the speckless gloss imparted by
      perfect superintendence. Emily saw to that; that is, she did not, of
      course, see to it&mdash;people of good position not seeing to each other&rsquo;s
      buttons, and Emily was of good position&mdash;but she saw that the butler
      saw to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to ask his way three times; on each occasion he repeated the
      directions given him, got the man to repeat them, then repeated them a
      second time, for he was naturally of a talkative disposition, and one
      could not be too careful in a new neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept assuring them that it was a new house he was looking for; it was
      only, however, when he was shown the roof through the trees that he could
      feel really satisfied that he had not been directed entirely wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy sky seemed to cover the world with the grey whiteness of a
      whitewashed ceiling. There was no freshness or fragrance in the air. On
      such a day even British workmen scarcely cared to do more then they were
      obliged, and moved about their business without the drone of talk which
      whiles away the pangs of labour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through spaces of the unfinished house, shirt-sleeved figures worked
      slowly, and sounds arose&mdash;spasmodic knockings, the scraping of metal,
      the sawing of wood, with the rumble of wheelbarrows along boards; now and
      again the foreman&rsquo;s dog, tethered by a string to an oaken beam,
      whimpered feebly, with a sound like the singing of a kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fresh-fitted window-panes, daubed each with a white patch in the
      centre, stared out at James like the eyes of a blind dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the building chorus went on, strident and mirthless under the
      grey-white sky. But the thrushes, hunting amongst the fresh-turned earth
      for worms, were silent quite.
    </p>
    <p>
      James picked his way among the heaps of gravel&mdash;the drive was being
      laid&mdash;till he came opposite the porch. Here he stopped and raised his
      eyes. There was but little to see from this point of view, and that little
      he took in at once; but he stayed in this position many minutes, and who
      shall know of what he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      His china-blue eyes under white eyebrows that jutted out in little horns,
      never stirred; the long upper lip of his wide mouth, between the fine
      white whiskers, twitched once or twice; it was easy to see from that
      anxious rapt expression, whence Soames derived the handicapped look which
      sometimes came upon his face. James might have been saying to himself:
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;life&rsquo;s a tough job.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In this position Bosinney surprised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      James brought his eyes down from whatever bird&rsquo;s-nest they had been
      looking for in the sky to Bosinney&rsquo;s face, on which was a kind of
      humorous scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Forsyte? Come down to see for yourself?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was exactly what James, as we know, had come for, and he was made
      correspondingly uneasy. He held out his hand, however, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; without looking at Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter made way for him with an ironical smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      James scented something suspicious in this courtesy. &ldquo;I should like
      to walk round the outside first,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and see what you&rsquo;ve
      been doing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A flagged terrace of rounded stones with a list of two or three inches to
      port had been laid round the south-east and south-west sides of the house,
      and ran with a bevelled edge into mould, which was in preparation for
      being turfed; along this terrace James led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what did this cost?&rdquo; he asked, when he saw the terrace
      extending round the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should you think?&rdquo; inquired Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; replied James somewhat nonplussed;
      &ldquo;two or three hundred, I dare say!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The exact sum!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James gave him a sharp look, but the architect appeared unconscious, and
      he put the answer down to mishearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On arriving at the garden entrance, he stopped to look at the view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ought to come down,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the oak-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think so? You think that with the tree there you don&rsquo;t
      get enough view for your money.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again James eyed him suspiciously&mdash;this young man had a peculiar way
      of putting things: &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said, with a perplexed, nervous,
      emphasis, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you want with a tree.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall come down to-morrow,&rdquo; said Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      James was alarmed. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go saying
      I said it was to come down! I know nothing about it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James went on in a fluster: &ldquo;Why, what should I know about it? It&rsquo;s
      nothing to do with me! You do it on your own responsibility.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll allow me to mention your name?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James grew more and more alarmed: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you want
      mentioning my name for,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better
      leave the tree alone. It&rsquo;s not your tree!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out a silk handkerchief and wiped his brow. They entered the
      house. Like Swithin, James was impressed by the inner court-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have spent a deuce of a lot of money here,&rdquo; he said,
      after staring at the columns and gallery for some time. &ldquo;Now, what
      did it cost to put up those columns?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you off-hand,&rdquo; thoughtfully answered
      Bosinney, &ldquo;but I know it was a deuce of a lot!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so,&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;I should....&rdquo; He
      caught the architect&rsquo;s eye, and broke off. And now, whenever he came
      to anything of which he desired to know the cost, he stifled that
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney appeared determined that he should see everything, and had not
      James been of too &lsquo;noticing&rsquo; a nature, he would certainly have
      found himself going round the house a second time. He seemed so anxious to
      be asked questions, too, that James felt he must be on his guard. He began
      to suffer from his exertions, for, though wiry enough for a man of his
      long build, he was seventy-five years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      He grew discouraged; he seemed no nearer to anything, had not obtained
      from his inspection any of the knowledge he had vaguely hoped for. He had
      merely increased his dislike and mistrust of this young man, who had tired
      him out with his politeness, and in whose manner he now certainly detected
      mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow was sharper than he had thought, and better-looking than he had
      hoped. He had a&mdash;a &lsquo;don&rsquo;t care&rsquo; appearance that
      James, to whom risk was the most intolerable thing in life, did not
      appreciate; a peculiar smile, too, coming when least expected; and very
      queer eyes. He reminded James, as he said afterwards, of a hungry cat.
      This was as near as he could get, in conversation with Emily, to a
      description of the peculiar exasperation, velvetiness, and mockery, of
      which Bosinney&rsquo;s manner had been composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, having seen all that was to be seen, he came out again at the
      door where he had gone in; and now, feeling that he was wasting time and
      strength and money, all for nothing, he took the courage of a Forsyte in
      both hands, and, looking sharply at Bosinney, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you see a good deal of my daughter-in-law; now, what
      does she think of the house? But she hasn&rsquo;t seen it, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This he said, knowing all about Irene&rsquo;s visit not, of course, that
      there was anything in the visit, except that extraordinary remark she had
      made about &lsquo;not caring to get home&rsquo;&mdash;and the story of how
      June had taken the news!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had determined, by this way of putting the question, to give Bosinney a
      chance, as he said to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was long in answering, but kept his eyes with uncomfortable
      steadiness on James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has seen the house, but I can&rsquo;t tell you what she thinks
      of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nervous and baffled, James was constitutionally prevented from letting the
      matter drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she has seen it? Soames brought her
      down, I suppose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney smilingly replied: &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, did she come down alone?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;who brought her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know whether I ought to tell you who brought
      her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To James, who knew that it was Swithin, this answer appeared
      incomprehensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why!&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;you know that....&rdquo; but he
      stopped, suddenly perceiving his danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t want to tell me I
      suppose you won&rsquo;t! Nobody tells me anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat to his surprise Bosinney asked him a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the by,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;could you tell me if there are
      likely to be any more of you coming down? I should like to be on the spot!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any more?&rdquo; said James bewildered, &ldquo;who should there be
      more? I don&rsquo;t know of any more. Good-bye?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the ground he held out his hand, crossed the palm of it with
      Bosinney&rsquo;s, and taking his umbrella just above the silk, walked away
      along the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he turned the corner he glanced back, and saw Bosinney following
      him slowly&mdash;&rsquo;slinking along the wall&rsquo; as he put it to
      himself, &lsquo;like a great cat.&rsquo; He paid no attention when the
      young fellow raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the drive, and out of sight, he slackened his pace still more.
      Very slowly, more bent than when he came, lean, hungry, and disheartened,
      he made his way back to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Buccaneer, watching him go so sadly home, felt sorry perhaps for his
      behaviour to the old man.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;SOAMES AND BOSINNEY CORRESPOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      James said nothing to his son of this visit to the house; but, having
      occasion to go to Timothy&rsquo;s one morning on a matter connected with a
      drainage scheme which was being forced by the sanitary authorities on his
      brother, he mentioned it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, he said, a bad house. He could see that a good deal could be
      made of it. The fellow was clever in his way, though what it was going to
      cost Soames before it was done with he didn&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Euphemia Forsyte, who happened to be in the room&mdash;she had come round
      to borrow the Rev. Mr. Scoles&rsquo; last novel, &lsquo;Passion and
      Paregoric&rsquo;, which was having such a vogue&mdash;chimed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw Irene yesterday at the Stores; she and Mr. Bosinney were
      having a nice little chat in the Groceries.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thus, simply, that she recorded a scene which had really made a
      deep and complicated impression on her. She had been hurrying to the silk
      department of the Church and Commercial Stores&mdash;that Institution than
      which, with its admirable system, admitting only guaranteed persons on a
      basis of payment before delivery, no emporium can be more highly
      recommended to Forsytes&mdash;to match a piece of prunella silk for her
      mother, who was waiting in the carriage outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through the Groceries her eye was unpleasantly attracted by the
      back view of a very beautiful figure. It was so charmingly proportioned,
      so balanced, and so well clothed, that Euphemia&rsquo;s instinctive
      propriety was at once alarmed; such figures, she knew, by intuition rather
      than experience, were rarely connected with virtue&mdash;certainly never
      in her mind, for her own back was somewhat difficult to fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her suspicions were fortunately confirmed. A young man coming from the
      Drugs had snatched off his hat, and was accosting the lady with the
      unknown back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that she saw with whom she had to deal; the lady was
      undoubtedly Mrs. Soames, the young man Mr. Bosinney. Concealing herself
      rapidly over the purchase of a box of Tunisian dates, for she was
      impatient of awkwardly meeting people with parcels in her hands, and at
      the busy time of the morning, she was quite unintentionally an interested
      observer of their little interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Soames, usually somewhat pale, had a delightful colour in her cheeks;
      and Mr. Bosinney&rsquo;s manner was strange, though attractive (she
      thought him rather a distinguished-looking man, and George&rsquo;s name
      for him, &lsquo;The Buccaneer&rsquo;&mdash;about which there was something
      romantic&mdash;quite charming). He seemed to be pleading. Indeed, they
      talked so earnestly&mdash;or, rather, he talked so earnestly, for Mrs.
      Soames did not say much&mdash;that they caused, inconsiderately, an eddy
      in the traffic. One nice old General, going towards Cigars, was obliged to
      step quite out of the way, and chancing to look up and see Mrs. Soames&rsquo;
      face, he actually took off his hat, the old fool! So like a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was Mrs. Soames&rsquo; eyes that worried Euphemia. She never once
      looked at Mr. Bosinney until he moved on, and then she looked after him.
      And, oh, that look!
    </p>
    <p>
      On that look Euphemia had spent much anxious thought. It is not too much
      to say that it had hurt her with its dark, lingering softness, for all the
      world as though the woman wanted to drag him back, and unsay something she
      had been saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, well, she had had no time to go deeply into the matter just then, with
      that prunella silk on her hands; but she was &lsquo;very intriguee&rsquo;&mdash;very!
      She had just nodded to Mrs. Soames, to show her that she had seen; and, as
      she confided, in talking it over afterwards, to her chum Francie (Roger&rsquo;s
      daughter), &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t she look caught out just?...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James, most averse at the first blush to accepting any news confirmatory
      of his own poignant suspicions, took her up at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they&rsquo;d be after wall-papers no
      doubt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Euphemia smiled. &ldquo;In the Groceries?&rdquo; she said softly; and,
      taking &lsquo;Passion and Paregoric&rsquo; from the table, added: &ldquo;And
      so you&rsquo;ll lend me this, dear Auntie? Good-bye!&rdquo; and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      James left almost immediately after; he was late as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the office of Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte, he found
      Soames, sitting in his revolving, chair, drawing up a defence. The latter
      greeted his father with a curt good-morning, and, taking an envelope from
      his pocket, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may interest you to look through this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James read as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;309D, SLOANE STREET, May 15,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR FORSYTE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The construction of your house being now completed, my duties as
      architect have come to an end. If I am to go on with the business of
      decoration, which at your request I undertook, I should like you to
      clearly understand that I must have a free hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You never come down without suggesting something that goes counter
      to my scheme. I have here three letters from you, each of which recommends
      an article I should never dream of putting in. I had your father here
      yesterday afternoon, who made further valuable suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please make up your mind, therefore, whether you want me to
      decorate for you, or to retire which on the whole I should prefer to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But understand that, if I decorate, I decorate alone, without
      interference of any sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I do the thing, I will do it thoroughly, but I must have a free hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;PHILIP BOSINNEY.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The exact and immediate cause of this letter cannot, of course, be told,
      though it is not improbable that Bosinney may have been moved by some
      sudden revolt against his position towards Soames&mdash;that eternal
      position of Art towards Property&mdash;which is so admirably summed up, on
      the back of the most indispensable of modern appliances, in a sentence
      comparable to the very finest in Tacitus:
    </p>
    <p>
      THOS. T. SORROW, Inventor. BERT M. PADLAND, Proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to say to him?&rdquo; James asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames did not even turn his head. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind,&rdquo;
      he said, and went on with his defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A client of his, having put some buildings on a piece of ground that did
      not belong to him, had been suddenly and most irritatingly warned to take
      them off again. After carefully going into the facts, however, Soames had
      seen his way to advise that his client had what was known as a title by
      possession, and that, though undoubtedly the ground did not belong to him,
      he was entitled to keep it, and had better do so; and he was now following
      up this advice by taking steps to&mdash;as the sailors say&mdash;&rsquo;make
      it so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a distinct reputation for sound advice; people saying of him:
      &ldquo;Go to young Forsyte&mdash;a long-headed fellow!&rdquo; and he
      prized this reputation highly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His natural taciturnity was in his favour; nothing could be more
      calculated to give people, especially people with property (Soames had no
      other clients), the impression that he was a safe man. And he was safe.
      Tradition, habit, education, inherited aptitude, native caution, all
      joined to form a solid professional honesty, superior to temptation&mdash;from
      the very fact that it was built on an innate avoidance of risk. How could
      he fall, when his soul abhorred circumstances which render a fall possible&mdash;a
      man cannot fall off the floor!
    </p>
    <p>
      And those countless Forsytes, who, in the course of innumerable
      transactions concerned with property of all sorts (from wives to water
      rights), had occasion for the services of a safe man, found it both
      reposeful and profitable to confide in Soames. That slight
      superciliousness of his, combined with an air of mousing amongst
      precedents, was in his favour too&mdash;a man would not be supercilious
      unless he knew!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was really at the head of the business, for though James still came
      nearly every day to, see for himself, he did little now but sit in his
      chair, twist his legs, slightly confuse things already decided, and
      presently go away again, and the other partner, Bustard, was a poor thing,
      who did a great deal of work, but whose opinion was never taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Soames went steadily on with his defence. Yet it would be idle to say
      that his mind was at ease. He was suffering from a sense of impending
      trouble, that had haunted him for some time past. He tried to think it
      physical&mdash;a condition of his liver&mdash;but knew that it was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch. In a quarter of an hour he was due at the General
      Meeting of the New Colliery Company&mdash;one of Uncle Jolyon&rsquo;s
      concerns; he should see Uncle Jolyon there, and say something to him about
      Bosinney&mdash;he had not made up his mind what, but something&mdash;in
      any case he should not answer this letter until he had seen Uncle Jolyon.
      He got up and methodically put away the draft of his defence. Going into a
      dark little cupboard, he turned up the light, washed his hands with a
      piece of brown Windsor soap, and dried them on a roller towel. Then he
      brushed his hair, paying strict attention to the parting, turned down the
      light, took his hat, and saying he would be back at half-past two, stepped
      into the Poultry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not far to the Offices of the New Colliery Company in Ironmonger
      Lane, where, and not at the Cannon Street Hotel, in accordance with the
      more ambitious practice of other companies, the General Meeting was always
      held. Old Jolyon had from the first set his face against the Press. What
      business&mdash;he said&mdash;had the Public with his concerns!
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames arrived on the stroke of time, and took his seat alongside the
      Board, who, in a row, each Director behind his own ink-pot, faced their
      Shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of this row old Jolyon, conspicuous in his black,
      tightly-buttoned frock-coat and his white moustaches, was leaning back
      with finger tips crossed on a copy of the Directors&rsquo; report and
      accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his right hand, always a little larger than life, sat the Secretary,
      &lsquo;Down-by-the-starn&rsquo; Hemmings; an all-too-sad sadness beaming
      in his fine eyes; his iron-grey beard, in mourning like the rest of him,
      giving the feeling of an all-too-black tie behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion indeed was a melancholy one, only six weeks having elapsed
      since that telegram had come from Scorrier, the mining expert, on a
      private mission to the Mines, informing them that Pippin, their
      Superintendent, had committed suicide in endeavouring, after his
      extraordinary two years&rsquo; silence, to write a letter to his Board.
      That letter was on the table now; it would be read to the Shareholders,
      who would of course be put into possession of all the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hemmings had often said to Soames, standing with his coat-tails divided
      before the fireplace:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What our Shareholders don&rsquo;t know about our affairs isn&rsquo;t
      worth knowing. You may take that from me, Mr. Soames.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion, old Jolyon being present, Soames recollected a little
      unpleasantness. His uncle had looked up sharply and said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      talk nonsense, Hemmings! You mean that what they do know isn&rsquo;t worth
      knowing!&rdquo; Old Jolyon detested humbug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hemmings, angry-eyed, and wearing a smile like that of a trained poodle,
      had replied in an outburst of artificial applause: &ldquo;Come, now, that&rsquo;s
      good, sir&mdash;that&rsquo;s very good. Your uncle will have his joke!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time he had seen Soames he had taken the opportunity of saying to
      him: &ldquo;The chairman&rsquo;s getting very old!&mdash;I can&rsquo;t get
      him to understand things; and he&rsquo;s so wilful&mdash;but what can you
      expect, with a chin like his?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone knew that Uncle Jolyon&rsquo;s chin was a caution. He was looking
      worried to-day, in spite of his General Meeting look; he (Soames) should
      certainly speak to him about Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond old Jolyon on the left was little Mr. Booker, and he, too, wore his
      General Meeting look, as though searching for some particularly tender
      shareholder. And next him was the deaf director, with a frown; and beyond
      the deaf director, again, was old Mr. Bleedham, very bland, and having an
      air of conscious virtue&mdash;as well he might, knowing that the
      brown-paper parcel he always brought to the Board-room was concealed
      behind his hat (one of that old-fashioned class, of flat-brimmed top-hats
      which go with very large bow ties, clean-shaven lips, fresh cheeks, and
      neat little, white whiskers).
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames always attended the General Meeting; it was considered better that
      he should do so, in case &lsquo;anything should arise!&rsquo; He glanced
      round with his close, supercilious air at the walls of the room, where
      hung plans of the mine and harbour, together with a large photograph of a
      shaft leading to a working which had proved quite remarkably unprofitable.
      This photograph&mdash;a witness to the eternal irony underlying commercial
      enterprise&mdash;still retained its position on the wall, an effigy of the
      directors&rsquo; pet, but dead, lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now old Jolyon rose, to present the report and accounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veiling under a Jove-like serenity that perpetual antagonism deep-seated
      in the bosom of a director towards his shareholders, he faced them calmly.
      Soames faced them too. He knew most of them by sight. There was old
      Scrubsole, a tar man, who always came, as Hemmings would say, &lsquo;to
      make himself nasty,&rsquo; a cantankerous-looking old fellow with a red
      face, a jowl, and an enormous low-crowned hat reposing on his knee. And
      the Rev. Mr. Boms, who always proposed a vote of thanks to the chairman,
      in which he invariably expressed the hope that the Board would not forget
      to elevate their employees, using the word with a double e, as being more
      vigorous and Anglo-Saxon (he had the strong Imperialistic tendencies of
      his cloth). It was his salutary custom to buttonhole a director
      afterwards, and ask him whether he thought the coming year would be good
      or bad; and, according to the trend of the answer, to buy or sell three
      shares within the ensuing fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was that military man, Major O&rsquo;Bally, who could not help
      speaking, if only to second the re-election of the auditor, and who
      sometimes caused serious consternation by taking toasts&mdash;proposals
      rather&mdash;out of the hands of persons who had been flattered with
      little slips of paper, entrusting the said proposals to their care.
    </p>
    <p>
      These made up the lot, together with four or five strong, silent
      shareholders, with whom Soames could sympathize&mdash;men of business, who
      liked to keep an eye on their affairs for themselves, without being fussy&mdash;good,
      solid men, who came to the City every day and went back in the evening to
      good, solid wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good, solid wives! There was something in that thought which roused the
      nameless uneasiness in Soames again.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should he say to his uncle? What answer should he make to this
      letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . &ldquo;If any shareholder has any question to put, I shall be glad
      to answer it.&rdquo; A soft thump. Old Jolyon had let the report and
      accounts fall, and stood twisting his tortoise-shell glasses between thumb
      and forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ghost of a smile appeared on Soames&rsquo; face. They had better hurry
      up with their questions! He well knew his uncle&rsquo;s method (the ideal
      one) of at once saying: &ldquo;I propose, then, that the report and
      accounts be adopted!&rdquo; Never let them get their wind&mdash;shareholders
      were notoriously wasteful of time!
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall, white-bearded man, with a gaunt, dissatisfied face, arose:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am in order, Mr. Chairman, in raising a question on
      this figure of L5000 in the accounts. &lsquo;To the widow and family&rdquo;&rsquo;
      (he looked sourly round), &ldquo;&lsquo;of our late superintendent,&rsquo;
      who so&mdash;er&mdash;ill-advisedly (I say&mdash;ill-advisedly) committed
      suicide, at a time when his services were of the utmost value to this
      Company. You have stated that the agreement which he has so unfortunately
      cut short with his own hand was for a period of five years, of which one
      only had expired&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon made a gesture of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am in order, Mr. Chairman&mdash;I ask whether this
      amount paid, or proposed to be paid, by the Board to the er&mdash;deceased&mdash;is
      for services which might have been rendered to the Company&mdash;had he
      not committed suicide?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in recognition of past services, which we all know&mdash;you
      as well as any of us&mdash;to have been of vital value.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir, all I have to say is that the services being past, the
      amount is too much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The shareholder sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon waited a second and said: &ldquo;I now propose that the report
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The shareholder rose again: &ldquo;May I ask if the Board realizes that it
      is not their money which&mdash;I don&rsquo;t hesitate to say that if it
      were their money....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A second shareholder, with a round, dogged face, whom Soames recognised as
      the late superintendent&rsquo;s brother-in-law, got up and said warmly:
      &ldquo;In my opinion, sir, the sum is not enough!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Mr. Boms now rose to his feet. &ldquo;If I may venture to express
      myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should say that the fact of the&mdash;er&mdash;deceased
      having committed suicide should weigh very heavily&mdash;very heavily with
      our worthy chairman. I have no doubt it has weighed with him, for&mdash;I
      say this for myself and I think for everyone present (hear, hear)&mdash;he
      enjoys our confidence in a high degree. We all desire, I should hope, to
      be charitable. But I feel sure&rdquo; (he-looked severely at the late
      superintendent&rsquo;s brother-in-law) &ldquo;that he will in some way, by
      some written expression, or better perhaps by reducing the amount, record
      our grave disapproval that so promising and valuable a life should have
      been thus impiously removed from a sphere where both its own interests and&mdash;if
      I may say so&mdash;our interests so imperatively demanded its continuance.
      We should not&mdash;nay, we may not&mdash;countenance so grave a
      dereliction of all duty, both human and divine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverend gentleman resumed his seat. The late superintendent&rsquo;s
      brother-in-law again rose: &ldquo;What I have said I stick to,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;the amount is not enough!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The first shareholder struck in: &ldquo;I challenge the legality of the
      payment. In my opinion this payment is not legal. The Company&rsquo;s
      solicitor is present; I believe I am in order in asking him the question.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were now turned upon Soames. Something had arisen!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, close-lipped and cold; his nerves inwardly fluttered, his
      attention tweaked away at last from contemplation of that cloud looming on
      the horizon of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The point,&rdquo; he said in a low, thin voice, &ldquo;is by no
      means clear. As there is no possibility of future consideration being
      received, it is doubtful whether the payment is strictly legal. If it is
      desired, the opinion of the court could be taken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The superintendent&rsquo;s brother-in-law frowned, and said in a meaning
      tone: &ldquo;We have no doubt the opinion of the court could be taken. May
      I ask the name of the gentleman who has given us that striking piece of
      information? Mr. Soames Forsyte? Indeed!&rdquo; He looked from Soames to
      old Jolyon in a pointed manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flush coloured Soames&rsquo; pale cheeks, but his superciliousness did
      not waver. Old Jolyon fixed his eyes on the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the late superintendents brother-in-law
      has nothing more to say, I propose that the report and accounts....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, however, there rose one of those five silent, stolid
      shareholders, who had excited Soames&rsquo; sympathy. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deprecate the proposal altogether. We are expected to give
      charity to this man&rsquo;s wife and children, who, you tell us, were
      dependent on him. They may have been; I do not care whether they were or
      not. I object to the whole thing on principle. It is high time a stand was
      made against this sentimental humanitarianism. The country is eaten up
      with it. I object to my money being paid to these people of whom I know
      nothing, who have done nothing to earn it. I object in toto; it is not
      business. I now move that the report and accounts be put back, and amended
      by striking out the grant altogether.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon had remained standing while the strong, silent man was
      speaking. The speech awoke an echo in all hearts, voicing, as it did, the
      worship of strong men, the movement against generosity, which had at that
      time already commenced among the saner members of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words &lsquo;it is not business&rsquo; had moved even the Board;
      privately everyone felt that indeed it was not. But they knew also the
      chairman&rsquo;s domineering temper and tenacity. He, too, at heart must
      feel that it was not business; but he was committed to his own
      proposition. Would he go back upon it? It was thought to be unlikely.
    </p>
    <p>
      All waited with interest. Old Jolyon held up his hand; dark-rimmed glasses
      depending between his finger and thumb quivered slightly with a suggestion
      of menace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He addressed the strong, silent shareholder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowing, as you do, the efforts of our late superintendent upon the
      occasion of the explosion at the mines, do you seriously wish me to put
      that amendment, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon put the amendment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does anyone second this?&rdquo; he asked, looking calmly round.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was then that Soames, looking at his uncle, felt the power of will
      that was in that old man. No one stirred. Looking straight into the eyes
      of the strong, silent shareholder, old Jolyon said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I now move, &lsquo;That the report and accounts for the year 1886
      be received and adopted.&rsquo; You second that? Those in favour signify
      the same in the usual way. Contrary&mdash;no. Carried. The next business,
      gentlemen....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled. Certainly Uncle Jolyon had a way with him!
    </p>
    <p>
      But now his attention relapsed upon Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Odd how that fellow haunted his thoughts, even in business hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s visit to the house&mdash;but there was nothing in that,
      except that she might have told him; but then, again, she never did tell
      him anything. She was more silent, more touchy, every day. He wished to
      God the house were finished, and they were in it, away from London. Town
      did not suit her; her nerves were not strong enough. That nonsense of the
      separate room had cropped up again!
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting was breaking up now. Underneath the photograph of the lost
      shaft Hemmings was buttonholed by the Rev. Mr. Boms. Little Mr. Booker,
      his bristling eyebrows wreathed in angry smiles, was having a parting
      turn-up with old Scrubsole. The two hated each other like poison. There
      was some matter of a tar-contract between them, little Mr. Booker having
      secured it from the Board for a nephew of his, over old Scrubsole&rsquo;s
      head. Soames had heard that from Hemmings, who liked a gossip, more
      especially about his directors, except, indeed, old Jolyon, of whom he was
      afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames awaited his opportunity. The last shareholder was vanishing through
      the door, when he approached his uncle, who was putting on his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I speak to you for a minute, Uncle Jolyon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is uncertain what Soames expected to get out of this interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from that somewhat mysterious awe in which Forsytes in general held
      old Jolyon, due to his philosophic twist, or perhaps&mdash;as Hemmings
      would doubtless have said&mdash;to his chin, there was, and always had
      been, a subtle antagonism between the younger man and the old. It had
      lurked under their dry manner of greeting, under their non-committal
      allusions to each other, and arose perhaps from old Jolyon&rsquo;s
      perception of the quiet tenacity (&rsquo;.bstinacy,&rsquo; he rather
      naturally called it) of the young man, of a secret doubt whether he could
      get his own way with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both these Forsytes, wide asunder as the poles in many respects, possessed
      in their different ways&mdash;to a greater degree than the rest of the
      family&mdash;that essential quality of tenacious and prudent insight into
      &lsquo;affairs,&rsquo; which is the highwater mark of their great class.
      Either of them, with a little luck and opportunity, was equal to a lofty
      career; either of them would have made a good financier, a great
      contractor, a statesman, though old Jolyon, in certain of his moods when
      under the influence of a cigar or of Nature&mdash;would have been capable
      of, not perhaps despising, but certainly of questioning, his own high
      position, while Soames, who never smoked cigars, would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, in old Jolyon&rsquo;s mind there was always the secret ache,
      that the son of James&mdash;of James, whom he had always thought such a
      poor thing, should be pursuing the paths of success, while his own son...!
    </p>
    <p>
      And last, not least&mdash;for he was no more outside the radiation of
      family gossip than any other Forsyte&mdash;he had now heard the sinister,
      indefinite, but none the less disturbing rumour about Bosinney, and his
      pride was wounded to the quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characteristically, his irritation turned not against Irene but against
      Soames. The idea that his nephew&rsquo;s wife (why couldn&rsquo;t the
      fellow take better care of her&mdash;Oh! quaint injustice! as though
      Soames could possibly take more care!)&mdash;should be drawing to herself
      June&rsquo;s lover, was intolerably humiliating. And seeing the danger, he
      did not, like James, hide it away in sheer nervousness, but owned with the
      dispassion of his broader outlook, that it was not unlikely; there was
      something very attractive about Irene!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a presentiment on the subject of Soames&rsquo; communication as
      they left the Board Room together, and went out into the noise and hurry
      of Cheapside. They walked together a good minute without speaking, Soames
      with his mousing, mincing step, and old Jolyon upright and using his
      umbrella languidly as a walking-stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned presently into comparative quiet, for old Jolyon&rsquo;s way
      to a second Board led him in the direction of Moorage Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Soames, without lifting his eyes, began: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had this
      letter from Bosinney. You see what he says; I thought I&rsquo;d let you
      know. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot more than I intended on this house, and I
      want the position to be clear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon ran his eyes unwillingly over the letter: &ldquo;What he says
      is clear enough,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He talks about &lsquo;a free hand,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon looked at him. The long-suppressed irritation and antagonism
      towards this young fellow, whose affairs were beginning to intrude upon
      his own, burst from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t trust him, why do you employ him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stole a sideway look: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much too late to go into
      that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I only want it to be quite understood that if
      I give him a free hand, he doesn&rsquo;t let me in. I thought if you were
      to speak to him, it would carry more weight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said old Jolyon abruptly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing
      to do with it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of both uncle and nephew gave the impression of unspoken
      meanings, far more important, behind. And the look they interchanged was
      like a revelation of this consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;I thought, for June&rsquo;s sake,
      I&rsquo;d tell you, that&rsquo;s all; I thought you&rsquo;d better know I
      shan&rsquo;t stand any nonsense!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that to me?&rdquo; old Jolyon took him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Soames, and flurried by that
      sharp look he was unable to say more. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t
      tell you,&rdquo; he added sulkily, recovering his composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; said old Jolyon; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you
      mean. You come worrying me about a thing like this. I don&rsquo;t want to
      hear about your affairs; you must manage them yourself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Soames immovably, &ldquo;I will!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, then,&rdquo; said old Jolyon, and they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames retraced his steps, and going into a celebrated eating-house, asked
      for a plate of smoked salmon and a glass of Chablis; he seldom ate much in
      the middle of the day, and generally ate standing, finding the position
      beneficial to his liver, which was very sound, but to which he desired to
      put down all his troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished he went slowly back to his office, with bent head,
      taking no notice of the swarming thousands on the pavements, who in their
      turn took no notice of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening post carried the following reply to Bosinney:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;FORSYTE, BUSTARD AND FORSYTE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Commissioners for Oaths,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;92001, BRANCH LANE, POULTRY, E.C.,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May 17, 1887.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR BOSINNEY,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have, received your letter, the terms of which not a little
      surprise me. I was under the impression that you had, and have had all
      along, a &ldquo;free hand&rdquo;; for I do not recollect that any
      suggestions I have been so unfortunate as to make have met with your
      approval. In giving you, in accordance with your request, this &ldquo;free
      hand,&rdquo; I wish you to clearly understand that the total cost of the
      house as handed over to me completely decorated, inclusive of your fee (as
      arranged between us), must not exceed twelve thousand pounds&mdash;L12,000.
      This gives you an ample margin, and, as you know, is far more than I
      originally contemplated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;SOAMES FORSYTE.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day he received a note from Bosinney:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;PHILIP BAYNES BOSINNEY,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Architect,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;309D, SLOANE STREET, S.W.,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May 18.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR FORSYTE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you think that in such a delicate matter as decoration I can
      bind myself to the exact pound, I am afraid you are mistaken. I can see
      that you are tired of the arrangement, and of me, and I had better,
      therefore, resign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yours faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;PHILIP BAYNES BOSINNEY.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames pondered long and painfully over his answer, and late at night in
      the dining-room, when Irene had gone to bed, he composed the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;62, MONTPELLIER SQUARE, S.W.,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May 19, 1887.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR BOSINNEY,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think that in both our interests it would be extremely
      undesirable that matters should be so left at this stage. I did not mean
      to say that if you should exceed the sum named in my letter to you by ten
      or twenty or even fifty pounds, there would be any difficulty between us.
      This being so, I should like you to reconsider your answer. You have a
      &ldquo;free hand&rdquo; in the terms of this correspondence, and I hope
      you will see your way to completing the decorations, in the matter of
      which I know it is difficult to be absolutely exact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;SOAMES FORSYTE.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney&rsquo;s answer, which came in the course of the next day, was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May 20.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR FORSYTE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;OLD JOLYON AT THE ZOO
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon disposed of his second Meeting&mdash;an ordinary Board&mdash;summarily.
      He was so dictatorial that his fellow directors were left in cabal over
      the increasing domineeringness of old Forsyte, which they were far from
      intending to stand much longer, they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out by Underground to Portland Road Station, whence he took a cab
      and drove to the Zoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an assignation there, one of those assignations that had lately
      been growing more frequent, to which his increasing uneasiness about June
      and the &lsquo;change in her,&rsquo; as he expressed it, was driving him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She buried herself away, and was growing thin; if he spoke to her he got
      no answer, or had his head snapped off, or she looked as if she would
      burst into tears. She was as changed as she could be, all through this
      Bosinney. As for telling him about anything, not a bit of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      And he would sit for long spells brooding, his paper unread before him, a
      cigar extinct between his lips. She had been such a companion to him ever
      since she was three years old! And he loved her so!
    </p>
    <p>
      Forces regardless of family or class or custom were beating down his
      guard; impending events over which he had no control threw their shadows
      on his head. The irritation of one accustomed to have his way was roused
      against he knew not what.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chafing at the slowness of his cab, he reached the Zoo door; but, with his
      sunny instinct for seizing the good of each moment, he forgot his vexation
      as he walked towards the tryst.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the stone terrace above the bear-pit his son and his two
      grandchildren came hastening down when they saw old Jolyon coming, and led
      him away towards the lion-house. They supported him on either side,
      holding one to each of his hands,&mdash;whilst Jolly, perverse like his
      father, carried his grandfather&rsquo;s umbrella in such a way as to catch
      people&rsquo;s legs with the crutch of the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as good as a play to see his father with the children, but such a
      play as brings smiles with tears behind. An old man and two small children
      walking together can be seen at any hour of the day; but the sight of old
      Jolyon, with Jolly and Holly seemed to young Jolyon a special peep-show of
      the things that lie at the bottom of our hearts. The complete surrender of
      that erect old figure to those little figures on either hand was too
      poignantly tender, and, being a man of an habitual reflex action, young
      Jolyon swore softly under his breath. The show affected him in a way
      unbecoming to a Forsyte, who is nothing if not undemonstrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they reached the lion-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a morning fete at the Botanical Gardens, and a large number
      of Forsy...&rsquo;&mdash;that is, of well-dressed people who kept
      carriages had brought them on to the Zoo, so as to have more, if possible,
      for their money, before going back to Rutland Gate or Bryanston Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on to the Zoo,&rdquo; they had said to each other;
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be great fun!&rdquo; It was a shilling day; and there
      would not be all those horrid common people.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the long line of cages they were collected in rows, watching
      the tawny, ravenous beasts behind the bars await their only pleasure of
      the four-and-twenty hours. The hungrier the beast, the greater the
      fascination. But whether because the spectators envied his appetite, or,
      more humanely, because it was so soon to be satisfied, young Jolyon could
      not tell. Remarks kept falling on his ears: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a
      nasty-looking brute, that tiger!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, what a love! Look at
      his little mouth!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s rather nice! Don&rsquo;t
      go too near, mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And frequently, with little pats, one or another would clap their hands to
      their pockets behind and look round, as though expecting young Jolyon or
      some disinterested-looking person to relieve them of the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      A well-fed man in a white waistcoat said slowly through his teeth: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      all greed; they can&rsquo;t be hungry. Why, they take no exercise.&rdquo;
      At these words a tiger snatched a piece of bleeding liver, and the fat man
      laughed. His wife, in a Paris model frock and gold nose-nippers, reproved
      him: &ldquo;How can you laugh, Harry? Such a horrid sight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstances of his life, though he had ceased to take a too personal
      view of them, had left him subject to an intermittent contempt; and the
      class to which he had belonged&mdash;the carriage class&mdash;especially
      excited his sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      To shut up a lion or tiger in confinement was surely a horrible barbarity.
      But no cultivated person would admit this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of its being barbarous to confine wild animals had probably never
      even occurred to his father for instance; he belonged to the old school,
      who considered it at once humanizing and educational to confine baboons
      and panthers, holding the view, no doubt, that in course of time they
      might induce these creatures not so unreasonably to die of misery and
      heart-sickness against the bars of their cages, and put the society to the
      expense of getting others! In his eyes, as in the eyes of all Forsytes,
      the pleasure of seeing these beautiful creatures in a state of captivity
      far outweighed the inconvenience of imprisonment to beasts whom God had so
      improvidently placed in a state of freedom! It was for the animals good,
      removing them at once from the countless dangers of open air and exercise,
      and enabling them to exercise their functions in the guaranteed seclusion
      of a private compartment! Indeed, it was doubtful what wild animals were
      made for but to be shut up in cages!
    </p>
    <p>
      But as young Jolyon had in his constitution the elements of impartiality,
      he reflected that to stigmatize as barbarity that which was merely lack of
      imagination must be wrong; for none who held these views had been placed
      in a similar position to the animals they caged, and could not, therefore,
      be expected to enter into their sensations. It was not until they were
      leaving the gardens&mdash;Jolly and Holly in a state of blissful delirium&mdash;that
      old Jolyon found an opportunity of speaking to his son on the matter next
      his heart. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;if she&rsquo;s to go on as she&rsquo;s going on now, I can&rsquo;t
      tell what&rsquo;s to come. I wanted her to see the doctor, but she won&rsquo;t.
      She&rsquo;s not a bit like me. She&rsquo;s your mother all over. Obstinate
      as a mule! If she doesn&rsquo;t want to do a thing, she won&rsquo;t, and
      there&rsquo;s an end of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon smiled; his eyes had wandered to his father&rsquo;s chin.
      &lsquo;A pair of you,&rsquo; he thought, but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; went on old Jolyon, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s this
      Bosinney. I should like to punch the fellow&rsquo;s head, but I can&rsquo;t,
      I suppose, though&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see why you shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
      he added doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has he done? Far better that it should come to an end, if they
      don&rsquo;t hit it off!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon looked at his son. Now they had actually come to discuss a
      subject connected with the relations between the sexes he felt
      distrustful. Jo would be sure to hold some loose view or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know what you think,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I
      dare say your sympathy&rsquo;s with him&mdash;shouldn&rsquo;t be
      surprised; but I think he&rsquo;s behaving precious badly, and if he comes
      my way I shall tell him so.&rdquo; He dropped the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to discuss with his son the true nature and meaning of
      Bosinney&rsquo;s defection. Had not his son done the very same thing
      (worse, if possible) fifteen years ago? There seemed no end to the
      consequences of that piece of folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon also was silent; he had quickly penetrated his father&rsquo;s
      thought, for, dethroned from the high seat of an obvious and uncomplicated
      view of things, he had become both perceptive and subtle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attitude he had adopted towards sexual matters fifteen years before,
      however, was too different from his father&rsquo;s. There was no bridging
      the gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said coolly: &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s fallen in love with some other
      woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon gave him a dubious look: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;they say so!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, it&rsquo;s probably true,&rdquo; remarked young Jolyon
      unexpectedly; &ldquo;and I suppose they&rsquo;ve told you who she is?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said old Jolyon, &ldquo;Soames&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon did not whistle: The circumstances of his own life had
      rendered him incapable of whistling on such a subject, but he looked at
      his father, while the ghost of a smile hovered over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      If old Jolyon saw, he took no notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She and June were bosom friends!&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little June!&rdquo; said young Jolyon softly. He thought of
      his daughter still as a babe of three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon came to a sudden halt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      some old woman&rsquo;s tale. Get me a cab, Jo, I&rsquo;m tired to death!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood at a corner to see if an empty cab would come along, while
      carriage after carriage drove past, bearing Forsytes of all descriptions
      from the Zoo. The harness, the liveries, the gloss on the horses&rsquo;
      coats, shone and glittered in the May sunlight, and each equipage, landau,
      sociable, barouche, Victoria, or brougham, seemed to roll out proudly from
      its wheels:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I and my horses and my men you know,&rsquo; Indeed the whole
      turn-out have cost a pot. But we were worth it every penny. Look At Master
      and at Missis now, the dawgs! Ease with security&mdash;ah! that&rsquo;s
      the ticket!
    </p>
    <p>
      And such, as everyone knows, is fit accompaniment for a perambulating
      Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst these carriages was a barouche coming at a greater pace than the
      others, drawn by a pair of bright bay horses. It swung on its high
      springs, and the four people who filled it seemed rocked as in a cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chariot attracted young Jolyon&rsquo;s attention; and suddenly, on
      the back seat, he recognised his Uncle James, unmistakable in spite of the
      increased whiteness of his whiskers; opposite, their backs defended by
      sunshades, Rachel Forsyte and her elder but married sister, Winifred
      Dartie, in irreproachable toilettes, had posed their heads haughtily, like
      two of the birds they had been seeing at the Zoo; while by James&rsquo;
      side reclined Dartie, in a brand-new frock-coat buttoned tight and square,
      with a large expanse of carefully shot linen protruding below each
      wristband.
    </p>
    <p>
      An extra, if subdued, sparkle, an added touch of the best gloss or varnish
      characterized this vehicle, and seemed to distinguish it from all the
      others, as though by some happy extravagance&mdash;like that which marks
      out the real &lsquo;work of art&rsquo; from the ordinary &lsquo;picture&rsquo;&mdash;it
      were designated as the typical car, the very throne of Forsytedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon did not see them pass; he was petting poor Holly who was tired,
      but those in the carriage had taken in the little group; the ladies&rsquo;
      heads tilted suddenly, there was a spasmodic screening movement of
      parasols; James&rsquo; face protruded naively, like the head of a long
      bird, his mouth slowly opening. The shield-like rounds of the parasols
      grew smaller and smaller, and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon saw that he had been recognised, even by Winifred, who could
      not have been more than fifteen when he had forfeited the right to be
      considered a Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much change in them! He remembered the exact look of their
      turn-out all that time ago: Horses, men, carriage&mdash;all different now,
      no doubt&mdash;but of the precise stamp of fifteen years before; the same
      neat display, the same nicely calculated arrogance ease with security! The
      swing exact, the pose of the sunshades exact, exact the spirit of the
      whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the sunlight, defended by the haughty shields of parasols, carriage
      after carriage went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle James has just passed, with his female folk,&rdquo; said
      young Jolyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father looked black. &ldquo;Did your uncle see us? Yes? Hmph! What&rsquo;s
      he want, coming down into these parts?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An empty cab drove up at this moment, and old Jolyon stopped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see you again before long, my boy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you go paying any attention to what I&rsquo;ve been saying about young
      Bosinney&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kissing the children, who tried to detain him, he stepped in and was borne
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon, who had taken Holly up in his arms, stood motionless at the
      corner, looking after the cab.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;AFTERNOON AT TIMOTHY&rsquo;S
    </h2>
    <p>
      If old Jolyon, as he got into his cab, had said: &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t
      believe a word of it!&rsquo; he would more truthfully have expressed his
      sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notion that James and his womankind had seen him in the company of his
      son had awakened in him not only the impatience he always felt when
      crossed, but that secret hostility natural between brothers, the roots of
      which&mdash;little nursery rivalries&mdash;sometimes toughen and deepen as
      life goes on, and, all hidden, support a plant capable of producing in
      season the bitterest fruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto there had been between these six brothers no more unfriendly
      feeling than that caused by the secret and natural doubt that the others
      might be richer than themselves; a feeling increased to the pitch of
      curiosity by the approach of death&mdash;that end of all handicaps&mdash;and
      the great &lsquo;closeness&rsquo; of their man of business, who, with some
      sagacity, would profess to Nicholas ignorance of James&rsquo; income, to
      James ignorance of old Jolyon&rsquo;s, to Jolyon ignorance of Roger&rsquo;s,
      to Roger ignorance of Swithin&rsquo;s, while to Swithin he would say most
      irritatingly that Nicholas must be a rich man. Timothy alone was exempt,
      being in gilt-edged securities.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, between two of them at least, had arisen a very different sense
      of injury. From the moment when James had the impertinence to pry into his
      affairs&mdash;as he put it&mdash;old Jolyon no longer chose to credit this
      story about Bosinney. His grand-daughter slighted through a member of
      &lsquo;that fellow&rsquo;s&rsquo; family! He made up his mind that
      Bosinney was maligned. There must be some other reason for his defection.
    </p>
    <p>
      June had flown out at him, or something; she was as touchy as she could
      be!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would, however, let Timothy have a bit of his mind, and see if he would
      go on dropping hints! And he would not let the grass grow under his feet
      either, he would go there at once, and take very good care that he didn&rsquo;t
      have to go again on the same errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw James&rsquo; carriage blocking the pavement in front of &lsquo;The
      Bower.&rsquo; So they had got there before him&mdash;cackling about having
      seen him, he dared say! And further on, Swithin&rsquo;s greys were turning
      their noses towards the noses of James&rsquo; bays, as though in conclave
      over the family, while their coachmen were in conclave above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon, depositing his hat on the chair in the narrow hall, where that
      hat of Bosinney&rsquo;s had so long ago been mistaken for a cat, passed
      his thin hand grimly over his face with its great drooping white
      moustaches, as though to remove all traces of expression, and made his way
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the front drawing-room full. It was full enough at the best of
      times&mdash;without visitors&mdash;without any one in it&mdash;for Timothy
      and his sisters, following the tradition of their generation, considered
      that a room was not quite &lsquo;nice&rsquo; unless it was &lsquo;properly&rsquo;
      furnished. It held, therefore, eleven chairs, a sofa, three tables, two
      cabinets, innumerable knicknacks, and part of a large grand piano. And
      now, occupied by Mrs. Small, Aunt Hester, by Swithin, James, Rachel,
      Winifred, Euphemia, who had come in again to return &lsquo;Passion and
      Paregoric&rsquo; which she had read at lunch, and her chum Frances, Roger&rsquo;s
      daughter (the musical Forsyte, the one who composed songs), there was only
      one chair left unoccupied, except, of course, the two that nobody ever sat
      on&mdash;and the only standing room was occupied by the cat, on whom old
      Jolyon promptly stepped.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these days it was by no means unusual for Timothy to have so many
      visitors. The family had always, one and all, had a real respect for Aunt
      Ann, and now that she was gone, they were coming far more frequently to
      The Bower, and staying longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin had been the first to arrive, and seated torpid in a red satin
      chair with a gilt back, he gave every appearance of lasting the others
      out. And symbolizing Bosinney&rsquo;s name &lsquo;the big one,&rsquo; with
      his great stature and bulk, his thick white hair, his puffy immovable
      shaven face, he looked more primeval than ever in the highly upholstered
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His conversation, as usual of late, had turned at once upon Irene, and he
      had lost no time in giving Aunts Juley and Hester his opinion with regard
      to this rumour he heard was going about. No&mdash;as he said&mdash;she
      might want a bit of flirtation&mdash;a pretty woman must have her fling;
      but more than that he did not believe. Nothing open; she had too much good
      sense, too much proper appreciation of what was due to her position, and
      to the family! No sc&mdash;, he was going to say &lsquo;scandal&rsquo; but
      the very idea was so preposterous that he waved his hand as though to say&mdash;&rsquo;but
      let that pass!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Granted that Swithin took a bachelor&rsquo;s view of the situation&mdash;still
      what indeed was not due to that family in which so many had done so well
      for themselves, had attained a certain position? If he had heard in dark,
      pessimistic moments the words &lsquo;yeomen&rsquo; and &lsquo;very small
      beer&rsquo; used in connection with his origin, did he believe them?
    </p>
    <p>
      No! he cherished, hugging it pathetically to his bosom the secret theory
      that there was something distinguished somewhere in his ancestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must be,&rdquo; he once said to young Jolyon, before the latter
      went to the bad. &ldquo;Look at us, we&rsquo;ve got on! There must be good
      blood in us somewhere.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been fond of young Jolyon: the boy had been in a good set at
      College, had known that old ruffian Sir Charles Fiste&rsquo;s sons&mdash;a
      pretty rascal one of them had turned out, too; and there was style about
      him&mdash;it was a thousand pities he had run off with that half-foreign
      governess! If he must go off like that why couldn&rsquo;t he have chosen
      someone who would have done them credit! And what was he now?&mdash;an
      underwriter at Lloyd&rsquo;s; they said he even painted pictures&mdash;pictures!
      Damme! he might have ended as Sir Jolyon Forsyte, Bart., with a seat in
      Parliament, and a place in the country!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Swithin who, following the impulse which sooner or later urges
      thereto some member of every great family, went to the Heralds&rsquo;
      Office, where they assured him that he was undoubtedly of the same family
      as the well-known Forsites with an &lsquo;i,&rsquo; whose arms were
      &lsquo;three dexter buckles on a sable ground gules,&rsquo; hoping no
      doubt to get him to take them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin, however, did not do this, but having ascertained that the crest
      was a &lsquo;pheasant proper,&rsquo; and the motto &lsquo;For Forsite,&rsquo;
      he had the pheasant proper placed upon his carriage and the buttons of his
      coachman, and both crest and motto on his writing-paper. The arms he
      hugged to himself, partly because, not having paid for them, he thought it
      would look ostentatious to put them on his carriage, and he hated
      ostentation, and partly because he, like any practical man all over the
      country, had a secret dislike and contempt for things he could not
      understand he found it hard, as anyone might, to swallow &lsquo;three
      dexter buckles on a sable ground gules.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He never forgot, however, their having told him that if he paid for them
      he would be entitled to use them, and it strengthened his conviction that
      he was a gentleman. Imperceptibly the rest of the family absorbed the
      &lsquo;pheasant proper,&rsquo; and some, more serious than others, adopted
      the motto; old Jolyon, however, refused to use the latter, saying that it
      was humbug meaning nothing, so far as he could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the older generation it was perhaps known at bottom from what great
      historical event they derived their crest; and if pressed on the subject,
      sooner than tell a lie&mdash;they did not like telling lies, having an
      impression that only Frenchmen and Russians told them&mdash;they would
      confess hurriedly that Swithin had got hold of it somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the younger generation the matter was wrapped in a discretion
      proper. They did not want to hurt the feelings of their elders, nor to
      feel ridiculous themselves; they simply used the crest....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Swithin, &ldquo;he had had an opportunity of seeing
      for himself, and what he should say was, that there was nothing in her
      manner to that young Buccaneer or Bosinney or whatever his name was,
      different from her manner to himself; in fact, he should rather say....&rdquo;
      But here the entrance of Frances and Euphemia put an unfortunate stop to
      the conversation, for this was not a subject which could be discussed
      before young people.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though Swithin was somewhat upset at being stopped like this on the
      point of saying something important, he soon recovered his affability. He
      was rather fond of Frances&mdash;Francie, as she was called in the family.
      She was so smart, and they told him she made a pretty little pot of
      pin-money by her songs; he called it very clever of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rather prided himself indeed on a liberal attitude towards women, not
      seeing any reason why they shouldn&rsquo;t paint pictures, or write tunes,
      or books even, for the matter of that, especially if they could turn a
      useful penny by it; not at all&mdash;kept them out of mischief. It was not
      as if they were men!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Little Francie,&rsquo; as she was usually called with good-natured
      contempt, was an important personage, if only as a standing illustration
      of the attitude of Forsytes towards the Arts. She was not really &lsquo;little,&rsquo;
      but rather tall, with dark hair for a Forsyte, which, together with a grey
      eye, gave her what was called &lsquo;a Celtic appearance.&rsquo; She wrote
      songs with titles like &lsquo;Breathing Sighs,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Kiss me,
      Mother, ere I die,&rsquo; with a refrain like an anthem:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &lsquo;Kiss me, Mother, ere I die;
     Kiss me-kiss me, Mother, ah!
     Kiss, ah! kiss me e-ere I&mdash;
     Kiss me, Mother, ere I d-d-die!&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      She wrote the words to them herself, and other poems. In lighter moments
      she wrote waltzes, one of which, the &lsquo;Kensington Coil,&rsquo; was
      almost national to Kensington, having a sweet dip in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very original. Then there were her &lsquo;Songs for Little People,&rsquo;
      at once educational and witty, especially &lsquo;Gran&rsquo;ma&rsquo;s
      Porgie,&rsquo; and that ditty, almost prophetically imbued with the coming
      Imperial spirit, entitled &lsquo;Black Him In His Little Eye.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Any publisher would take these, and reviews like &lsquo;High Living,&rsquo;
      and the &lsquo;Ladies&rsquo; Genteel Guide&rsquo; went into raptures over:
      &lsquo;Another of Miss Francie Forsyte&rsquo;s spirited ditties, sparkling
      and pathetic. We ourselves were moved to tears and laughter. Miss Forsyte
      should go far.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With the true instinct of her breed, Francie had made a point of knowing
      the right people&mdash;people who would write about her, and talk about
      her, and people in Society, too&mdash;keeping a mental register of just
      where to exert her fascinations, and an eye on that steady scale of rising
      prices, which in her mind&rsquo;s eye represented the future. In this way
      she caused herself to be universally respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, at a time when her emotions were whipped by an attachment&mdash;for
      the tenor of Roger&rsquo;s life, with its whole-hearted collection of
      house property, had induced in his only daughter a tendency towards
      passion&mdash;she turned to great and sincere work, choosing the sonata
      form, for the violin. This was the only one of her productions that
      troubled the Forsytes. They felt at once that it would not sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger, who liked having a clever daughter well enough, and often alluded
      to the amount of pocket-money she made for herself, was upset by this
      violin sonata.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish like that!&rdquo; he called it. Francie had borrowed young
      Flageoletti from Euphemia, to play it in the drawing-room at Prince&rsquo;s
      Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact Roger was right. It was rubbish, but&mdash;annoying!
      the sort of rubbish that wouldn&rsquo;t sell. As every Forsyte knows,
      rubbish that sells is not rubbish at all&mdash;far from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, in spite of the sound common sense which fixed the worth of art
      at what it would fetch, some of the Forsytes&mdash;Aunt Hester, for
      instance, who had always been musical&mdash;could not help regretting that
      Francie&rsquo;s music was not &lsquo;classical&rsquo;. the same with her
      poems. But then, as Aunt Hester said, they didn&rsquo;t see any poetry
      nowadays, all the poems were &lsquo;little light things.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nobody who could write a poem like &lsquo;Paradise Lost,&rsquo;
      or &lsquo;Childe Harold&rsquo;. either of which made you feel that you
      really had read something. Still, it was nice for Francie to have
      something to occupy her; while other girls were spending money shopping
      she was making it!
    </p>
    <p>
      And both Aunt Hester and Aunt Juley were always ready to listen to the
      latest story of how Francie had got her price increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      They listened now, together with Swithin, who sat pretending not to, for
      these young people talked so fast and mumbled so, he never could catch
      what they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Septimus, &ldquo;how you
      do it. I should never have the audacity!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie smiled lightly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather deal with a man than
      a woman. Women are so sharp!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Small, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re
      not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Euphemia went off into her silent laugh, and, ending with the squeak,
      said, as though being strangled: &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll kill me some day,
      auntie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin saw no necessity to laugh; he detested people laughing when he
      himself perceived no joke. Indeed, he detested Euphemia altogether, to
      whom he always alluded as &lsquo;Nick&rsquo;s daughter, what&rsquo;s she
      called&mdash;the pale one?&rsquo; He had just missed being her god-father&mdash;indeed,
      would have been, had he not taken a firm stand against her outlandish
      name. He hated becoming a godfather. Swithin then said to Francie with
      dignity: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day&mdash;er&mdash;for the time of year.&rdquo;
      But Euphemia, who knew perfectly well that he had refused to be her
      godfather, turned to Aunt Hester, and began telling her how she had seen
      Irene&mdash;Mrs. Soames&mdash;at the Church and Commercial Stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Soames was with her?&rdquo; said Aunt Hester, to whom Mrs.
      Small had as yet had no opportunity of relating the incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soames with her? Of course not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But was she all alone in London?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; there was Mr. Bosinney with her. She was perfectly dressed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Swithin, hearing the name Irene, looked severely at Euphemia, who, it
      is true, never did look well in a dress, whatever she may have done on
      other occasions, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dressed like a lady, I&rsquo;ve no doubt. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to
      see her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment James and his daughters were announced. Dartie, feeling
      badly in want of a drink, had pleaded an appointment with his dentist,
      and, being put down at the Marble Arch, had got into a hansom, and was
      already seated in the window of his club in Piccadilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, he told his cronies, had wanted to take him to pay some calls.
      It was not in his line&mdash;not exactly. Haw!
    </p>
    <p>
      Hailing the waiter, he sent him out to the hall to see what had won the
      4.30 race. He was dog-tired, he said, and that was a fact; had been drivin&rsquo;
      about with his wife to &lsquo;shows&rsquo; all the afternoon. Had put his
      foot down at last. A fellow must live his own life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, glancing out of the bay window&mdash;for he loved this
      seat whence he could see everybody pass&mdash;his eye unfortunately, or
      perhaps fortunately, chanced to light on the figure of Soames, who was
      mousing across the road from the Green Park-side, with the evident
      intention of coming in, for he, too, belonged to &lsquo;The Iseeum.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie sprang to his feet; grasping his glass, he muttered something about
      &lsquo;that 4.30 race,&rsquo; and swiftly withdrew to the card-room, where
      Soames never came. Here, in complete isolation and a dim light, he lived
      his own life till half past seven, by which hour he knew Soames must
      certainly have left the club.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not do, as he kept repeating to himself whenever he felt the
      impulse to join the gossips in the bay-window getting too strong for him&mdash;it
      absolutely would not do, with finances as low as his, and the &lsquo;old
      man&rsquo; (James) rusty ever since that business over the oil shares,
      which was no fault of his, to risk a row with Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Soames were to see him in the club it would be sure to come round to
      her that he wasn&rsquo;t at the dentist&rsquo;s at all. He never knew a
      family where things &lsquo;came round&rsquo; so. Uneasily, amongst the
      green baize card-tables, a frown on his olive coloured face, his check
      trousers crossed, and patent-leather boots shining through the gloom, he
      sat biting his forefinger, and wondering where the deuce he was to get the
      money if Erotic failed to win the Lancashire Cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts turned gloomily to the Forsytes. What a set they were! There
      was no getting anything out of them&mdash;at least, it was a matter of
      extreme difficulty. They were so d&mdash;-d particular about money
      matters; not a sportsman amongst the lot, unless it were George. That
      fellow Soames, for instance, would have a fit if you tried to borrow a
      tenner from him, or, if he didn&rsquo;t have a fit, he looked at you with
      his cursed supercilious smile, as if you were a lost soul because you were
      in want of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that wife of his (Dartie&rsquo;s mouth watered involuntarily), he had
      tried to be on good terms with her, as one naturally would with any pretty
      sister-in-law, but he would be cursed if the (he mentally used a coarse
      word)&mdash;would have anything to say to him&mdash;she looked at him,
      indeed, as if he were dirt&mdash;and yet she could go far enough, he
      wouldn&rsquo;t mind betting. He knew women; they weren&rsquo;t made with
      soft eyes and figures like that for nothing, as that fellow Soames would
      jolly soon find out, if there were anything in what he had heard about
      this Buccaneer Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising from his chair, Dartie took a turn across the room, ending in front
      of the looking-glass over the marble chimney-piece; and there he stood for
      a long time contemplating in the glass the reflection of his face. It had
      that look, peculiar to some men, of having been steeped in linseed oil,
      with its waxed dark moustaches and the little distinguished commencements
      of side whiskers; and concernedly he felt the promise of a pimple on the
      side of his slightly curved and fattish nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime old Jolyon had found the remaining chair in Timothy&rsquo;s
      commodious drawing-room. His advent had obviously put a stop to the
      conversation, decided awkwardness having set in. Aunt Juley, with her
      well-known kindheartedness, hastened to set people at their ease again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Jolyon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we were just saying that you
      haven&rsquo;t been here for a long time; but we mustn&rsquo;t be
      surprised. You&rsquo;re busy, of course? James was just saying what a busy
      time of year....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he?&rdquo; said old Jolyon, looking hard at James. &ldquo;It
      wouldn&rsquo;t be half so busy if everybody minded their own business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James, brooding in a small chair from which his knees ran uphill, shifted
      his feet uneasily, and put one of them down on the cat, which had unwisely
      taken refuge from old Jolyon beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, you&rsquo;ve got a cat here,&rdquo; he said in an injured
      voice, withdrawing his foot nervously as he felt it squeezing into the
      soft, furry body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Several,&rdquo; said old Jolyon, looking at one face and another;
      &ldquo;I trod on one just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Small, twisting her fingers and gazing round with &lsquo;pathetic
      calm&rsquo;, asked: &ldquo;And how is dear June?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A twinkle of humour shot through the sternness of old Jolyon&rsquo;s eyes.
      Extraordinary old woman, Juley! No one quite like her for saying the wrong
      thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;London don&rsquo;t agree with her&mdash;too
      many people about, too much clatter and chatter by half.&rdquo; He laid
      emphasis on the words, and again looked James in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feeling of its being too dangerous to take a step in any direction, or
      hazard any remark, had fallen on them all. Something of the sense of the
      impending, that comes over the spectator of a Greek tragedy, had entered
      that upholstered room, filled with those white-haired, frock-coated old
      men, and fashionably attired women, who were all of the same blood,
      between all of whom existed an unseizable resemblance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that they were conscious of it&mdash;the visits of such fateful,
      bitter spirits are only felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Swithin rose. He would not sit there, feeling like that&mdash;he was
      not to be put down by anyone! And, manoeuvring round the room with added
      pomp, he shook hands with each separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell Timothy from me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he coddles
      himself too much!&rdquo; Then, turning to Francie, whom he considered
      &lsquo;smart,&rsquo; he added: &ldquo;You come with me for a drive one of
      these days.&rdquo; But this conjured up the vision of that other eventful
      drive which had been so much talked about, and he stood quite still for a
      second, with glassy eyes, as though waiting to catch up with the
      significance of what he himself had said; then, suddenly recollecting that
      he didn&rsquo;t care a damn, he turned to old Jolyon: &ldquo;Well,
      good-bye, Jolyon! You shouldn&rsquo;t go about without an overcoat; you&rsquo;ll
      be getting sciatica or something!&rdquo; And, kicking the cat slightly
      with the pointed tip of his patent leather boot, he took his huge form
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone everyone looked secretly at the others, to see how they
      had taken the mention of the word &lsquo;drive&rsquo;&mdash;the word which
      had become famous, and acquired an overwhelming importance, as the only
      official&mdash;so to speak&mdash;news in connection with the vague and
      sinister rumour clinging to the family tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Euphemia, yielding to an impulse, said with a short laugh: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      glad Uncle Swithin doesn&rsquo;t ask me to go for drives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small, to reassure her and smooth over any little awkwardness the
      subject might have, replied: &ldquo;My dear, he likes to take somebody
      well dressed, who will do him a little credit. I shall never forget the
      drive he took me. It was an experience!&rdquo; And her chubby round old
      face was spread for a moment with a strange contentment; then broke into
      pouts, and tears came into her eyes. She was thinking of that long ago
      driving tour she had once taken with Septimus Small.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, who had relapsed into his nervous brooding in the little chair,
      suddenly roused himself: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a funny fellow, Swithin,&rdquo;
      he said, but in a half-hearted way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon&rsquo;s silence, his stern eyes, held them all in a kind of
      paralysis. He was disconcerted himself by the effect of his own words&mdash;an
      effect which seemed to deepen the importance of the very rumour he had
      come to scotch; but he was still angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not done with them yet&mdash;No, no&mdash;he would give them
      another rub or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not wish to rub his nieces, he had no quarrel with them&mdash;a
      young and presentable female always appealed to old Jolyon&rsquo;s
      clemency&mdash;but that fellow James, and, in a less degree perhaps, those
      others, deserved all they would get. And he, too, asked for Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As though feeling that some danger threatened her younger brother, Aunt
      Juley suddenly offered him tea: &ldquo;There it is,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;all cold and nasty, waiting for you in the back drawing room, but
      Smither shall make you some fresh.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon rose: &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, looking straight at
      James, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve no time for tea, and&mdash;scandal, and the
      rest of it! It&rsquo;s time I was at home. Good-bye, Julia; good-bye,
      Hester; good-bye, Winifred.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without more ceremonious adieux, he marched out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again in his cab, his anger evaporated, for so it ever was with his
      wrath&mdash;when he had rapped out, it was gone. Sadness came over his
      spirit. He had stopped their mouths, maybe, but at what a cost! At the
      cost of certain knowledge that the rumour he had been resolved not to
      believe was true. June was abandoned, and for the wife of that fellow&rsquo;s
      son! He felt it was true, and hardened himself to treat it as if it were
      not; but the pain he hid beneath this resolution began slowly, surely, to
      vent itself in a blind resentment against James and his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The six women and one man left behind in the little drawing-room began
      talking as easily as might be after such an occurrence, for though each
      one of them knew for a fact that he or she never talked scandal, each one
      of them also knew that the other six did; all were therefore angry and at
      a loss. James only was silent, disturbed, to the bottom of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Francie said: &ldquo;Do you know, I think Uncle Jolyon is
      terribly changed this last year. What do you think, Aunt Hester?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester made a little movement of recoil: &ldquo;Oh, ask your Aunt
      Julia!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I know nothing about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No one else was afraid of assenting, and James muttered gloomily at the
      floor: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not half the man he was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed it a long time,&rdquo; went on Francie; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
      aged tremendously.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley shook her head; her face seemed suddenly to have become one
      immense pout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor dear Jolyon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;somebody ought to see to
      it for him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was again silence; then, as though in terror of being left
      solitarily behind, all five visitors rose simultaneously, and took their
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small, Aunt Hester, and their cat were left once more alone, the
      sound of a door closing in the distance announced the approach of Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, when Aunt Hester had just got off to sleep in the back
      bedroom that used to be Aunt Juley&rsquo;s before Aunt Juley took Aunt Ann&rsquo;s,
      her door was opened, and Mrs. Small, in a pink night-cap, a candle in her
      hand, entered: &ldquo;Hester!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hester!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester faintly rustled the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hester,&rdquo; repeated Aunt Juley, to make quite sure that she had
      awakened her, &ldquo;I am quite troubled about poor dear Jolyon. What,&rdquo;
      Aunt Juley dwelt on the word, &ldquo;do you think ought to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester again rustled the sheet, her voice was heard faintly pleading:
      &ldquo;Done? How should I know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Juley turned away satisfied, and closing the door with extra
      gentleness so as not to disturb dear Hester, let it slip through her
      fingers and fall to with a &lsquo;crack.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in her own room, she stood at the window gazing at the moon over the
      trees in the Park, through a chink in the muslin curtains, close drawn
      lest anyone should see. And there, with her face all round and pouting in
      its pink cap, and her eyes wet, she thought of &lsquo;dear Jolyon,&rsquo;
      so old and so lonely, and how she could be of some use to him; and how he
      would come to love her, as she had never been loved since&mdash;since poor
      Septimus went away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;DANCE AT ROGER&rsquo;S
    </h2>
    <p>
      Roger&rsquo;s house in Prince&rsquo;s Gardens was brilliantly alight.
      Large numbers of wax candles had been collected and placed in cut-glass
      chandeliers, and the parquet floor of the long, double drawing-room
      reflected these constellations. An appearance of real spaciousness had
      been secured by moving out all the furniture on to the upper landings, and
      enclosing the room with those strange appendages of civilization known as
      &lsquo;rout&rsquo; seats. In a remote corner, embowered in palms, was a
      cottage piano, with a copy of the &lsquo;Kensington Coil&rsquo; open on
      the music-stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roger had objected to a band. He didn&rsquo;t see in the least what they
      wanted with a band; he wouldn&rsquo;t go to the expense, and there was an
      end of it. Francie (her mother, whom Roger had long since reduced to
      chronic dyspepsia, went to bed on such occasions), had been obliged to
      content herself with supplementing the piano by a young man who played the
      cornet, and she so arranged with palms that anyone who did not look into
      the heart of things might imagine there were several musicians secreted
      there. She made up her mind to tell them to play loud&mdash;there was a
      lot of music in a cornet, if the man would only put his soul into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the more cultivated American tongue, she was &lsquo;through&rsquo; at
      last&mdash;through that tortuous labyrinth of make-shifts, which must be
      traversed before fashionable display can be combined with the sound
      economy of a Forsyte. Thin but brilliant, in her maize-coloured frock with
      much tulle about the shoulders, she went from place to place, fitting on
      her gloves, and casting her eye over it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the hired butler (for Roger only kept maids) she spoke about the wine.
      Did he quite understand that Mr. Forsyte wished a dozen bottles of the
      champagne from Whiteley&rsquo;s to be put out? But if that were finished
      (she did not suppose it would be, most of the ladies would drink water, no
      doubt), but if it were, there was the champagne cup, and he must do the
      best he could with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hated having to say this sort of thing to a butler, it was so infra
      dig.; but what could you do with father? Roger, indeed, after making
      himself consistently disagreeable about the dance, would come down
      presently, with his fresh colour and bumpy forehead, as though he had been
      its promoter; and he would smile, and probably take the prettiest woman in
      to supper; and at two o&rsquo;clock, just as they were getting into the
      swing, he would go up secretly to the musicians and tell them to play
      &lsquo;God Save the Queen,&rsquo; and go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francie devoutly hoped he might soon get tired, and slip off to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three or four devoted girl friends who were staying in the house for
      this dance had partaken with her, in a small, abandoned room upstairs, of
      tea and cold chicken-legs, hurriedly served; the men had been sent out to
      dine at Eustace&rsquo;s Club, it being felt that they must be fed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctually on the stroke of nine arrived Mrs. Small alone. She made
      elaborate apologies for the absence of Timothy, omitting all mention of
      Aunt Hester, who, at the last minute, had said she could not be bothered.
      Francie received her effusively, and placed her on a rout seat, where she
      left her, pouting and solitary in lavender-coloured satin&mdash;the first
      time she had worn colour since Aunt Ann&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devoted maiden friends came now from their rooms, each by magic
      arrangement in a differently coloured frock, but all with the same liberal
      allowance of tulle on the shoulders and at the bosom&mdash;for they were,
      by some fatality, lean to a girl. They were all taken up to Mrs. Small.
      None stayed with her more than a few seconds, but clustering together
      talked and twisted their programmes, looking secretly at the door for the
      first appearance of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then arrived in a group a number of Nicholases, always punctual&mdash;the
      fashion up Ladbroke Grove way; and close behind them Eustace and his men,
      gloomy and smelling rather of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four of Francie&rsquo;s lovers now appeared, one after the other;
      she had made each promise to come early. They were all clean-shaven and
      sprightly, with that peculiar kind of young-man sprightliness which had
      recently invaded Kensington; they did not seem to mind each other&rsquo;s
      presence in the least, and wore their ties bunching out at the ends, white
      waistcoats, and socks with clocks. All had handkerchiefs concealed in
      their cuffs. They moved buoyantly, each armoured in professional gaiety,
      as though he had come to do great deeds. Their faces when they danced, far
      from wearing the traditional solemn look of the dancing Englishman, were
      irresponsible, charming, suave; they bounded, twirling their partners at
      great pace, without pedantic attention to the rhythm of the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      At other dancers they looked with a kind of airy scorn&mdash;they, the
      light brigade, the heroes of a hundred Kensington &lsquo;hops&rsquo;&mdash;from
      whom alone could the right manner and smile and step be hoped.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the stream came fast; chaperones silting up along the wall
      facing the entrance, the volatile element swelling the eddy in the larger
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men were scarce, and wallflowers wore their peculiar, pathetic expression,
      a patient, sourish smile which seemed to say: &ldquo;Oh, no! don&rsquo;t
      mistake me, I know you are not coming up to me. I can hardly expect that!&rdquo;
      And Francie would plead with one of her lovers, or with some callow youth:
      &ldquo;Now, to please me, do let me introduce you to Miss Pink; such a
      nice girl, really!&rdquo; and she would bring him up, and say: &ldquo;Miss
      Pink&mdash;Mr. Gathercole. Can you spare him a dance?&rdquo; Then Miss
      Pink, smiling her forced smile, colouring a little, answered: &ldquo;Oh! I
      think so!&rdquo; and screening her empty card, wrote on it the name of
      Gathercole, spelling it passionately in the district that he proposed,
      about the second extra.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the youth had murmured that it was hot, and passed, she relapsed
      into her attitude of hopeless expectation, into her patient, sourish
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mothers, slowly fanning their faces, watched their daughters, and in their
      eyes could be read all the story of those daughters&rsquo; fortunes. As
      for themselves, to sit hour after hour, dead tired, silent, or talking
      spasmodically&mdash;what did it matter, so long as the girls were having a
      good time! But to see them neglected and passed by! Ah! they smiled, but
      their eyes stabbed like the eyes of an offended swan; they longed to pluck
      young Gathercole by the slack of his dandified breeches, and drag him to
      their daughters&mdash;the jackanapes!
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the cruelties and hardness of life, its pathos and unequal
      chances, its conceit, self-forgetfulness, and patience, were presented on
      the battle-field of this Kensington ball-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there, too, lovers&mdash;not lovers like Francie&rsquo;s, a
      peculiar breed, but simply lovers&mdash;trembling, blushing, silent,
      sought each other by flying glances, sought to meet and touch in the mazes
      of the dance, and now and again dancing together, struck some beholder by
      the light in their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a second before ten o&rsquo;clock came the Jameses&mdash;Emily,
      Rachel, Winifred (Dartie had been left behind, having on a former occasion
      drunk too much of Roger&rsquo;s champagne), and Cicely, the youngest,
      making her debut; behind them, following in a hansom from the paternal
      mansion where they had dined, Soames and Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these ladies had shoulder-straps and no tulle&mdash;thus showing at
      once, by a bolder exposure of flesh, that they came from the more
      fashionable side of the Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, sidling back from the contact of the dancers, took up a position
      against the wall. Guarding himself with his pale smile, he stood watching.
      Waltz after waltz began and ended, couple after couple brushed by with
      smiling lips, laughter, and snatches of talk; or with set lips, and eyes
      searching the throng; or again, with silent, parted lips, and eyes on each
      other. And the scent of festivity, the odour of flowers, and hair, of
      essences that women love, rose suffocatingly in the heat of the summer
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent, with something of scorn in his smile, Soames seemed to notice
      nothing; but now and again his eyes, finding that which they sought, would
      fix themselves on a point in the shifting throng, and the smile die off
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He danced with no one. Some fellows danced with their wives; his sense of
      &lsquo;form&rsquo; had never permitted him to dance with Irene since their
      marriage, and the God of the Forsytes alone can tell whether this was a
      relief to him or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed, dancing with other men, her dress, iris-coloured, floating
      away from her feet. She danced well; he was tired of hearing women say
      with an acid smile: &ldquo;How beautifully your wife dances, Mr. Forsyte&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      quite a pleasure to watch her!&rdquo; Tired of answering them with his
      sidelong glance: &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A young couple close by flirted a fan by turns, making an unpleasant
      draught. Francie and one of her lovers stood near. They were talking of
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard Roger&rsquo;s voice behind, giving an order about supper to a
      servant. Everything was very second-class! He wished that he had not come!
      He had asked Irene whether she wanted him; she had answered with that
      maddening smile of hers &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had he come? For the last quarter of an hour he had not even seen her.
      Here was George advancing with his Quilpish face; it was too late to get
      out of his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen &lsquo;The Buccaneer&rsquo;.&rdquo; said this
      licensed wag; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s on the warpath&mdash;hair cut and
      everything!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames said he had not, and crossing the room, half-empty in an interval
      of the dance, he went out on the balcony, and looked down into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      A carriage had driven up with late arrivals, and round the door hung some
      of those patient watchers of the London streets who spring up to the call
      of light or music; their faces, pale and upturned above their black and
      rusty figures, had an air of stolid watching that annoyed Soames. Why were
      they allowed to hang about; why didn&rsquo;t the bobby move them on?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the policeman took no notice of them; his feet were planted apart on
      the strip of crimson carpet stretched across the pavement; his face, under
      the helmet, wore the same stolid, watching look as theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the road, through the railings, Soames could see the branches of
      trees shining, faintly stirring in the breeze, by the gleam of the street
      lamps; beyond, again, the upper lights of the houses on the other side, so
      many eyes looking down on the quiet blackness of the garden; and over all,
      the sky, that wonderful London sky, dusted with the innumerable reflection
      of countless lamps; a dome woven over between its stars with the
      refraction of human needs and human fancies&mdash;immense mirror of pomp
      and misery that night after night stretches its kindly mocking over miles
      of houses and gardens, mansions and squalor, over Forsytes, policemen, and
      patient watchers in the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned away, and, hidden in the recess, gazed into the lighted
      room. It was cooler out there. He saw the new arrivals, June and her
      grandfather, enter. What had made them so late? They stood by the doorway.
      They looked fagged. Fancy Uncle Jolyon turning out at this time of night!
      Why hadn&rsquo;t June come to Irene, as she usually did, and it occurred
      to him suddenly that he had seen nothing of June for a long time now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching her face with idle malice, he saw it change, grow so pale that he
      thought she would drop, then flame out crimson. Turning to see at what she
      was looking, he saw his wife on Bosinney&rsquo;s arm, coming from the
      conservatory at the end of the room. Her eyes were raised to his, as
      though answering some question he had asked, and he was gazing at her
      intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked again at June. Her hand rested on old Jolyon&rsquo;s arm;
      she seemed to be making a request. He saw a surprised look on his uncle&rsquo;s
      face; they turned and passed through the door out of his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music began again&mdash;a waltz&mdash;and, still as a statue in the
      recess of the window, his face unmoved, but no smile on his lips, Soames
      waited. Presently, within a yard of the dark balcony, his wife and
      Bosinney passed. He caught the perfume of the gardenias that she wore, saw
      the rise and fall of her bosom, the languor in her eyes, her parted lips,
      and a look on her face that he did not know. To the slow, swinging measure
      they danced by, and it seemed to him that they clung to each other; he saw
      her raise her eyes, soft and dark, to Bosinney&rsquo;s, and drop them
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very white, he turned back to the balcony, and leaning on it, gazed down
      on the Square; the figures were still there looking up at the light with
      dull persistency, the policeman&rsquo;s face, too, upturned, and staring,
      but he saw nothing of them. Below, a carriage drew up, two figures got in,
      and drove away....
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening June and old Jolyon sat down to dinner at the usual hour. The
      girl was in her customary high-necked frock, old Jolyon had not dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast she had spoken of the dance at Uncle Roger&rsquo;s, she
      wanted to go; she had been stupid enough, she said, not to think of asking
      anyone to take her. It was too late now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon lifted his keen eyes. June was used to go to dances with Irene
      as a matter of course! and deliberately fixing his gaze on her, he asked:
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get Irene?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No! June did not want to ask Irene; she would only go if&mdash;if her
      grandfather wouldn&rsquo;t mind just for once for a little time!
    </p>
    <p>
      At her look, so eager and so worn, old Jolyon had grumblingly consented.
      He did not know what she wanted, he said, with going to a dance like this,
      a poor affair, he would wager; and she no more fit for it than a cat! What
      she wanted was sea air, and after his general meeting of the Globular Gold
      Concessions he was ready to take her. She didn&rsquo;t want to go away?
      Ah! she would knock herself up! Stealing a mournful look at her, he went
      on with his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      June went out early, and wandered restlessly about in the heat. Her little
      light figure that lately had moved so languidly about its business, was
      all on fire. She bought herself some flowers. She wanted&mdash;she meant
      to look her best. He would be there! She knew well enough that he had a
      card. She would show him that she did not care. But deep down in her heart
      she resolved that evening to win him back. She came in flushed, and talked
      brightly all lunch; old Jolyon was there, and he was deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon she was overtaken by a desperate fit of sobbing. She
      strangled the noise against the pillows of her bed, but when at last it
      ceased she saw in the glass a swollen face with reddened eyes, and violet
      circles round them. She stayed in the darkened room till dinner time.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through that silent meal the struggle went on within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked so shadowy and exhausted that old Jolyon told &lsquo;Sankey&rsquo;
      to countermand the carriage, he would not have her going out.... She was
      to go to bed! She made no resistance. She went up to her room, and sat in
      the dark. At ten o&rsquo;clock she rang for her maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring some hot water, and go down and tell Mr. Forsyte that I feel
      perfectly rested. Say that if he&rsquo;s too tired I can go to the dance
      by myself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid looked askance, and June turned on her imperiously. &ldquo;Go,&rdquo;
      she said, &ldquo;bring the hot water at once!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ball-dress still lay on the sofa, and with a sort of fierce care she
      arrayed herself, took the flowers in her hand, and went down, her small
      face carried high under its burden of hair. She could hear old Jolyon in
      his room as she passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bewildered and vexed, he was dressing. It was past ten, they would not get
      there till eleven; the girl was mad. But he dared not cross her&mdash;the
      expression of her face at dinner haunted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With great ebony brushes he smoothed his hair till it shone like silver
      under the light; then he, too, came out on the gloomy staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      June met him below, and, without a word, they went to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after that drive which seemed to last for ever, she entered Roger&rsquo;s
      drawing-room, she disguised under a mask of resolution a very torment of
      nervousness and emotion. The feeling of shame at what might be called
      &lsquo;running after him&rsquo; was smothered by the dread that he might
      not be there, that she might not see him after all, and by that dogged
      resolve&mdash;somehow, she did not know how&mdash;to win him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the ballroom, with its gleaming floor, gave her a feeling of
      joy, of triumph, for she loved dancing, and when dancing she floated, so
      light was she, like a strenuous, eager little spirit. He would surely ask
      her to dance, and if he danced with her it would all be as it was before.
      She looked about her eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of Bosinney coming with Irene from the conservatory, with that
      strange look of utter absorption on his face, struck her too suddenly.
      They had not seen&mdash;no one should see&mdash;her distress, not even her
      grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand on Jolyon&rsquo;s arm, and said very low:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go home, Gran; I feel ill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried her away, grumbling to himself that he had known how it would
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her he said nothing; only when they were once more in the carriage,
      which by some fortunate chance had lingered near the door, he asked her:
      &ldquo;What is it, my darling?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling her whole slender body shaken by sobs, he was terribly alarmed.
      She must have Blank to-morrow. He would insist upon it. He could not have
      her like this.... There, there!
    </p>
    <p>
      June mastered her sobs, and squeezing his hand feverishly, she lay back in
      her corner, her face muffled in a shawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could only see her eyes, fixed and staring in the dark, but he did not
      cease to stroke her hand with his thin fingers.

      CHAPTER IX&mdash;EVENING AT RICHMOND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Other eyes besides the eyes of June and of Soames had seen &lsquo;those
      two&rsquo; (as Euphemia had already begun to call them) coming from the
      conservatory; other eyes had noticed the look on Bosinney&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are moments when Nature reveals the passion hidden beneath the
      careless calm of her ordinary moods&mdash;violent spring flashing white on
      almond-blossom through the purple clouds; a snowy, moonlit peak, with its
      single star, soaring up to the passionate blue; or against the flames of
      sunset, an old yew-tree standing dark guardian of some fiery secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are moments, too, when in a picture-gallery, a work, noted by the
      casual spectator as &lsquo;......Titian&mdash;remarkably fine,&rsquo;
      breaks through the defences of some Forsyte better lunched perhaps than
      his fellows, and holds him spellbound in a kind of ecstasy. There are
      things, he feels&mdash;there are things here which&mdash;well, which are
      things. Something unreasoning, unreasonable, is upon him; when he tries to
      define it with the precision of a practical man, it eludes him, slips
      away, as the glow of the wine he has drunk is slipping away, leaving him
      cross, and conscious of his liver. He feels that he has been extravagant,
      prodigal of something; virtue has gone out of him. He did not desire this
      glimpse of what lay under the three stars of his catalogue. God forbid
      that he should know anything about the forces of Nature! God forbid that
      he should admit for a moment that there are such things! Once admit that,
      and where was he? One paid a shilling for entrance, and another for the
      programme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The look which June had seen, which other Forsytes had seen, was like the
      sudden flashing of a candle through a hole in some imaginary canvas,
      behind which it was being moved&mdash;the sudden flaming-out of a vague,
      erratic glow, shadowy and enticing. It brought home to onlookers the
      consciousness that dangerous forces were at work. For a moment they
      noticed it with pleasure, with interest, then felt they must not notice it
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It supplied, however, the reason of June&rsquo;s coming so late and
      disappearing again without dancing, without even shaking hands with her
      lover. She was ill, it was said, and no wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here they looked at each other guiltily. They had no desire to spread
      scandal, no desire to be ill-natured. Who would have? And to outsiders no
      word was breathed, unwritten law keeping them silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the news that June had gone to the seaside with old Jolyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had carried her off to Broadstairs, for which place there was just then
      a feeling, Yarmouth having lost caste, in spite of Nicholas, and no
      Forsyte going to the sea without intending to have an air for his money
      such as would render him bilious in a week. That fatally aristocratic
      tendency of the first Forsyte to drink Madeira had left his descendants
      undoubtedly accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      So June went to the sea. The family awaited developments; there was
      nothing else to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how far&mdash;how far had &lsquo;those two&rsquo; gone? How far were
      they going to go? Could they really be going at all? Nothing could surely
      come of it, for neither of them had any money. At the most a flirtation,
      ending, as all such attachments should, at the proper time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames&rsquo; sister, Winifred Dartie, who had imbibed with the breezes of
      Mayfair&mdash;she lived in Green Street&mdash;more fashionable principles
      in regard to matrimonial behaviour than were current, for instance, in
      Ladbroke Grove, laughed at the idea of there being anything in it. The
      &lsquo;little thing&rsquo;&mdash;Irene was taller than herself, and it was
      real testimony to the solid worth of a Forsyte that she should always thus
      be a &lsquo;little thing&rsquo;&mdash;the little thing was bored. Why
      shouldn&rsquo;t she amuse herself? Soames was rather tiring; and as to Mr.
      Bosinney&mdash;only that buffoon George would have called him the
      Buccaneer&mdash;she maintained that he was very chic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dictum&mdash;that Bosinney was chic&mdash;caused quite a sensation.
      It failed to convince. That he was &lsquo;good-looking in a way&rsquo;
      they were prepared to admit, but that anyone could call a man with his
      pronounced cheekbones, curious eyes, and soft felt hats chic was only
      another instance of Winifred&rsquo;s extravagant way of running after
      something new.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that famous summer when extravagance was fashionable, when the very
      earth was extravagant, chestnut-trees spread with blossom, and flowers
      drenched in perfume, as they had never been before; when roses blew in
      every garden; and for the swarming stars the nights had hardly space; when
      every day and all day long the sun, in full armour, swung his brazen
      shield above the Park, and people did strange things, lunching and dining
      in the open air. Unprecedented was the tale of cabs and carriages that
      streamed across the bridges of the shining river, bearing the upper-middle
      class in thousands to the green glories of Bushey, Richmond, Kew, and
      Hampton Court. Almost every family with any pretensions to be of the
      carriage-class paid one visit that year to the horse-chestnuts at Bushey,
      or took one drive amongst the Spanish chestnuts of Richmond Park. Bowling
      smoothly, if dustily, along, in a cloud of their own creation, they would
      stare fashionably at the antlered heads which the great slow deer raised
      out of a forest of bracken that promised to autumn lovers such cover as
      was never seen before. And now and again, as the amorous perfume of
      chestnut flowers and of fern was drifted too near, one would say to the
      other: &ldquo;My dear! What a peculiar scent!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the lime-flowers that year were of rare prime, near honey-coloured. At
      the corners of London squares they gave out, as the sun went down, a
      perfume sweeter than the honey bees had taken&mdash;a perfume that stirred
      a yearning unnamable in the hearts of Forsytes and their peers, taking the
      cool after dinner in the precincts of those gardens to which they alone
      had keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that yearning made them linger amidst the dim shapes of flower-beds in
      the failing daylight, made them turn, and turn, and turn again, as though
      lovers were waiting for them&mdash;waiting for the last light to die away
      under the shadow of the branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some vague sympathy evoked by the scent of the limes, some sisterly desire
      to see for herself, some idea of demonstrating the soundness of her dictum
      that there was &lsquo;nothing in it&rsquo;. or merely the craving to drive
      down to Richmond, irresistible that summer, moved the mother of the little
      Darties (of little Publius, of Imogen, Maud, and Benedict) to write the
      following note to her sister-in-law:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR IRENE, &lsquo;June 30.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear that Soames is going to Henley tomorrow for the night. I
      thought it would be great fun if we made up a little party and drove down
      to, Richmond. Will you ask Mr. Bosinney, and I will get young Flippard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Emily (they called their mother Emily&mdash;it was so chic) will
      lend us the carriage. I will call for you and your young man at seven o&rsquo;clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your affectionate sister,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;WINIFRED DARTIE.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Montague believes the dinner at the Crown and Sceptre to be quite
      eatable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Montague was Dartie&rsquo;s second and better known name&mdash;his first
      being Moses; for he was nothing if not a man of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her plan met with more opposition from Providence than so benevolent a
      scheme deserved. In the first place young Flippard wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;DEAR Mrs. DARTIE,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Awfully sorry. Engaged two deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;AUGUSTUS FLIPPARD.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late to send into the by-ways and hedges to remedy this misfortune.
      With the promptitude and conduct of a mother, Winifred fell back on her
      husband. She had, indeed, the decided but tolerant temperament that goes
      with a good deal of profile, fair hair, and greenish eyes. She was seldom
      or never at a loss; or if at a loss, was always able to convert it into a
      gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie, too, was in good feather. Erotic had failed to win the Lancashire
      Cup. Indeed, that celebrated animal, owned as he was by a pillar of the
      turf, who had secretly laid many thousands against him, had not even
      started. The forty-eight hours that followed his scratching were among the
      darkest in Dartie&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visions of James haunted him day and night. Black thoughts about Soames
      mingled with the faintest hopes. On the Friday night he got drunk, so
      greatly was he affected. But on Saturday morning the true Stock Exchange
      instinct triumphed within him. Owing some hundreds, which by no
      possibility could he pay, he went into town and put them all on Concertina
      for the Saltown Borough Handicap.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said to Major Scrotton, with whom he lunched at the Iseeum: &ldquo;That
      little Jew boy, Nathans, had given him the tip. He didn&rsquo;t care a
      cursh. He wash in&mdash;a mucker. If it didn&rsquo;t come up&mdash;well
      then, damme, the old man would have to pay!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A bottle of Pol Roger to his own cheek had given him a new contempt for
      James.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came up. Concertina was squeezed home by her neck&mdash;a terrible
      squeak! But, as Dartie said: There was nothing like pluck!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was by no means averse to the expedition to Richmond. He would &lsquo;stand&rsquo;
      it himself! He cherished an admiration for Irene, and wished to be on more
      playful terms with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past five the Park Lane footman came round to say: Mrs. Forsyte
      was very sorry, but one of the horses was coughing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Undaunted by this further blow, Winifred at once despatched little Publius
      (now aged seven) with the nursery governess to Montpellier Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would go down in hansoms and meet at the Crown and Sceptre at 7.45.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie, on being told, was pleased enough. It was better than going down
      with your back to the horses! He had no objection to driving down with
      Irene. He supposed they would pick up the others at Montpellier Square,
      and swop hansoms there?
    </p>
    <p>
      Informed that the meet was at the Crown and Sceptre, and that he would
      have to drive with his wife, he turned sulky, and said it was d&mdash;-d
      slow!
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o&rsquo;clock they started, Dartie offering to bet the driver
      half-a-crown he didn&rsquo;t do it in the three-quarters of an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice only did husband and wife exchange remarks on the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll put Master Soames&rsquo;s nose out of
      joint to hear his wife&rsquo;s been drivin&rsquo; in a hansom with Master
      Bosinney!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred replied: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk such nonsense, Monty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; repeated Dartie. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know
      women, my fine lady!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other occasion he merely asked: &ldquo;How am I looking? A bit
      puffy about the gills? That fizz old George is so fond of is a windy wine!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been lunching with George Forsyte at the Haversnake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney and Irene had arrived before them. They were standing in one of
      the long French windows overlooking the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows that summer were open all day long, and all night too, and day and
      night the scents of flowers and trees came in, the hot scent of parching
      grass, and the cool scent of the heavy dews.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the eye of the observant Dartie his two guests did not appear to be
      making much running, standing there close together, without a word.
      Bosinney was a hungry-looking creature&mdash;not much go about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left them to Winifred, however, and busied himself to order the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Forsyte will require good, if not delicate feeding, but a Dartie will
      tax the resources of a Crown and Sceptre. Living as he does, from hand to
      mouth, nothing is too good for him to eat; and he will eat it. His drink,
      too, will need to be carefully provided; there is much drink in this
      country &lsquo;not good enough&rsquo; for a Dartie; he will have the best.
      Paying for things vicariously, there is no reason why he should stint
      himself. To stint yourself is the mark of a fool, not of a Dartie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best of everything! No sounder principle on which a man can base his
      life, whose father-in-law has a very considerable income, and a partiality
      for his grandchildren.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his not unable eye Dartie had spotted this weakness in James the very
      first year after little Publius&rsquo;s arrival (an error); he had
      profited by his perspicacity. Four little Darties were now a sort of
      perpetual insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feature of the feast was unquestionably the red mullet. This
      delectable fish, brought from a considerable distance in a state of almost
      perfect preservation, was first fried, then boned, then served in ice,
      with Madeira punch in place of sauce, according to a recipe known to a few
      men of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing else calls for remark except the payment of the bill by Dartie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made himself extremely agreeable throughout the meal; his bold,
      admiring stare seldom abandoning Irene&rsquo;s face and figure. As he was
      obliged to confess to himself, he got no change out of her&mdash;she was
      cool enough, as cool as her shoulders looked under their veil of creamy
      lace. He expected to have caught her out in some little game with
      Bosinney; but not a bit of it, she kept up her end remarkably well. As for
      that architect chap, he was as glum as a bear with a sore head&mdash;Winifred
      could barely get a word out of him; he ate nothing, but he certainly took
      his liquor, and his face kept getting whiter, and his eyes looked queer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Dartie himself was in capital form, and talked freely, with a certain
      poignancy, being no fool. He told two or three stories verging on the
      improper, a concession to the company, for his stories were not used to
      verging. He proposed Irene&rsquo;s health in a mock speech. Nobody drank
      it, and Winifred said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a clown, Monty!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At her suggestion they went after dinner to the public terrace overlooking
      the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see the common people making love,&rdquo; she
      said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s such fun!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were numbers of them walking in the cool, after the day&rsquo;s
      heat, and the air was alive with the sound of voices, coarse and loud, or
      soft as though murmuring secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before Winifred&rsquo;s better sense&mdash;she was the
      only Forsyte present&mdash;secured them an empty bench. They sat down in a
      row. A heavy tree spread a thick canopy above their heads, and the haze
      darkened slowly over the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie sat at the end, next to him Irene, then Bosinney, then Winifred.
      There was hardly room for four, and the man of the world could feel Irene&rsquo;s
      arm crushed against his own; he knew that she could not withdraw it
      without seeming rude, and this amused him; he devised every now and again
      a movement that would bring her closer still. He thought: &lsquo;That
      Buccaneer Johnny shan&rsquo;t have it all to himself! It&rsquo;s a pretty
      tight fit, certainly!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      From far down below on the dark river came drifting the tinkle of a
      mandoline, and voices singing the old round:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A boat, a boat, unto the ferry, For we&rsquo;ll go over and be
      merry; And laugh, and quaff, and drink brown sherry!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly the moon appeared, young and tender, floating up on her back
      from behind a tree; and as though she had breathed, the air was cooler,
      but down that cooler air came always the warm odour of the limes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over his cigar Dartie peered round at Bosinney, who was sitting with his
      arms crossed, staring straight in front of him, and on his face the look
      of a man being tortured.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dartie shot a glance at the face between, so veiled by the overhanging
      shadow that it was but like a darker piece of the darkness shaped and
      breathed on; soft, mysterious, enticing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hush had fallen on the noisy terrace, as if all the strollers were
      thinking secrets too precious to be spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Dartie thought: &lsquo;Women!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The glow died above the river, the singing ceased; the young moon hid
      behind a tree, and all was dark. He pressed himself against Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not alarmed at the shuddering that ran through the limbs he
      touched, or at the troubled, scornful look of her eyes. He felt her trying
      to draw herself away, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be confessed that the man of the world had drunk quite as much as
      was good for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With thick lips parted under his well-curled moustaches, and his bold eyes
      aslant upon her, he had the malicious look of a satyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the pathway of sky between the hedges of the tree tops the stars
      clustered forth; like mortals beneath, they seemed to shift and swarm and
      whisper. Then on the terrace the buzz broke out once more, and Dartie
      thought: &lsquo;Ah! he&rsquo;s a poor, hungry-looking devil, that
      Bosinney!&rsquo; and again he pressed himself against Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement deserved a better success. She rose, and they all followed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man of the world was more than ever determined to see what she was
      made of. Along the terrace he kept close at her elbow. He had within him
      much good wine. There was the long drive home, the long drive and the warm
      dark and the pleasant closeness of the hansom cab&mdash;with its
      insulation from the world devised by some great and good man. That hungry
      architect chap might drive with his wife&mdash;he wished him joy of her!
      And, conscious that his voice was not too steady, he was careful not to
      speak; but a smile had become fixed on his thick lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      They strolled along toward the cabs awaiting them at the farther end. His
      plan had the merit of all great plans, an almost brutal simplicity&mdash;
      he would merely keep at her elbow till she got in, and get in quickly
      after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Irene reached the cab she did not get in; she slipped, instead,
      to the horse&rsquo;s head. Dartie was not at the moment sufficiently
      master of his legs to follow. She stood stroking the horse&rsquo;s nose,
      and, to his annoyance, Bosinney was at her side first. She turned and
      spoke to him rapidly, in a low voice; the words &lsquo;That man&rsquo;
      reached Dartie. He stood stubbornly by the cab step, waiting for her to
      come back. He knew a trick worth two of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in the lamp-light, his figure (no more than medium height), well
      squared in its white evening waistcoat, his light overcoat flung over his
      arm, a pink flower in his button-hole, and on his dark face that look of
      confident, good-humoured insolence, he was at his best&mdash;a thorough
      man of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred was already in her cab. Dartie reflected that Bosinney would have
      a poorish time in that cab if he didn&rsquo;t look sharp! Suddenly he
      received a push which nearly overturned him in the road. Bosinney&rsquo;s
      voice hissed in his ear: &ldquo;I am taking Irene back; do you understand?&rdquo;
      He saw a face white with passion, and eyes that glared at him like a wild
      cat&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;What? Not a bit. You take my wife!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away!&rdquo; hissed Bosinney&mdash;&ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll throw
      you into the road!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie recoiled; he saw as plainly as possible that the fellow meant it.
      In the space he made Irene had slipped by, her dress brushed his legs.
      Bosinney stepped in after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he heard the Buccaneer cry. The cabman flicked his
      horse. It sprang forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie stood for a moment dumbfounded; then, dashing at the cab where his
      wife sat, he scrambled in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive on!&rdquo; he shouted to the driver, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t
      you lose sight of that fellow in front!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated by his wife&rsquo;s side, he burst into imprecations. Calming
      himself at last with a supreme effort, he added: &ldquo;A pretty mess you&rsquo;ve
      made of it, to let the Buccaneer drive home with her; why on earth couldn&rsquo;t
      you keep hold of him? He&rsquo;s mad with love; any fool can see that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drowned Winifred&rsquo;s rejoinder with fresh calls to the Almighty;
      nor was it until they reached Barnes that he ceased a Jeremiad, in the
      course of which he had abused her, her father, her brother, Irene,
      Bosinney, the name of Forsyte, his own children, and cursed the day when
      he had ever married.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred, a woman of strong character, let him have his say, at the end of
      which he lapsed into sulky silence. His angry eyes never deserted the back
      of that cab, which, like a lost chance, haunted the darkness in front of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately he could not hear Bosinney&rsquo;s passionate pleading&mdash;that
      pleading which the man of the world&rsquo;s conduct had let loose like a
      flood; he could not see Irene shivering, as though some garment had been
      torn from her, nor her eyes, black and mournful, like the eyes of a beaten
      child. He could not hear Bosinney entreating, entreating, always
      entreating; could not hear her sudden, soft weeping, nor see that poor,
      hungry-looking devil, awed and trembling, humbly touching her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Montpellier Square their cabman, following his instructions to the
      letter, faithfully drew up behind the cab in front. The Darties saw
      Bosinney spring out, and Irene follow, and hasten up the steps with bent
      head. She evidently had her key in her hand, for she disappeared at once.
      It was impossible to tell whether she had turned to speak to Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter came walking past their cab; both husband and wife had an
      admirable view of his face in the light of a street lamp. It was working
      with violent emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Mr. Bosinney!&rdquo; called Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney started, clawed off his hat, and hurried on. He had obviously
      forgotten their existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Dartie, &ldquo;did you see the beast&rsquo;s
      face? What did I say? Fine games!&rdquo; He improved the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had so clearly been a crisis in the cab that Winifred was unable to
      defend her theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: &ldquo;I shall say nothing about it. I don&rsquo;t see any use
      in making a fuss!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With that view Dartie at once concurred; looking upon James as a private
      preserve, he disapproved of his being disturbed by the troubles of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let Soames look after himself.
      He&rsquo;s jolly well able to!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, the Darties entered their habitat in Green Street, the rent
      of which was paid by James, and sought a well-earned rest. The hour was
      midnight, and no Forsytes remained abroad in the streets to spy out
      Bosinney&rsquo;s wanderings; to see him return and stand against the rails
      of the Square garden, back from the glow of the street lamp; to see him
      stand there in the shadow of trees, watching the house where in the dark
      was hidden she whom he would have given the world to see for a single
      minute&mdash;she who was now to him the breath of the lime-trees, the
      meaning of the light and the darkness, the very beating of his own heart.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;DIAGNOSIS OF A FORSYTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is in the nature of a Forsyte to be ignorant that he is a Forsyte; but
      young Jolyon was well aware of being one. He had not known it till after
      the decisive step which had made him an outcast; since then the knowledge
      had been with him continually. He felt it throughout his alliance,
      throughout all his dealings with his second wife, who was emphatically not
      a Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that if he had not possessed in great measure the eye for what he
      wanted, the tenacity to hold on to it, the sense of the folly of wasting
      that for which he had given so big a price&mdash;in other words, the
      &lsquo;sense of property&rsquo; he could never have retained her (perhaps
      never would have desired to retain her) with him through all the financial
      troubles, slights, and misconstructions of those fifteen years; never have
      induced her to marry him on the death of his first wife; never have lived
      it all through, and come up, as it were, thin, but smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of those men who, seated cross-legged like miniature Chinese
      idols in the cages of their own hearts, are ever smiling at themselves a
      doubting smile. Not that this smile, so intimate and eternal, interfered
      with his actions, which, like his chin and his temperament, were quite a
      peculiar blend of softness and determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious, too, of being a Forsyte in his work, that painting of
      water-colours to which he devoted so much energy, always with an eye on
      himself, as though he could not take so unpractical a pursuit quite
      seriously, and always with a certain queer uneasiness that he did not make
      more money at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, then, this consciousness of what it meant to be a Forsyte, that
      made him receive the following letter from old Jolyon, with a mixture of
      sympathy and disgust:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;SHELDRAKE HOUSE, &lsquo;BROADSTAIRS,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;July 1. &lsquo;MY DEAR JO,&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (The Dad&rsquo;s handwriting had altered very little in the thirty odd
      years that he remembered it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have been here now a fortnight, and have had good weather on the
      whole. The air is bracing, but my liver is out of order, and I shall be
      glad enough to get back to town. I cannot say much for June, her health
      and spirits are very indifferent, and I don&rsquo;t see what is to come of
      it. She says nothing, but it is clear that she is harping on this
      engagement, which is an engagement and no engagement, and&mdash;goodness
      knows what. I have grave doubts whether she ought to be allowed to return
      to London in the present state of affairs, but she is so self-willed that
      she might take it into her head to come up at any moment. The fact is
      someone ought to speak to Bosinney and ascertain what he means. I&rsquo;m
      afraid of this myself, for I should certainly rap him over the knuckles,
      but I thought that you, knowing him at the Club, might put in a word, and
      get to ascertain what the fellow is about. You will of course in no way
      commit June. I shall be glad to hear from you in the course of a few days
      whether you have succeeded in gaining any information. The situation is
      very distressing to me, I worry about it at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      With my love to Jolly and Holly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your affect. father,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;JOLYON FORSYTE.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon pondered this letter so long and seriously that his wife
      noticed his preoccupation, and asked him what was the matter. He replied:
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fixed principle with him never to allude to June. She might take
      alarm, he did not know what she might think; he hastened, therefore, to
      banish from his manner all traces of absorption, but in this he was about
      as successful as his father would have been, for he had inherited all old
      Jolyon&rsquo;s transparency in matters of domestic finesse; and young Mrs.
      Jolyon, busying herself over the affairs of the house, went about with
      tightened lips, stealing at him unfathomable looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started for the Club in the afternoon with the letter in his pocket,
      and without having made up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      To sound a man as to &lsquo;his intentions&rsquo; was peculiarly
      unpleasant to him; nor did his own anomalous position diminish this
      unpleasantness. It was so like his family, so like all the people they
      knew and mixed with, to enforce what they called their rights over a man,
      to bring him up to the mark; so like them to carry their business
      principles into their private relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how that phrase in the letter&mdash;&rsquo;You will, of course, in no
      way commit June&rsquo;&mdash;gave the whole thing away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the letter, with the personal grievance, the concern for June, the
      &lsquo;rap over the knuckles,&rsquo; was all so natural. No wonder his
      father wanted to know what Bosinney meant, no wonder he was angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to refuse! But why give the thing to him to do? That was
      surely quite unbecoming; but so long as a Forsyte got what he was after,
      he was not too particular about the means, provided appearances were
      saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      How should he set about it, or how refuse? Both seemed impossible. So,
      young Jolyon!
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived at the Club at three o&rsquo;clock, and the first person he saw
      was Bosinney himself, seated in a corner, staring out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon sat down not far off, and began nervously to reconsider his
      position. He looked covertly at Bosinney sitting there unconscious. He did
      not know him very well, and studied him attentively for perhaps the first
      time; an unusual looking man, unlike in dress, face, and manner to most of
      the other members of the Club&mdash;young Jolyon himself, however
      different he had become in mood and temper, had always retained the neat
      reticence of Forsyte appearance. He alone among Forsytes was ignorant of
      Bosinney&rsquo;s nickname. The man was unusual, not eccentric, but
      unusual; he looked worn, too, haggard, hollow in the cheeks beneath those
      broad, high cheekbones, though without any appearance of ill-health, for
      he was strongly built, with curly hair that seemed to show all the
      vitality of a fine constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in his face and attitude touched young Jolyon. He knew what
      suffering was like, and this man looked as if he were suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and touched his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney started, but exhibited no sign of embarrassment on seeing who it
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for a long time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How
      are you getting on with my cousin&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be finished in about a week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s much of a subject
      for congratulation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; queried young Jolyon; &ldquo;I should have thought you&rsquo;d
      be glad to get a long job like that off your hands; but I suppose you feel
      it much as I do when I part with a picture&mdash;a sort of child?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked kindly at Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the latter more cordially, &ldquo;it goes out from
      you and there&rsquo;s an end of it. I didn&rsquo;t know you painted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only water-colours; I can&rsquo;t say I believe in my work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe in it? There&mdash;how can you do it? Work&rsquo;s
      no use unless you believe in it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said young Jolyon; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve
      always said. By-the-bye, have you noticed that whenever one says &lsquo;Good,&rsquo;
      one always adds &lsquo;it&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve always said&rsquo;.
      But if you ask me how I do it, I answer, because I&rsquo;m a Forsyte.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Forsyte! I never thought of you as one!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Forsyte,&rdquo; replied young Jolyon, &ldquo;is not an uncommon
      animal. There are hundreds among the members of this Club. Hundreds out
      there in the streets; you meet them wherever you go!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how do you tell them, may I ask?&rdquo; said Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By their sense of property. A Forsyte takes a practical&mdash;one
      might say a commonsense&mdash;view of things, and a practical view of
      things is based fundamentally on a sense of property. A Forsyte, you will
      notice, never gives himself away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joking?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon&rsquo;s eye twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much. As a Forsyte myself, I have no business to talk. But I&rsquo;m
      a kind of thoroughbred mongrel; now, there&rsquo;s no mistaking you: You&rsquo;re
      as different from me as I am from my Uncle James, who is the perfect
      specimen of a Forsyte. His sense of property is extreme, while you have
      practically none. Without me in between, you would seem like a different
      species. I&rsquo;m the missing link. We are, of course, all of us the
      slaves of property, and I admit that it&rsquo;s a question of degree, but
      what I call a &lsquo;Forsyte&rsquo; is a man who is decidedly more than
      less a slave of property. He knows a good thing, he knows a safe thing,
      and his grip on property&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it be
      wives, houses, money, or reputation&mdash;is his hall-mark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Bosinney. &ldquo;You should patent the word.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like,&rdquo; said young Jolyon, &ldquo;to lecture on it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Properties and quality of a Forsyte: This little animal, disturbed
      by the ridicule of his own sort, is unaffected in his motions by the
      laughter of strange creatures (you or I). Hereditarily disposed to myopia,
      he recognises only the persons of his own species, amongst which he passes
      an existence of competitive tranquillity.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk of them,&rdquo; said Bosinney, &ldquo;as if they were half
      England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are,&rdquo; repeated young Jolyon, &ldquo;half England, and
      the better half, too, the safe half, the three per cent. half, the half
      that counts. It&rsquo;s their wealth and security that makes everything
      possible; makes your art possible, makes literature, science, even
      religion, possible. Without Forsytes, who believe in none of these things,
      and habitats but turn them all to use, where should we be? My dear sir,
      the Forsytes are the middlemen, the commercials, the pillars of society,
      the cornerstones of convention; everything that is admirable!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I catch your drift,&rdquo; said
      Bosinney, &ldquo;but I fancy there are plenty of Forsytes, as you call
      them, in my profession.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied young Jolyon. &ldquo;The great majority
      of architects, painters, or writers have no principles, like any other
      Forsytes. Art, literature, religion, survive by virtue of the few cranks
      who really believe in such things, and the many Forsytes who make a
      commercial use of them. At a low estimate, three-fourths of our Royal
      Academicians are Forsytes, seven-eighths of our novelists, a large
      proportion of the press. Of science I can&rsquo;t speak; they are
      magnificently represented in religion; in the House of Commons perhaps
      more numerous than anywhere; the aristocracy speaks for itself. But I&rsquo;m
      not laughing. It is dangerous to go against the majority and what a
      majority!&rdquo; He fixed his eyes on Bosinney: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      dangerous to let anything carry you away&mdash;a house, a picture, a&mdash;woman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other.&mdash;And, as though he had done that which no
      Forsyte did&mdash;given himself away, young Jolyon drew into his shell.
      Bosinney broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you take your own people as the type?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My people,&rdquo; replied young Jolyon, &ldquo;are not very
      extreme, and they have their own private peculiarities, like every other
      family, but they possess in a remarkable degree those two qualities which
      are the real tests of a Forsyte&mdash;the power of never being able to
      give yourself up to anything soul and body, and the &lsquo;sense of
      property&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney smiled: &ldquo;How about the big one, for instance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean Swithin?&rdquo; asked young Jolyon. &ldquo;Ah! in
      Swithin there&rsquo;s something primeval still. The town and middle-class
      life haven&rsquo;t digested him yet. All the old centuries of farm work
      and brute force have settled in him, and there they&rsquo;ve stuck, for
      all he&rsquo;s so distinguished.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney seemed to ponder. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ve hit your cousin
      Soames off to the life,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never
      blow his brains out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon shot at him a penetrating glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s
      to be reckoned with. Look out for their grip! It&rsquo;s easy to laugh,
      but don&rsquo;t mistake me. It doesn&rsquo;t do to despise a Forsyte; it
      doesn&rsquo;t do to disregard them!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet you&rsquo;ve done it yourself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon acknowledged the hit by losing his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; he said with a queer pride, &ldquo;I can hold
      on, too&mdash;I&rsquo;m a Forsyte myself. We&rsquo;re all in the path of
      great forces. The man who leaves the shelter of the wall&mdash;well&mdash;you
      know what I mean. I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he ended very low, as though
      uttering a threat, &ldquo;recommend every man to-go-my-way. It depends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour rushed into Bosinney&rsquo;s face, but soon receded, leaving it
      sallow-brown as before. He gave a short laugh, that left his lips fixed in
      a queer, fierce smile; his eyes mocked young Jolyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s deuced kind of you. But
      you&rsquo;re not the only chaps that can hold on.&rdquo; He rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon looked after him as he walked away, and, resting his head on
      his hand, sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drowsy, almost empty room the only sounds were the rustle of
      newspapers, the scraping of matches being struck. He stayed a long time
      without moving, living over again those days when he, too, had sat long
      hours watching the clock, waiting for the minutes to pass&mdash;long hours
      full of the torments of uncertainty, and of a fierce, sweet aching; and
      the slow, delicious agony of that season came back to him with its old
      poignancy. The sight of Bosinney, with his haggard face, and his restless
      eyes always wandering to the clock, had roused in him a pity, with which
      was mingled strange, irresistible envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew the signs so well. Whither was he going&mdash;to what sort of
      fate? What kind of woman was it who was drawing him to her by that
      magnetic force which no consideration of honour, no principle, no interest
      could withstand; from which the only escape was flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flight! But why should Bosinney fly? A man fled when he was in danger of
      destroying hearth and home, when there were children, when he felt himself
      trampling down ideals, breaking something. But here, so he had heard, it
      was all broken to his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself had not fled, nor would he fly if it were all to come over
      again. Yet he had gone further than Bosinney, had broken up his own
      unhappy home, not someone else&rsquo;s: And the old saying came back to
      him: &lsquo;A man&rsquo;s fate lies in his own heart.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In his own heart! The proof of the pudding was in the eating&mdash;Bosinney
      had still to eat his pudding.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts passed to the woman, the woman whom he did not know, but the
      outline of whose story he had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unhappy marriage! No ill-treatment&mdash;only that indefinable malaise,
      that terrible blight which killed all sweetness under Heaven; and so from
      day to day, from night to night, from week to week, from year to year,
      till death should end it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But young Jolyon, the bitterness of whose own feelings time had assuaged,
      saw Soames&rsquo; side of the question too. Whence should a man like his
      cousin, saturated with all the prejudices and beliefs of his class, draw
      the insight or inspiration necessary to break up this life? It was a
      question of imagination, of projecting himself into the future beyond the
      unpleasant gossip, sneers, and tattle that followed on such separations,
      beyond the passing pangs that the lack of the sight of her would cause,
      beyond the grave disapproval of the worthy. But few men, and especially
      few men of Soames&rsquo; class, had imagination enough for that. A deal of
      mortals in this world, and not enough imagination to go round! And sweet
      Heaven, what a difference between theory and practice; many a man, perhaps
      even Soames, held chivalrous views on such matters, who when the shoe
      pinched found a distinguishing factor that made of himself an exception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, he distrusted his judgment. He had been through the experience
      himself, had tasted too the dregs the bitterness of an unhappy marriage,
      and how could he take the wide and dispassionate view of those who had
      never been within sound of the battle? His evidence was too first-hand&mdash;like
      the evidence on military matters of a soldier who has been through much
      active service, against that of civilians who have not suffered the
      disadvantage of seeing things too close. Most people would consider such a
      marriage as that of Soames and Irene quite fairly successful; he had
      money, she had beauty; it was a case for compromise. There was no reason
      why they should not jog along, even if they hated each other. It would not
      matter if they went their own ways a little so long as the decencies were
      observed&mdash;the sanctity of the marriage tie, of the common home,
      respected. Half the marriages of the upper classes were conducted on these
      lines: Do not offend the susceptibilities of Society; do not offend the
      susceptibilities of the Church. To avoid offending these is worth the
      sacrifice of any private feelings. The advantages of the stable home are
      visible, tangible, so many pieces of property; there is no risk in the
      statu quo. To break up a home is at the best a dangerous experiment, and
      selfish into the bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the case for the defence, and young Jolyon sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The core of it all,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;is property, but
      there are many people who would not like it put that way. To them it is
      &ldquo;the sanctity of the marriage tie&rdquo;; but the sanctity of the
      marriage tie is dependent on the sanctity of the family, and the sanctity
      of the family is dependent on the sanctity of property. And yet I imagine
      all these people are followers of One who never owned anything. It is
      curious!
    </p>
    <p>
      And again young Jolyon sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I going on my way home to ask any poor devils I meet to share my
      dinner, which will then be too little for myself, or, at all events, for
      my wife, who is necessary to my health and happiness? It may be that after
      all Soames does well to exercise his rights and support by his practice
      the sacred principle of property which benefits us all, with the exception
      of those who suffer by the process.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he left his chair, threaded his way through the maze of seats, took
      his hat, and languidly up the hot streets crowded with carriages, reeking
      with dusty odours, wended his way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before reaching Wistaria Avenue he removed old Jolyon&rsquo;s letter from
      his pocket, and tearing it carefully into tiny pieces, scattered them in
      the dust of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let himself in with his key, and called his wife&rsquo;s name. But she
      had gone out, taking Jolly and Holly, and the house was empty; alone in
      the garden the dog Balthasar lay in the shade snapping at flies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon took his seat there, too, under the pear-tree that bore no
      fruit.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;BOSINNEY ON PAROLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The day after the evening at Richmond Soames returned from Henley by a
      morning train. Not constitutionally interested in amphibious sports, his
      visit had been one of business rather than pleasure, a client of some
      importance having asked him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went straight to the City, but finding things slack, he left at three o&rsquo;clock,
      glad of this chance to get home quietly. Irene did not expect him. Not
      that he had any desire to spy on her actions, but there was no harm in
      thus unexpectedly surveying the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      After changing to Park clothes he went into the drawing-room. She was
      sitting idly in the corner of the sofa, her favourite seat; and there were
      circles under her eyes, as though she had not slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked: &ldquo;How is it you&rsquo;re in? Are you expecting somebody?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes that is, not particularly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bosinney said he might come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosinney. He ought to be at work.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To this she made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;I want you to come out to the
      Stores with me, and after that we&rsquo;ll go to the Park.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go out; I have a headache.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames replied: &ldquo;If ever I want you to do anything, you&rsquo;ve
      always got a headache. It&rsquo;ll do you good to come and sit under the
      trees.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames was silent for some minutes; at last he said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know what your idea of a wife&rsquo;s duty is. I never have known!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not expected her to reply, but she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried to do what you want; it&rsquo;s not my fault that I
      haven&rsquo;t been able to put my heart into it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose fault is it, then?&rdquo; He watched her askance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we were married you promised to let me go if our marriage
      was not a success. Is it a success?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Success,&rdquo; he stammered&mdash;&ldquo;it would be a success if
      you behaved yourself properly!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried,&rdquo; said Irene. &ldquo;Will you let me go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned away. Secretly alarmed, he took refuge in bluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let you go? You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about.
      Let you go? How can I let you go? We&rsquo;re married, aren&rsquo;t we?
      Then, what are you talking about? For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
      have any of this sort of nonsense! Get your hat on, and come and sit in
      the Park.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, you won&rsquo;t let me go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her eyes resting on him with a strange, touching look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let you go!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and what on earth would you do
      with yourself if I did? You&rsquo;ve got no money!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could manage somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a swift turn up and down the room; then came and stood before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;once and for all, I won&rsquo;t
      have you say this sort of thing. Go and get your hat on!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Soames, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to miss
      Bosinney if he comes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene got up slowly and left the room. She came down with her hat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Park, the motley hour of mid-afternoon, when foreigners and other
      pathetic folk drive, thinking themselves to be in fashion, had passed; the
      right, the proper, hour had come, was nearly gone, before Soames and Irene
      seated themselves under the Achilles statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time since he had enjoyed her company in the Park. That was
      one of the past delights of the first two seasons of his married life,
      when to feel himself the possessor of this gracious creature before all
      London had been his greatest, though secret, pride. How many afternoons
      had he not sat beside her, extremely neat, with light grey gloves and
      faint, supercilious smile, nodding to acquaintances, and now and again
      removing his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      His light grey gloves were still on his hands, and on his lips his smile
      sardonic, but where the feeling in his heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      The seats were emptying fast, but still he kept her there, silent and
      pale, as though to work out a secret punishment. Once or twice he made
      some comment, and she bent her head, or answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with a
      tired smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the rails a man was walking so fast that people stared after him
      when he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that ass!&rdquo; said Soames; &ldquo;he must be mad to walk
      like that in this heat!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned; Irene had made a rapid movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s our friend the Buccaneer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he sat still, with his sneering smile, conscious that Irene was
      sitting still, and smiling too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she bow to him?&rdquo; he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she made no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney reached the end of the rails, and came walking back amongst the
      chairs, quartering his ground like a pointer. When he saw them he stopped
      dead, and raised his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile never left Soames&rsquo; face; he also took off his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney came up, looking exhausted, like a man after hard physical
      exercise; the sweat stood in drops on his brow, and Soames&rsquo; smile
      seemed to say: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a trying time, my friend.... What
      are <i>you</i> doing in the Park?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;We thought you
      despised such frivolity!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney did not seem to hear; he made his answer to Irene: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been round to your place; I hoped I should find you in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody tapped Soames on the back, and spoke to him; and in the exchange
      of those platitudes over his shoulder, he missed her answer, and took a
      resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just going in,&rdquo; he said to Bosinney; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
      better come back to dinner with us.&rdquo; Into that invitation he put a
      strange bravado, a stranger pathos: &ldquo;You, can&rsquo;t deceive me,&rdquo;
      his look and voice seemed saying, &ldquo;but see&mdash;I trust you&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      not afraid of you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They started back to Montpellier Square together, Irene between them. In
      the crowded streets Soames went on in front. He did not listen to their
      conversation; the strange resolution of trustfulness he had taken seemed
      to animate even his secret conduct. Like a gambler, he said to himself:
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a card I dare not throw away&mdash;I must play it for
      what it&rsquo;s worth. I have not too many chances.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He dressed slowly, heard her leave her room and go downstairs, and, for
      full five minutes after, dawdled about in his dressing-room. Then he went
      down, purposely shutting the door loudly to show that he was coming. He
      found them standing by the hearth, perhaps talking, perhaps not; he could
      not say.
    </p>
    <p>
      He played his part out in the farce, the long evening through&mdash;his
      manner to his guest more friendly than it had ever been before; and when
      at last Bosinney went, he said: &ldquo;You must come again soon; Irene
      likes to have you to talk about the house!&rdquo; Again his voice had the
      strange bravado and the stranger pathos; but his hand was cold as ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loyal to his resolution, he turned away from their parting, turned away
      from his wife as she stood under the hanging lamp to say good-night&mdash;away
      from the sight of her golden head shining so under the light, of her
      smiling mournful lips; away from the sight of Bosinney&rsquo;s eyes
      looking at her, so like a dog&rsquo;s looking at its master.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he went to bed with the certainty that Bosinney was in love with his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer night was hot, so hot and still that through every opened
      window came in but hotter air. For long hours he lay listening to her
      breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could sleep, but he must lie awake. And, lying awake, he hardened
      himself to play the part of the serene and trusting husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the small hours he slipped out of bed, and passing into his
      dressing-room, leaned by the open window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hardly breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      A night four years ago came back to him&mdash;the night but one before his
      marriage; as hot and stifling as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered how he had lain in a long cane chair in the window of his
      sitting-room off Victoria Street. Down below in a side street a man had
      banged at a door, a woman had cried out; he remembered, as though it were
      now, the sound of the scuffle, the slam of the door, the dead silence that
      followed. And then the early water-cart, cleansing the reek of the
      streets, had approached through the strange-seeming, useless lamp-light;
      he seemed to hear again its rumble, nearer and nearer, till it passed and
      slowly died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned far out of the dressing-room window over the little court below,
      and saw the first light spread. The outlines of dark walls and roofs were
      blurred for a moment, then came out sharper than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered how that other night he had watched the lamps paling all the
      length of Victoria Street; how he had hurried on his clothes and gone down
      into the street, down past houses and squares, to the street where she was
      staying, and there had stood and looked at the front of the little house,
      as still and grey as the face of a dead man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly it shot through his mind; like a sick man&rsquo;s fancy: What&rsquo;s
      he doing?&mdash;that fellow who haunts me, who was here this evening, who&rsquo;s
      in love with my wife&mdash;prowling out there, perhaps, looking for her as
      I know he was looking for her this afternoon; watching my house now, for
      all I can tell!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole across the landing to the front of the house, stealthily drew
      aside a blind, and raised a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grey light clung about the trees of the square, as though Night, like
      a great downy moth, had brushed them with her wings. The lamps were still
      alight, all pale, but not a soul stirred&mdash;no living thing in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet suddenly, very faint, far off in the deathly stillness, he heard a cry
      writhing, like the voice of some wandering soul barred out of heaven, and
      crying for its happiness. There it was again&mdash;again! Soames shut the
      window, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he thought: &lsquo;Ah! it&rsquo;s only the peacocks, across the
      water.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII&mdash;JUNE PAYS SOME CALLS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jolyon stood in the narrow hall at Broadstairs, inhaling that odour of
      oilcloth and herrings which permeates all respectable seaside
      lodging-houses. On a chair&mdash;a shiny leather chair, displaying its
      horsehair through a hole in the top left-hand corner&mdash;stood a black
      despatch case. This he was filling with papers, with the Times, and a
      bottle of Eau-de Cologne. He had meetings that day of the &lsquo;Globular
      Gold Concessions&rsquo; and the &lsquo;New Colliery Company, Limited,&rsquo;
      to which he was going up, for he never missed a Board; to &lsquo;miss a
      Board&rsquo; would be one more piece of evidence that he was growing old,
      and this his jealous Forsyte spirit could not bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes, as he filled that black despatch case, looked as if at any
      moment they might blaze up with anger. So gleams the eye of a schoolboy,
      baited by a ring of his companions; but he controls himself, deterred by
      the fearful odds against him. And old Jolyon controlled himself, keeping
      down, with his masterful restraint now slowly wearing out, the irritation
      fostered in him by the conditions of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had received from his son an unpractical letter, in which by rambling
      generalities the boy seemed trying to get out of answering a plain
      question. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Bosinney,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;he is
      not a criminal. The more I see of people the more I am convinced that they
      are never good or bad&mdash;merely comic, or pathetic. You probably don&rsquo;t
      agree with me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon did not; he considered it cynical to so express oneself; he had
      not yet reached that point of old age when even Forsytes, bereft of those
      illusions and principles which they have cherished carefully for practical
      purposes but never believed in, bereft of all corporeal enjoyment,
      stricken to the very heart by having nothing left to hope for&mdash;break
      through the barriers of reserve and say things they would never have
      believed themselves capable of saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he did not believe in &lsquo;goodness&rsquo; and &lsquo;badness&rsquo;
      any more than his son; but as he would have said: He didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
      tell; there might be something in it; and why, by an unnecessary
      expression of disbelief, deprive yourself of possible advantage?
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed to spend his holidays among the mountains, though (like a true
      Forsyte) he had never attempted anything too adventurous or too foolhardy,
      he had been passionately fond of them. And when the wonderful view
      (mentioned in Baedeker&mdash;&rsquo;fatiguing but repaying&rsquo;.&mdash;was
      disclosed to him after the effort of the climb, he had doubtless felt the
      existence of some great, dignified principle crowning the chaotic
      strivings, the petty precipices, and ironic little dark chasms of life.
      This was as near to religion, perhaps, as his practical spirit had ever
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was many years since he had been to the mountains. He had taken
      June there two seasons running, after his wife died, and had realized
      bitterly that his walking days were over.
    </p>
    <p>
      To that old mountain&mdash;given confidence in a supreme order of things
      he had long been a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew himself to be old, yet he felt young; and this troubled him. It
      troubled and puzzled him, too, to think that he, who had always been so
      careful, should be father and grandfather to such as seemed born to
      disaster. He had nothing to say against Jo&mdash;who could say anything
      against the boy, an amiable chap?&mdash;but his position was deplorable,
      and this business of June&rsquo;s nearly as bad. It seemed like a
      fatality, and a fatality was one of those things no man of his character
      could either understand or put up with.
    </p>
    <p>
      In writing to his son he did not really hope that anything would come of
      it. Since the ball at Roger&rsquo;s he had seen too clearly how the land
      lay&mdash;he could put two and two together quicker than most men&mdash;and,
      with the example of his own son before his eyes, knew better than any
      Forsyte of them all that the pale flame singes men&rsquo;s wings whether
      they will or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days before June&rsquo;s engagement, when she and Mrs. Soames were
      always together, he had seen enough of Irene to feel the spell she cast
      over men. She was not a flirt, not even a coquette&mdash;words dear to the
      heart of his generation, which loved to define things by a good, broad,
      inadequate word&mdash;but she was dangerous. He could not say why. Tell
      him of a quality innate in some women&mdash;a seductive power beyond their
      own control! He would but answer: &lsquo;Humbug!&rsquo; She was dangerous,
      and there was an end of it. He wanted to close his eyes to that affair. If
      it was, it was; he did not want to hear any more about it&mdash;he only
      wanted to save June&rsquo;s position and her peace of mind. He still hoped
      she might once more become a comfort to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he had written. He got little enough out of the answer. As to what
      young Jolyon had made of the interview, there was practically only the
      queer sentence: &lsquo;I gather that he&rsquo;s in the stream.&rsquo; The
      stream! What stream? What was this new-fangled way of talking?
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed, and folded the last of the papers under the flap of the bag; he
      knew well enough what was meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      June came out of the dining-room, and helped him on with his summer coat.
      From her costume, and the expression of her little resolute face, he saw
      at once what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going with you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my dear; I go straight into the City. I can&rsquo;t have
      you racketting about!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must see old Mrs. Smeech.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your precious &lsquo;lame ducks!&rdquo; grumbled out old
      Jolyon. He did not believe her excuse, but ceased his opposition. There
      was no doing anything with that pertinacity of hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Victoria he put her into the carriage which had been ordered for
      himself&mdash;a characteristic action, for he had no petty selfishnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you go tiring yourself, my darling,&rdquo; he
      said, and took a cab on into the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      June went first to a back-street in Paddington, where Mrs. Smeech, her
      &lsquo;lame duck,&rsquo; lived&mdash;an aged person, connected with the
      charring interest; but after half an hour spent in hearing her habitually
      lamentable recital, and dragooning her into temporary comfort, she went on
      to Stanhope Gate. The great house was closed and dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had decided to learn something at all costs. It was better to face the
      worst, and have it over. And this was her plan: To go first to Phil&rsquo;s
      aunt, Mrs. Baynes, and, failing information there, to Irene herself. She
      had no clear notion of what she would gain by these visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o&rsquo;clock she was in Lowndes Square. With a woman&rsquo;s
      instinct when trouble is to be faced, she had put on her best frock, and
      went to the battle with a glance as courageous as old Jolyon&rsquo;s
      itself. Her tremors had passed into eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baynes, Bosinney&rsquo;s aunt (Louisa was her name), was in her
      kitchen when June was announced, organizing the cook, for she was an
      excellent housewife, and, as Baynes always said, there was &lsquo;a lot in
      a good dinner.&rsquo; He did his best work after dinner. It was Baynes who
      built that remarkably fine row of tall crimson houses in Kensington which
      compete with so many others for the title of &lsquo;the ugliest in London.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing June&rsquo;s name, she went hurriedly to her bedroom, and,
      taking two large bracelets from a red morocco case in a locked drawer, put
      them on her white wrists&mdash;for she possessed in a remarkable degree
      that &lsquo;sense of property,&rsquo; which, as we know, is the touchstone
      of Forsyteism, and the foundation of good morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her figure, of medium height and broad build, with a tendency to
      embonpoint, was reflected by the mirror of her whitewood wardrobe, in a
      gown made under her own organization, of one of those half-tints,
      reminiscent of the distempered walls of corridors in large hotels. She
      raised her hands to her hair, which she wore a la Princesse de Galles, and
      touched it here and there, settling it more firmly on her head, and her
      eyes were full of an unconscious realism, as though she were looking in
      the face one of life&rsquo;s sordid facts, and making the best of it. In
      youth her cheeks had been of cream and roses, but they were mottled now by
      middle-age, and again that hard, ugly directness came into her eyes as she
      dabbed a powder-puff across her forehead. Putting the puff down, she stood
      quite still before the glass, arranging a smile over her high, important
      nose, her chin, (never large, and now growing smaller with the increase of
      her neck), her thin-lipped, down-drooping mouth. Quickly, not to lose the
      effect, she grasped her skirts strongly in both hands, and went
      downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been hoping for this visit for some time past. Whispers had
      reached her that things were not all right between her nephew and his
      fiancee. Neither of them had been near her for weeks. She had asked Phil
      to dinner many times; his invariable answer had been &lsquo;Too busy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her instinct was alarmed, and the instinct in such matters of this
      excellent woman was keen. She ought to have been a Forsyte; in young
      Jolyon&rsquo;s sense of the word, she certainly had that privilege, and
      merits description as such.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had married off her three daughters in a way that people said was
      beyond their deserts, for they had the professional plainness only to be
      found, as a rule, among the female kind of the more legal callings. Her
      name was upon the committees of numberless charities connected with the
      Church-dances, theatricals, or bazaars&mdash;and she never lent her name
      unless sure beforehand that everything had been thoroughly organized.
    </p>
    <p>
      She believed, as she often said, in putting things on a commercial basis;
      the proper function of the Church, of charity, indeed, of everything, was
      to strengthen the fabric of &lsquo;Society.&rsquo; Individual action,
      therefore, she considered immoral. Organization was the only thing, for by
      organization alone could you feel sure that you were getting a return for
      your money. Organization&mdash;and again, organization! And there is no
      doubt that she was what old Jolyon called her&mdash;&ldquo;a &lsquo;dab&rsquo;
      at that&rdquo;&mdash;he went further, he called her &ldquo;a humbug.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The enterprises to which she lent her name were organized so admirably
      that by the time the takings were handed over, they were indeed skim milk
      divested of all cream of human kindness. But as she often justly remarked,
      sentiment was to be deprecated. She was, in fact, a little academic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This great and good woman, so highly thought of in ecclesiastical circles,
      was one of the principal priestesses in the temple of Forsyteism, keeping
      alive day and night a sacred flame to the God of Property, whose altar is
      inscribed with those inspiring words: &lsquo;Nothing for nothing, and
      really remarkably little for sixpence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she entered a room it was felt that something substantial had come
      in, which was probably the reason of her popularity as a patroness. People
      liked something substantial when they had paid money for it; and they
      would look at her&mdash;surrounded by her staff in charity ballrooms, with
      her high nose and her broad, square figure, attired in an uniform covered
      with sequins&mdash;as though she were a general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing against her was that she had not a double name. She was a
      power in upper middle-class society, with its hundred sets and circles,
      all intersecting on the common battlefield of charity functions, and on
      that battlefield brushing skirts so pleasantly with the skirts of Society
      with the capital &lsquo;S.&rsquo; She was a power in society with the
      smaller &lsquo;s,&rsquo; that larger, more significant, and more powerful
      body, where the commercially Christian institutions, maxims, and &lsquo;principle,&rsquo;
      which Mrs. Baynes embodied, were real life-blood, circulating freely, real
      business currency, not merely the sterilized imitation that flowed in the
      veins of smaller Society with the larger &lsquo;S.&rsquo; People who knew
      her felt her to be sound&mdash;a sound woman, who never gave herself away,
      nor anything else, if she could possibly help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been on the worst sort of terms with Bosinney&rsquo;s father, who
      had not infrequently made her the object of an unpardonable ridicule. She
      alluded to him now that he was gone as her &lsquo;poor, dear, irreverend
      brother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She greeted June with the careful effusion of which she was a mistress, a
      little afraid of her as far as a woman of her eminence in the commercial
      and Christian world could be afraid&mdash;for so slight a girl June had a
      great dignity, the fearlessness of her eyes gave her that. And Mrs.
      Baynes, too, shrewdly recognized that behind the uncompromising frankness
      of June&rsquo;s manner there was much of the Forsyte. If the girl had been
      merely frank and courageous, Mrs. Baynes would have thought her &lsquo;cranky,&rsquo;
      and despised her; if she had been merely a Forsyte, like Francie&mdash;let
      us say&mdash;she would have patronized her from sheer weight of metal; but
      June, small though she was&mdash;Mrs. Baynes habitually admired quantity&mdash;gave
      her an uneasy feeling; and she placed her in a chair opposite the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another reason for her respect which Mrs. Baynes, too good a
      churchwoman to be worldly, would have been the last to admit&mdash;she
      often heard her husband describe old Jolyon as extremely well off, and was
      biassed towards his granddaughter for the soundest of all reasons. To-day
      she felt the emotion with which we read a novel describing a hero and an
      inheritance, nervously anxious lest, by some frightful lapse of the
      novelist, the young man should be left without it at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her manner was warm; she had never seen so clearly before how
      distinguished and desirable a girl this was. She asked after old Jolyon&rsquo;s
      health. A wonderful man for his age; so upright, and young looking, and
      how old was he? Eighty-one! She would never have thought it! They were at
      the sea! Very nice for them; she supposed June heard from Phil every day?
      Her light grey eyes became more prominent as she asked this question; but
      the girl met the glance without flinching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he never writes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baynes&rsquo;s eyes dropped; they had no intention of doing so, but
      they did. They recovered immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. That&rsquo;s Phil all over&mdash;he was always like
      that!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he?&rdquo; said June.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brevity of the answer caused Mrs. Baynes&rsquo;s bright smile a moment&rsquo;s
      hesitation; she disguised it by a quick movement, and spreading her skirts
      afresh, said: &ldquo;Why, my dear&mdash;he&rsquo;s quite the most
      harum-scarum person; one never pays the slightest attention to what he
      does!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The conviction came suddenly to June that she was wasting her time; even
      were she to put a question point-blank, she would never get anything out
      of this woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you see him?&rsquo; she asked, her face crimsoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The perspiration broke out on Mrs. Baynes&rsquo; forehead beneath the
      powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I don&rsquo;t remember when he was here last&mdash;indeed,
      we haven&rsquo;t seen much of him lately. He&rsquo;s so busy with your
      cousin&rsquo;s house; I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;ll be finished directly. We
      must organize a little dinner to celebrate the event; do come and stay the
      night with us!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said June. Again she thought: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      only wasting my time. This woman will tell me nothing.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up to go. A change came over Mrs. Baynes. She rose too; her lips
      twitched, she fidgeted her hands. Something was evidently very wrong, and
      she did not dare to ask this girl, who stood there, a slim, straight
      little figure, with her decided face, her set jaw, and resentful eyes. She
      was not accustomed to be afraid of asking questions&mdash;all organization
      was based on the asking of questions!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the issue was so grave that her nerve, normally strong, was fairly
      shaken; only that morning her husband had said: &ldquo;Old Mr. Forsyte
      must be worth well over a hundred thousand pounds!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And this girl stood there, holding out her hand&mdash;holding out her
      hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      The chance might be slipping away&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t tell&mdash;the
      chance of keeping her in the family, and yet she dared not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes followed June to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with an exclamation Mrs. Baynes ran forward, wobbling her bulky frame
      from side to side, and opened it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late! She heard the front door click, and stood still, an expression
      of real anger and mortification on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      June went along the Square with her bird-like quickness. She detested that
      woman now whom in happier days she had been accustomed to think so kind.
      Was she always to be put off thus, and forced to undergo this torturing
      suspense?
    </p>
    <p>
      She would go to Phil himself, and ask him what he meant. She had the right
      to know. She hurried on down Sloane Street till she came to Bosinney&rsquo;s
      number. Passing the swing-door at the bottom, she ran up the stairs, her
      heart thumping painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the third flight she paused for breath, and holding on to
      the bannisters, stood listening. No sound came from above.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a very white face she mounted the last flight. She saw the door, with
      his name on the plate. And the resolution that had brought her so far
      evaporated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The full meaning of her conduct came to her. She felt hot all over; the
      palms of her hands were moist beneath the thin silk covering of her
      gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back to the stairs, but did not descend. Leaning against the rail
      she tried to get rid of a feeling of being choked; and she gazed at the
      door with a sort of dreadful courage. No! she refused to go down. Did it
      matter what people thought of her? They would never know! No one would
      help her if she did not help herself! She would go through with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forcing herself, therefore, to leave the support of the wall, she rang the
      bell. The door did not open, and all her shame and fear suddenly abandoned
      her; she rang again and again, as though in spite of its emptiness she
      could drag some response out of that closed room, some recompense for the
      shame and fear that visit had cost her. It did not open; she left off
      ringing, and, sitting down at the top of the stairs, buried her face in
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she stole down, out into the air. She felt as though she had
      passed through a bad illness, and had no desire now but to get home as
      quickly as she could. The people she met seemed to know where she had
      been, what she had been doing; and suddenly&mdash;over on the opposite
      side, going towards his rooms from the direction of Montpellier Square&mdash;she
      saw Bosinney himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a movement to cross into the traffic. Their eyes met, and he
      raised his hat. An omnibus passed, obscuring her view; then, from the edge
      of the pavement, through a gap in the traffic, she saw him walking on.
    </p>
    <p>
      And June stood motionless, looking after him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;PERFECTION OF THE HOUSE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;One mockturtle, clear; one oxtail; two glasses of port.&rsquo;
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the upper room at French&rsquo;s, where a Forsyte could still get heavy
      English food, James and his son were sitting down to lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all eating-places James liked best to come here; there was something
      unpretentious, well-flavoured, and filling about it, and though he had
      been to a certain extent corrupted by the necessity for being fashionable,
      and the trend of habits keeping pace with an income that would increase,
      he still hankered in quiet City moments after the tasty fleshpots of his
      earlier days. Here you were served by hairy English waiters in aprons;
      there was sawdust on the floor, and three round gilt looking-glasses hung
      just above the line of sight. They had only recently done away with the
      cubicles, too, in which you could have your chop, prime chump, with a
      floury-potato, without seeing your neighbours, like a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tucked the top corner of his napkin behind the third button of his
      waistcoat, a practice he had been obliged to abandon years ago in the West
      End. He felt that he should relish his soup&mdash;the entire morning had
      been given to winding up the estate of an old friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      After filling his mouth with household bread, stale, he at once began:
      &ldquo;How are you going down to Robin Hill? You going to take Irene? You&rsquo;d
      better take her. I should think there&rsquo;ll be a lot that&rsquo;ll want
      seeing to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without looking up, Soames answered: &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t go? What&rsquo;s the meaning of that? She&rsquo;s going
      to live in the house, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s coming to women nowadays,&rdquo;
      mumbled James; &ldquo;I never used to have any trouble with them. She&rsquo;s
      had too much liberty. She&rsquo;s spoiled....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames lifted his eyes: &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have anything said against
      her,&rdquo; he said unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was only broken now by the supping of James&rsquo;s soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waiter brought the two glasses of port, but Soames stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the way to serve port,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;take
      them away, and bring the bottle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rousing himself from his reverie over the soup, James took one of his
      rapid shifting surveys of surrounding facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s in bed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you can have the
      carriage to take you down. I should think Irene&rsquo;d like the drive.
      This young Bosinney&rsquo;ll be there, I suppose, to show you over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to go and see for myself what sort of a job he&rsquo;s
      made finishing off,&rdquo; pursued James. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just drive
      round and pick you both up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going down by train,&rdquo; replied Soames. &ldquo;If you like
      to drive round and see, Irene might go with you, I can&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He signed to the waiter to bring the bill, which James paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      They parted at St. Paul&rsquo;s, Soames branching off to the station,
      James taking his omnibus westwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had secured the corner seat next the conductor, where his long legs
      made it difficult for anyone to get in, and at all who passed him he
      looked resentfully, as if they had no business to be using up his air.
    </p>
    <p>
      He intended to take an opportunity this afternoon of speaking to Irene. A
      word in time saved nine; and now that she was going to live in the country
      there was a chance for her to turn over a new leaf! He could see that
      Soames wouldn&rsquo;t stand very much more of her goings on!
    </p>
    <p>
      It did not occur to him to define what he meant by her &lsquo;goings on&rsquo;.
      the expression was wide, vague, and suited to a Forsyte. And James had
      more than his common share of courage after lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching home, he ordered out the barouche, with special instructions
      that the groom was to go too. He wished to be kind to her, and to give her
      every chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door of No.62 was opened he could distinctly hear her singing,
      and said so at once, to prevent any chance of being denied entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Mrs. Soames was in, but the maid did not know if she was seeing
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, moving with the rapidity that ever astonished the observers of his
      long figure and absorbed expression, went forthwith into the drawing-room
      without permitting this to be ascertained. He found Irene seated at the
      piano with her hands arrested on the keys, evidently listening to the
      voices in the hall. She greeted him without smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother-in-law&rsquo;s in bed,&rdquo; he began, hoping at once
      to enlist her sympathy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the carriage here. Now, be a
      good girl, and put on your hat and come with me for a drive. It&rsquo;ll
      do you good!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene looked at him as though about to refuse, but, seeming to change her
      mind, went upstairs, and came down again with her hat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to take me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just go down to Robin Hill,&rdquo; said James,
      spluttering out his words very quick; &ldquo;the horses want exercise, and
      I should like to see what they&rsquo;ve been doing down there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene hung back, but again changed her mind, and went out to the carriage,
      James brooding over her closely, to make quite sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not before he had got her more than half way that he began: &ldquo;Soames
      is very fond of you&mdash;he won&rsquo;t have anything said against you;
      why don&rsquo;t you show him more affection?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene flushed, and said in a low voice: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t show what I
      haven&rsquo;t got.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James looked at her sharply; he felt that now he had her in his own
      carriage, with his own horses and servants, he was really in command of
      the situation. She could not put him off; nor would she make a scene in
      public.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what you&rsquo;re about,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very good husband!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s answer was so low as to be almost inaudible among the sounds
      of traffic. He caught the words: &ldquo;You are not married to him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do with it? He&rsquo;s given you
      everything you want. He&rsquo;s always ready to take you anywhere, and now
      he&rsquo;s built you this house in the country. It&rsquo;s not as if you
      had anything of your own.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again James looked at her; he could not make out the expression on her
      face. She looked almost as if she were going to cry, and yet....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he muttered hastily, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve all
      tried to be kind to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s lips quivered; to his dismay James saw a tear steal down her
      cheek. He felt a choke rise in his own throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all fond of you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;d
      only&rdquo;&mdash;he was going to say, &ldquo;behave yourself,&rdquo; but
      changed it to&mdash;&ldquo;if you&rsquo;d only be more of a wife to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene did not answer, and James, too, ceased speaking. There was something
      in her silence which disconcerted him; it was not the silence of
      obstinacy, rather that of acquiescence in all that he could find to say.
      And yet he felt as if he had not had the last word. He could not
      understand this.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was unable, however, to long keep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that young Bosinney,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will be
      getting married to June now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s face changed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she said;
      &ldquo;you should ask her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she write to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;I thought you and she
      were such great friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene turned on him. &ldquo;Again,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you should ask
      her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; flustered James, frightened by her look, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      very odd that I can&rsquo;t get a plain answer to a plain question, but
      there it is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat ruminating over his rebuff, and burst out at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve warned you. You won&rsquo;t look ahead. Soames he
      doesn&rsquo;t say much, but I can see he won&rsquo;t stand a great deal
      more of this sort of thing. You&rsquo;ll have nobody but yourself to
      blame, and, what&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll get no sympathy from anybody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene bent her head with a little smiling bow. &ldquo;I am very much
      obliged to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James did not know what on earth to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright hot morning had changed slowly to a grey, oppressive afternoon;
      a heavy bank of clouds, with the yellow tinge of coming thunder, had risen
      in the south, and was creeping up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The branches of the trees dropped motionless across the road without the
      smallest stir of foliage. A faint odour of glue from the heated horses
      clung in the thick air; the coachman and groom, rigid and unbending,
      exchanged stealthy murmurs on the box, without ever turning their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      To James&rsquo; great relief they reached the house at last; the silence
      and impenetrability of this woman by his side, whom he had always thought
      so soft and mild, alarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage put them down at the door, and they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall was cool, and so still that it was like passing into a tomb; a
      shudder ran down James&rsquo;s spine. He quickly lifted the heavy leather
      curtains between the columns into the inner court.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not restrain an exclamation of approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decoration was really in excellent taste. The dull ruby tiles that
      extended from the foot of the walls to the verge of a circular clump of
      tall iris plants, surrounding in turn a sunken basin of white marble
      filled with water, were obviously of the best quality. He admired
      extremely the purple leather curtains drawn along one entire side, framing
      a huge white-tiled stove. The central partitions of the skylight had been
      slid back, and the warm air from outside penetrated into the very heart of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood, his hands behind him, his head bent back on his high, narrow
      shoulders, spying the tracery on the columns and the pattern of the frieze
      which ran round the ivory-coloured walls under the gallery. Evidently, no
      pains had been spared. It was quite the house of a gentleman. He went up
      to the curtains, and, having discovered how they were worked, drew them
      asunder and disclosed the picture-gallery, ending in a great window taking
      up the whole end of the room. It had a black oak floor, and its walls,
      again, were of ivory white. He went on throwing open doors, and peeping
      in. Everything was in apple-pie order, ready for immediate occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round at last to speak to Irene, and saw her standing over in
      the garden entrance, with her husband and Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though not remarkable for sensibility, James felt at once that something
      was wrong. He went up to them, and, vaguely alarmed, ignorant of the
      nature of the trouble, made an attempt to smooth things over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Mr. Bosinney?&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been spending money pretty freely down here, I should
      say!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned his back, and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      James looked from Bosinney&rsquo;s frowning face to Irene, and, in his
      agitation, spoke his thoughts aloud: &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t tell what&rsquo;s
      the matter. Nobody tells me anything!&rdquo; And, making off after his
      son, he heard Bosinney&rsquo;s short laugh, and his &ldquo;Well, thank
      God! You look so....&rdquo; Most unfortunately he lost the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had happened? He glanced back. Irene was very close to the architect,
      and her face not like the face he knew of her. He hastened up to his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames was pacing the picture-gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s all
      this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames looked at him with his supercilious calm unbroken, but James knew
      well enough that he was violently angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has exceeded his instructions
      again, that&rsquo;s all. So much the worse for him this time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round and walked back towards the door. James followed
      hurriedly, edging himself in front. He saw Irene take her finger from
      before her lips, heard her say something in her ordinary voice, and began
      to speak before he reached them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a storm coming on. We&rsquo;d better get home. We can&rsquo;t
      take you, I suppose, Mr. Bosinney? No, I suppose not. Then, good-bye!&rdquo;
      He held out his hand. Bosinney did not take it, but, turning with a laugh,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Mr. Forsyte. Don&rsquo;t get caught in the storm!&rdquo;
      and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began James, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sight of Irene&rsquo;s face stopped him. Taking hold of his
      daughter-in-law by the elbow, he escorted her towards the carriage. He
      felt certain, quite certain, they had been making some appointment or
      other....
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing in this world is more sure to upset a Forsyte than the discovery
      that something on which he has stipulated to spend a certain sum has cost
      more. And this is reasonable, for upon the accuracy of his estimates the
      whole policy of his life is ordered. If he cannot rely on definite values
      of property, his compass is amiss; he is adrift upon bitter waters without
      a helm.
    </p>
    <p>
      After writing to Bosinney in the terms that have already been chronicled,
      Soames had dismissed the cost of the house from his mind. He believed that
      he had made the matter of the final cost so very plain that the
      possibility of its being again exceeded had really never entered his head.
      On hearing from Bosinney that his limit of twelve thousand pounds would be
      exceeded by something like four hundred, he had grown white with anger.
      His original estimate of the cost of the house completed had been ten
      thousand pounds, and he had often blamed himself severely for allowing
      himself to be led into repeated excesses. Over this last expenditure,
      however, Bosinney had put himself completely in the wrong. How on earth a
      fellow could make such an ass of himself Soames could not conceive; but he
      had done so, and all the rancour and hidden jealousy that had been burning
      against him for so long was now focussed in rage at this crowning piece of
      extravagance. The attitude of the confident and friendly husband was gone.
      To preserve property&mdash;his wife&mdash;he had assumed it, to preserve
      property of another kind he lost it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he had said to Bosinney when he could speak, &ldquo;and
      I suppose you&rsquo;re perfectly contented with yourself. But I may as
      well tell you that you&rsquo;ve altogether mistaken your man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      What he meant by those words he did not quite know at the time, but after
      dinner he looked up the correspondence between himself and Bosinney to
      make quite sure. There could be no two opinions about it&mdash;the fellow
      had made himself liable for that extra four hundred, or, at all events,
      for three hundred and fifty of it, and he would have to make it good.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at his wife&rsquo;s face when he came to this conclusion.
      Seated in her usual seat on the sofa, she was altering the lace on a
      collar. She had not once spoken to him all the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up to the mantelpiece, and contemplating his face in the mirror
      said: &ldquo;Your friend the Buccaneer has made a fool of himself; he will
      have to pay for it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him scornfully, and answered: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what
      you are talking about!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You soon will. A mere trifle, quite beneath your contempt&mdash;four
      hundred pounds.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you are going to make him pay that towards this
      hateful, house?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know he&rsquo;s got nothing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are meaner than I thought you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned from the mirror, and unconsciously taking a china cup from
      the mantelpiece, clasped his hands around it as though praying. He saw her
      bosom rise and fall, her eyes darkening with anger, and taking no notice
      of the taunt, he asked quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you carrying on a flirtation with Bosinney?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes met his, and he looked away. He neither believed nor disbelieved
      her, but he knew that he had made a mistake in asking; he never had known,
      never would know, what she was thinking. The sight of her inscrutable
      face, the thought of all the hundreds of evenings he had seen her sitting
      there like that soft and passive, but unreadable, unknown, enraged him
      beyond measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are made of stone,&rdquo; he said, clenching his
      fingers so hard that he broke the fragile cup. The pieces fell into the
      grate. And Irene smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to forget,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that cup is not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames gripped her arm. &ldquo;A good beating,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is
      the only thing that would bring you to your senses,&rdquo; but turning on
      his heel, he left the room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;SOAMES SITS ON THE STAIRS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soames went up-stairs that night with the feeling that he had gone too
      far. He was prepared to offer excuses for his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned out the gas still burning in the passage outside their room.
      Pausing, with his hand on the knob of the door, he tried to shape his
      apology, for he had no intention of letting her see that he was nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the door did not open, nor when he pulled it and turned the handle
      firmly. She must have locked it for some reason, and forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering his dressing-room, where the gas was also lighted and burning
      low, he went quickly to the other door. That too was locked. Then he
      noticed that the camp bed which he occasionally used was prepared, and his
      sleeping-suit laid out upon it. He put his hand up to his forehead, and
      brought it away wet. It dawned on him that he was barred out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to the door, and rattling the handle stealthily, called:
      &ldquo;Unlock the door, do you hear? Unlock the door!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a faint rustling, but no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear? Let me in at once&mdash;I insist on being let in!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He could catch the sound of her breathing close to the door, like the
      breathing of a creature threatened by danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something terrifying in this inexorable silence, in the
      impossibility of getting at her. He went back to the other door, and
      putting his whole weight against it, tried to burst it open. The door was
      a new one&mdash;he had had them renewed himself, in readiness for their
      coming in after the honeymoon. In a rage he lifted his foot to kick in the
      panel; the thought of the servants restrained him, and he felt suddenly
      that he was beaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flinging himself down in the dressing-room, he took up a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      But instead of the print he seemed to see his wife&mdash;with her yellow
      hair flowing over her bare shoulders, and her great dark eyes&mdash;standing
      like an animal at bay. And the whole meaning of her act of revolt came to
      him. She meant it to be for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not sit still, and went to the door again. He could still hear
      her, and he called: &ldquo;Irene! Irene!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not mean to make his voice pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ominous answer, the faint sounds ceased. He stood with clenched hands,
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he stole round on tiptoe, and running suddenly at the other
      door, made a supreme effort to break it open. It creaked, but did not
      yield. He sat down on the stairs and buried his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time he sat there in the dark, the moon through the skylight
      above laying a pale smear which lengthened slowly towards him down the
      stairway. He tried to be philosophical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since she had locked her doors she had no further claim as a wife, and he
      would console himself with other women.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a spectral journey he made among such delights&mdash;he had no
      appetite for these exploits. He had never had much, and he had lost the
      habit. He felt that he could never recover it. His hunger could only be
      appeased by his wife, inexorable and frightened, behind these shut doors.
      No other woman could help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conviction came to him with terrible force out there in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      His philosophy left him; and surly anger took its place. Her conduct was
      immoral, inexcusable, worthy of any punishment within his power. He
      desired no one but her, and she refused him!
    </p>
    <p>
      She must really hate him, then! He had never believed it yet. He did not
      believe it now. It seemed to him incredible. He felt as though he had lost
      for ever his power of judgment. If she, so soft and yielding as he had
      always judged her, could take this decided step&mdash;what could not
      happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he asked himself again if she were carrying on an intrigue with
      Bosinney. He did not believe that she was; he could not afford to believe
      such a reason for her conduct&mdash;the thought was not to be faced.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unbearable to contemplate the necessity of making his marital
      relations public property. Short of the most convincing proofs he must
      still refuse to believe, for he did not wish to punish himself. And all
      the time at heart&mdash;he did believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight cast a greyish tinge over his figure, hunched against the
      staircase wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney was in love with her! He hated the fellow, and would not spare
      him now. He could and would refuse to pay a penny piece over twelve
      thousand and fifty pounds&mdash;the extreme limit fixed in the
      correspondence; or rather he would pay, he would pay and sue him for
      damages. He would go to Jobling and Boulter and put the matter in their
      hands. He would ruin the impecunious beggar! And suddenly&mdash;though
      what connection between the thoughts?&mdash;he reflected that Irene had no
      money either. They were both beggars. This gave him a strange
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was broken by a faint creaking through the wall. She was going
      to bed at last. Ah! Joy and pleasant dreams! If she threw the door open
      wide he would not go in now!
    </p>
    <p>
      But his lips, that were twisted in a bitter smile, twitched; he covered
      his eyes with his hands....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late the following afternoon when Soames stood in the dining-room
      window gazing gloomily into the Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight still showered on the plane-trees, and in the breeze their
      gay broad leaves shone and swung in rhyme to a barrel organ at the corner.
      It was playing a waltz, an old waltz that was out of fashion, with a
      fateful rhythm in the notes; and it went on and on, though nothing indeed
      but leaves danced to the tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman did not look too gay, for she was tired; and from the tall
      houses no one threw her down coppers. She moved the organ on, and three
      doors off began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the waltz they had played at Roger&rsquo;s when Irene had danced
      with Bosinney; and the perfume of the gardenias she had worn came back to
      Soames, drifted by the malicious music, as it had been drifted to him
      then, when she passed, her hair glistening, her eyes so soft, drawing
      Bosinney on and on down an endless ballroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organ woman plied her handle slowly; she had been grinding her tune
      all day-grinding it in Sloane Street hard by, grinding it perhaps to
      Bosinney himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames turned, took a cigarette from the carven box, and walked back to
      the window. The tune had mesmerized him, and there came into his view
      Irene, her sunshade furled, hastening homewards down the Square, in a
      soft, rose-coloured blouse with drooping sleeves, that he did not know.
      She stopped before the organ, took out her purse, and gave the woman
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shrank back and stood where he could see into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in with her latch-key, put down her sunshade, and stood looking
      at herself in the glass. Her cheeks were flushed as if the sun had burned
      them; her lips were parted in a smile. She stretched her arms out as
      though to embrace herself, with a laugh that for all the world was like a
      sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very-pretty!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as though shot she spun round, and would have passed him up the
      stairs. He barred the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why such a hurry?&rdquo; he said, and his eyes fastened on a curl
      of hair fallen loose across her ear....
    </p>
    <p>
      He hardly recognised her. She seemed on fire, so deep and rich the colour
      of her cheeks, her eyes, her lips, and of the unusual blouse she wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put up her hand and smoothed back the curl. She was breathing fast and
      deep, as though she had been running, and with every breath perfume seemed
      to come from her hair, and from her body, like perfume from an opening
      flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that blouse,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      a soft, shapeless thing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his finger towards her breast, but she dashed his hand aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her wrist; she wrenched it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where may you have been?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In heaven&mdash;out of this house!&rdquo; With those words she fled
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside&mdash;in thanksgiving&mdash;at the very door, the organ-grinder
      was playing the waltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Soames stood motionless. What prevented him from following her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it that, with the eyes of faith, he saw Bosinney looking down from
      that high window in Sloane Street, straining his eyes for yet another
      glimpse of Irene&rsquo;s vanished figure, cooling his flushed face,
      dreaming of the moment when she flung herself on his breast&mdash;the
      scent of her still in the air around, and the sound of her laugh that was
      like a sob?

      CHAPTER I&mdash;MRS. MACANDER&rsquo;S EVIDENCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many people, no doubt, including the editor of the &lsquo;Ultra
      Vivisectionist,&rsquo; then in the bloom of its first youth, would say
      that Soames was less than a man not to have removed the locks from his
      wife&rsquo;s doors, and, after beating her soundly, resumed wedded
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brutality is not so deplorably diluted by humaneness as it used to be, yet
      a sentimental segment of the population may still be relieved to learn
      that he did none of these things. For active brutality is not popular with
      Forsytes; they are too circumspect, and, on the whole, too softhearted.
      And in Soames there was some common pride, not sufficient to make him do a
      really generous action, but enough to prevent his indulging in an
      extremely mean one, except, perhaps, in very hot blood. Above all this a
      true Forsyte refused to feel himself ridiculous. Short of actually beating
      his wife, he perceived nothing to be done; he therefore accepted the
      situation without another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the summer and autumn he continued to go to the office, to sort
      his pictures, and ask his friends to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not leave town; Irene refused to go away. The house at Robin Hill,
      finished though it was, remained empty and ownerless. Soames had brought a
      suit against the Buccaneer, in which he claimed from him the sum of three
      hundred and fifty pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A firm of solicitors, Messrs. Freak and Able, had put in a defence on
      Bosinney&rsquo;s behalf. Admitting the facts, they raised a point on the
      correspondence which, divested of legal phraseology, amounted to this: To
      speak of &lsquo;a free hand in the terms of this correspondence&rsquo; is
      an Irish bull.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a chance, fortuitous but not improbable in the close borough of legal
      circles, a good deal of information came to Soames&rsquo; ear anent this
      line of policy, the working partner in his firm, Bustard, happening to sit
      next at dinner at Walmisley&rsquo;s, the Taxing Master, to young Chankery,
      of the Common Law Bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessity for talking what is known as &lsquo;shop,&rsquo; which comes
      on all lawyers with the removal of the ladies, caused Chankery, a young
      and promising advocate, to propound an impersonal conundrum to his
      neighbour, whose name he did not know, for, seated as he permanently was
      in the background, Bustard had practically no name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, said Chankery, a case coming on with a &lsquo;very nice point.&rsquo;
      He then explained, preserving every professional discretion, the riddle in
      Soames&rsquo; case. Everyone, he said, to whom he had spoken, thought it a
      nice point. The issue was small unfortunately, &lsquo;though d&mdash;&mdash;d
      serious for his client he believed&rsquo;&mdash;Walmisley&rsquo;s
      champagne was bad but plentiful. A Judge would make short work of it, he
      was afraid. He intended to make a big effort&mdash;the point was a nice
      one. What did his neighbour say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bustard, a model of secrecy, said nothing. He related the incident to
      Soames however with some malice, for this quiet man was capable of human
      feeling, ending with his own opinion that the point was &lsquo;a very nice
      one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with his resolve, our Forsyte had put his interests into the
      hands of Jobling and Boulter. From the moment of doing so he regretted
      that he had not acted for himself. On receiving a copy of Bosinney&rsquo;s
      defence he went over to their offices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boulter, who had the matter in hand, Jobling having died some years
      before, told him that in his opinion it was rather a nice point; he would
      like counsel&rsquo;s opinion on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames told him to go to a good man, and they went to Waterbuck, Q.C.,
      marking him ten and one, who kept the papers six weeks and then wrote as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In my opinion the true interpretation of this correspondence
      depends very much on the intention of the parties, and will turn upon the
      evidence given at the trial. I am of opinion that an attempt should be
      made to secure from the architect an admission that he understood he was
      not to spend at the outside more than twelve thousand and fifty pounds.
      With regard to the expression, &ldquo;a free hand in the terms of this
      correspondence,&rdquo; to which my attention is directed, the point is a
      nice one; but I am of opinion that upon the whole the ruling in &ldquo;Boileau
      v. The Blasted Cement Co., Ltd.,&rdquo; will apply.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this opinion they acted, administering interrogatories, but to their
      annoyance Messrs. Freak and Able answered these in so masterly a fashion
      that nothing whatever was admitted and that without prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on October 1 that Soames read Waterbuck&rsquo;s opinion, in the
      dining-room before dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made him nervous; not so much because of the case of &lsquo;Boileau v.
      The Blasted Cement Co., Ltd.,&rsquo; as that the point had lately begun to
      seem to him, too, a nice one; there was about it just that pleasant
      flavour of subtlety so attractive to the best legal appetites. To have his
      own impression confirmed by Waterbuck, Q.C., would have disturbed any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat thinking it over, and staring at the empty grate, for though autumn
      had come, the weather kept as gloriously fine that jubilee year as if it
      were still high August. It was not pleasant to be disturbed; he desired
      too passionately to set his foot on Bosinney&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though he had not seen the architect since the last afternoon at Robin
      Hill, he was never free from the sense of his presence&mdash;never free
      from the memory of his worn face with its high cheek bones and
      enthusiastic eyes. It would not be too much to say that he had never got
      rid of the feeling of that night when he heard the peacock&rsquo;s cry at
      dawn&mdash;the feeling that Bosinney haunted the house. And every man&rsquo;s
      shape that he saw in the dark evenings walking past, seemed that of him
      whom George had so appropriately named the Buccaneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene still met him, he was certain; where, or how, he neither knew, nor
      asked; deterred by a vague and secret dread of too much knowledge. It all
      seemed subterranean nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes when he questioned his wife as to where she had been, which he
      still made a point of doing, as every Forsyte should, she looked very
      strange. Her self-possession was wonderful, but there were moments when,
      behind the mask of her face, inscrutable as it had always been to him,
      lurked an expression he had never been used to see there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had taken to lunching out too; when he asked Bilson if her mistress
      had been in to lunch, as often as not she would answer: &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He strongly disapproved of her gadding about by herself, and told her so.
      But she took no notice. There was something that angered, amazed, yet
      almost amused him about the calm way in which she disregarded his wishes.
      It was really as if she were hugging to herself the thought of a triumph
      over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from the perusal of Waterbuck, Q.C.&rsquo;. opinion, and, going
      upstairs, entered her room, for she did not lock her doors till bed-time&mdash;she
      had the decency, he found, to save the feelings of the servants. She was
      brushing her hair, and turned to him with strange fierceness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Please leave my room!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered: &ldquo;I want to know how long this state of things between
      us is to last? I have put up with it long enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please leave my room?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you treat me as your husband?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I shall take steps to make you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared, amazed at the calmness of her answer. Her lips were compressed
      in a thin line; her hair lay in fluffy masses on her bare shoulders, in
      all its strange golden contrast to her dark eyes&mdash;those eyes alive
      with the emotions of fear, hate, contempt, and odd, haunting triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, please, will you leave my room?&rdquo; He turned round, and
      went sulkily out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew very well that he had no intention of taking steps, and he saw
      that she knew too&mdash;knew that he was afraid to.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a habit with him to tell her the doings of his day: how such and
      such clients had called; how he had arranged a mortgage for Parkes; how
      that long-standing suit of Fryer v. Forsyte was getting on, which, arising
      in the preternaturally careful disposition of his property by his great
      uncle Nicholas, who had tied it up so that no one could get at it at all,
      seemed likely to remain a source of income for several solicitors till the
      Day of Judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how he had called in at Jobson&rsquo;s, and seen a Boucher sold, which
      he had just missed buying of Talleyrand and Sons in Pall Mall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an admiration for Boucher, Watteau, and all that school. It was a
      habit with him to tell her all these matters, and he continued to do it
      even now, talking for long spells at dinner, as though by the volubility
      of words he could conceal from himself the ache in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, if they were alone, he made an attempt to kiss her when she said
      good-night. He may have had some vague notion that some night she would
      let him; or perhaps only the feeling that a husband ought to kiss his
      wife. Even if she hated him, he at all events ought not to put himself in
      the wrong by neglecting this ancient rite.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why did she hate him? Even now he could not altogether believe it. It
      was strange to be hated!&mdash;the emotion was too extreme; yet he hated
      Bosinney, that Buccaneer, that prowling vagabond, that night-wanderer. For
      in his thoughts Soames always saw him lying in wait&mdash;wandering. Ah,
      but he must be in very low water! Young Burkitt, the architect, had seen
      him coming out of a third-rate restaurant, looking terribly down in the
      mouth!
    </p>
    <p>
      During all the hours he lay awake, thinking over the situation, which
      seemed to have no end&mdash;unless she should suddenly come to her senses&mdash;never
      once did the thought of separating from his wife seriously enter his
      head....
    </p>
    <p>
      And the Forsytes! What part did they play in this stage of Soames&rsquo;
      subterranean tragedy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth to say, little or none, for they were at the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      From hotels, hydropathics, or lodging-houses, they were bathing daily;
      laying in a stock of ozone to last them through the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each section, in the vineyard of its own choosing, grew and culled and
      pressed and bottled the grapes of a pet sea-air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of September began to witness their several returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      In rude health and small omnibuses, with considerable colour in their
      cheeks, they arrived daily from the various termini. The following morning
      saw them back at their vocations.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next Sunday Timothy&rsquo;s was thronged from lunch till dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst other gossip, too numerous and interesting to relate, Mrs.
      Septimus Small mentioned that Soames and Irene had not been away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remained for a comparative outsider to supply the next evidence of
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that one afternoon late in September, Mrs. MacAnder, Winifred
      Dartie&rsquo;s greatest friend, taking a constitutional, with young
      Augustus Flippard, on her bicycle in Richmond Park, passed Irene and
      Bosinney walking from the bracken towards the Sheen Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the poor little woman was thirsty, for she had ridden long on a
      hard, dry road, and, as all London knows, to ride a bicycle and talk to
      young Flippard will try the toughest constitution; or perhaps the sight of
      the cool bracken grove, whence &lsquo;those two&rsquo; were coming down,
      excited her envy. The cool bracken grove on the top of the hill, with the
      oak boughs for roof, where the pigeons were raising an endless wedding
      hymn, and the autumn, humming, whispered to the ears of lovers in the
      fern, while the deer stole by. The bracken grove of irretrievable
      delights, of golden minutes in the long marriage of heaven and earth! The
      bracken grove, sacred to stags, to strange tree-stump fauns leaping around
      the silver whiteness of a birch-tree nymph at summer dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lady knew all the Forsytes, and having been at June&rsquo;s &lsquo;at
      home,&rsquo; was not at a loss to see with whom she had to deal. Her own
      marriage, poor thing, had not been successful, but having had the good
      sense and ability to force her husband into pronounced error, she herself
      had passed through the necessary divorce proceedings without incurring
      censure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was therefore a judge of all that sort of thing, and lived in one of
      those large buildings, where in small sets of apartments, are gathered
      incredible quantities of Forsytes, whose chief recreation out of business
      hours is the discussion of each other&rsquo;s affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little woman, perhaps she was thirsty, certainly she was bored, for
      Flippard was a wit. To see &lsquo;those two&rsquo; in so unlikely a spot
      was quite a merciful &lsquo;pick-me-up.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At the MacAnder, like all London, Time pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      This small but remarkable woman merits attention; her all-seeing eye and
      shrewd tongue were inscrutably the means of furthering the ends of
      Providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an air of being in at the death, she had an almost distressing power
      of taking care of herself. She had done more, perhaps, in her way than any
      woman about town to destroy the sense of chivalry which still clogs the
      wheel of civilization. So smart she was, and spoken of endearingly as
      &lsquo;the little MacAnder!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dressing tightly and well, she belonged to a Woman&rsquo;s Club, but was
      by no means the neurotic and dismal type of member who was always thinking
      of her rights. She took her rights unconsciously, they came natural to
      her, and she knew exactly how to make the most of them without exciting
      anything but admiration amongst that great class to whom she was
      affiliated, not precisely perhaps by manner, but by birth, breeding, and
      the true, the secret gauge, a sense of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter of a Bedfordshire solicitor, by the daughter of a clergyman,
      she had never, through all the painful experience of being married to a
      very mild painter with a cranky love of Nature, who had deserted her for
      an actress, lost touch with the requirements, beliefs, and inner feeling
      of Society; and, on attaining her liberty, she placed herself without
      effort in the very van of Forsyteism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always in good spirits, and &lsquo;full of information,&rsquo; she was
      universally welcomed. She excited neither surprise nor disapprobation when
      encountered on the Rhine or at Zermatt, either alone, or travelling with a
      lady and two gentlemen; it was felt that she was perfectly capable of
      taking care of herself; and the hearts of all Forsytes warmed to that
      wonderful instinct, which enabled her to enjoy everything without giving
      anything away. It was generally felt that to such women as Mrs. MacAnder
      should we look for the perpetuation and increase of our best type of
      woman. She had never had any children.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was one thing more than another that she could not stand it was
      one of those soft women with what men called &lsquo;charm&rsquo; about
      them, and for Mrs. Soames she always had an especial dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obscurely, no doubt, she felt that if charm were once admitted as the
      criterion, smartness and capability must go to the wall; and she hated&mdash;with
      a hatred the deeper that at times this so-called charm seemed to disturb
      all calculations&mdash;the subtle seductiveness which she could not
      altogether overlook in Irene.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, however, that she could see nothing in the woman&mdash;there was
      no &lsquo;go&rsquo; about her&mdash;she would never be able to stand up
      for herself&mdash;anyone could take advantage of her, that was plain&mdash;she
      could not see in fact what men found to admire!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not really ill-natured, but, in maintaining her position after the
      trying circumstances of her married life, she had found it so necessary to
      be &lsquo;full of information,&rsquo; that the idea of holding her tongue
      about &lsquo;those two&rsquo; in the Park never occurred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it so happened that she was dining that very evening at Timothy&rsquo;s,
      where she went sometimes to &lsquo;cheer the old things up,&rsquo; as she
      was wont to put it. The same people were always asked to meet her:
      Winifred Dartie and her husband; Francie, because she belonged to the
      artistic circles, for Mrs. MacAnder was known to contribute articles on
      dress to &lsquo;The Ladies Kingdom Come&rsquo;. and for her to flirt with,
      provided they could be obtained, two of the Hayman boys, who, though they
      never said anything, were believed to be fast and thoroughly intimate with
      all that was latest in smart Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twenty-five minutes past seven she turned out the electric light in her
      little hall, and wrapped in her opera cloak with the chinchilla collar,
      came out into the corridor, pausing a moment to make sure she had her
      latch-key. These little self-contained flats were convenient; to be sure,
      she had no light and no air, but she could shut it up whenever she liked
      and go away. There was no bother with servants, and she never felt tied as
      she used to when poor, dear Fred was always about, in his mooney way. She
      retained no rancour against poor, dear Fred, he was such a fool; but the
      thought of that actress drew from her, even now, a little, bitter,
      derisive smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firmly snapping the door to, she crossed the corridor, with its gloomy,
      yellow-ochre walls, and its infinite vista of brown, numbered doors. The
      lift was going down; and wrapped to the ears in the high cloak, with every
      one of her auburn hairs in its place, she waited motionless for it to stop
      at her floor. The iron gates clanked open; she entered. There were already
      three occupants, a man in a great white waistcoat, with a large, smooth
      face like a baby&rsquo;s, and two old ladies in black, with mittened
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. MacAnder smiled at them; she knew everybody; and all these three, who
      had been admirably silent before, began to talk at once. This was Mrs.
      MacAnder&rsquo;s successful secret. She provoked conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout a descent of five stories the conversation continued, the lift
      boy standing with his back turned, his cynical face protruding through the
      bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the bottom they separated, the man in the white waistcoat sentimentally
      to the billiard room, the old ladies to dine and say to each other:
      &ldquo;A dear little woman!&rdquo; &ldquo;Such a rattle!&rdquo; and Mrs.
      MacAnder to her cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. MacAnder dined at Timothy&rsquo;s, the conversation (although
      Timothy himself could never be induced to be present) took that wider,
      man-of-the-world tone current among Forsytes at large, and this, no doubt,
      was what put her at a premium there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small and Aunt Hester found it an exhilarating change. &ldquo;If
      only,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;Timothy would meet her!&rdquo; It was felt
      that she would do him good. She could tell you, for instance, the latest
      story of Sir Charles Fiste&rsquo;s son at Monte Carlo; who was the real
      heroine of Tynemouth Eddy&rsquo;s fashionable novel that everyone was
      holding up their hands over, and what they were doing in Paris about
      wearing bloomers. She was so sensible, too, knowing all about that vexed
      question, whether to send young Nicholas&rsquo; eldest into the navy as
      his mother wished, or make him an accountant as his father thought would
      be safer. She strongly deprecated the navy. If you were not exceptionally
      brilliant or exceptionally well connected, they passed you over so
      disgracefully, and what was it after all to look forward to, even if you
      became an admiral&mdash;a pittance! An accountant had many more chances,
      but let him be put with a good firm, where there was no risk at starting!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she would give them a tip on the Stock Exchange; not that Mrs.
      Small or Aunt Hester ever took it. They had indeed no money to invest; but
      it seemed to bring them into such exciting touch with the realities of
      life. It was an event. They would ask Timothy, they said. But they never
      did, knowing in advance that it would upset him. Surreptitiously, however,
      for weeks after they would look in that paper, which they took with
      respect on account of its really fashionable proclivities, to see whether
      &lsquo;Bright&rsquo;s Rubies&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Woollen Mackintosh
      Company&rsquo; were up or down. Sometimes they could not find the name of
      the company at all; and they would wait until James or Roger or even
      Swithin came in, and ask them in voices trembling with curiosity how that
      &lsquo;Bolivia Lime and Speltrate&rsquo; was doing&mdash;they could not
      find it in the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Roger would answer: &ldquo;What do you want to know for? Some trash!
      You&rsquo;ll go burning your fingers&mdash;investing your money in lime,
      and things you know nothing about! Who told you?&rdquo; and ascertaining
      what they had been told, he would go away, and, making inquiries in the
      City, would perhaps invest some of his own money in the concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about the middle of dinner, just in fact as the saddle of mutton
      had been brought in by Smither, that Mrs. MacAnder, looking airily round,
      said: &ldquo;Oh! and whom do you think I passed to-day in Richmond Park?
      You&rsquo;ll never guess&mdash;Mrs. Soames and&mdash;Mr. Bosinney. They
      must have been down to look at the house!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred Dartie coughed, and no one said a word. It was the piece of
      evidence they had all unconsciously been waiting for.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do Mrs. MacAnder justice, she had been to Switzerland and the Italian
      lakes with a party of three, and had not heard of Soames&rsquo; rupture
      with his architect. She could not tell, therefore, the profound impression
      her words would make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upright and a little flushed, she moved her small, shrewd eyes from face
      to face, trying to gauge the effect of her words. On either side of her a
      Hayman boy, his lean, taciturn, hungry face turned towards his plate, ate
      his mutton steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two, Giles and Jesse, were so alike and so inseparable that they
      were known as the Dromios. They never talked, and seemed always completely
      occupied in doing nothing. It was popularly supposed that they were
      cramming for an important examination. They walked without hats for long
      hours in the Gardens attached to their house, books in their hands, a
      fox-terrier at their heels, never saying a word, and smoking all the time.
      Every morning, about fifty yards apart, they trotted down Campden Hill on
      two lean hacks, with legs as long as their own, and every morning about an
      hour later, still fifty yards apart, they cantered up again. Every
      evening, wherever they had dined, they might be observed about half-past
      ten, leaning over the balustrade of the Alhambra promenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were never seen otherwise than together; in this way passing their
      lives, apparently perfectly content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by some dumb stirring within them of the feelings of gentlemen,
      they turned at this painful moment to Mrs. MacAnder, and said in precisely
      the same voice: &ldquo;Have you seen the...?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was her surprise at being thus addressed that she put down her fork;
      and Smither, who was passing, promptly removed her plate. Mrs. MacAnder,
      however, with presence of mind, said instantly: &ldquo;I must have a
      little more of that nice mutton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But afterwards in the drawing&mdash;room she sat down by Mrs. Small,
      determined to get to the bottom of the matter. And she began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a charming woman, Mrs. Soames; such a sympathetic temperament!
      Soames is a really lucky man!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her anxiety for information had not made sufficient allowance for that
      inner Forsyte skin which refuses to share its troubles with outsiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Septimus Small, drawing herself up with a creak and rustle of her
      whole person, said, shivering in her dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, it is a subject we do not talk about!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2HCH0025" id="link2HCH0025">

    </div>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;NIGHT IN THE PARK
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although with her infallible instinct Mrs. Small had said the very thing
      to make her guest &lsquo;more intriguee than ever,&rsquo; it is difficult
      to see how else she could truthfully have spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a subject which the Forsytes could talk about even among
      themselves&mdash;to use the word Soames had invented to characterize to
      himself the situation, it was &lsquo;subterranean.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, within a week of Mrs. MacAnder&rsquo;s encounter in Richmond Park, to
      all of them&mdash;save Timothy, from whom it was carefully kept&mdash;to
      James on his domestic beat from the Poultry to Park Lane, to George the
      wild one, on his daily adventure from the bow window at the Haversnake to
      the billiard room at the &lsquo;Red Pottle,&rsquo; was it known that
      &lsquo;those two&rsquo; had gone to extremes.
    </p>
    <p>
      George (it was he who invented many of those striking expressions still
      current in fashionable circles) voiced the sentiment more accurately than
      any one when he said to his brother Eustace that &lsquo;the Buccaneer&rsquo;
      was &lsquo;going it&rsquo;. he expected Soames was about &lsquo;fed up.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was felt that he must be, and yet, what could be done? He ought perhaps
      to take steps; but to take steps would be deplorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without an open scandal which they could not see their way to
      recommending, it was difficult to see what steps could be taken. In this
      impasse, the only thing was to say nothing to Soames, and nothing to each
      other; in fact, to pass it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      By displaying towards Irene a dignified coldness, some impression might be
      made upon her; but she was seldom now to be seen, and there seemed a
      slight difficulty in seeking her out on purpose to show her coldness.
      Sometimes in the privacy of his bedroom James would reveal to Emily the
      real suffering that his son&rsquo;s misfortune caused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; he would say; &ldquo;it worries me out
      of my life. There&rsquo;ll be a scandal, and that&rsquo;ll do him no good.
      I shan&rsquo;t say anything to him. There might be nothing in it. What do
      you think? She&rsquo;s very artistic, they tell me. What? Oh, you&rsquo;re
      a &lsquo;regular Juley! Well, I don&rsquo;t know; I expect the worst. This
      is what comes of having no children. I knew how it would be from the
      first. They never told me they didn&rsquo;t mean to have any children&mdash;nobody
      tells me anything!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On his knees by the side of the bed, his eyes open and fixed with worry,
      he would breathe into the counterpane. Clad in his nightshirt, his neck
      poked forward, his back rounded, he resembled some long white bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our Father-,&rdquo; he repeated, turning over and over again the
      thought of this possible scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like old Jolyon, he, too, at the bottom of his heart set the blame of the
      tragedy down to family interference. What business had that lot&mdash;he
      began to think of the Stanhope Gate branch, including young Jolyon and his
      daughter, as &lsquo;that lot&rsquo;&mdash;to introduce a person like this
      Bosinney into the family? (He had heard George&rsquo;s soubriquet, &lsquo;The
      Buccaneer,&rsquo; but he could make nothing of that&mdash;the young man
      was an architect.)
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to feel that his brother Jolyon, to whom he had always looked up
      and on whose opinion he had relied, was not quite what he had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not having his eldest brother&rsquo;s force of character, he was more sad
      than angry. His great comfort was to go to Winifred&rsquo;s, and take the
      little Darties in his carriage over to Kensington Gardens, and there, by
      the Round Pond, he could often be seen walking with his eyes fixed
      anxiously on little Publius Dartie&rsquo;s sailing-boat, which he had
      himself freighted with a penny, as though convinced that it would never
      again come to shore; while little Publius&mdash;who, James delighted to
      say, was not a bit like his father skipping along under his lee, would try
      to get him to bet another that it never would, having found that it always
      did. And James would make the bet; he always paid&mdash;sometimes as many
      as three or four pennies in the afternoon, for the game seemed never to
      pall on little Publius&mdash;and always in paying he said: &ldquo;Now,
      that&rsquo;s for your money-box. Why, you&rsquo;re getting quite a rich
      man!&rdquo; The thought of his little grandson&rsquo;s growing wealth was
      a real pleasure to him. But little Publius knew a sweet-shop, and a trick
      worth two of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they would walk home across the Park, James&rsquo; figure, with high
      shoulders and absorbed and worried face, exercising its tall, lean
      protectorship, pathetically unregarded, over the robust child-figures of
      Imogen and little Publius.
    </p>
    <p>
      But those Gardens and that Park were not sacred to James. Forsytes and
      tramps, children and lovers, rested and wandered day after day, night
      after night, seeking one and all some freedom from labour, from the reek
      and turmoil of the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leaves browned slowly, lingering with the sun and summer-like warmth
      of the nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday, October 5, the sky that had been blue all day deepened after
      sunset to the bloom of purple grapes. There was no moon, and a clear dark,
      like some velvety garment, was wrapped around the trees, whose thinned
      branches, resembling plumes, stirred not in the still, warm air. All
      London had poured into the Park, draining the cup of summer to its dregs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Couple after couple, from every gate, they streamed along the paths and
      over the burnt grass, and one after another, silently out of the lighted
      spaces, stole into the shelter of the feathery trees, where, blotted
      against some trunk, or under the shadow of shrubs, they were lost to all
      but themselves in the heart of the soft darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fresh-comers along the paths, these forerunners formed but part of that
      passionate dusk, whence only a strange murmur, like the confused beating
      of hearts, came forth. But when that murmur reached each couple in the
      lamp-light their voices wavered, and ceased; their arms enlaced, their
      eyes began seeking, searching, probing the blackness. Suddenly, as though
      drawn by invisible hands, they, too, stepped over the railing, and, silent
      as shadows, were gone from the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stillness, enclosed in the far, inexorable roar of the town, was alive
      with the myriad passions, hopes, and loves of multitudes of struggling
      human atoms; for in spite of the disapproval of that great body of
      Forsytes, the Municipal Council&mdash;to whom Love had long been
      considered, next to the Sewage Question, the gravest danger to the
      community&mdash;a process was going on that night in the Park, and in a
      hundred other parks, without which the thousand factories, churches,
      shops, taxes, and drains, of which they were custodians, were as arteries
      without blood, a man without a heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instincts of self-forgetfulness, of passion, and of love, hiding under
      the trees, away from the trustees of their remorseless enemy, the &lsquo;sense
      of property,&rsquo; were holding a stealthy revel, and Soames, returning
      from Bayswater&mdash;for he had been alone to dine at Timothy&rsquo;s
      walking home along the water, with his mind upon that coming lawsuit, had
      the blood driven from his heart by a low laugh and the sound of kisses. He
      thought of writing to the Times the next morning, to draw the attention of
      the Editor to the condition of our parks. He did not, however, for he had
      a horror of seeing his name in print.
    </p>
    <p>
      But starved as he was, the whispered sounds in the stillness, the
      half-seen forms in the dark, acted on him like some morbid stimulant. He
      left the path along the water and stole under the trees, along the deep
      shadow of little plantations, where the boughs of chestnut trees hung
      their great leaves low, and there was blacker refuge, shaping his course
      in circles which had for their object a stealthy inspection of chairs side
      by side, against tree-trunks, of enlaced lovers, who stirred at his
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he stood still on the rise overlooking the Serpentine, where, in full
      lamp-light, black against the silver water, sat a couple who never moved,
      the woman&rsquo;s face buried on the man&rsquo;s neck&mdash;a single form,
      like a carved emblem of passion, silent and unashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, stung by the sight, Soames hurried on deeper into the shadow of the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this search, who knows what he thought and what he sought? Bread for
      hunger&mdash;light in darkness? Who knows what he expected to find&mdash;impersonal
      knowledge of the human heart&mdash;the end of his private subterranean
      tragedy&mdash;for, again, who knew, but that each dark couple, unnamed,
      unnameable, might not be he and she?
    </p>
    <p>
      But it could not be such knowledge as this that he was seeking&mdash;the
      wife of Soames Forsyte sitting in the Park like a common wench! Such
      thoughts were inconceivable; and from tree to tree, with his noiseless
      step, he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he was sworn at; once the whisper, &ldquo;If only it could always be
      like this!&rdquo; sent the blood flying again from his heart, and he
      waited there, patient and dogged, for the two to move. But it was only a
      poor thin slip of a shop-girl in her draggled blouse who passed him,
      clinging to her lover&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred other lovers too whispered that hope in the stillness of the
      trees, a hundred other lovers clung to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But shaking himself with sudden disgust, Soames returned to the path, and
      left that seeking for he knew not what.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;MEETING AT THE BOTANICAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon, whose circumstances were not those of a Forsyte, found at
      times a difficulty in sparing the money needful for those country jaunts
      and researches into Nature, without having prosecuted which no watercolour
      artist ever puts brush to paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was frequently, in fact, obliged to take his colour-box into the
      Botanical Gardens, and there, on his stool, in the shade of a
      monkey-puzzler or in the lee of some India-rubber plant, he would spend
      long hours sketching.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Art critic who had recently been looking at his work had delivered
      himself as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way your drawings are very good; tone and colour, in some of
      them certainly quite a feeling for Nature. But, you see, they&rsquo;re so
      scattered; you&rsquo;ll never get the public to look at them. Now, if you&rsquo;d
      taken a definite subject, such as &lsquo;London by Night,&rsquo; or
      &lsquo;The Crystal Palace in the Spring,&rsquo; and made a regular series,
      the public would have known at once what they were looking at. I can&rsquo;t
      lay too much stress upon that. All the men who are making great names in
      Art, like Crum Stone or Bleeder, are making them by avoiding the
      unexpected; by specializing and putting their works all in the same
      pigeon-hole, so that the public know at once where to go. And this stands
      to reason, for if a man&rsquo;s a collector he doesn&rsquo;t want people
      to smell at the canvas to find out whom his pictures are by; he wants them
      to be able to say at once, &lsquo;A capital Forsyte!&rsquo; It is all the
      more important for you to be careful to choose a subject that they can lay
      hold of on the spot, since there&rsquo;s no very marked originality in
      your style.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon, standing by the little piano, where a bowl of dried rose
      leaves, the only produce of the garden, was deposited on a bit of faded
      damask, listened with his dim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to his wife, who was looking at the speaker with an angry
      expression on her thin face, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; she answered in her staccato voice, that still had
      a little foreign accent; &ldquo;your style has originality.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The critic looked at her, smiled&rsquo; deferentially, and said no more.
      Like everyone else, he knew their history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words bore good fruit with young Jolyon; they were contrary to all
      that he believed in, to all that he theoretically held good in his Art,
      but some strange, deep instinct moved him against his will to turn them to
      profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He discovered therefore one morning that an idea had come to him for
      making a series of watercolour drawings of London. How the idea had arisen
      he could not tell; and it was not till the following year, when he had
      completed and sold them at a very fair price, that in one of his
      impersonal moods, he found himself able to recollect the Art critic, and
      to discover in his own achievement another proof that he was a Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to commence with the Botanical Gardens, where he had already
      made so many studies, and chose the little artificial pond, sprinkled now
      with an autumn shower of red and yellow leaves, for though the gardeners
      longed to sweep them off, they could not reach them with their brooms. The
      rest of the gardens they swept bare enough, removing every morning Nature&rsquo;s
      rain of leaves; piling them in heaps, whence from slow fires rose the
      sweet, acrid smoke that, like the cuckoo&rsquo;s note for spring, the
      scent of lime trees for the summer, is the true emblem of the fall. The
      gardeners&rsquo; tidy souls could not abide the gold and green and russet
      pattern on the grass. The gravel paths must lie unstained, ordered,
      methodical, without knowledge of the realities of life, nor of that slow
      and beautiful decay which flings crowns underfoot to star the earth with
      fallen glories, whence, as the cycle rolls, will leap again wild spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus each leaf that fell was marked from the moment when it fluttered a
      good-bye and dropped, slow turning, from its twig.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on that little pond the leaves floated in peace, and praised Heaven
      with their hues, the sunlight haunting over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so young Jolyon found them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming there one morning in the middle of October, he was disconcerted to
      find a bench about twenty paces from his stand occupied, for he had a
      proper horror of anyone seeing him at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady in a velvet jacket was sitting there, with her eyes fixed on the
      ground. A flowering laurel, however, stood between, and, taking shelter
      behind this, young Jolyon prepared his easel.
    </p>
    <p>
      His preparations were leisurely; he caught, as every true artist should,
      at anything that might delay for a moment the effort of his work, and he
      found himself looking furtively at this unknown dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like his father before him, he had an eye for a face. This face was
      charming!
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw a rounded chin nestling in a cream ruffle, a delicate face with
      large dark eyes and soft lips. A black &lsquo;picture&rsquo; hat concealed
      the hair; her figure was lightly poised against the back of the bench, her
      knees were crossed; the tip of a patent-leather shoe emerged beneath her
      skirt. There was something, indeed, inexpressibly dainty about the person
      of this lady, but young Jolyon&rsquo;s attention was chiefly riveted by
      the look on her face, which reminded him of his wife. It was as though its
      owner had come into contact with forces too strong for her. It troubled
      him, arousing vague feelings of attraction and chivalry. Who was she? And
      what doing there, alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Two young gentlemen of that peculiar breed, at once forward and shy, found
      in the Regent&rsquo;s Park, came by on their way to lawn tennis, and he
      noted with disapproval their furtive stares of admiration. A loitering
      gardener halted to do something unnecessary to a clump of pampas grass;
      he, too, wanted an excuse for peeping. A gentleman, old, and, by his hat,
      a professor of horticulture, passed three times to scrutinize her long and
      stealthily, a queer expression about his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all these men young Jolyon felt the same vague irritation. She looked
      at none of them, yet was he certain that every man who passed would look
      at her like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was not the face of a sorceress, who in every look holds out to
      men the offer of pleasure; it had none of the &lsquo;devil&rsquo;s beauty&rsquo;
      so highly prized among the first Forsytes of the land; neither was it of
      that type, no less adorable, associated with the box of chocolate; it was
      not of the spiritually passionate, or passionately spiritual order,
      peculiar to house-decoration and modern poetry; nor did it seem to promise
      to the playwright material for the production of the interesting and
      neurasthenic figure, who commits suicide in the last act.
    </p>
    <p>
      In shape and colouring, in its soft persuasive passivity, its sensuous
      purity, this woman&rsquo;s face reminded him of Titian&rsquo;s &lsquo;Heavenly
      Love,&rsquo; a reproduction of which hung over the sideboard in his
      dining-room. And her attraction seemed to be in this soft passivity, in
      the feeling she gave that to pressure she must yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      For what or whom was she waiting, in the silence, with the trees dropping
      here and there a leaf, and the thrushes strutting close on grass, touched
      with the sparkle of the autumn rime? Then her charming face grew eager,
      and, glancing round, with almost a lover&rsquo;s jealousy, young Jolyon
      saw Bosinney striding across the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously he watched the meeting, the look in their eyes, the long clasp
      of their hands. They sat down close together, linked for all their outward
      discretion. He heard the rapid murmur of their talk; but what they said he
      could not catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had rowed in the galley himself! He knew the long hours of waiting and
      the lean minutes of a half-public meeting; the tortures of suspense that
      haunt the unhallowed lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      It required, however, but a glance at their two faces to see that this was
      none of those affairs of a season that distract men and women about town;
      none of those sudden appetites that wake up ravening, and are surfeited
      and asleep again in six weeks. This was the real thing! This was what had
      happened to himself! Out of this anything might come!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney was pleading, and she so quiet, so soft, yet immovable in her
      passivity, sat looking over the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he the man to carry her off, that tender, passive being, who would
      never stir a step for herself? Who had given him all herself, and would
      die for him, but perhaps would never run away with him!
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to young Jolyon that he could hear her saying: &ldquo;But,
      darling, it would ruin you!&rdquo; For he himself had experienced to the
      full the gnawing fear at the bottom of each woman&rsquo;s heart that she
      is a drag on the man she loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he peeped at them no more; but their soft, rapid talk came to his
      ears, with the stuttering song of some bird who seemed trying to remember
      the notes of spring: Joy&mdash;tragedy? Which&mdash;which?
    </p>
    <p>
      And gradually their talk ceased; long silence followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And where does Soames come in?&rsquo; young Jolyon thought. &lsquo;People
      think she is concerned about the sin of deceiving her husband! Little they
      know of women! She&rsquo;s eating, after starvation&mdash;taking her
      revenge! And Heaven help her&mdash;for he&rsquo;ll take his.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the swish of silk, and, spying round the laurel, saw them walking
      away, their hands stealthily joined....
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of July old Jolyon had taken his grand-daughter to the
      mountains; and on that visit (the last they ever paid) June recovered to a
      great extent her health and spirits. In the hotels, filled with British
      Forsytes&mdash;for old Jolyon could not bear a &lsquo;set of Germans,&rsquo;
      as he called all foreigners&mdash;she was looked upon with respect&mdash;the
      only grand-daughter of that fine-looking, and evidently wealthy, old Mr.
      Forsyte. She did not mix freely with people&mdash;to mix freely with
      people was not June&rsquo;s habit&mdash;but she formed some friendships,
      and notably one in the Rhone Valley, with a French girl who was dying of
      consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determining at once that her friend should not die, she forgot, in the
      institution of a campaign against Death, much of her own trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon watched the new intimacy with relief and disapproval; for this
      additional proof that her life was to be passed amongst &lsquo;lame ducks&rsquo;
      worried him. Would she never make a friendship or take an interest in
      something that would be of real benefit to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Taking up with a parcel of foreigners,&rsquo; he called it. He
      often, however, brought home grapes or roses, and presented them to
      &lsquo;Mam&rsquo;zelle&rsquo; with an ingratiating twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of September, in spite of June&rsquo;s disapproval,
      Mademoiselle Vigor breathed her last in the little hotel at St. Luc, to
      which they had moved her; and June took her defeat so deeply to heart that
      old Jolyon carried her away to Paris. Here, in contemplation of the
      &lsquo;Venus de Milo&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Madeleine,&rsquo; she shook off
      her depression, and when, towards the middle of October, they returned to
      town, her grandfather believed that he had effected a cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner, however, had they established themselves in Stanhope Gate than
      he perceived to his dismay a return of her old absorbed and brooding
      manner. She would sit, staring in front of her, her chin on her hand, like
      a little Norse spirit, grim and intent, while all around in the electric
      light, then just installed, shone the great, drawing-room brocaded up to
      the frieze, full of furniture from Baple and Pullbred&rsquo;s. And in the
      huge gilt mirror were reflected those Dresden china groups of young men in
      tight knee breeches, at the feet of full-bosomed ladies nursing on their
      laps pet lambs, which old Jolyon had bought when he was a bachelor and
      thought so highly of in these days of degenerate taste. He was a man of
      most open mind, who, more than any Forsyte of them all, had moved with the
      times, but he could never forget that he had bought these groups at Jobson&rsquo;s,
      and given a lot of money for them. He often said to June, with a sort of
      disillusioned contempt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care about them! They&rsquo;re not the gimcrack
      things you and your friends like, but they cost me seventy pounds!&rdquo;
      He was not a man who allowed his taste to be warped when he knew for solid
      reasons that it was sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the first things that June did on getting home was to go round to
      Timothy&rsquo;s. She persuaded herself that it was her duty to call there,
      and cheer him with an account of all her travels; but in reality she went
      because she knew of no other place where, by some random speech, or
      roundabout question, she could glean news of Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      They received her most cordially: And how was her dear grandfather? He had
      not been to see them since May. Her Uncle Timothy was very poorly, he had
      had a lot of trouble with the chimney-sweep in his bedroom; the stupid man
      had let the soot down the chimney! It had quite upset her uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      June sat there a long time, dreading, yet passionately hoping, that they
      would speak of Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      But paralyzed by unaccountable discretion, Mrs. Septimus Small let fall no
      word, neither did she question June about him. In desperation the girl
      asked at last whether Soames and Irene were in town&mdash;she had not yet
      been to see anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Aunt Hester who replied: Oh, yes, they were in town, they had not
      been away at all. There was some little difficulty about the house, she
      believed. June had heard, no doubt! She had better ask her Aunt Juley!
    </p>
    <p>
      June turned to Mrs. Small, who sat upright in her chair, her hands
      clasped, her face covered with innumerable pouts. In answer to the girl&rsquo;s
      look she maintained a strange silence, and when she spoke it was to ask
      June whether she had worn night-socks up in those high hotels where it
      must be so cold of a night.
    </p>
    <p>
      June answered that she had not, she hated the stuffy things; and rose to
      leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small&rsquo;s infallibly chosen silence was far more ominous to her
      than anything that could have been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before half an hour was over she had dragged the truth from Mrs. Baynes in
      Lowndes Square, that Soames was bringing an action against Bosinney over
      the decoration of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of disturbing her, the news had a strangely calming effect; as
      though she saw in the prospect of this struggle new hope for herself. She
      learnt that the case was expected to come on in about a month, and there
      seemed little or no prospect of Bosinney&rsquo;s success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whatever he&rsquo;ll do I can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Baynes; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very dreadful for him, you know&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      got no money&mdash;he&rsquo;s very hard up. And we can&rsquo;t help him, I&rsquo;m
      sure. I&rsquo;m told the money-lenders won&rsquo;t lend if you have no
      security, and he has none&mdash;none at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her embonpoint had increased of late; she was in the full swing of autumn
      organization, her writing-table literally strewn with the menus of charity
      functions. She looked meaningly at June, with her round eyes of
      parrot-grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden flush that rose on the girl&rsquo;s intent young face&mdash;she
      must have seen spring up before her a great hope&mdash;the sudden
      sweetness of her smile, often came back to Lady Baynes in after years
      (Baynes was knighted when he built that public Museum of Art which has
      given so much employment to officials, and so little pleasure to those
      working classes for whom it was designed).
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of that change, vivid and touching, like the breaking open of a
      flower, or the first sun after long winter, the memory, too, of all that
      came after, often intruded itself, unaccountably, inopportunely on Lady
      Baynes, when her mind was set upon the most important things.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the very afternoon of the day that young Jolyon witnessed the
      meeting in the Botanical Gardens, and on this day, too, old Jolyon paid a
      visit to his solicitors, Forsyte, Bustard, and Forsyte, in the Poultry.
      Soames was not in, he had gone down to Somerset House; Bustard was buried
      up to the hilt in papers and that inaccessible apartment, where he was
      judiciously placed, in order that he might do as much work as possible;
      but James was in the front office, biting a finger, and lugubriously
      turning over the pleadings in Forsyte v. Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sound lawyer had only a sort of luxurious dread of the &lsquo;nice
      point,&rsquo; enough to set up a pleasurable feeling of fuss; for his good
      practical sense told him that if he himself were on the Bench he would not
      pay much attention to it. But he was afraid that this Bosinney would go
      bankrupt and Soames would have to find the money after all, and costs into
      the bargain. And behind this tangible dread there was always that
      intangible trouble, lurking in the background, intricate, dim, scandalous,
      like a bad dream, and of which this action was but an outward and visible
      sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his head as old Jolyon came in, and muttered: &ldquo;How are
      you, Jolyon? Haven&rsquo;t seen you for an age. You&rsquo;ve been to
      Switzerland, they tell me. This young Bosinney, he&rsquo;s got himself
      into a mess. I knew how it would be!&rdquo; He held out the papers,
      regarding his elder brother with nervous gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon read them in silence, and while he read them James looked at
      the floor, biting his fingers the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon pitched them down at last, and they fell with a thump amongst a
      mass of affidavits in &lsquo;re Buncombe, deceased,&rsquo; one of the many
      branches of that parent and profitable tree, &lsquo;Fryer v. Forsyte.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what Soames is about,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to
      make a fuss over a few hundred pounds. I thought he was a man of property.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James&rsquo; long upper lip twitched angrily; he could not bear his son to
      be attacked in such a spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the money,&rdquo; he began, but meeting his brother&rsquo;s
      glance, direct, shrewd, judicial, he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come in for my Will,&rdquo; said old Jolyon at last,
      tugging at his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      James&rsquo; curiosity was roused at once. Perhaps nothing in this life
      was more stimulating to him than a Will; it was the supreme deal with
      property, the final inventory of a man&rsquo;s belongings, the last word
      on what he was worth. He sounded the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring in Mr. Jolyon&rsquo;s Will,&rdquo; he said to an anxious,
      dark-haired clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You going to make some alterations?&rdquo; And through his mind
      there flashed the thought: &lsquo;Now, am I worth as much as he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon put the Will in his breast pocket, and James twisted his long
      legs regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made some nice purchases lately, they tell me,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you get your information from,&rdquo;
      answered old Jolyon sharply. &ldquo;When&rsquo;s this action coming on?
      Next month? I can&rsquo;t tell what you&rsquo;ve got in your minds. You
      must manage your own affairs; but if you take my advice, you&rsquo;ll
      settle it out of Court. Good-bye!&rdquo; With a cold handshake he was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, his fixed grey-blue eye corkscrewing round some secret anxious
      image, began again to bite his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon took his Will to the offices of the New Colliery Company, and
      sat down in the empty Board Room to read it through. He answered &lsquo;Down-by-the-starn&rsquo;
      Hemmings so tartly when the latter, seeing his Chairman seated there,
      entered with the new Superintendent&rsquo;s first report, that the
      Secretary withdrew with regretful dignity; and sending for the transfer
      clerk, blew him up till the poor youth knew not where to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not&mdash;by George&mdash;as he (Down-by-the-starn) would have him
      know, for a whippersnapper of a young fellow like him, to come down to
      that office, and think that he was God Almighty. He (Down-by-the-starn)
      had been head of that office for more years than a boy like him could
      count, and if he thought that when he had finished all his work, he could
      sit there doing nothing, he did not know him, Hemmings
      (Down-by-the-starn), and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the green baize door old Jolyon sat at the long,
      mahogany-and-leather board table, his thick, loose-jointed, tortoiseshell
      eye-glasses perched on the bridge of his nose, his gold pencil moving down
      the clauses of his Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a simple affair, for there were none of those vexatious little
      legacies and donations to charities, which fritter away a man&rsquo;s
      possessions, and damage the majestic effect of that little paragraph in
      the morning papers accorded to Forsytes who die with a hundred thousand
      pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A simple affair. Just a bequest to his son of twenty thousand, and &lsquo;as
      to the residue of my property of whatsoever kind whether realty or
      personalty, or partaking of the nature of either&mdash;upon trust to pay
      the proceeds rents annual produce dividends or interest thereof and
      thereon to my said grand-daughter June Forsyte or her assigns during her
      life to be for her sole use and benefit and without, etc... and from and
      after her death or decease upon trust to convey assign transfer or make
      over the said last-mentioned lands hereditaments premises trust moneys
      stocks funds investments and securities or such as shall then stand for
      and represent the same unto such person or persons whether one or more for
      such intents purposes and uses and generally in such manner way and form
      in all respects as the said June Forsyte notwithstanding coverture shall
      by her last Will and Testament or any writing or writings in the nature of
      a Will testament or testamentary disposition to be by her duly made signed
      and published direct appoint or make over give and dispose of the same And
      in default etc.... Provided always...&rsquo; and so on, in seven folios of
      brief and simple phraseology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Will had been drawn by James in his palmy days. He had foreseen almost
      every contingency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon sat a long time reading this Will; at last he took half a sheet
      of paper from the rack, and made a prolonged pencil note; then buttoning
      up the Will, he caused a cab to be called and drove to the offices of
      Paramor and Herring, in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. Jack Herring was dead,
      but his nephew was still in the firm, and old Jolyon was closeted with him
      for half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had kept the hansom, and on coming out, gave the driver the address&mdash;3,
      Wistaria Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a strange, slow satisfaction, as though he had scored a victory
      over James and the man of property. They should not poke their noses into
      his affairs any more; he had just cancelled their trusteeships of his
      Will; he would take the whole of his business out of their hands, and put
      it into the hands of young Herring, and he would move the business of his
      Companies too. If that young Soames were such a man of property, he would
      never miss a thousand a year or so; and under his great white moustache
      old Jolyon grimly smiled. He felt that what he was doing was in the nature
      of retributive justice, richly deserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, surely, with the secret inner process that works the destruction
      of an old tree, the poison of the wounds to his happiness, his will, his
      pride, had corroded the comely edifice of his philosophy. Life had worn
      him down on one side, till, like that family of which he was the head, he
      had lost balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him, borne northwards towards his son&rsquo;s house, the thought of the
      new disposition of property, which he had just set in motion, appeared
      vaguely in the light of a stroke of punishment, levelled at that family
      and that Society, of which James and his son seemed to him the
      representatives. He had made a restitution to young Jolyon, and
      restitution to young Jolyon satisfied his secret craving for
      revenge-revenge against Time, sorrow, and interference, against all that
      incalculable sum of disapproval that had been bestowed by the world for
      fifteen years on his only son. It presented itself as the one possible way
      of asserting once more the domination of his will; of forcing James, and
      Soames, and the family, and all those hidden masses of Forsytes&mdash;a
      great stream rolling against the single dam of his obstinacy&mdash;to
      recognise once and for all that he would be master. It was sweet to think
      that at last he was going to make the boy a richer man by far than that
      son of James, that &lsquo;man of property.&rsquo; And it was sweet to give
      to Jo, for he loved his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither young Jolyon nor his wife were in (young Jolyon indeed was not
      back from the Botanical), but the little maid told him that she expected
      the master at any moment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always at &lsquo;ome to tea, sir, to play with the
      children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon said he would wait; and sat down patiently enough in the faded,
      shabby drawing room, where, now that the summer chintzes were removed, the
      old chairs and sofas revealed all their threadbare deficiencies. He longed
      to send for the children; to have them there beside him, their supple
      bodies against his knees; to hear Jolly&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Hallo, Gran!&rdquo;
      and see his rush; and feel Holly&rsquo;s soft little hand stealing up
      against his cheek. But he would not. There was solemnity in what he had
      come to do, and until it was over he would not play. He amused himself by
      thinking how with two strokes of his pen he was going to restore the look
      of caste so conspicuously absent from everything in that little house; how
      he could fill these rooms, or others in some larger mansion, with triumphs
      of art from Baple and Pullbred&rsquo;s; how he could send little Jolly to
      Harrow and Oxford (he no longer had faith in Eton and Cambridge, for his
      son had been there); how he could procure little Holly the best musical
      instruction, the child had a remarkable aptitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these visions crowded before him, causing emotion to swell his heart,
      he rose, and stood at the window, looking down into the little walled
      strip of garden, where the pear-tree, bare of leaves before its time,
      stood with gaunt branches in the slow-gathering mist of the autumn
      afternoon. The dog Balthasar, his tail curled tightly over a piebald,
      furry back, was walking at the farther end, sniffing at the plants, and at
      intervals placing his leg for support against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And old Jolyon mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      What pleasure was there left but to give? It was pleasant to give, when
      you could find one who would be thankful for what you gave&mdash;one of
      your own flesh and blood! There was no such satisfaction to be had out of
      giving to those who did not belong to you, to those who had no claim on
      you! Such giving as that was a betrayal of the individualistic convictions
      and actions of his life, of all his enterprise, his labour, and his
      moderation, of the great and proud fact that, like tens of thousands of
      Forsytes before him, tens of thousands in the present, tens of thousands
      in the future, he had always made his own, and held his own, in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, while he stood there looking down on the smut-covered foliage of the
      laurels, the black-stained grass-plot, the progress of the dog Balthasar,
      all the suffering of the fifteen years during which he had been baulked of
      legitimate enjoyment mingled its gall with the sweetness of the
      approaching moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon came at last, pleased with his work, and fresh from long
      hours in the open air. On hearing that his father was in the drawing room,
      he inquired hurriedly whether Mrs. Forsyte was at home, and being informed
      that she was not, heaved a sigh of relief. Then putting his painting
      materials carefully in the little coat-closet out of sight, he went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      With characteristic decision old Jolyon came at once to the point. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been altering my arrangements, Jo,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You can cut your
      coat a bit longer in the future&mdash;I&rsquo;m settling a thousand a year
      on you at once. June will have fifty thousand at my death; and you the
      rest. That dog of yours is spoiling the garden. I shouldn&rsquo;t keep a
      dog, if I were you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog Balthasar, seated in the centre of the lawn, was examining his
      tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon looked at the animal, but saw him dimly, for his eyes were
      misty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours won&rsquo;t come short of a hundred thousand, my boy,&rdquo;
      said old Jolyon; &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d better know. I haven&rsquo;t
      much longer to live at my age. I shan&rsquo;t allude to it again. How&rsquo;s
      your wife? And&mdash;give her my love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon put his hand on his father&rsquo;s shoulder, and, as neither
      spoke, the episode closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen his father into a hansom, young Jolyon came back to the
      drawing-room and stood, where old Jolyon had stood, looking down on the
      little garden. He tried to realize all that this meant to him, and,
      Forsyte that he was, vistas of property were opened out in his brain; the
      years of half rations through which he had passed had not sapped his
      natural instincts. In extremely practical form, he thought of travel, of
      his wife&rsquo;s costume, the children&rsquo;s education, a pony for
      Jolly, a thousand things; but in the midst of all he thought, too, of
      Bosinney and his mistress, and the broken song of the thrush. Joy&mdash;tragedy!
      Which? Which?
    </p>
    <p>
      The old past&mdash;the poignant, suffering, passionate, wonderful past,
      that no money could buy, that nothing could restore in all its burning
      sweetness&mdash;had come back before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his wife came in he went straight up to her and took her in his arms;
      and for a long time he stood without speaking, his eyes closed, pressing
      her to him, while she looked at him with a wondering, adoring, doubting
      look in her eyes.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;VOYAGE INTO THE INFERNO
    </h2>
    <p>
      The morning after a certain night on which Soames at last asserted his
      rights and acted like a man, he breakfasted alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He breakfasted by gaslight, the fog of late November wrapping the town as
      in some monstrous blanket till the trees of the Square even were barely
      visible from the dining-room window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate steadily, but at times a sensation as though he could not swallow
      attacked him. Had he been right to yield to his overmastering hunger of
      the night before, and break down the resistance which he had suffered now
      too long from this woman who was his lawful and solemnly constituted
      helpmate?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was strangely haunted by the recollection of her face, from before
      which, to soothe her, he had tried to pull her hands&mdash;of her terrible
      smothered sobbing, the like of which he had never heard, and still seemed
      to hear; and he was still haunted by the odd, intolerable feeling of
      remorse and shame he had felt, as he stood looking at her by the flame of
      the single candle, before silently slinking away.
    </p>
    <p>
      And somehow, now that he had acted like this, he was surprised at himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two nights before, at Winifred Dartie&rsquo;s, he had taken Mrs. MacAnder
      into dinner. She had said to him, looking in his face with her sharp,
      greenish eyes: &ldquo;And so your wife is a great friend of that Mr.
      Bosinney&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not deigning to ask what she meant, he had brooded over her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had roused in him a fierce jealousy, which, with the peculiar
      perversion of this instinct, had turned to fiercer desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without the incentive of Mrs. MacAnder&rsquo;s words he might never have
      done what he had done. Without their incentive and the accident of finding
      his wife&rsquo;s door for once unlocked, which had enabled him to steal
      upon her asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slumber had removed his doubts, but the morning brought them again. One
      thought comforted him: No one would know&mdash;it was not the sort of
      thing that she would speak about.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, when the vehicle of his daily business life, which needed so
      imperatively the grease of clear and practical thought, started rolling
      once more with the reading of his letters, those nightmare-like doubts
      began to assume less extravagant importance at the back of his mind. The
      incident was really not of great moment; women made a fuss about it in
      books; but in the cool judgment of right-thinking men, of men of the
      world, of such as he recollected often received praise in the Divorce
      Court, he had but done his best to sustain the sanctity of marriage, to
      prevent her from abandoning her duty, possibly, if she were still seeing
      Bosinney, from....
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he did not regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the first step towards reconciliation had been taken, the rest
      would be comparatively&mdash;comparatively....
    </p>
    <p>
      He, rose and walked to the window. His nerve had been shaken. The sound of
      smothered sobbing was in his ears again. He could not get rid of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put on his fur coat, and went out into the fog; having to go into the
      City, he took the underground railway from Sloane Square station.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his corner of the first-class compartment filled with City men the
      smothered sobbing still haunted him, so he opened the Times with the rich
      crackle that drowns all lesser sounds, and, barricaded behind it, set
      himself steadily to con the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read that a Recorder had charged a grand jury on the previous day with
      a more than usually long list of offences. He read of three murders, five
      manslaughters, seven arsons, and as many as eleven rapes&mdash;a
      surprisingly high number&mdash;in addition to many less conspicuous
      crimes, to be tried during a coming Sessions; and from one piece of news
      he went on to another, keeping the paper well before his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And still, inseparable from his reading, was the memory of Irene&rsquo;s
      tear-stained face, and the sounds from her broken heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was a busy one, including, in addition to the ordinary affairs of
      his practice, a visit to his brokers, Messrs. Grin and Grinning, to give
      them instructions to sell his shares in the New Colliery Co., Ltd., whose
      business he suspected, rather than knew, was stagnating (this enterprise
      afterwards slowly declined, and was ultimately sold for a song to an
      American syndicate); and a long conference at Waterbuck, Q.C.&rsquo;.
      chambers, attended by Boulter, by Fiske, the junior counsel, and
      Waterbuck, Q.C., himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case of Forsyte v. Bosinney was expected to be reached on the morrow,
      before Mr. Justice Bentham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Justice Bentham, a man of common-sense rather than too great legal
      knowledge, was considered to be about the best man they could have to try
      the action. He was a &lsquo;strong&rsquo; Judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waterbuck, Q.C., in pleasing conjunction with an almost rude neglect of
      Boulter and Fiske paid to Soames a good deal of attention, by instinct or
      the sounder evidence of rumour, feeling him to be a man of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held with remarkable consistency to the opinion he had already
      expressed in writing, that the issue would depend to a great extent on the
      evidence given at the trial, and in a few well directed remarks he advised
      Soames not to be too careful in giving that evidence. &ldquo;A little
      bluffness, Mr. Forsyte,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a little bluffness,&rdquo;
      and after he had spoken he laughed firmly, closed his lips tight, and
      scratched his head just below where he had pushed his wig back, for all
      the world like the gentleman-farmer for whom he loved to be taken. He was
      considered perhaps the leading man in breach of promise cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames used the underground again in going home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fog was worse than ever at Sloane Square station. Through the still,
      thick blur, men groped in and out; women, very few, grasped their
      reticules to their bosoms and handkerchiefs to their mouths; crowned with
      the weird excrescence of the driver, haloed by a vague glow of lamp-light
      that seemed to drown in vapour before it reached the pavement, cabs loomed
      dim-shaped ever and again, and discharged citizens, bolting like rabbits
      to their burrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these shadowy figures, wrapped each in his own little shroud of fog,
      took no notice of each other. In the great warren, each rabbit for
      himself, especially those clothed in the more expensive fur, who, afraid
      of carriages on foggy days, are driven underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      One figure, however, not far from Soames, waited at the station door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some buccaneer or lover, of whom each Forsyte thought: &lsquo;Poor devil!
      looks as if he were having a bad time!&rsquo; Their kind hearts beat a
      stroke faster for that poor, waiting, anxious lover in the fog; but they
      hurried by, well knowing that they had neither time nor money to spare for
      any suffering but their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a policeman, patrolling slowly and at intervals, took an interest in
      that waiting figure, the brim of whose slouch hat half hid a face reddened
      by the cold, all thin, and haggard, over which a hand stole now and again
      to smooth away anxiety, or renew the resolution that kept him waiting
      there. But the waiting lover (if lover he were) was used to policemen&rsquo;s
      scrutiny, or too absorbed in his anxiety, for he never flinched. A
      hardened case, accustomed to long trysts, to anxiety, and fog, and cold,
      if only his mistress came at last. Foolish lover! Fogs last until the
      spring; there is also snow and rain, no comfort anywhere; gnawing fear if
      you bring her out, gnawing fear if you bid her stay at home!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serve him right; he should arrange his affairs better!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So any respectable Forsyte. Yet, if that sounder citizen could have
      listened at the waiting lover&rsquo;s heart, out there in the fog and the
      cold, he would have said again: &ldquo;Yes, poor devil he&rsquo;s having a
      bad time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames got into his cab, and, with the glass down, crept along Sloane
      Street, and so along the Brompton Road, and home. He reached his house at
      five.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was not in. She had gone out a quarter of an hour before. Out at
      such a time of night, into this terrible fog! What was the meaning of
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat by the dining-room fire, with the door open, disturbed to the soul,
      trying to read the evening paper. A book was no good&mdash;in daily papers
      alone was any narcotic to such worry as his. From the customary events
      recorded in the journal he drew some comfort. &lsquo;Suicide of an actress&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;Grave
      indisposition of a Statesman&rsquo; (that chronic sufferer)&mdash;&rsquo;Divorce
      of an army officer&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;Fire in a colliery&rsquo;&mdash;he
      read them all. They helped him a little&mdash;prescribed by the greatest
      of all doctors, our natural taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly seven when he heard her come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident of the night before had long lost its importance under stress
      of anxiety at her strange sortie into the fog. But now that Irene was
      home, the memory of her broken-hearted sobbing came back to him, and he
      felt nervous at the thought of facing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was already on the stairs; her grey fur coat hung to her knees, its
      high collar almost hid her face, she wore a thick veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      She neither turned to look at him nor spoke. No ghost or stranger could
      have passed more silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bilson came to lay dinner, and told him that Mrs. Forsyte was not coming
      down; she was having the soup in her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once Soames did not &lsquo;change&rsquo;. it was, perhaps, the first
      time in his life that he had sat down to dinner with soiled cuffs, and,
      not even noticing them, he brooded long over his wine. He sent Bilson to
      light a fire in his picture-room, and presently went up there himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning on the gas, he heaved a deep sigh, as though amongst these
      treasures, the backs of which confronted him in stacks, around the little
      room, he had found at length his peace of mind. He went straight up to the
      greatest treasure of them all, an undoubted Turner, and, carrying it to
      the easel, turned its face to the light. There had been a movement in
      Turners, but he had not been able to make up his mind to part with it. He
      stood for a long time, his pale, clean-shaven face poked forward above his
      stand-up collar, looking at the picture as though he were adding it up; a
      wistful expression came into his eyes; he found, perhaps, that it came to
      too little. He took it down from the easel to put it back against the
      wall; but, in crossing the room, stopped, for he seemed to hear sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nothing&mdash;only the sort of thing that had been bothering him in
      the morning. And soon after, putting the high guard before the blazing
      fire, he stole downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh for the morrow! was his thought. It was long before he went to
      sleep....
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now to George Forsyte that the mind must turn for light on the
      events of that fog-engulfed afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wittiest and most sportsmanlike of the Forsytes had passed the day
      reading a novel in the paternal mansion at Princes&rsquo; Gardens. Since a
      recent crisis in his financial affairs he had been kept on parole by
      Roger, and compelled to reside &lsquo;at home.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards five o&rsquo;clock he went out, and took train at South Kensington
      Station (for everyone to-day went Underground). His intention was to dine,
      and pass the evening playing billiards at the Red Pottle&mdash;that unique
      hostel, neither club, hotel, nor good gilt restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got out at Charing Cross, choosing it in preference to his more usual
      St. James&rsquo;s Park, that he might reach Jermyn Street by better
      lighted ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the platform his eyes&mdash;for in combination with a composed and
      fashionable appearance, George had sharp eyes, and was always on the
      look-out for fillips to his sardonic humour&mdash;his eyes were attracted
      by a man, who, leaping from a first-class compartment, staggered rather
      than walked towards the exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So ho, my bird!&rsquo; said George to himself; &lsquo;why, it&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;the Buccaneer!&rdquo;&rsquo; and he put his big figure on the
      trail. Nothing afforded him greater amusement than a drunken man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney, who wore a slouch hat, stopped in front of him, spun around, and
      rushed back towards the carriage he had just left. He was too late. A
      porter caught him by the coat; the train was already moving on.
    </p>
    <p>
      George&rsquo;s practised glance caught sight of the face of a lady clad in
      a grey fur coat at the carriage window. It was Mrs. Soames&mdash;and
      George felt that this was interesting!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he followed Bosinney more closely than ever&mdash;up the stairs,
      past the ticket collector into the street. In that progress, however, his
      feelings underwent a change; no longer merely curious and amused, he felt
      sorry for the poor fellow he was shadowing. &lsquo;The Buccaneer&rsquo;
      was not drunk, but seemed to be acting under the stress of violent
      emotion; he was talking to himself, and all that George could catch were
      the words &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; Nor did he appear to know what he was
      doing, or where going; but stared, hesitated, moved like a man out of his
      mind; and from being merely a joker in search of amusement, George felt
      that he must see the poor chap through.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had &lsquo;taken the knock&rsquo;&mdash;&rsquo;taken the knock!&rsquo;
      And he wondered what on earth Mrs. Soames had been saying, what on earth
      she had been telling him in the railway carriage. She had looked bad
      enough herself! It made George sorry to think of her travelling on with
      her trouble all alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed close behind Bosinney&rsquo;s elbow&mdash;tall, burly figure,
      saying nothing, dodging warily&mdash;and shadowed him out into the fog.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something here beyond a jest! He kept his head admirably, in
      spite of some excitement, for in addition to compassion, the instincts of
      the chase were roused within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney walked right out into the thoroughfare&mdash;a vast muffled
      blackness, where a man could not see six paces before him; where, all
      around, voices or whistles mocked the sense of direction; and sudden
      shapes came rolling slow upon them; and now and then a light showed like a
      dim island in an infinite dark sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And fast into this perilous gulf of night walked Bosinney, and fast after
      him walked George. If the fellow meant to put his &lsquo;twopenny&rsquo;
      under a &lsquo;bus, he would stop it if he could! Across the street and
      back the hunted creature strode, not groping as other men were groping in
      that gloom, but driven forward as though the faithful George behind
      wielded a knout; and this chase after a haunted man began to have for
      George the strangest fascination.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was now that the affair developed in a way which ever afterwards
      caused it to remain green in his mind. Brought to a stand-still in the
      fog, he heard words which threw a sudden light on these proceedings. What
      Mrs. Soames had said to Bosinney in the train was now no longer dark.
      George understood from those mutterings that Soames had exercised his
      rights over an estranged and unwilling wife in the greatest&mdash;the
      supreme act of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fancy wandered in the fields of this situation; it impressed him; he
      guessed something of the anguish, the sexual confusion and horror in
      Bosinney&rsquo;s heart. And he thought: &lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a bit
      thick! I don&rsquo;t wonder the poor fellow is half-cracked!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had run his quarry to earth on a bench under one of the lions in
      Trafalgar Square, a monster sphynx astray like themselves in that gulf of
      darkness. Here, rigid and silent, sat Bosinney, and George, in whose
      patience was a touch of strange brotherliness, took his stand behind. He
      was not lacking in a certain delicacy&mdash;a sense of form&mdash;that did
      not permit him to intrude upon this tragedy, and he waited, quiet as the
      lion above, his fur collar hitched above his ears concealing the fleshy
      redness of his cheeks, concealing all but his eyes with their sardonic,
      compassionate stare. And men kept passing back from business on the way to
      their clubs&mdash;men whose figures shrouded in cocoons of fog came into
      view like spectres, and like spectres vanished. Then even in his
      compassion George&rsquo;s Quilpish humour broke forth in a sudden longing
      to pluck these spectres by the sleeve, and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, you Johnnies! You don&rsquo;t often see a show like this! Here&rsquo;s
      a poor devil whose mistress has just been telling him a pretty little
      story of her husband; walk up, walk up! He&rsquo;s taken the knock, you
      see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In fancy he saw them gaping round the tortured lover; and grinned as he
      thought of some respectable, newly-married spectre enabled by the state of
      his own affections to catch an inkling of what was going on within
      Bosinney; he fancied he could see his mouth getting wider and wider, and
      the fog going down and down. For in George was all that contempt of the
      middle-class&mdash;especially of the married middle-class&mdash;peculiar
      to the wild and sportsmanlike spirits in its ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he began to be bored. Waiting was not what he had bargained for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After all,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;the poor chap will get over
      it; not the first time such a thing has happened in this little city!&rsquo;
      But now his quarry again began muttering words of violent hate and anger.
      And following a sudden impulse George touched him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosinney spun round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you? What do you want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George could have stood it well enough in the light of the gas lamps, in
      the light of that everyday world of which he was so hardy a connoisseur;
      but in this fog, where all was gloomy and unreal, where nothing had that
      matter-of-fact value associated by Forsytes with earth, he was a victim to
      strange qualms, and as he tried to stare back into the eyes of this
      maniac, he thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I see a bobby, I&rsquo;ll hand him over; he&rsquo;s not fit to
      be at large.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But waiting for no answer, Bosinney strode off into the fog, and George
      followed, keeping perhaps a little further off, yet more than ever set on
      tracking him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t go on long like this,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      God&rsquo;s own miracle he&rsquo;s not been run over already.&rsquo; He
      brooded no more on policemen, a sportsman&rsquo;s sacred fire alive again
      within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into a denser gloom than ever Bosinney held on at a furious pace; but his
      pursuer perceived more method in his madness&mdash;he was clearly making
      his way westwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s really going for Soames!&rsquo; thought George. The idea
      was attractive. It would be a sporting end to such a chase. He had always
      disliked his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shaft of a passing cab brushed against his shoulder and made him leap
      aside. He did not intend to be killed for the Buccaneer, or anyone. Yet,
      with hereditary tenacity, he stuck to the trail through vapour that
      blotted out everything but the shadow of the hunted man and the dim moon
      of the nearest lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly, with the instinct of a town-stroller, George knew himself
      to be in Piccadilly. Here he could find his way blindfold; and freed from
      the strain of geographical uncertainty, his mind returned to Bosinney&rsquo;s
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the long avenue of his man-about-town experience, bursting, as it
      were, through a smirch of doubtful amours, there stalked to him a memory
      of his youth. A memory, poignant still, that brought the scent of hay, the
      gleam of moonlight, a summer magic, into the reek and blackness of this
      London fog&mdash;the memory of a night when in the darkest shadow of a
      lawn he had overheard from a woman&rsquo;s lips that he was not her sole
      possessor. And for a moment George walked no longer in black Piccadilly,
      but lay again, with hell in his heart, and his face to the sweet-smelling,
      dewy grass, in the long shadow of poplars that hid the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      A longing seized him to throw his arm round the Buccaneer, and say,
      &ldquo;Come, old boy. Time cures all. Let&rsquo;s go and drink it off!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But a voice yelled at him, and he started back. A cab rolled out of
      blackness, and into blackness disappeared. And suddenly George perceived
      that he had lost Bosinney. He ran forward and back, felt his heart
      clutched by a sickening fear, the dark fear which lives in the wings of
      the fog. Perspiration started out on his brow. He stood quite still,
      listening with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; as he confided to Dartie the same evening in the
      course of a game of billiards at the Red Pottle, &ldquo;I lost him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dartie twirled complacently at his dark moustache. He had just put
      together a neat break of twenty-three,&mdash;failing at a &lsquo;Jenny.&rsquo;
      &ldquo;And who was she?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      George looked slowly at the &lsquo;man of the world&rsquo;s&rsquo;
      fattish, sallow face, and a little grim smile lurked about the curves of
      his cheeks and his heavy-lidded eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, my fine fellow,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not
      going to tell you.&rsquo; For though he mixed with Dartie a good deal, he
      thought him a bit of a cad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, some little love-lady or other,&rdquo; he said, and chalked his
      cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A love-lady!&rdquo; exclaimed Dartie&mdash;he used a more
      figurative expression. &ldquo;I made sure it was our friend Soa....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; said George curtly. &ldquo;Then damme you&rsquo;ve
      made an error.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He missed his shot. He was careful not to allude to the subject again
      till, towards eleven o&rsquo;clock, having, in his poetic phraseology,
      &lsquo;looked upon the drink when it was yellow,&rsquo; he drew aside the
      blind, and gazed out into the street. The murky blackness of the fog was
      but faintly broken by the lamps of the &lsquo;Red Pottle,&rsquo; and no
      shape of mortal man or thing was in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking of that poor Buccaneer,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;He may be wandering out there now in that fog. If he&rsquo;s not a
      corpse,&rdquo; he added with strange dejection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corpse!&rdquo; said Dartie, in whom the recollection of his defeat
      at Richmond flared up. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right. Ten to one if he wasn&rsquo;t
      tight!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George turned on him, looking really formidable, with a sort of savage
      gloom on his big face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry up!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell you he&rsquo;s
      &lsquo;taken the knock!&rdquo;&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;THE TRIAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the morning of his case, which was second in the list, Soames was again
      obliged to start without seeing Irene, and it was just as well, for he had
      not as yet made up his mind what attitude to adopt towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been requested to be in court by half-past ten, to provide against
      the event of the first action (a breach of promise) collapsing, which
      however it did not, both sides showing a courage that afforded Waterbuck,
      Q.C., an opportunity for improving his already great reputation in this
      class of case. He was opposed by Ram, the other celebrated breach of
      promise man. It was a battle of giants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court delivered judgment just before the luncheon interval. The jury
      left the box for good, and Soames went out to get something to eat. He met
      James standing at the little luncheon-bar, like a pelican in the
      wilderness of the galleries, bent over a sandwich with a glass of sherry
      before him. The spacious emptiness of the great central hall, over which
      father and son brooded as they stood together, was marred now and then for
      a fleeting moment by barristers in wig and gown hurriedly bolting across,
      by an occasional old lady or rusty-coated man, looking up in a frightened
      way, and by two persons, bolder than their generation, seated in an
      embrasure arguing. The sound of their voices arose, together with a scent
      as of neglected wells, which, mingling with the odour of the galleries,
      combined to form the savour, like nothing but the emanation of a refined
      cheese, so indissolubly connected with the administration of British
      Justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before James addressed his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&rsquo;s your case coming on? I suppose it&rsquo;ll be on
      directly. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if this Bosinney&rsquo;d say anything;
      I should think he&rsquo;d have to. He&rsquo;ll go bankrupt if it goes
      against him.&rdquo; He took a large bite at his sandwich and a mouthful of
      sherry. &ldquo;Your mother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wants you and Irene to
      come and dine to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A chill smile played round Soames&rsquo; lips; he looked back at his
      father. Anyone who had seen the look, cold and furtive, thus interchanged,
      might have been pardoned for not appreciating the real understanding
      between them. James finished his sherry at a draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to the court Soames took at once his rightful seat on the
      front bench beside his solicitor. He ascertained where his father was
      seated with a glance so sidelong as to commit nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, sitting back with his hands clasped over the handle of his
      umbrella, was brooding on the end of the bench immediately behind counsel,
      whence he could get away at once when the case was over. He considered
      Bosinney&rsquo;s conduct in every way outrageous, but he did not wish to
      run up against him, feeling that the meeting would be awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to the Divorce Court, this court was, perhaps, the favourite emporium
      of justice, libel, breach of promise, and other commercial actions being
      frequently decided there. Quite a sprinkling of persons unconnected with
      the law occupied the back benches, and the hat of a woman or two could be
      seen in the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two rows of seats immediately in front of James were gradually filled
      by barristers in wigs, who sat down to make pencil notes, chat, and attend
      to their teeth; but his interest was soon diverted from these lesser
      lights of justice by the entrance of Waterbuck, Q.C., with the wings of
      his silk gown rustling, and his red, capable face supported by two short,
      brown whiskers. The famous Q.C. looked, as James freely admitted, the very
      picture of a man who could heckle a witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all his experience, it so happened that he had never seen Waterbuck,
      Q.C., before, and, like many Forsytes in the lower branch of the
      profession, he had an extreme admiration for a good cross-examiner. The
      long, lugubrious folds in his cheeks relaxed somewhat after seeing him,
      especially as he now perceived that Soames alone was represented by silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waterbuck, Q.C., had barely screwed round on his elbow to chat with his
      Junior before Mr. Justice Bentham himself appeared&mdash;a thin, rather
      hen-like man, with a little stoop, clean-shaven under his snowy wig. Like
      all the rest of the court, Waterbuck rose, and remained on his feet until
      the judge was seated. James rose but slightly; he was already comfortable,
      and had no opinion of Bentham, having sat next but one to him at dinner
      twice at the Bumley Tomms&rsquo;. Bumley Tomm was rather a poor thing,
      though he had been so successful. James himself had given him his first
      brief. He was excited, too, for he had just found out that Bosinney was
      not in court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, what&rsquo;s he mean by that?&rsquo; he kept on thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case having been called on, Waterbuck, Q.C., pushing back his papers,
      hitched his gown on his shoulder, and, with a semi-circular look around
      him, like a man who is going to bat, arose and addressed the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      The facts, he said, were not in dispute, and all that his Lordship would
      be asked was to interpret the correspondence which had taken place between
      his client and the defendant, an architect, with reference to the
      decoration of a house. He would, however, submit that this correspondence
      could only mean one very plain thing. After briefly reciting the history
      of the house at Robin Hill, which he described as a mansion, and the
      actual facts of expenditure, he went on as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My client, Mr. Soames Forsyte, is a gentleman, a man of property,
      who would be the last to dispute any legitimate claim that might be made
      against him, but he has met with such treatment from his architect in the
      matter of this house, over which he has, as your lordship has heard,
      already spent some twelve&mdash;some twelve thousand pounds, a sum
      considerably in advance of the amount he had originally contemplated, that
      as a matter of principle&mdash;and this I cannot too strongly emphasize&mdash;as
      a matter of principle, and in the interests of others, he has felt himself
      compelled to bring this action. The point put forward in defence by the
      architect I will suggest to your lordship is not worthy of a moment&rsquo;s
      serious consideration.&rdquo; He then read the correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His client, &ldquo;a man of recognised position,&rdquo; was prepared to go
      into the box, and to swear that he never did authorize, that it was never
      in his mind to authorize, the expenditure of any money beyond the extreme
      limit of twelve thousand and fifty pounds, which he had clearly fixed; and
      not further to waste the time of the court, he would at once call Mr.
      Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames then went into the box. His whole appearance was striking in its
      composure. His face, just supercilious enough, pale and clean-shaven, with
      a little line between the eyes, and compressed lips; his dress in
      unostentatious order, one hand neatly gloved, the other bare. He answered
      the questions put to him in a somewhat low, but distinct voice. His
      evidence under cross-examination savoured of taciturnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he not used the expression, &ldquo;a free hand&rdquo;? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression he had used was &lsquo;a free hand in the terms of this
      correspondence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you tell the Court that that was English?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say it means?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What it says!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you prepared to deny that it is a contradiction in terms?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not an Irishman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a well-educated man?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you persist in that statement?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this and much more cross-examination, which turned again and
      again around the &lsquo;nice point,&rsquo; James sat with his hand behind
      his ear, his eyes fixed upon his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was proud of him! He could not but feel that in similar circumstances
      he himself would have been tempted to enlarge his replies, but his
      instinct told him that this taciturnity was the very thing. He sighed with
      relief, however, when Soames, slowly turning, and without any change of
      expression, descended from the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it came to the turn of Bosinney&rsquo;s Counsel to address the Judge,
      James redoubled his attention, and he searched the Court again and again
      to see if Bosinney were not somewhere concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Chankery began nervously; he was placed by Bosinney&rsquo;s absence
      in an awkward position. He therefore did his best to turn that absence to
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not but fear&mdash;he said&mdash;that his client had met with an
      accident. He had fully expected him there to give evidence; they had sent
      round that morning both to Mr. Bosinney&rsquo;s office and to his rooms
      (though he knew they were one and the same, he thought it was as well not
      to say so), but it was not known where he was, and this he considered to
      be ominous, knowing how anxious Mr. Bosinney had been to give his
      evidence. He had not, however, been instructed to apply for an
      adjournment, and in default of such instruction he conceived it his duty
      to go on. The plea on which he somewhat confidently relied, and which his
      client, had he not unfortunately been prevented in some way from
      attending, would have supported by his evidence, was that such an
      expression as a &lsquo;free hand&rsquo; could not be limited, fettered,
      and rendered unmeaning, by any verbiage which might follow it. He would go
      further and say that the correspondence showed that whatever he might have
      said in his evidence, Mr. Forsyte had in fact never contemplated
      repudiating liability on any of the work ordered or executed by his
      architect. The defendant had certainly never contemplated such a
      contingency, or, as was demonstrated by his letters, he would never have
      proceeded with the work&mdash;a work of extreme delicacy, carried out with
      great care and efficiency, to meet and satisfy the fastidious taste of a
      connoisseur, a rich man, a man of property. He felt strongly on this
      point, and feeling strongly he used, perhaps, rather strong words when he
      said that this action was of a most unjustifiable, unexpected, indeed&mdash;unprecedented
      character. If his Lordship had had the opportunity that he himself had
      made it his duty to take, to go over this very fine house and see the
      great delicacy and beauty of the decorations executed by his client&mdash;an
      artist in his most honourable profession&mdash;he felt convinced that not
      for one moment would his Lordship tolerate this, he would use no stronger
      word than daring attempt to evade legitimate responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the text of Soames&rsquo; letters, he lightly touched on &lsquo;Boileau
      v. The Blasted Cement Company, Limited.&rsquo; &ldquo;It is doubtful,&rdquo;
      he said, &ldquo;what that authority has decided; in any case I would
      submit that it is just as much in my favour as in my friend&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      He then argued the &lsquo;nice point&rsquo; closely. With all due
      deference he submitted that Mr. Forsyte&rsquo;s expression nullified
      itself. His client not being a rich man, the matter was a serious one for
      him; he was a very talented architect, whose professional reputation was
      undoubtedly somewhat at stake. He concluded with a perhaps too personal
      appeal to the Judge, as a lover of the arts, to show himself the protector
      of artists, from what was occasionally&mdash;he said occasionally&mdash;the
      too iron hand of capital. &ldquo;What,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will be the
      position of the artistic professions, if men of property like this Mr.
      Forsyte refuse, and are allowed to refuse, to carry out the obligations of
      the commissions which they have given.&rdquo; He would now call his
      client, in case he should at the last moment have found himself able to be
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name Philip Baynes Bosinney was called three times by the Ushers, and
      the sound of the calling echoed with strange melancholy throughout the
      Court and Galleries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crying of this name, to which no answer was returned, had upon James a
      curious effect: it was like calling for your lost dog about the streets.
      And the creepy feeling that it gave him, of a man missing, grated on his
      sense of comfort and security-on his cosiness. Though he could not have
      said why, it made him feel uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked now at the clock&mdash;a quarter to three! It would be all over
      in a quarter of an hour. Where could the young fellow be?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only when Mr. Justice Bentham delivered judgment that he got over
      the turn he had received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the wooden erection, by which he was fenced from more ordinary
      mortals, the learned Judge leaned forward. The electric light, just turned
      on above his head, fell on his face, and mellowed it to an orange hue
      beneath the snowy crown of his wig; the amplitude of his robes grew before
      the eye; his whole figure, facing the comparative dusk of the Court,
      radiated like some majestic and sacred body. He cleared his throat, took a
      sip of water, broke the nib of a quill against the desk, and, folding his
      bony hands before him, began.
    </p>
    <p>
      To James he suddenly loomed much larger than he had ever thought Bentham
      would loom. It was the majesty of the law; and a person endowed with a
      nature far less matter-of-fact than that of James might have been excused
      for failing to pierce this halo, and disinter therefrom the somewhat
      ordinary Forsyte, who walked and talked in every-day life under the name
      of Sir Walter Bentham.
    </p>
    <p>
      He delivered judgment in the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The facts in this case are not in dispute. On May 15 last the
      defendant wrote to the plaintiff, requesting to be allowed to withdraw
      from his professional position in regard to the decoration of the
      plaintiff&rsquo;s house, unless he were given &lsquo;a free hand.&rsquo;
      The plaintiff, on May 17, wrote back as follows: &lsquo;In giving you, in
      accordance with your request, this free hand, I wish you to clearly
      understand that the total cost of the house as handed over to me
      completely decorated, inclusive of your fee (as arranged between us) must
      not exceed twelve thousand pounds.&rsquo; To this letter the defendant
      replied on May 18: &lsquo;If you think that in such a delicate matter as
      decoration I can bind myself to the exact pound, I am afraid you are
      mistaken.&rsquo; On May 19 the plaintiff wrote as follows: &lsquo;I did
      not mean to say that if you should exceed the sum named in my letter to
      you by ten or twenty or even fifty pounds there would be any difficulty
      between us. You have a free hand in the terms of this correspondence, and
      I hope you will see your way to completing the decorations.&rsquo; On May
      20 the defendant replied thus shortly: &lsquo;Very well.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In completing these decorations, the defendant incurred liabilities
      and expenses which brought the total cost of this house up to the sum of
      twelve thousand four hundred pounds, all of which expenditure has been
      defrayed by the plaintiff. This action has been brought by the plaintiff
      to recover from the defendant the sum of three hundred and fifty pounds
      expended by him in excess of a sum of twelve thousand and fifty pounds,
      alleged by the plaintiff to have been fixed by this correspondence as the
      maximum sum that the defendant had authority to expend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question for me to decide is whether or no the defendant is
      liable to refund to the plaintiff this sum. In my judgment he is so
      liable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in effect the plaintiff has said is this &lsquo;I give you a
      free hand to complete these decorations, provided that you keep within a
      total cost to me of twelve thousand pounds. If you exceed that sum by as
      much as fifty pounds, I will not hold you responsible; beyond that point
      you are no agent of mine, and I shall repudiate liability.&rsquo; It is
      not quite clear to me whether, had the plaintiff in fact repudiated
      liability under his agent&rsquo;s contracts, he would, under all the
      circumstances, have been successful in so doing; but he has not adopted
      this course. He has accepted liability, and fallen back upon his rights
      against the defendant under the terms of the latter&rsquo;s engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my judgment the plaintiff is entitled to recover this sum from
      the defendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been sought, on behalf of the defendant, to show that no
      limit of expenditure was fixed or intended to be fixed by this
      correspondence. If this were so, I can find no reason for the plaintiff&rsquo;s
      importation into the correspondence of the figures of twelve thousand
      pounds and subsequently of fifty pounds. The defendant&rsquo;s contention
      would render these figures meaningless. It is manifest to me that by his
      letter of May 20 he assented to a very clear proposition, by the terms of
      which he must be held to be bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For these reasons there will be judgment for the plaintiff for the
      amount claimed with costs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James sighed, and stooping, picked up his umbrella which had fallen with a
      rattle at the words &lsquo;importation into this correspondence.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Untangling his legs, he rapidly left the Court; without waiting for his
      son, he snapped up a hansom cab (it was a clear, grey afternoon) and drove
      straight to Timothy&rsquo;s where he found Swithin; and to him, Mrs.
      Septimus Small, and Aunt Hester, he recounted the whole proceedings,
      eating two muffins not altogether in the intervals of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soames did very well,&rdquo; he ended; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s got his
      head screwed on the right way. This won&rsquo;t please Jolyon. It&rsquo;s
      a bad business for that young Bosinney; he&rsquo;ll go bankrupt, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder,&rdquo; and then after a long pause, during which he had stared
      disquietly into the fire, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t there&mdash;now why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound of footsteps. The figure of a thick-set man, with the
      ruddy brown face of robust health, was seen in the back drawing-room. The
      forefinger of his upraised hand was outlined against the black of his
      frock coat. He spoke in a grudging voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, James,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
      stop,&rdquo; and turning round, he walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Timothy.
    </p>
    <p>
      James rose from his chair. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there! I
      knew there was something wro....&rdquo; He checked himself, and was
      silent, staring before him, as though he had seen a portent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;SOAMES BREAKS THE NEWS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In leaving the Court Soames did not go straight home. He felt disinclined
      for the City, and drawn by need for sympathy in his triumph, he, too, made
      his way, but slowly and on foot, to Timothy&rsquo;s in the Bayswater Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father had just left; Mrs. Small and Aunt Hester, in possession of the
      whole story, greeted him warmly. They were sure he was hungry after all
      that evidence. Smither should toast him some more muffins, his dear father
      had eaten them all. He must put his legs up on the sofa; and he must have
      a glass of prune brandy too. It was so strengthening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swithin was still present, having lingered later than his wont, for he
      felt in want of exercise. On hearing this suggestion, he &lsquo;pished.&rsquo;
      A pretty pass young men were coming to! His own liver was out of order,
      and he could not bear the thought of anyone else drinking prune brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went away almost immediately, saying to Soames: &ldquo;And how&rsquo;s
      your wife? You tell her from me that if she&rsquo;s dull, and likes to
      come and dine with me quietly, I&rsquo;ll give her such a bottle of
      champagne as she doesn&rsquo;t get every day.&rdquo; Staring down from his
      height on Soames he contracted his thick, puffy, yellow hand as though
      squeezing within it all this small fry, and throwing out his chest he
      waddled slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small and Aunt Hester were left horrified. Swithin was so droll!
    </p>
    <p>
      They themselves were longing to ask Soames how Irene would take the
      result, yet knew that they must not; he would perhaps say something of his
      own accord, to throw some light on this, the present burning question in
      their lives, the question that from necessity of silence tortured them
      almost beyond bearing; for even Timothy had now been told, and the effect
      on his health was little short of alarming. And what, too, would June do?
      This, also, was a most exciting, if dangerous speculation!
    </p>
    <p>
      They had never forgotten old Jolyon&rsquo;s visit, since when he had not
      once been to see them; they had never forgotten the feeling it gave all
      who were present, that the family was no longer what it had been&mdash;that
      the family was breaking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Soames gave them no help, sitting with his knees crossed, talking of
      the Barbizon school of painters, whom he had just discovered. These were
      the coming men, he said; he should not wonder if a lot of money were made
      over them; he had his eye on two pictures by a man called Corot, charming
      things; if he could get them at a reasonable price he was going to buy
      them&mdash;they would, he thought, fetch a big price some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interested as they could not but be, neither Mrs. Septimus Small nor Aunt
      Hester could entirely acquiesce in being thus put off.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was interesting&mdash;most interesting&mdash;and then Soames was so
      clever that they were sure he would do something with those pictures if
      anybody could; but what was his plan now that he had won his case; was he
      going to leave London at once, and live in the country, or what was he
      going to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames answered that he did not know, he thought they should be moving
      soon. He rose and kissed his aunts.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had Aunt Juley received this emblem of departure than a change
      came over her, as though she were being visited by dreadful courage; every
      little roll of flesh on her face seemed trying to escape from an
      invisible, confining mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose to the full extent of her more than medium height, and said:
      &ldquo;It has been on my mind a long time, dear, and if nobody else will
      tell you, I have made up my mind that....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester interrupted her: &ldquo;Mind, Julia, you do it....&rdquo; she
      gasped&mdash;&ldquo;on your own responsibility!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Small went on as though she had not heard: &ldquo;I think you ought
      to know, dear, that Mrs. MacAnder saw Irene walking in Richmond Park with
      Mr. Bosinney.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Hester, who had also risen, sank back in her chair, and turned her
      face away. Really Juley was too&mdash;she should not do such things when
      she&mdash;Aunt Hester, was in the room; and, breathless with anticipation,
      she waited for what Soames would answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had flushed the peculiar flush which always centred between his eyes;
      lifting his hand, and, as it were, selecting a finger, he bit a nail
      delicately; then, drawling it out between set lips, he said: &ldquo;Mrs.
      MacAnder is a cat!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for any reply, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went into Timothy&rsquo;s he had made up his mind what course to
      pursue on getting home. He would go up to Irene and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve won my case, and there&rsquo;s an end of it! I don&rsquo;t
      want to be hard on Bosinney; I&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t come to some
      arrangement; he shan&rsquo;t be pressed. And now let&rsquo;s turn over a
      new leaf! We&rsquo;ll let the house, and get out of these fogs. We&rsquo;ll
      go down to Robin Hill at once. I&mdash;I never meant to be rough with you!
      Let&rsquo;s shake hands&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; Perhaps she would let him
      kiss her, and forget!
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came out of Timothy&rsquo;s his intentions were no longer so
      simple. The smouldering jealousy and suspicion of months blazed up within
      him. He would put an end to that sort of thing once and for all; he would
      not have her drag his name in the dirt! If she could not or would not love
      him, as was her duty and his right&mdash;she should not play him tricks
      with anyone else! He would tax her with it; threaten to divorce her! That
      would make her behave; she would never face that. But&mdash;but&mdash;what
      if she did? He was staggered; this had not occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if she did? What if she made him a confession? How would he stand
      then? He would have to bring a divorce!
    </p>
    <p>
      A divorce! Thus close, the word was paralyzing, so utterly at variance
      with all the principles that had hitherto guided his life. Its lack of
      compromise appalled him; he felt&mdash;like the captain of a ship, going
      to the side of his vessel, and, with his own hands throwing over the most
      precious of his bales. This jettisoning of his property with his own hand
      seemed uncanny to Soames. It would injure him in his profession: He would
      have to get rid of the house at Robin Hill, on which he had spent so much
      money, so much anticipation&mdash;and at a sacrifice. And she! She would
      no longer belong to him, not even in name! She would pass out of his life,
      and he&mdash;he should never see her again!
    </p>
    <p>
      He traversed in the cab the length of a street without getting beyond the
      thought that he should never see her again!
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps there was nothing to confess, even now very likely there was
      nothing to confess. Was it wise to push things so far? Was it wise to put
      himself into a position where he might have to eat his words? The result
      of this case would ruin Bosinney; a ruined man was desperate, but&mdash;what
      could he do? He might go abroad, ruined men always went abroad. What could
      they do&mdash;if indeed it was &lsquo;they&rsquo;&mdash;without money? It
      would be better to wait and see how things turned out. If necessary, he
      could have her watched. The agony of his jealousy (for all the world like
      the crisis of an aching tooth) came on again; and he almost cried out. But
      he must decide, fix on some course of action before he got home. When the
      cab drew up at the door, he had decided nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered, pale, his hands moist with perspiration, dreading to meet her,
      burning to meet her, ignorant of what he was to say or do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid Bilson was in the hall, and in answer to his question: &ldquo;Where
      is your mistress?&rdquo; told him that Mrs. Forsyte had left the house
      about noon, taking with her a trunk and bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snatching the sleeve of his fur coat away from her grasp, he confronted
      her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s that you said?&rdquo;
      Suddenly recollecting that he must not betray emotion, he added: &ldquo;What
      message did she leave?&rdquo; and noticed with secret terror the startled
      look of the maid&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Forsyte left no message, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No message; very well, thank you, that will do. I shall be dining
      out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid went downstairs, leaving him still in his fur coat, idly turning
      over the visiting cards in the porcelain bowl that stood on the carved oak
      rug chest in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Bareham Culcher. Mrs. Septimus Small. Mrs. Baynes. Mr.
      Solomon Thornworthy. Lady Bellis. Miss Hermione Bellis. Miss Winifred
      Bellis. Miss Ella Bellis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who the devil were all these people? He seemed to have forgotten all
      familiar things. The words &lsquo;no message&mdash;a trunk, and a bag,&rsquo;
      played a hide-and-seek in his brain. It was incredible that she had left
      no message, and, still in his fur coat, he ran upstairs two steps at a
      time, as a young married man when he comes home will run up to his wife&rsquo;s
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was dainty, fresh, sweet-smelling; everything in perfect order.
      On the great bed with its lilac silk quilt, was the bag she had made and
      embroidered with her own hands to hold her sleeping things; her slippers
      ready at the foot; the sheets even turned over at the head as though
      expecting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the table stood the silver-mounted brushes and bottles from her
      dressing bag, his own present. There must, then, be some mistake. What bag
      had she taken? He went to the bell to summon Bilson, but remembered in
      time that he must assume knowledge of where Irene had gone, take it all as
      a matter of course, and grope out the meaning for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He locked the doors, and tried to think, but felt his brain going round;
      and suddenly tears forced themselves into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurriedly pulling off his coat, he looked at himself in the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too pale, a greyish tinge all over his face; he poured out water,
      and began feverishly washing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her silver-mounted brushes smelt faintly of the perfumed lotion she used
      for her hair; and at this scent the burning sickness of his jealousy
      seized him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Struggling into his fur, he ran downstairs and out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not lost all command of himself, however, and as he went down
      Sloane Street he framed a story for use, in case he should not find her at
      Bosinney&rsquo;s. But if he should? His power of decision again failed; he
      reached the house without knowing what he should do if he did find her
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after office hours, and the street door was closed; the woman who
      opened it could not say whether Mr. Bosinney were in or no; she had not
      seen him that day, not for two or three days; she did not attend to him
      now, nobody attended to him, he....
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames interrupted her, he would go up and see for himself. He went up
      with a dogged, white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top floor was unlighted, the door closed, no one answered his ringing,
      he could hear no sound. He was obliged to descend, shivering under his
      fur, a chill at his heart. Hailing a cab, he told the man to drive to Park
      Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way he tried to recollect when he had last given her a cheque; she
      could not have more than three or four pounds, but there were her jewels;
      and with exquisite torture he remembered how much money she could raise on
      these; enough to take them abroad; enough for them to live on for months!
      He tried to calculate; the cab stopped, and he got out with the
      calculation unmade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler asked whether Mrs. Soames was in the cab, the master had told
      him they were both expected to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames answered: &ldquo;No. Mrs. Forsyte has a cold.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler was sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames thought he was looking at him inquisitively, and remembering that
      he was not in dress clothes, asked: &ldquo;Anybody here to dinner,
      Warmson?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody but Mr. and Mrs. Dartie, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again it seemed to Soames that the butler was looking curiously at him.
      His composure gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter with me, eh?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler blushed, hung up the fur coat, murmured something that sounded
      like: &ldquo;Nothing, sir, I&rsquo;m sure, sir,&rdquo; and stealthily
      withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames walked upstairs. Passing the drawing-room without a look, he went
      straight up to his mother&rsquo;s and father&rsquo;s bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, standing sideways, the concave lines of his tall, lean figure
      displayed to advantage in shirt-sleeves and evening waistcoat, his head
      bent, the end of his white tie peeping askew from underneath one white
      Dundreary whisker, his eyes peering with intense concentration, his lips
      pouting, was hooking the top hooks of his wife&rsquo;s bodice. Soames
      stopped; he felt half-choked, whether because he had come upstairs too
      fast, or for some other reason. He&mdash;he himself had never&mdash;never
      been asked to....
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard his father&rsquo;s voice, as though there were a pin in his
      mouth, saying: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that? Who&rsquo;s there? What d&rsquo;you
      want?&rdquo; His mother&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Here, Felice, come and hook this;
      your master&rsquo;ll never get done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand up to his throat, and said hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I&mdash;Soames!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed gratefully the affectionate surprise in Emily&rsquo;s: &ldquo;Well,
      my dear boy?&rdquo; and James&rsquo;, as he dropped the hook: &ldquo;What,
      Soames! What&rsquo;s brought you up? Aren&rsquo;t you well?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered mechanically: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; and looked at
      them, and it seemed impossible to bring out his news.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, quick to take alarm, began: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look well. I
      expect you&rsquo;ve taken a chill&mdash;it&rsquo;s liver, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      wonder. Your mother&rsquo;ll give you....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Emily broke in quietly: &ldquo;Have you brought Irene?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;she&mdash;she&rsquo;s left me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily deserted the mirror before which she was standing. Her tall, full
      figure lost its majesty and became very human as she came running over to
      Soames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy! My dear boy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her lips to his forehead, and stroked his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      James, too, had turned full towards his son; his face looked older.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean&mdash;left
      you? You never told me she was going to leave you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames answered surlily: &ldquo;How could I tell? What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James began walking up and down; he looked strange and stork-like without
      a coat. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;How
      should I know what&rsquo;s to be done? What&rsquo;s the good of asking me?
      Nobody tells me anything, and then they come and ask me what&rsquo;s to be
      done; and I should like to know how I&rsquo;m to tell them! Here&rsquo;s
      your mother, there she stands; she doesn&rsquo;t say anything. What I
      should say you&rsquo;ve got to do is to follow her..&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames smiled; his peculiar, supercilious smile had never before looked
      pitiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where she&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know where she&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;How
      d&rsquo;you mean, don&rsquo;t know where she&rsquo;s gone? Where d&rsquo;you
      suppose she&rsquo;s gone? She&rsquo;s gone after that young Bosinney, that&rsquo;s
      where she&rsquo;s gone. I knew how it would be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames, in the long silence that followed, felt his mother pressing his
      hand. And all that passed seemed to pass as though his own power of
      thinking or doing had gone to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father&rsquo;s face, dusky red, twitching as if he were going to cry,
      and words breaking out that seemed rent from him by some spasm in his
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a scandal; I always said so.&rdquo; Then, no one
      saying anything: &ldquo;And there you stand, you and your mother!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Emily&rsquo;s voice, calm, rather contemptuous: &ldquo;Come, now,
      James! Soames will do all that he can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And James, staring at the floor, a little brokenly: &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t
      help you; I&rsquo;m getting old. Don&rsquo;t you be in too great a hurry,
      my boy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And his mother&rsquo;s voice again: &ldquo;Soames will do all he can to
      get her back. We won&rsquo;t talk of it. It&rsquo;ll all come right, I
      dare say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And James: &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t see how it can come right. And if
      she hasn&rsquo;t gone off with that young Bosinney, my advice to you is
      not to listen to her, but to follow her and get her back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more Soames felt his mother stroking his hand, in token of her
      approval, and as though repeating some form of sacred oath, he muttered
      between his teeth: &ldquo;I will!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All three went down to the drawing-room together. There, were gathered the
      three girls and Dartie; had Irene been present, the family circle would
      have been complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      James sank into his armchair, and except for a word of cold greeting to
      Dartie, whom he both despised and dreaded, as a man likely to be always in
      want of money, he said nothing till dinner was announced. Soames, too, was
      silent; Emily alone, a woman of cool courage, maintained a conversation
      with Winifred on trivial subjects. She was never more composed in her
      manner and conversation than that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      A decision having been come to not to speak of Irene&rsquo;s flight, no
      view was expressed by any other member of the family as to the right
      course to be pursued; there can be little doubt, from the general tone
      adopted in relation to events as they afterwards turned out, that James&rsquo;s
      advice: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you listen to her, follow her and get her back!&rdquo;
      would, with here and there an exception, have been regarded as sound, not
      only in Park Lane, but amongst the Nicholases, the Rogers, and at Timothy&rsquo;s.
      Just as it would surely have been endorsed by that wider body of Forsytes
      all over London, who were merely excluded from judgment by ignorance of
      the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite then of Emily&rsquo;s efforts, the dinner was served by Warmson
      and the footman almost in silence. Dartie was sulky, and drank all he
      could get; the girls seldom talked to each other at any time. James asked
      once where June was, and what she was doing with herself in these days. No
      one could tell him. He sank back into gloom. Only when Winifred recounted
      how little Publius had given his bad penny to a beggar, did he brighten
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a clever little chap. I don&rsquo;t
      know what&rsquo;ll become of him, if he goes on like this. An intelligent
      little chap, I call him!&rdquo; But it was only a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courses succeeded one another solemnly, under the electric light,
      which glared down onto the table, but barely reached the principal
      ornament of the walls, a so-called &lsquo;Sea Piece by Turner,&rsquo;
      almost entirely composed of cordage and drowning men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Champagne was handed, and then a bottle of James&rsquo; prehistoric port,
      but as by the chill hand of some skeleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o&rsquo;clock Soames left; twice in reply to questions, he had said
      that Irene was not well; he felt he could no longer trust himself. His
      mother kissed him with her large soft kiss, and he pressed her hand, a
      flush of warmth in his cheeks. He walked away in the cold wind, which
      whistled desolately round the corners of the streets, under a sky of clear
      steel-blue, alive with stars; he noticed neither their frosty greeting,
      nor the crackle of the curled-up plane-leaves, nor the night-women
      hurrying in their shabby furs, nor the pinched faces of vagabonds at
      street corners. Winter was come! But Soames hastened home, oblivious; his
      hands trembled as he took the late letters from the gilt wire cage into
      which they had been thrust through the slit in the door.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      None from Irene!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the dining-room; the fire was bright there, his chair drawn
      up to it, slippers ready, spirit case, and carven cigarette box on the
      table; but after staring at it all for a minute or two, he turned out the
      light and went upstairs. There was a fire too in his dressing-room, but
      her room was dark and cold. It was into this room that Soames went.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a great illumination with candles, and for a long time continued
      pacing up and down between the bed and the door. He could not get used to
      the thought that she had really left him, and as though still searching
      for some message, some reason, some reading of all the mystery of his
      married life, he began opening every recess and drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were her dresses; he had always liked, indeed insisted, that she
      should be well-dressed&mdash;she had taken very few; two or three at most,
      and drawer after drawer; full of linen and silk things, was untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps after all it was only a freak, and she had gone to the seaside for
      a few days&rsquo; change. If only that were so, and she were really coming
      back, he would never again do as he had done that fatal night before last,
      never again run that risk&mdash;though it was her duty, her duty as a
      wife; though she did belong to him&mdash;he would never again run that
      risk; she was evidently not quite right in her head!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped over the drawer where she kept her jewels; it was not locked,
      and came open as he pulled; the jewel box had the key in it. This
      surprised him until he remembered that it was sure to be empty. He opened
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was far from empty. Divided, in little green velvet compartments, were
      all the things he had given her, even her watch, and stuck into the recess
      that contained the watch was a three-cornered note addressed &lsquo;Soames
      Forsyte,&rsquo; in Irene&rsquo;s handwriting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I have taken nothing that you or your people have given me.&rsquo;
      And that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the clasps and bracelets of diamonds and pearls, at the
      little flat gold watch with a great diamond set in sapphires, at the
      chains and rings, each in its nest, and the tears rushed up in his eyes
      and dropped upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing that she could have done, nothing that she had done, brought home
      to him like this the inner significance of her act. For the moment,
      perhaps, he understood nearly all there was to understand&mdash;understood
      that she loathed him, that she had loathed him for years, that for all
      intents and purposes they were like people living in different worlds,
      that there was no hope for him, never had been; even, that she had
      suffered&mdash;that she was to be pitied.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that moment of emotion he betrayed the Forsyte in him&mdash;forgot
      himself, his interests, his property&mdash;was capable of almost anything;
      was lifted into the pure ether of the selfless and unpractical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such moments pass quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as though with the tears he had purged himself of weakness, he got up,
      locked the box, and slowly, almost trembling, carried it with him into the
      other room.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;JUNE&rsquo;S VICTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      June had waited for her chance, scanning the duller columns of the
      journals, morning and evening with an assiduity which at first puzzled old
      Jolyon; and when her chance came, she took it with all the promptitude and
      resolute tenacity of her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      She will always remember best in her life that morning when at last she
      saw amongst the reliable Cause List of the Times newspaper, under the
      heading of Court XIII, Mr. Justice Bentham, the case of Forsyte v.
      Bosinney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a gambler who stakes his last piece of money, she had prepared to
      hazard her all upon this throw; it was not her nature to contemplate
      defeat. How, unless with the instinct of a woman in love, she knew that
      Bosinney&rsquo;s discomfiture in this action was assured, cannot be told&mdash;on
      this assumption, however, she laid her plans, as upon a certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half past eleven found her at watch in the gallery of Court XIII., and
      there she remained till the case of Forsyte v. Bosinney was over. Bosinney&rsquo;s
      absence did not disquiet her; she had felt instinctively that he would not
      defend himself. At the end of the judgment she hastened down, and took a
      cab to his rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed the open street-door and the offices on the three lower floors
      without attracting notice; not till she reached the top did her
      difficulties begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ring was not answered; she had now to make up her mind whether she
      would go down and ask the caretaker in the basement to let her in to await
      Mr. Bosinney&rsquo;s return, or remain patiently outside the door,
      trusting that no one would come up. She decided on the latter course.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour had passed in freezing vigil on the landing, before
      it occurred to her that Bosinney had been used to leave the key of his
      rooms under the door-mat. She looked and found it there. For some minutes
      she could not decide to make use of it; at last she let herself in and
      left the door open that anyone who came might see she was there on
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not the same June who had paid the trembling visit five months
      ago; those months of suffering and restraint had made her less sensitive;
      she had dwelt on this visit so long, with such minuteness, that its
      terrors were discounted beforehand. She was not there to fail this time,
      for if she failed no one could help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like some mother beast on the watch over her young, her little quick
      figure never stood still in that room, but wandered from wall to wall,
      from window to door, fingering now one thing, now another. There was dust
      everywhere, the room could not have been cleaned for weeks, and June,
      quick to catch at anything that should buoy up her hope, saw in it a sign
      that he had been obliged, for economy&rsquo;s sake, to give up his
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked into the bedroom; the bed was roughly made, as though by the
      hand of man. Listening intently, she darted in, and peered into his
      cupboards. A few shirts and collars, a pair of muddy boots&mdash;the room
      was bare even of garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stole back to the sitting-room, and now she noticed the absence of all
      the little things he had set store by. The clock that had been his mother&rsquo;s,
      the field-glasses that had hung over the sofa; two really valuable old
      prints of Harrow, where his father had been at school, and last, not
      least, the piece of Japanese pottery she herself had given him. All were
      gone; and in spite of the rage roused within her championing soul at the
      thought that the world should treat him thus, their disappearance augured
      happily for the success of her plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while looking at the spot where the piece of Japanese pottery had
      stood that she felt a strange certainty of being watched, and, turning,
      saw Irene in the open doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two stood gazing at each other for a minute in silence; then June
      walked forward and held out her hand. Irene did not take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her hand was refused, June put it behind her. Her eyes grew steady
      with anger; she waited for Irene to speak; and thus waiting, took in, with
      who-knows-what rage of jealousy, suspicion, and curiosity, every detail of
      her friend&rsquo;s face and dress and figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene was clothed in her long grey fur; the travelling cap on her head
      left a wave of gold hair visible above her forehead. The soft fullness of
      the coat made her face as small as a child&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike June&rsquo;s cheeks, her cheeks had no colour in them, but were
      ivory white and pinched as if with cold. Dark circles lay round her eyes.
      In one hand she held a bunch of violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked back at June, no smile on her lips; and with those great dark
      eyes fastened on her, the girl, for all her startled anger, felt something
      of the old spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke first, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you come for?&rdquo; But the feeling that she herself was
      being asked the same question, made her add: &ldquo;This horrible case. I
      came to tell him&mdash;he has lost it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene did not speak, her eyes never moved from June&rsquo;s face, and the
      girl cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand there as if you were made of stone!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene laughed: &ldquo;I wish to God I were!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But June turned away: &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      tell me! I don&rsquo;t want to hear! I don&rsquo;t want to hear what you&rsquo;ve
      come for. I don&rsquo;t want to hear!&rdquo; And like some uneasy spirit,
      she began swiftly walking to and fro. Suddenly she broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was here first. We can&rsquo;t both stay here together!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On Irene&rsquo;s face a smile wandered up, and died out like a flicker of
      firelight. She did not move. And then it was that June perceived under the
      softness and immobility of this figure something desperate and resolved;
      something not to be turned away, something dangerous. She tore off her
      hat, and, putting both hands to her brow, pressed back the bronze mass of
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right here!&rdquo; she cried defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene answered: &ldquo;I have no right anywhere!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have left Soames. You always wanted me to!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June put her hands over her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t want to hear anything&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      want to know anything. It&rsquo;s impossible to fight with you! What makes
      you stand like that? Why don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s lips moved; she seemed to be saying: &ldquo;Where should I
      go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June turned to the window. She could see the face of a clock down in the
      street. It was nearly four. At any moment he might come! She looked back
      across her shoulder, and her face was distorted with anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Irene had not moved; in her gloved hands she ceaselessly turned and
      twisted the little bunch of violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears of rage and disappointment rolled down June&rsquo;s cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you come?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have been a false
      friend to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Irene laughed. June saw that she had played a wrong card, and broke
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you come?&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve ruined my
      life, and now you want to ruin his!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Irene&rsquo;s mouth quivered; her eyes met June&rsquo;s with a look so
      mournful that the girl cried out in the midst of her sobbing, &ldquo;No,
      no!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Irene&rsquo;s head bent till it touched her breast. She turned, and
      went quickly out, hiding her lips with the little bunch of violets.
    </p>
    <p>
      June ran to the door. She heard the footsteps going down and down. She
      called out: &ldquo;Come back, Irene! Come back!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps died away....
    </p>
    <p>
      Bewildered and torn, the girl stood at the top of the stairs. Why had
      Irene gone, leaving her mistress of the field? What did it mean? Had she
      really given him up to her? Or had she...? And she was the prey of a
      gnawing uncertainty.... Bosinney did not come....
    </p>
    <p>
      About six o&rsquo;clock that afternoon old Jolyon returned from Wistaria
      Avenue, where now almost every day he spent some hours, and asked if his
      grand-daughter were upstairs. On being told that she had just come in, he
      sent up to her room to request her to come down and speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made up his mind to tell her that he was reconciled with her
      father. In future bygones must be bygones. He would no longer live alone,
      or practically alone, in this great house; he was going to give it up, and
      take one in the country for his son, where they could all go and live
      together. If June did not like this, she could have an allowance and live
      by herself. It wouldn&rsquo;t make much difference to her, for it was a
      long time since she had shown him any affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when June came down, her face was pinched and piteous; there was a
      strained, pathetic look in her eyes. She snuggled up in her old attitude
      on the arm of his chair, and what he said compared but poorly with the
      clear, authoritative, injured statement he had thought out with much care.
      His heart felt sore, as the great heart of a mother-bird feels sore when
      its youngling flies and bruises its wing. His words halted, as though he
      were apologizing for having at last deviated from the path of virtue, and
      succumbed, in defiance of sounder principles, to his more natural
      instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed nervous lest, in thus announcing his intentions, he should be
      setting his granddaughter a bad example; and now that he came to the
      point, his way of putting the suggestion that, if she didn&rsquo;t like
      it, she could live by herself and lump it, was delicate in the extreme.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if, by any chance, my darling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you found
      you didn&rsquo;t get on&mdash;with them, why, I could make that all right.
      You could have what you liked. We could find a little flat in London where
      you could set up, and I could be running to continually. But the children,&rdquo;
      he added, &ldquo;are dear little things!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the midst of this grave, rather transparent, explanation of
      changed policy, his eyes twinkled. &ldquo;This&rsquo;ll astonish Timothy&rsquo;s
      weak nerves. That precious young thing will have something to say about
      this, or I&rsquo;m a Dutchman!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June had not yet spoken. Perched thus on the arm of his chair, with her
      head above him, her face was invisible. But presently he felt her warm
      cheek against his own, and knew that, at all events, there was nothing
      very alarming in her attitude towards his news. He began to take courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll like your father,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;an
      amiable chap. Never was much push about him, but easy to get on with. You&rsquo;ll
      find him artistic and all that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And old Jolyon bethought him of the dozen or so water-colour drawings all
      carefully locked up in his bedroom; for now that his son was going to
      become a man of property he did not think them quite such poor things as
      heretofore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to your&mdash;your stepmother,&rdquo; he said, using the word
      with some little difficulty, &ldquo;I call her a refined woman&mdash;a bit
      of a Mrs. Gummidge, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder&mdash;but very fond of Jo.
      And the children,&rdquo; he repeated&mdash;indeed, this sentence ran like
      music through all his solemn self-justification&mdash;&ldquo;are sweet
      little things!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If June had known, those words but reincarnated that tender love for
      little children, for the young and weak, which in the past had made him
      desert his son for her tiny self, and now, as the cycle rolled, was taking
      him from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he began to get alarmed at her silence, and asked impatiently: &ldquo;Well,
      what do you say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June slid down to his knee, and she in her turn began her tale. She
      thought it would all go splendidly; she did not see any difficulty, and
      she did not care a bit what people thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon wriggled. H&rsquo;m! then people would think! He had thought
      that after all these years perhaps they wouldn&rsquo;t! Well, he couldn&rsquo;t
      help it! Nevertheless, he could not approve of his granddaughter&rsquo;s
      way of putting it&mdash;she ought to mind what people thought!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he said nothing. His feelings were too mixed, too inconsistent for
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;went on June&mdash;she did not care; what business was it of
      theirs? There was only one thing&mdash;and with her cheek pressing against
      his knee, old Jolyon knew at once that this something was no trifle: As he
      was going to buy a house in the country, would he not&mdash;to please her&mdash;buy
      that splendid house of Soames&rsquo; at Robin Hill? It was finished, it
      was perfectly beautiful, and no one would live in it now. They would all
      be so happy there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon was on the alert at once. Wasn&rsquo;t the &lsquo;man of
      property&rsquo; going to live in his new house, then? He never alluded to
      Soames now but under this title.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;June said&mdash;&ldquo;he was not; she knew that he
      was not!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How did she know?
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not tell him, but she knew. She knew nearly for certain! It was
      most unlikely; circumstances had changed! Irene&rsquo;s words still rang
      in her head: &ldquo;I have left Soames. Where should I go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she kept silence about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      If her grandfather would only buy it and settle that wretched claim that
      ought never to have been made on Phil! It would be the very best thing for
      everybody, and everything&mdash;everything might come straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And June put her lips to his forehead, and pressed them close.
    </p>
    <p>
      But old Jolyon freed himself from her caress, his face wore the judicial
      look which came upon it when he dealt with affairs. He asked: What did she
      mean? There was something behind all this&mdash;had she been seeing
      Bosinney?
    </p>
    <p>
      June answered: &ldquo;No; but I have been to his rooms.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been to his rooms? Who took you there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June faced him steadily. &ldquo;I went alone. He has lost that case. I don&rsquo;t
      care whether it was right or wrong. I want to help him; and I will!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon asked again: &ldquo;Have you seen him?&rdquo; His glance seemed
      to pierce right through the girl&rsquo;s eyes into her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again June answered: &ldquo;No; he was not there. I waited, but he did not
      come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon made a movement of relief. She had risen and looked down at
      him; so slight, and light, and young, but so fixed, and so determined; and
      disturbed, vexed, as he was, he could not frown away that fixed look. The
      feeling of being beaten, of the reins having slipped, of being old and
      tired, mastered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll get yourself into a
      mess one of these days, I can see. You want your own way in everything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Visited by one of his strange bursts of philosophy, he added: &ldquo;Like
      that you were born; and like that you&rsquo;ll stay until you die!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he, who in his dealings with men of business, with Boards, with
      Forsytes of all descriptions, with such as were not Forsytes, had always
      had his own way, looked at his indomitable grandchild sadly&mdash;for he
      felt in her that quality which above all others he unconsciously admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what they say is going on?&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      June crimsoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;no! I know&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      care!&rdquo; and she stamped her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said old Jolyon, dropping his eyes, &ldquo;that
      you&rsquo;d have him if he were dead!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence before he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as to buying this house&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
      talking about!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      June said that she did. She knew that he could get it if he wanted. He
      would only have to give what it cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What it cost! You know nothing about it. I won&rsquo;t go to Soames&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      have nothing more to do with that young man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you needn&rsquo;t; you can go to Uncle James. If you can&rsquo;t
      buy the house, will you pay his lawsuit claim? I know he is terribly hard
      up&mdash;I&rsquo;ve seen it. You can stop it out of my money!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A twinkle came into old Jolyon&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop it out of your money! A pretty way. And what will you do,
      pray, without your money?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But secretly, the idea of wresting the house from James and his son had
      begun to take hold of him. He had heard on Forsyte &lsquo;Change much
      comment, much rather doubtful praise of this house. It was &lsquo;too
      artistic,&rsquo; but a fine place. To take from the &lsquo;man of property&rsquo;
      that on which he had set his heart, would be a crowning triumph over
      James, practical proof that he was going to make a man of property of Jo,
      to put him back in his proper position, and there to keep him secure.
      Justice once for all on those who had chosen to regard his son as a poor,
      penniless outcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would see, he would see! It might be out of the question; he was not
      going to pay a fancy price, but if it could be done, why, perhaps he would
      do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      And still more secretly he knew that he could not refuse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not commit himself. He would think it over&mdash;he said to
      June.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;BOSINNEY&rsquo;S DEPARTURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon was not given to hasty decisions; it is probable that he would
      have continued to think over the purchase of the house at Robin Hill, had
      not June&rsquo;s face told him that he would have no peace until he acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast next morning she asked him what time she should order the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carriage!&rdquo; he said, with some appearance of innocence;
      &ldquo;what for? I&rsquo;m not going out!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t go early, you won&rsquo;t catch
      Uncle James before he goes into the City.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;James! what about your Uncle James?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house,&rdquo; she replied, in such a voice that he no longer
      pretended ignorance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not made up my mind,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must! You must! Oh! Gran&mdash;think of me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon grumbled out: &ldquo;Think of you&mdash;I&rsquo;m always
      thinking of you, but you don&rsquo;t think of yourself; you don&rsquo;t
      think what you&rsquo;re letting yourself in for. Well, order the carriage
      at ten!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter past he was placing his umbrella in the stand at Park Lane&mdash;he
      did not choose to relinquish his hat and coat; telling Warmson that he
      wanted to see his master, he went, without being announced, into the
      study, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      James was still in the dining-room talking to Soames, who had come round
      again before breakfast. On hearing who his visitor was, he muttered
      nervously: &ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s he want, I wonder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He then got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said to Soames, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you go doing
      anything in a hurry. The first thing is to find out where she is&mdash;I
      should go to Stainer&rsquo;s about it; they&rsquo;re the best men, if they
      can&rsquo;t find her, nobody can.&rdquo; And suddenly moved to strange
      softness, he muttered to himself, &ldquo;Poor little thing, I can&rsquo;t
      tell what she was thinking about!&rdquo; and went out blowing his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon did not rise on seeing his brother, but held out his hand, and
      exchanged with him the clasp of a Forsyte.
    </p>
    <p>
      James took another chair by the table, and leaned his head on his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how are you? We don&rsquo;t see much
      of you nowadays!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon paid no attention to the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Emily?&rdquo; he asked; and waiting for no reply, went
      on &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to see you about this affair of young Bosinney&rsquo;s.
      I&rsquo;m told that new house of his is a white elephant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about a white elephant,&rdquo; said
      James, &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;s lost his case, and I should say he&rsquo;ll
      go bankrupt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon was not slow to seize the opportunity this gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder a bit!&rdquo; he agreed; &ldquo;and if he
      goes bankrupt, the &lsquo;man of property&rsquo;&mdash;that is, Soames&rsquo;ll
      be out of pocket. Now, what I was thinking was this: If he&rsquo;s not
      going to live there....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing both surprise and suspicion in James&rsquo; eye, he quickly went
      on: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know anything; I suppose Irene&rsquo;s
      put her foot down&mdash;it&rsquo;s not material to me. But I&rsquo;m
      thinking of a house in the country myself, not too far from London, and if
      it suited me I don&rsquo;t say that I mightn&rsquo;t look at it, at a
      price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James listened to this statement with a strange mixture of doubt,
      suspicion, and relief, merging into a dread of something behind, and
      tinged with the remains of his old undoubted reliance upon his elder
      brother&rsquo;s good faith and judgment. There was anxiety, too, as to
      what old Jolyon could have heard and how he had heard it; and a sort of
      hopefulness arising from the thought that if June&rsquo;s connection with
      Bosinney were completely at an end, her grandfather would hardly seem
      anxious to help the young fellow. Altogether he was puzzled; as he did not
      like either to show this, or to commit himself in any way, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me you&rsquo;re altering your Will in favour of your son.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been told this; he had merely added the fact of having seen old
      Jolyon with his son and grandchildren to the fact that he had taken his
      Will away from Forsyte, Bustard and Forsyte. The shot went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; asked old Jolyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said James; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      remember names&mdash;I know somebody told me Soames spent a lot of money
      on this house; he&rsquo;s not likely to part with it except at a good
      price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said old Jolyon, &ldquo;if, he thinks I&rsquo;m going
      to pay a fancy price, he&rsquo;s mistaken. I&rsquo;ve not got the money to
      throw away that he seems to have. Let him try and sell it at a forced
      sale, and see what he&rsquo;ll get. It&rsquo;s not every man&rsquo;s
      house, I hear!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James, who was secretly also of this opinion, answered: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      a gentleman&rsquo;s house. Soames is here now if you&rsquo;d like to see
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said old Jolyon, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got as far as
      that; and I&rsquo;m not likely to, I can see that very well if I&rsquo;m
      met in this manner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      James was a little cowed; when it came to the actual figures of a
      commercial transaction he was sure of himself, for then he was dealing
      with facts, not with men; but preliminary negotiations such as these made
      him nervous&mdash;he never knew quite how far he could go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I know nothing about it. Soames, he
      tells me nothing; I should think he&rsquo;d entertain it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a question of price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said old Jolyon, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let him make a
      favour of it!&rdquo; He placed his hat on his head in dudgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened and Soames came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a policeman out here,&rdquo; he said with his half
      smile, &ldquo;for Uncle Jolyon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon looked at him angrily, and James said: &ldquo;A policeman? I
      don&rsquo;t know anything about a policeman. But I suppose you know
      something about him,&rdquo; he added to old Jolyon with a look of
      suspicion: &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d better see him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall an Inspector of Police stood stolidly regarding with
      heavy-lidded pale-blue eyes the fine old English furniture picked up by
      James at the famous Mavrojano sale in Portman Square. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      find my brother in there,&rdquo; said James.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector raised his fingers respectfully to his peaked cap, and
      entered the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      James saw him go in with a strange sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said to Soames, &ldquo;I suppose we must wait and
      see what he wants. Your uncle&rsquo;s been here about the house!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned with Soames into the dining-room, but could not rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what does he want?&rdquo; he murmured again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; replied Soames: &ldquo;the Inspector? They sent him
      round from Stanhope Gate, that&rsquo;s all I know. That &lsquo;nonconformist&rsquo;
      of Uncle Jolyon&rsquo;s has been pilfering, I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But in spite of his calmness, he too was ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of ten minutes old Jolyon came in. He walked up to the table,
      and stood there perfectly silent pulling at his long white moustaches.
      James gazed up at him with opening mouth; he had never seen his brother
      look like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon raised his hand, and said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Bosinney has been run over in the fog and killed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then standing above his brother and his nephew, and looking down at him
      with his deep eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s&mdash;some&mdash;talk&mdash;of&mdash;suicide,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      James&rsquo; jaw dropped. &ldquo;Suicide! What should he do that for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon answered sternly: &ldquo;God knows, if you and your son don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But James did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all men of great age, even for all Forsytes, life has had bitter
      experiences. The passer-by, who sees them wrapped in cloaks of custom,
      wealth, and comfort, would never suspect that such black shadows had
      fallen on their roads. To every man of great age&mdash;to Sir Walter
      Bentham himself&mdash;the idea of suicide has once at least been present
      in the ante-room of his soul; on the threshold, waiting to enter, held out
      from the inmost chamber by some chance reality, some vague fear, some
      painful hope. To Forsytes that final renunciation of property is hard. Oh!
      it is hard! Seldom&mdash;perhaps never&mdash;can they achieve, it; and
      yet, how near have they not sometimes been!
    </p>
    <p>
      So even with James! Then in the medley of his thoughts, he broke out:
      &ldquo;Why I saw it in the paper yesterday: &lsquo;Run over in the fog!&rsquo;
      They didn&rsquo;t know his name!&rdquo; He turned from one face to the
      other in his confusion of soul; but instinctively all the time he was
      rejecting that rumour of suicide. He dared not entertain this thought, so
      against his interest, against the interest of his son, of every Forsyte.
      He strove against it; and as his nature ever unconsciously rejected that
      which it could not with safety accept, so gradually he overcame this fear.
      It was an accident! It must have been!
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon broke in on his reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death was instantaneous. He lay all day yesterday at the hospital.
      There was nothing to tell them who he was. I am going there now; you and
      your son had better come too.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No one opposing this command he led the way from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was still and clear and bright, and driving over to Park Lane from
      Stanhope Gate, old Jolyon had had the carriage open. Sitting back on the
      padded cushions, finishing his cigar, he had noticed with pleasure the
      keen crispness of the air, the bustle of the cabs and people; the strange,
      almost Parisian, alacrity that the first fine day will bring into London
      streets after a spell of fog or rain. And he had felt so happy; he had not
      felt like it for months. His confession to June was off his mind; he had
      the prospect of his son&rsquo;s, above all, of his grandchildren&rsquo;s
      company in the future&mdash;(he had appointed to meet young Jolyon at the
      Hotch Potch that very manning to&mdash;discuss it again); and there was
      the pleasurable excitement of a coming encounter, a coming victory, over
      James and the &lsquo;man of property&rsquo; in the matter of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the carriage closed now; he had no heart to look on gaiety; nor was
      it right that Forsytes should be seen driving with an Inspector of Police.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that carriage the Inspector spoke again of the death:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not so very thick&mdash;Just there. The driver says the
      gentleman must have had time to see what he was about, he seemed to walk
      right into it. It appears that he was very hard up, we found several pawn
      tickets at his rooms, his account at the bank is overdrawn, and there&rsquo;s
      this case in to-day&rsquo;s papers;&rdquo; his cold blue eyes travelled
      from one to another of the three Forsytes in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon watching from his corner saw his brother&rsquo;s face change,
      and the brooding, worried, look deepen on it. At the Inspector&rsquo;s
      words, indeed, all James&rsquo; doubts and fears revived. Hard-up&mdash;pawn-tickets&mdash;an
      overdrawn account! These words that had all his life been a far-off
      nightmare to him, seemed to make uncannily real that suspicion of suicide
      which must on no account be entertained. He sought his son&rsquo;s eye;
      but lynx-eyed, taciturn, immovable, Soames gave no answering look. And to
      old Jolyon watching, divining the league of mutual defence between them,
      there came an overmastering desire to have his own son at his side, as
      though this visit to the dead man&rsquo;s body was a battle in which
      otherwise he must single-handed meet those two. And the thought of how to
      keep June&rsquo;s name out of the business kept whirring in his brain.
      James had his son to support him! Why should he not send for Jo?
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking out his card-case, he pencilled the following message:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come round at once. I&rsquo;ve sent the carriage for you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      On getting out he gave this card to his coachman, telling him to drive&mdash;as
      fast as possible to the Hotch Potch Club, and if Mr. Jolyon Forsyte were
      there to give him the card and bring him at once. If not there yet, he was
      to wait till he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed the others slowly up the steps, leaning on his umbrella, and
      stood a moment to get his breath. The Inspector said: &ldquo;This is the
      mortuary, sir. But take your time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bare, white-walled room, empty of all but a streak of sunshine
      smeared along the dustless floor, lay a form covered by a sheet. With a
      huge steady hand the Inspector took the hem and turned it back. A
      sightless face gazed up at them, and on either side of that sightless
      defiant face the three Forsytes gazed down; in each one of them the secret
      emotions, fears, and pity of his own nature rose and fell like the rising,
      falling waves of life, whose wash those white walls barred out now for
      ever from Bosinney. And in each one of them the trend of his nature, the
      odd essential spring, which moved him in fashions minutely, unalterably
      different from those of every other human being, forced him to a different
      attitude of thought. Far from the others, yet inscrutably close, each
      stood thus, alone with death, silent, his eyes lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector asked softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You identify the gentleman, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon raised his head and nodded. He looked at his brother opposite,
      at that long lean figure brooding over the dead man, with face dusky red,
      and strained grey eyes; and at the figure of Soames white and still by his
      father&rsquo;s side. And all that he had felt against those two was gone
      like smoke in the long white presence of Death. Whence comes it, how comes
      it&mdash;Death? Sudden reverse of all that goes before; blind setting
      forth on a path that leads to where? Dark quenching of the fire! The
      heavy, brutal crushing&mdash;out that all men must go through, keeping
      their eyes clear and brave unto the end! Small and of no import, insects
      though they are! And across old Jolyon&rsquo;s face there flitted a gleam,
      for Soames, murmuring to the Inspector, crept noiselessly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly James raised his eyes. There was a queer appeal in that
      suspicious troubled look: &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m no match for you,&rdquo;
      it seemed to say. And, hunting for handkerchief he wiped his brow; then,
      bending sorrowful and lank over the dead man, he too turned and hurried
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jolyon stood, still as death, his eyes fixed on the body. Who shall
      tell of what he was thinking? Of himself, when his hair was brown like the
      hair of that young fellow dead before him? Of himself, with his battle
      just beginning, the long, long battle he had loved; the battle that was
      over for this young man almost before it had begun? Of his grand-daughter,
      with her broken hopes? Of that other woman? Of the strangeness, and the
      pity of it? And the irony, inscrutable, and bitter of that end? Justice!
      There was no justice for men, for they were ever in the dark!
    </p>
    <p>
      Or perhaps in his philosophy he thought: Better to be out of, it all!
      Better to have done with it, like this poor youth....
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one touched him on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tear started up and wetted his eyelash. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good here. I&rsquo;d better be going. You&rsquo;ll
      come to me as soon as you can, Jo,&rdquo; and with his head bowed he went
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was young Jolyon&rsquo;s turn to take his stand beside the dead man,
      round whose fallen body he seemed to see all the Forsytes breathless, and
      prostrated. The stroke had fallen too swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forces underlying every tragedy&mdash;forces that take no denial,
      working through cross currents to their ironical end, had met and fused
      with a thunder-clap, flung out the victim, and flattened to the ground all
      those that stood around.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or so at all events young Jolyon seemed to see them, lying around Bosinney&rsquo;s
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked the Inspector to tell him what had happened, and the latter, like
      a man who does not every day get such a chance, again detailed such facts
      as were known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more here, sir, however,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than
      meets the eye. I don&rsquo;t believe in suicide, nor in pure accident,
      myself. It&rsquo;s more likely I think that he was suffering under great
      stress of mind, and took no notice of things about him. Perhaps you can
      throw some light on these.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took from his pocket a little packet and laid it on the table.
      Carefully undoing it, he revealed a lady&rsquo;s handkerchief, pinned
      through the folds with a pin of discoloured Venetian gold, the stone of
      which had fallen from the socket. A scent of dried violets rose to young
      Jolyon&rsquo;s nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Found in his breast pocket,&rdquo; said the Inspector; &ldquo;the
      name has been cut away!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon with difficulty answered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I cannot
      help you!&rdquo; But vividly there rose before him the face he had seen
      light up, so tremulous and glad, at Bosinney&rsquo;s coming! Of her he
      thought more than of his own daughter, more than of them all&mdash;of her
      with the dark, soft glance, the delicate passive face, waiting for the
      dead man, waiting even at that moment, perhaps, still and patient in the
      sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked sorrowfully away from the hospital towards his father&rsquo;s
      house, reflecting that this death would break up the Forsyte family. The
      stroke had indeed slipped past their defences into the very wood of their
      tree. They might flourish to all appearance as before, preserving a brave
      show before the eyes of London, but the trunk was dead, withered by the
      same flash that had stricken down Bosinney. And now the saplings would
      take its place, each one a new custodian of the sense of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good forest of Forsytes! thought young Jolyon&mdash;soundest timber of our
      land!
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the cause of this death&mdash;his family would doubtless reject
      with vigour the suspicion of suicide, which was so compromising! They
      would take it as an accident, a stroke of fate. In their hearts they would
      even feel it an intervention of Providence, a retribution&mdash;had not
      Bosinney endangered their two most priceless possessions, the pocket and
      the hearth? And they would talk of &lsquo;that unfortunate accident of
      young Bosinney&rsquo;s,&rsquo; but perhaps they would not talk&mdash;silence
      might be better!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for himself, he regarded the bus-driver&rsquo;s account of the accident
      as of very little value. For no one so madly in love committed suicide for
      want of money; nor was Bosinney the sort of fellow to set much store by a
      financial crisis. And so he too, rejected this theory of suicide, the dead
      man&rsquo;s face rose too clearly before him. Gone in the heyday of his
      summer&mdash;and to believe thus that an accident had cut Bosinney off in
      the full sweep of his passion was more than ever pitiful to young Jolyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a vision of Soames&rsquo; home as it now was, and must be
      hereafter. The streak of lightning had flashed its clear uncanny gleam on
      bare bones with grinning spaces between, the disguising flesh was gone....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dining-room at Stanhope Gate old Jolyon was sitting alone when his
      son came in. He looked very wan in his great armchair. And his eyes
      travelling round the walls with their pictures of still life, and the
      masterpiece &lsquo;Dutch fishing-boats at Sunset&rsquo; seemed as though
      passing their gaze over his life with its hopes, its gains, its
      achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Jo!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that you? I&rsquo;ve told poor
      little June. But that&rsquo;s not all of it. Are you going to Soames&rsquo;.
      She&rsquo;s brought it on herself, I suppose; but somehow I can&rsquo;t
      bear to think of her, shut up there&mdash;and all alone.&rdquo; And
      holding up his thin, veined hand, he clenched it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;IRENE&rsquo;S RETURN
    </h2>
    <p>
      After leaving James and old Jolyon in the mortuary of the hospital, Soames
      hurried aimlessly along the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tragic event of Bosinney&rsquo;s death altered the complexion of
      everything. There was no longer the same feeling that to lose a minute
      would be fatal, nor would he now risk communicating the fact of his wife&rsquo;s
      flight to anyone till the inquest was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      That morning he had risen early, before the postman came, had taken the
      first-post letters from the box himself, and, though there had been none
      from Irene, he had made an opportunity of telling Bilson that her mistress
      was at the sea; he would probably, he said, be going down himself from
      Saturday to Monday. This had given him time to breathe, time to leave no
      stone unturned to find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, cut off from taking steps by Bosinney&rsquo;s death&mdash;that
      strange death, to think of which was like putting a hot iron to his heart,
      like lifting a great weight from it&mdash;he did not know how to pass his
      day; and he wandered here and there through the streets, looking at every
      face he met, devoured by a hundred anxieties.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he wandered, he thought of him who had finished his wandering, his
      prowling, and would never haunt his house again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already in the afternoon he passed posters announcing the identity of the
      dead man, and bought the papers to see what they said. He would stop their
      mouths if he could, and he went into the City, and was closeted with
      Boulter for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way home, passing the steps of Jobson&rsquo;s about half past four,
      he met George Forsyte, who held out an evening paper to Soames, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! Have you seen this about the poor Buccaneer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames answered stonily: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      George stared at him. He had never liked Soames; he now held him
      responsible for Bosinney&rsquo;s death. Soames had done for him&mdash;done
      for him by that act of property that had sent the Buccaneer to run amok
      that fatal afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The poor fellow,&rsquo; he was thinking, &lsquo;was so cracked with
      jealousy, so cracked for his vengeance, that he heard nothing of the
      omnibus in that infernal fog.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames had done for him! And this judgment was in George&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They talk of suicide here,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;That cat
      won&rsquo;t jump.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames shook his head. &ldquo;An accident,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clenching his fist on the paper, George crammed it into his pocket. He
      could not resist a parting shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;mm! All flourishing at home? Any little Soameses yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a face as white as the steps of Jobson&rsquo;s, and a lip raised as
      if snarling, Soames brushed past him and was gone....
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching home, and entering the little lighted hall with his latchkey,
      the first thing that caught his eye was his wife&rsquo;s gold-mounted
      umbrella lying on the rug chest. Flinging off his fur coat, he hurried to
      the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtains were drawn for the night, a bright fire of cedar-logs burned
      in the grate, and by its light he saw Irene sitting in her usual corner on
      the sofa. He shut the door softly, and went towards her. She did not move,
      and did not seem to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come back?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why are you
      sitting here in the dark?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he caught sight of her face, so white and motionless that it seemed
      as though the blood must have stopped flowing in her veins; and her eyes,
      that looked enormous, like the great, wide, startled brown eyes of an owl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions, she had a strange
      resemblance to a captive owl, bunched in its soft feathers against the
      wires of a cage. The supple erectness of her figure was gone, as though
      she had been broken by cruel exercise; as though there were no longer any
      reason for being beautiful, and supple, and erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come back,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She never looked up, and never spoke, the firelight playing over her
      motionless figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she tried to rise, but he prevented her; it was then that he
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come back like an animal wounded to death, not knowing where to
      turn, not knowing what she was doing. The sight of her figure, huddled in
      the fur, was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew then for certain that Bosinney had been her lover; knew that she
      had seen the report of his death&mdash;perhaps, like himself, had bought a
      paper at the draughty corner of a street, and read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had come back then of her own accord, to the cage she had pined to be
      free of&mdash;and taking in all the tremendous significance of this, he
      longed to cry: &ldquo;Take your hated body, that I love, out of my house!
      Take away that pitiful white face, so cruel and soft&mdash;before I crush
      it. Get out of my sight; never let me see you again!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, at those unspoken words, he seemed to see her rise and move away,
      like a woman in a terrible dream, from which she was fighting to awake&mdash;rise
      and go out into the dark and cold, without a thought of him, without so
      much as the knowledge of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he cried, contradicting what he had not yet spoken, &ldquo;No; stay
      there!&rdquo; And turning away from her, he sat down in his accustomed
      chair on the other side of the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Soames thought: &lsquo;Why is all this? Why should I suffer so? What
      have I done? It is not my fault!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he looked at her, huddled like a bird that is shot and dying, whose
      poor breast you see panting as the air is taken from it, whose poor eyes
      look at you who have shot it, with a slow, soft, unseeing look, taking
      farewell of all that is good&mdash;of the sun, and the air, and its mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sat, by the firelight, in the silence, one on each side of the
      hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the fume of the burning cedar logs, that he loved so well, seemed to
      grip Soames by the throat till he could bear it no longer. And going out
      into the hall he flung the door wide, to gulp down the cold air that came
      in; then without hat or overcoat went out into the Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the garden rails a half-starved cat came rubbing her way towards
      him, and Soames thought: &lsquo;Suffering! when will it cease, my
      suffering?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At a front door across the way was a man of his acquaintance named Rutter,
      scraping his boots, with an air of &lsquo;I am master here.&rsquo; And
      Soames walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      From far in the clear air the bells of the church where he and Irene had
      been married were pealing in &lsquo;practice&rsquo; for the advent of
      Christ, the chimes ringing out above the sound of traffic. He felt a
      craving for strong drink, to lull him to indifference, or rouse him to
      fury. If only he could burst out of himself, out of this web that for the
      first time in his life he felt around him. If only he could surrender to
      the thought: &lsquo;Divorce her&mdash;turn her out! She has forgotten you.
      Forget her!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If only he could surrender to the thought: &lsquo;Let her go&mdash;she has
      suffered enough!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If only he could surrender to the desire: &lsquo;Make a slave of her&mdash;she
      is in your power!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If only even he could surrender to the sudden vision: &lsquo;What does it
      all matter?&rsquo; Forget himself for a minute, forget that it mattered
      what he did, forget that whatever he did he must sacrifice something.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only he could act on an impulse!
    </p>
    <p>
      He could forget nothing; surrender to no thought, vision, or desire; it
      was all too serious; too close around him, an unbreakable cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the far side of the Square newspaper boys were calling their evening
      wares, and the ghoulish cries mingled and jangled with the sound of those
      church bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames covered his ears. The thought flashed across him that but for a
      chance, he himself, and not Bosinney, might be lying dead, and she,
      instead of crouching there like a shot bird with those dying eyes....
    </p>
    <p>
      Something soft touched his legs, the cat was rubbing herself against them.
      And a sob that shook him from head to foot burst from Soames&rsquo; chest.
      Then all was still again in the dark, where the houses seemed to stare at
      him, each with a master and mistress of its own, and a secret story of
      happiness or sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he saw that his own door was open, and black against the
      light from the hall a man standing with his back turned. Something slid
      too in his breast, and he stole up close behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see his own fur coat flung across the carved oak chair; the
      Persian rugs; the silver bowls, the rows of porcelain plates arranged
      along the walls, and this unknown man who was standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And sharply he asked: &ldquo;What is it you want, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor turned. It was young Jolyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door was open,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Might I see your wife for
      a minute, I have a message for her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames gave him a strange, sidelong stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife can see no one,&rdquo; he muttered doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon answered gently: &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t keep her a minute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames brushed by him and barred the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can see no one,&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Jolyon&rsquo;s glance shot past him into the hall, and Soames
      turned. There in the drawing-room doorway stood Irene, her eyes were wild
      and eager, her lips were parted, her hands outstretched. In the sight of
      both men that light vanished from her face; her hands dropped to her
      sides; she stood like stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soames spun round, and met his visitor&rsquo;s eyes, and at the look he
      saw in them, a sound like a snarl escaped him. He drew his lips back in
      the ghost of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my house,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I manage my own affairs. I&rsquo;ve
      told you once&mdash;I tell you again; we are not at home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And in young Jolyon&rsquo;s face he slammed the door.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
