    <h2>
      ACT I
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The time is morning, and the scene a level lawn, beyond which the river
        is running amongst fields. A huge old beech tree overshadows everything,
        in the darkness of whose hollow many things are hidden. A rustic seat
        encircles it. A low wall clothed in creepers, with two openings, divides
        this lawn from the flowery approaches to the house. Close to the wall
        there is a swing. The sky is clear and sunny. COLONEL HOPE is seated in
        a garden-chair, reading a newspaper through pince-nez. He is fifty-five
        and bald, with drooping grey moustaches and a weather-darkened face. He
        wears a flannel suit and a hat from Panama; a tennis racquet leans
        against his chair. MRS. HOPE comes quickly through the opening of the
        wall, with roses in her hands. She is going grey; she wears tan
        gauntlets, and no hat. Her manner is decided, her voice emphatic, as
        though aware that there is no nonsense in its owner's composition.
        Screened from sight, MISS BEECH is seated behind the hollow tree; and
        JOY is perched on a lower branch hidden by foliage.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. I told Molly in my letter that she'd have to walk up, Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Walk up in this heat? My dear, why didn't you order Benson's fly?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Expense for nothing! Bob can bring up her things in the barrow.
      I've told Joy I won't have her going down to meet the train. She's so
      excited about her mother's coming there's no doing anything with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. No wonder, after two months.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Well, she's going home to-morrow; she must just keep herself
      fresh for the dancing tonight. I'm not going to get people in to dance,
      and have Joy worn out before they begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Dropping his paper.] I don't like Molly's walking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. A great strong woman like Molly Gwyn! It isn't half a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. I don't like it, Nell; it's not hospitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Rubbish! If you want to throw away money, you must just find
      some better investment than those wretched 3 per cents. of yours. The
      greenflies are in my roses already! Did you ever see anything so
      disgusting? [They bend over the roses they have grown, and lose all sense
      of everything.] Where's the syringe? I saw you mooning about with it last
      night, Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Uneasily.] Mooning!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He retires behind his paper. MRS. HOPE enters the hollow of the tree.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There's an account of that West Australian swindle. Set of ruffians!
      Listen to this, Nell! "It is understood that amongst the share-holders are
      large numbers of women, clergymen, and Army officers." How people can be
      such fools!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Becoming aware that his absorption is unobserved, he drops his glasses,
        and reverses his chair towards the tree.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. [Reappearing with a garden syringe.] I simply won't have Dick
      keep his fishing things in the tree; there's a whole potful of disgusting
      worms. I can't touch them. You must go and take 'em out, Tom.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [In his turn the COLONEL enters the hollow of the tree.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. [Personally.] What on earth's the pleasure of it? I can't see!
      He never catches anything worth eating.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The COLONEL reappears with a paint pot full of worms; he holds them out
        abstractedly.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. [Jumping.] Don't put them near me!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [From behind the tree.] Don't hurt the poor creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Turning.] Hallo, Peachey? What are you doing round there?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He puts the worms down on the seat.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Tom, take the worms off that seat at once!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Somewhat flurried.] Good gad! I don't know what to do with the
      beastly worms!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. It's not my business to look after Dick's worms. Don't put them
      on the ground. I won't have them anywhere where they can crawl about. [She
      flicks some greenflies off her roses.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Looking into the pot as though the worms could tell him where to
      put them.] Dash!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Give them to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. [Relieved.] Yes, give them to Peachey.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [There comes from round the tree Miss BEECH, old-fashioned,
        barrel-shaped, balloony in the skirts. She takes the paint pot, and sits
        beside it on the rustic seat.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Poor creatures!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Well, it's beyond me how you can make pets of worms&mdash;
      wriggling, crawling, horrible things!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ROSE, who is young and comely, in a pale print frock, comes from the
        house and places letters before her on a silver salver.] [Taking the
        letters.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      What about Miss joy's frock, Rose?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROSE. Please, 'm, I can't get on with the back without Miss Joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Well, then you must just find her. I don't know where she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROSE. [In a slow, sidelong manner.] If you please, Mum, I think Miss Joy's
      up in the&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She stops, seeing Miss BEECH signing to her with both hands.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. [Sharply.] What is it, Peachey?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Selecting a finger.] Pricked meself!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Let's look!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She bends to look, but Miss BEECH places the finger in her mouth.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ROSE. [Glancing askance at the COLONEL.] If you please, Mum, it's below
      the waist; I think I can manage with the dummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Well, you can try. [Opening her letter as ROSE retires.] Here's
      Molly about her train.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Is there a letter for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. No, Peachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. There never is.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. What's that? You got four by the first post.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Exceptions!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Looking over his glasses.] Why! You know, you get 'em every day!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Molly says she'll be down by the eleven thirty. [In an injured
      voice.] She'll be here in half an hour! [Reading with disapproval from the
      letter.] "MAURICE LEVER is coming down by the same train to see Mr. Henty
      about the Tocopala Gold Mine. Could you give him a bed for the night?"
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Silence, slight but ominous.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Calling into his aid his sacred hospitality.] Of course we must
      give him a bed!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Just like a man! What room I should like to know!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. As if Molly wouldn't have the pink!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Ruefully.] I thought she'd have the blue!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. You know perfectly well it's full of earwigs, Tom. I killed ten
      there yesterday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Poor creatures!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. I don't know that I approve of this Mr. Lever's dancing
      attendance. Molly's only thirty-six.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [In a high voice.] You can't refuse him a bed; I never heard of
      such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. [Reading from the letter.] "This gold mine seems to be a
      splendid chance. [She glances at the COLONEL.] I've put all my spare cash
      into it. They're issuing some Preference shares now; if Uncle Tom wants an
      investment"&mdash;[She pauses, then in a changed, decided voice ]&mdash;Well,
      I suppose I shall have to screw him in somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. What's that about gold mines? Gambling nonsense! Molly ought to
      know my views.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. [Folding the letter away out of her consciousness.] Oh! your
      views! This may be a specially good chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Ahem! Special case!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. [Paying no attention.] I 'm sick of these 3 per cent.
      dividends. When you've only got so little money, to put it all into that
      India Stock, when it might be earning 6 per cent. at least, quite safely!
      There are ever so many things I want.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. There you go!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. As to Molly, I think it's high time her husband came home to
      look after her, instead of sticking out there in that hot place. In fact&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Miss BEECH looks up at the tree and exhibits cerebral excitement]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I don't know what Geoff's about; why doesn't he find something in England,
      where they could live together.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Don't say anything against Molly, Nell!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Well, I don't believe in husband and wife being separated.
      That's not my idea of married life.

    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Ouch! [She sucks her finger.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Well, if I couldn't sew at your age, Peachey, without pricking
      my fingers! Tom, if I have Mr. Lever here, you'll just attend to what I
      say and look into that mine!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Look into your grandmother! I have n't made a study of geology
      for nothing. For every ounce you take out of a gold mine, you put an ounce
      and a half in. Any fool knows that, eh, Peachey?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. I hate your horrid mines, with all the poor creatures
      underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Nonsense, Peachey! As if they'd go there if they did n't want
      to!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Why don't you read your paper, then you'd see what a lot of
      wild-cat things there are about.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. [Abstractedly.] I can't put Ernest and Letty in the blue room,
      there's only the single bed. Suppose I put Mr. Lever there, and say
      nothing about the earwigs. I daresay he'll never notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Treat a guest like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Then where am I to put him for goodness sake?
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Put him in my dressing-room, I'll turn out.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Rubbish, Tom, I won't have you turned out, that's flat. He can
      have Joy's room, and she can sleep with the earwigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [From her hiding-place upon a lower branch of the hollow tree.] I
      won't.

      MRS. HOPE. You wretched girl! I told you never to climb that tree again.
      Did you know, Peachey? [Miss BEECH smiles.] She's always up there,
      spoiling all her frocks. Come down now, Joy; there's a good child!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. I don't want to sleep with earwigs, Aunt Nell.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. I'll sleep with the poor creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE, [After a pause.] Well, it would be a mercy if you would for
      once, Peachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Nonsense, I won't have Peachey&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Well, who is to sleep there then?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Coaxingly.] Let me sleep with Mother, Aunt Nell, do!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. Litter her up with a great girl like you, as if we'd only one
      spare room! Tom, see that she comes down&mdash;I can't stay here, I must
      manage something. [She goes away towards the house.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Moving to the tree, and looking up.] You heard what your aunt
      said?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Softly.] Oh, Uncle Tom!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. I shall have to come up after you.

    <p>
      JOY. Oh, do, and Peachey too!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Trying to restrain a smile.] Peachey, you talk to her. [Without
      waiting for MISS BEECH, however, he proceeds.] What'll your aunt say to me
      if I don't get you down?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Poor creature!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. I don't want to be worried about my frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Scratching his bald head.] Well, I shall catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. Oh, Uncle Tom, your head is so beautiful from here! [Leaning over,
      she fans it with a leafy twig.]

    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Disrespectful little toad!
    </p>
    <p>

        you Mother's governess.

    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Oh! yes, I was.

    <p>
      JOY. Fonder than of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Don't you ask such a lot of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. Peachey, duckie, what was Mother's worst fault?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Doing what she knew she oughtn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. Was she ever sorry?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Yes, but she always went on doin' it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. I think being sorry 's stupid!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Oh, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. It isn't any good. Was Mother revengeful, like me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Ah! Wasn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. And jealous?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. The most jealous girl I ever saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Nodding.] I like to be like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Regarding her intently.] Yes! you've got all your troubles
      before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. Mother was married at eighteen, wasn't she, Peachey? Was she&mdash;
      was she much in love with Father then?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [With a sniff.] About as much as usual. [She takes the paint
      pot, and walking round begins to release the worms.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Indifferently.] They don't get on now, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. What d'you mean by that, disrespectful little creature?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [In a hard voice.] They haven't ever since I've known them. MISS
      BEECH. [Looks at her, and turns away again.] Don't talk about such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. I suppose you don't know Mr. Lever? [Bitterly.] He's such a cool
      beast. He never loses his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Is that why you don't like him?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Frowning.] No&mdash;yes&mdash;I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Oh! perhaps you do like him?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. I don't; I hate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Standing still.] Fie! Naughty Temper!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. Well, so would you! He takes up all Mother's time.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [In a peculiar voice.] Oh! does he?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. When he comes I might just as well go to bed. [Passionately.] And now
      he's chosen to-day to come down here, when I haven't seen her for two
      months! Why couldn't he come when Mother and I'd gone home. It's simply
      brutal!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. But your mother likes him?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Sullenly.] I don't want her to like him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [With a long look at Joy.] I see!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. What are you doing, Peachey?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Releasing a worm.] Letting the poor creatures go.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. If I tell Dick he'll never forgive you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Sidling behind the swing and plucking off Joy's sunbonnet.
      With devilry.] Ah-h-h! You've done your hair up; so that's why you
      wouldn't come down!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Springing up, anal pouting.] I didn't want any one to see before
      Mother. You are a pig, Peachey!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. I thought there was something!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Twisting round.] How does it look?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. I've seen better.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. You tell any one before Mother comes, and see what I do!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Well, don't you tell about my worms, then!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. Give me my hat! [Backing hastily towards the tree, and putting her
      finger to her lips.] Look out! Dick!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Oh! dear!

      behind Joy.

      manage the hind leg off a donkey; but if I want five shillings for a
      charity or what not, I have to whistle for it. And then all of a sudden,
      Molly, she'll take it into her head to spend goodness knows what on some
      trumpery or other and come to me for the money. If I have n't got it to
      give her, out she flies about 3 per cent., and worries me to invest in
      some wild-cat or other, like your friend's thing, the Jaco what is it? I

    <p>
      COLONEL. Did n't Joy come and tell you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. I don't know what's the matter with that child? Well, Molly, so
      here you are. You're before your time&mdash;that train's always late.

    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. What have you done with Mr. Lever? I shall have to put him in
      Peachey's room. Tom's got no champagne.

      put yourself out! I'm sorry I suggested his coming.

    <p>
      COLONEL. My dear, we ought to have champagne in the house&mdash;in case of
      accident.

    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Shaking him gently by the coat.] No, please, Uncle Tom!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. [Suddenly.] Now, I've told your uncle, Molly, that he's not to
      go in for this gold mine without making certain it's a good thing. Mind, I
      think you've been very rash. I'm going to give you a good talking to; and
      that's not all&mdash;you ought n't to go about like this with a young man;
      he's not at all bad looking. I remember him perfectly well at the
      Fleming's dance.

      ACT II
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is afternoon, and at a garden-table placed beneath the hollow tree,
        the COLONEL is poring over plans. Astride of a garden-chair, LEVER is
        smoking cigarettes. DICK is hanging Chinese lanterns to the hollow tree.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LEVER. Of course, if this level [pointing with his cigarette] peters out
      to the West we shall be in a tightish place; you know what a mine is at
      this stage, Colonel Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Absently.] Yes, yes. [Tracing a line.] What is there to prevent
      its running out here to the East?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. Well, nothing, except that as a matter of fact it doesn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [With some excitement.] I'm very glad you showed me these papers,
      very glad! I say that it's a most astonishing thing if the ore suddenly
      stops there. [A gleam of humour visits LEVER'S face.] I'm not an expert,
      but you ought to prove that ground to the East more thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Quizzically.] Of course, sir, if you advise that&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. If it were mine, I'd no more sit down under the belief that the
      ore stopped there than I 'd&mdash;-There's a harmony in these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      NEVER. I can only tell you what our experts say.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Ah! Experts! No faith in them&mdash;never had! Miners, lawyers,
      theologians, cowardly lot&mdash;pays them to be cowardly. When they have
      n't their own axes to grind, they've got their theories; a theory's a
      dangerous thing. [He loses himself in contemplation of the papers.] Now my
      theory is, you 're in strata here of what we call the Triassic Age.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Smiling faintly.] Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. You've struck a fault, that's what's happened. The ore may be as
      much as thirty or forty yards out; but it 's there, depend on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. Would you back that opinion, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [With dignity.] I never give an opinion that I'm not prepared to
      back. I want to get to the bottom of this. What's to prevent the gold
      going down indefinitely?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. Nothing, so far as I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [With suspicion.] Eh!
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. All I can tell you is: This is as far as we've got, and we want
      more money before we can get any farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Absently.] Yes, yes; that's very usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. If you ask my personal opinion I think it's very doubtful that the
      gold does go down.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Smiling.] Oh! a personal opinion a matter of this sort!
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [As though about to take the papers.] Perhaps we'd better close the
      sitting, sir; sorry to have bored you.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Now, now! Don't be so touchy! If I'm to put money in, I'm bound
      to look at it all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [With lifted brows.] Please don't imagine that I want you to put
      money in.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Confound it, sir! D 'you suppose I take you for a Company
      promoter?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. Thank you!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Looking at him doubtfully.] You've got Irish blood in you&mdash;um?
      You're so hasty!
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. If you 're really thinking of taking shares&mdash;my advice to you
      is, don't!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Regretfully.] If this were an ordinary gold mine, I wouldn't
      dream of looking at it, I want you to understand that. Nobody has a
      greater objection to gold mines than I.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Looks down at his host with half-closed eyes.] But it is a gold
      mine, Colonel Hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. I know, I know; but I 've been into it for myself; I've formed my
      opinion personally. Now, what 's the reason you don't want me to invest?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. Well, if it doesn't turn out as you expect, you'll say it's my
      doing. I know what investors are.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Dubiously.] If it were a Westralian or a Kaffir I would n't
      touch it with a pair of tongs! It 's not as if I were going to put much
      in! [He suddenly bends above the papers as though magnetically attracted.]
      I like these Triassic formations!

    <p>
      LEVER. [Looking after him.] That young man seems depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [As though remembering his principles.] I don't like mines, never
      have! [Suddenly absorbed again.] I tell you what, Lever&mdash;this thing's
      got tremendous possibilities. You don't seem to believe in it enough. No
      mine's any good without faith; until I see for myself, however, I shan't
      commit myself beyond a thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. Are you serious, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Certainly! I've been thinking it over ever since you told me
      Henty had fought shy. I 've a poor opinion of Henty. He's one of those
      fellows that says one thing and does another. An opportunist!
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Slowly.] I'm afraid we're all that, more or less. [He sits beneath
      the hollow tree.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. A man never knows what he is himself. There 's my wife. She
      thinks she 's&mdash;&mdash;By the way, don't say anything to her about
      this, please. And, Lever [nervously], I don't think, you know, this is
      quite the sort of thing for my niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Quietly.] I agree. I mean to get her out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [A little taken aback.] Ah! You know, she&mdash;she's in a very
      delicate position, living by herself in London. [LEVER looks at him
      ironically.] You [very nervously] see a good deal of her? If it had n't
      been for Joy growing so fast, we shouldn't have had the child down here.
      Her mother ought to have her with her. Eh! Don't you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Forcing a smile.] Mrs. Gwyn always seems to me to get on all
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [As though making a discovery.] You know, I've found that when a
      woman's living alone and unprotected, the very least thing will set a lot
      of hags and jackanapes talking. [Hotly.] The more unprotected and helpless
      a woman is, the more they revel in it. If there's anything I hate in this
      world, it's those wretched creatures who babble about their neighbours'
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. I agree with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. One ought to be very careful not to give them&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;
      [checks himself confused; then hurrying on]&mdash;I suppose you and Joy
      get on all right?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Coolly.] Pretty well, thanks. I'm not exactly in Joy's line; have
      n't seen very much of her, in fact.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

        LEVER, JOY turns abruptly, hesitates a moment, and with an angry gesture

      COLONEL. Really?

    <p>
      ERNEST. [Unmoved.] If I were you, Colonel, I should tip her the wink. He

      COLONEL.] Peachey, go in and tell them tea 'll be ready in a minute, there
      's a good soul? Oh! and on my dressing table you'll find a bottle of Eau
      de Cologne.

      this?

    <p>
      COLONEL. [Avoiding her eyes.] I shall lose my temper with him one of these
      days. He's got that confounded habit of thinking nobody can be right but
      himself.

    <p>
      MRS. HOPE. That's enough! I want to talk to you seriously! Dick's in love.
      I'm perfectly certain of it.

      me so wild the way you throw away all the chances you have of making a
      little money. I've got you this opportunity, and you do nothing but rave
      up and down, and talk nonsense!

      talk it over calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Drawing himself up.] Go back on what I 've said? Not if I lose
      every penny! First you worry me to take the shares, and then you worry me
      not&mdash;I won't have it, Nell, I won't have it!

    </p>
    <p>
      LETTY. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      ERNEST. Well, I merely said what I thought, that Molly ought to look out
      what's she's doing, and he dropped on me like a cartload of bricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      LETTY. The Dad's very fond of Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERNEST. But look here, d'you mean to tell me that she and Lever are n't&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LETTY. Don't! Suppose they are! If joy were to hear it'd be simply awful.
      I like Molly. I 'm not going to believe anything against her. I don't see
      the use of it. If it is, it is, and if it is n't, it is n't.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERNEST. Well, all I know is that when I told her the mine was probably a
      frost she went for me like steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      LETTY. Well, so should I. She was only sticking up for her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERNEST. Ask the old Peachey-bird. She knows a thing or two. Look here, I
      don't mind a man's being a bit of a sportsman, but I think Molly's
      bringin' him down here is too thick. Your old Dad's got one of his notions
      that because this Josser's his guest, he must keep him in a glass case,
      and take shares in his mine, and all the rest of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LETTY. I do think people are horrible, always thinking things. It's not as
      if Molly were a stranger. She's my own cousin. I 'm not going to believe
      anything about my own cousin. I simply won't.
    </p>
    <p>
      ERNEST. [Reluctantly realising the difference that this makes.] I suppose
      it does make a difference, her bein' your cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      LETTY. Of course it does! I only hope to goodness no one will make Joy
      suspect&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      LEVER. [Frowning.] So I see! [There is a silence.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Maurice!
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Aunt Nell's hopeless, you mustn't mind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [In a dubious and ironic voice.] My dear girl, I 've too much to
      bother me to mind trifles like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Going to him suddenly.] Tell me, won't you?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [LEVER shrugs his shoulders.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A month ago you'd have told me soon enough!
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. Now, Molly!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Ah! [With a bitter smile.] The Spring's soon over.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. It 's always Spring between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. You did n't tell me what you were thinking about just now when you
      sat there like stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. It does n't do for a woman to say too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. Have I been so bad to you that you need feel like that, Molly?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [With a little warm squeeze of his arm.] Oh! my dear, it's only
      that I'm so&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      [She stops.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Gently]. So what?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [In a low voice.] It's hateful here.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. I didn't want to come. I don't understand why you suggested it.
      [MRS. GWYN is silent.] It's been a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Her eyes fixed on the ground.] Joy comes home to-morrow. I
      thought if I brought you here&mdash;I should know&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Vexedly.] Um!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Losing her control.] Can't you SEE? It haunts me? How are we
      to go on? I must know&mdash;I must know!
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. I don't see that my coming&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. I thought I should have more confidence; I thought I should be
      able to face it better in London, if you came down here openly&mdash;and
      now&mdash;I feel I must n't speak or look at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. You don't think your Aunt&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Scornfully.] She! It's only Joy I care about.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Frowning.] We must be more careful, that's all. We mustn't give
      ourselves away again, as we were doing just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. When any one says anything horrid to you, I can't help it.

        away.]

    <p>
      [Following hastily.] Don't dear, don't! I only meant&mdash;Come, Molly,
      let's be sensible. I want to tell you something about the mine.

    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [With a quavering smile.] Yes-let 's talk sensibly, and walk
      properly in this sensible, proper place.

        in her hand; then flings herself on a chair, and leans her elbows on the
        table.]

      JOY. No.

      DICK. Come on the river, Joy, just for half an hour, as far as the
      kingfishers&mdash;do! [Joy shakes her head.] Why not? It 'll be so jolly
      and cool. I'm most awfully sorry if I worried you this morning. I didn't
      mean to. I won't again, I promise. [Joy slides a look at him, and from
      that look he gains a little courage.] Do come! It'll be the last time. I
      feel it awfully, Joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. There's nothing to hurt you!
    </p>

      DICK. [Gloomily.] Isn't there&mdash;when you're like this?

    <p>
      JOY. [In a hard voice.] If you don't like me, why do you follow me about?
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. What is the matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Looking up, as if for want of air.] Oh! Don't!

    <p>
      DICK. Oh, Joy, what is the matter? Is it the heat?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [With a little laugh.] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. Have some Eau de Cologne. I 'll make you a bandage. [He takes the
      Eau de Cologne, and makes a bandage with his handkerchief.] It's quite
      clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. Oh, Dick, you are so funny!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [Bandaging her forehead.] I can't bear you to feel bad; it puts me
      off completely. I mean I don't generally make a fuss about people, but
      when it 's you&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Suddenly.] I'm all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. Is that comfy?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [With her chin up, and her eyes fast closed.] Quite.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. I'm not going to stay and worry you. You ought to rest. Only, Joy!
      Look here! If you want me to do anything for you, any time&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. But I don't see why, Maurice.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. We mean to sell the mine; we must do some more work on it, and for
      that we must have money.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. If you only want a little, I should have thought you could have
      got it in a minute in the City.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Shaking his head.] No, no; we must get it privately.
    </p>

      thing!

    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. What about the people who buy?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Dubiously regarding her.] My dear girl, they've just as much
      chance as we had. It 's not my business to think of them. There's YOUR
      thousand pounds&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Softly.] Don't bother about my money, Maurice. I don't want
      you to do anything not quite&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Evasively.] Oh! There's my brother's and my sister's too. I 'm not
      going to let any of you run any risk. When we all went in for it the thing
      looked splendid; it 's only the last month that we 've had doubts. What
      bothers me now is your Uncle. I don't want him to take these shares. It
      looks as if I'd come here on purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Oh! he mustn't take them!
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. That 's all very well; but it 's not so simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Shyly.] But, Maurice, have you told him about the selling?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Gloomily, under the hollow tree.] It 's a Board secret. I'd no
      business to tell even you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. But he thinks he's taking shares in a good&mdash;a permanent
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. You can't go into a mining venture without some risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Oh yes, I know&mdash;but&mdash;but Uncle Tom is such a dear!
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Stubbornly.] I can't help his being the sort of man he is. I did
      n't want him to take these shares; I told him so in so many words. Put
      yourself in my place, Molly: how can I go to him and say, "This thing may
      turn out rotten," when he knows I got you to put your money into it?

      understand that kind of man.

      MRS. GWYN. I don't think I quite understand.

      MRS. GWYN. Don't!

    <p>
      LEVER. We may not sell after all, dear, we may find it turn out trumps.

      MRS. GWYN. [With a shiver.] I don't want to hear any more. I know women
      don't understand. [Impulsively.] It's only that I can't bear any one
      should think that you&mdash;&mdash;

      course, I'll speak to your Uncle. I'll stop him somehow, even if I have to
      make a fool of myself. I 'll do anything you want&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. I will never&mdash;never make friends with him.

    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Cuttingly.] I have not asked you to.

      MRS. GWYN. If you were not, a child, Joy, you wouldn't say such things.

    <p>
      JOY. [Eagerly.] I'm not a child, I'm&mdash;I'm a woman. I am.

      LEVER. [Looking from face to face.] What's the matter? [There is no

      JOY. [Passionately.] I heard you, I don't care who knows. I'd listen
      again.

      JOY. You're a&mdash;a&mdash;you 're a&mdash;coward!

      MRS. GWYN. [With a sort of groan.] Joy!
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVER. [Stepping up to JOY, and standing with his hands behind him&mdash;
      in a low voice.] Now hit me in the face&mdash;hit me&mdash;hit me as hard
      as you can. Go on, Joy, it'll do you good.

      MRS. GWYN. Oh! my dear Joy, don't be silly!

      JOY. [Wincing; then with sudden passion.] I defy you&mdash;I defy you!

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is evening; a full yellow moon is shining through the branches of the
        hollow tree. The Chinese lanterns are alight. There is dancing in the
        house; the music sounds now loud, now soft. MISS BEECH is sitting on the
        rustic seat in a black bunchy evening dress, whose inconspicuous opening
        is inlaid with white. She slowly fans herself. DICK comes from the house
        in evening dress. He does not see Miss BEECH.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      DICK. Curse! [A short silence.] Curse!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Poor young man!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [With a start.] Well, Peachey, I can't help it [He fumbles off his
      gloves.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Did you ever know any one that could?
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [Earnestly.] It's such awfully hard lines on Joy. I can't get her
      out of my head, lying there with that beastly headache while everybody's
      jigging round.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Oh! you don't mind about yourself&mdash;noble young man!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. I should be a brute if I did n't mind more for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. So you think it's a headache, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. Did n't you hear what Mrs. Gwyn said at dinner about the sun? [With
      inspiration.] I say, Peachey, could n't you&mdash;could n't you just go up
      and give her a message from me, and find out if there 's anything she
      wants, and say how brutal it is that she 's seedy; it would be most
      awfully decent of you. And tell her the dancing's no good without her. Do,
      Peachey, now do! Ah! and look here!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He dives into the hollow of the tree, and brings from out of it a pail
        of water in which are placed two bottles of champagne, and some yellow
        irises&mdash;he takes the irises.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      You might give her these. I got them specially for her, and I have n't had
      a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Lifting a bottle.] What 's this?
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. Fizz. The Colonel brought it from the George. It 's for supper; he
      put it in here because of&mdash;[Smiling faintly]&mdash;Mrs. Hope, I
      think. Peachey, do take her those irises.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS. BEECH. D' you think they'll do her any good?
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [Crestfallen.] I thought she'd like&mdash;I don't want to worry her&mdash;you
      might try.

      <p>

    <p>
      Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. The poor little creature won't let me in.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. You've been up then!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Sharply.] Of course I've been up. I've not got a stone for my
      heart, young man!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. All right! I suppose I shall just have to get along somehow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [With devilry.] That's what we've all got to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [Gloomily.] But this is too brutal for anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Worse than ever happened to any one!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. I swear I'm not thinking of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Did y' ever know anybody that swore they were?
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. Oh! shut up!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. You'd better go in and get yourself a partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [With pale desperation.] Look here, Peachey, I simply loathe all
      those girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Ah-h! [Ironically.] Poor lot, are n't they?
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. All right; chaff away, it's good fun, isn't it? It makes me sick to
      dance when Joy's lying there. Her last night, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Sidling to him.] You're a good young man, and you 've got a
      good heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      DICK. Peachey&mdash;I say, Peachey d' you think there 's&mdash;I mean d'
      you think there'll ever be any chance for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. I thought that was coming! I don't approve of your making love
      at your time of life; don't you think I 'm going to encourage you.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. But I shall be of age in a year; my money's my own, it's not as if I
      had to ask any one's leave; and I mean, I do know my own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Of course you do. Nobody else would at your age, but you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. I would n't ask her to promise, it would n't be fair when she 's so
      young, but I do want her to know that I shall never change.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. And suppose&mdash;only suppose&mdash;she's fond of you, and
      says she'll never change.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. Oh! Peachey! D' you think there's a chance of that&mdash;do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. A-h-h!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. I wouldn't let her bind herself, I swear I wouldn't. [Solemnly.] I'm
      not such a selfish brute as you seem to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Sidling close to him and in a violent whisper.] Well&mdash;
      have a go!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. Really? You are a brick, Peachey!

      MISS BEACH. [Yielding pleasurably; then remembering her principles.] Don't
      you ever say I said so! You're too young, both of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. But it is exceptional&mdash;I mean in my case, is n't it?

    <p>
      [Looking after him.] Hallo! What's the matter with him? Cooling your
      heels, Peachey? By George! it's hot. Fancy the poor devils in London on a
      night like this, what? [He sees the moon.] It's a full moon. You're lucky
      to be down here, Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [In a low voice.] Very!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Oh! so you think she's lucky, do you?

    <p>
      COLONEL. [Expanding his nostrils.] Delicious scent to-night! Hay and roses&mdash;delicious.

    <p>
      A shame that poor child has knocked up like this. Don't think it was the
      sun myself&mdash;more likely neuralgic&mdash;she 's subject to neuralgia,
      Molly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Motionless.] I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Got too excited about your coming. I told Nell not to keep
      worrying her about her frock, and this is the result. But your Aunt
      &mdash;you know&mdash;she can't let a thing alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Ah! 't isn't neuralgia.

    <p>
      COLONEL. Excitable little thing. You don't understand her, Peachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Don't I?
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. She's all affection. Eh, Molly? I remember what I was like at her
      age, a poor affectionate little rat, and now look at me!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Fanning herself.] I see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [A little sadly.] We forget what we were like when we were young.
      She's been looking forward to to-night ever since you wrote; and now to
      have to go to bed and miss the dancing. Too bad!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Don't, Uncle Tom!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Patting her hand.] There, there, old girl, don't think about it.
      She'll be all right tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. If I were her mother I'd soon have her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Have her up with that headache! What are you talking about,
      Peachey?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. I know a remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Well, out with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Oh! Molly knows it too!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Staring at the ground.] It's easy to advise.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Fidgetting.] Well, if you're thinking of morphia for her, don't
      have anything to do with it. I've always set my face against morphia; the
      only time I took it was in Burmah. I'd raging neuralgia for two days. I
      went to our old doctor, and I made him give me some. "Look here, doctor,"
      I said, "I hate the idea of morphia, I 've never taken it, and I never
      want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Looking at MRS. GWYN.] When a tooth hurts, you should have it
      out. It 's only puttin' off the evil day.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. You say that because it was n't your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Well, it was hollow, and you broke your principles!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Hollow yourself, Peachey; you're as bad as any one!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH [With devilry.] Well, I know that! [She turns to MRS. GWYN.] He
      should have had it out! Shouldn't he, Molly?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. I&mdash;don't&mdash;judge for other people.

      COLONEL. [Alarmed.] Hallo, Molly! Are n't you feeling the thing, old girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Let her get some air, poor creature!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Who follows anxiously.] Your Aunt's got some first-rate sal
      volatile.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. It's all right, Uncle Tom. I felt giddy, it's nothing, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. That's the dancing. [He taps his forehead.] I know what it is
      when you're not used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [With a sudden bitter outburst.] I suppose you think I 'm a
      very bad mother to be amusing myself while joy's suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. My dear girl, whatever put such a thought into your head? We all
      know if there were anything you could do, you'd do it at once, would n't
      she, Peachey?

    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Ah! you see, Peachey knows me better.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Following up his thoughts.] I always think women are wonderful.
      There's your Aunt, she's very funny, but if there's anything the matter
      with me, she'll sit up all night; but when she's ill herself, and you try
      to do anything for her, out she raps at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [In a low voice.] There's always one that a woman will do
      anything for.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Exactly what I say. With your Aunt it's me, and by George! Molly,
      sometimes I wish it was n't.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH, [With meaning.] But is it ever for another woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. You old cynic! D' you mean to say Joy wouldn't do anything on
      earth for her Mother, or Molly for Joy? You don't know human nature. What
      a wonderful night! Have n't seen such a moon for years, she's like a
      great, great lamp!

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Don't like these Chinese lanterns, with that moon-tawdry! eh! By Jove,
      Molly, I sometimes think we humans are a rubbishy lot&mdash;each of us
      talking and thinking of nothing but our own petty little affairs; and when
      you see a great thing like that up there&mdash;[Sighs.] But there's your
      Aunt, if I were to say a thing like that to her she 'd&mdash; she'd think
      me a lunatic; and yet, you know, she 's a very good woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Half clinging to him.] Do you think me very selfish, Uncle
      Tom?
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. My dear&mdash;what a fancy! Think you selfish&mdash;of course I
      don't; why should I?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [Dully.] I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Changing the subject nervously.] I like your friend, Lever,
      Molly. He came to me before dinner quite distressed about your Aunt,
      beggin' me not to take those shares. She 'll be the first to worry me, but
      he made such a point of it, poor chap&mdash;in the end I was obliged to
      say I wouldn't. I thought it showed very' nice feeling. [Ruefully.] It's a
      pretty tight fit to make two ends meet on my income&mdash;I've missed a
      good thing, all owing to your Aunt. [Dropping his voice.] I don't mind
      telling you, Molly, I think they've got a much finer mine there than
      they've any idea of.

      fretting about Joy. Never mind&mdash;come! [He draws her hand beneath his
      arm.] Let's go and have a look at the moon on the river. We all get upset
      at times; eh! [Lifting his hand as if he had been stung.] Why, you 're not
      crying, Molly! I say! Don't do that, old girl, it makes me wretched. Look
      here, Peachey. [Holding out the hand on which the tear has dropped.] This

      MRS. GWYN, But you do. D' you think I haven't seen this coming&mdash;all
      these weeks. I knew she must find out some time! But even a day counts&mdash;&mdash;

      MRS. GWYN. [After staring at her, bitterly.] When day after day and night
      after night you've thought of nothing but how to keep them both, you might
      a little want to prove that it was possible, mightn't you? But you don't

      other you 'll have to give up.

      carries it away; but seeing MRS. GWYN's scarf lying across the chair, she
      fingers it, and stops, listening to the waltz. Suddenly draping it round
      her shoulders, she seizes the bottle of champagne, and waltzes with
      abandon to the music, as though avenging a long starvation of her
      instincts. Thus dancing, she is surprised by DICK, who has come to smoke a
      cigarette and think, at the spot where he was told to "have a go." ROSE,
      startled, stops and hugs the bottle.]

    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [With the ghost of a laugh.] Ah, Joy!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. I would try so hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. [With the same quivering smile.] My darling, I know you would,
      until you fell in love yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. Oh, Mother, I wouldn't, I never would, I swear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. There has never been a woman, joy, that did not fall in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [In a despairing whisper.] But it 's wrong of you it's wicked!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. If it's wicked, I shall pay for it, not you!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. But I want to save you, Mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Save me? [Breaking into laughter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. I can't bear it that you&mdash;if you 'll only&mdash;I'll never leave
      you. You think I don't know what I 'm saying, but I do, because even now I&mdash;I
      half love somebody. Oh, Mother! [Pressing her breast.] I feel&mdash;I feel
      so awful&mdash;as if everybody knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. You think I'm a monster to hurt you. Ah! yes! You'll understand
      better some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [In a sudden outburst of excited fear.] I won't believe it&mdash; I&mdash;I&mdash;can't&mdash;you're
      deserting me, Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. GWYN. Oh, you untouched things! You&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      JOY. Mother&mdash;it 's for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      GWYN. Ask for my life, JOY&mdash;don't be afraid.

    <blockquote>
      <p>

        daughter's hair; JOY shrinks from that touch.]

    <p>

      you.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [And swiftly without looking back she goes away. Joy, left alone under
        the hollow tree, crouches lower, and her shoulders shake. Here DICK
        finds her, when he hears no longer any sound o f voices. He falls on his
        knees beside her.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      DICK. Oh! Joy; dear, don't cry. It's so dreadful to see you! I 'd do
      anything not to see you cry! Say something.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Joy is still for a moment, then the shaking of the shoulders begins
        again.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Joy, darling! It's so awful, you 'll make yourself ill, and it is n't
      worth it, really. I 'd do anything to save you pain&mdash;won't you stop
      just for a minute?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Joy is still again.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Nothing in the world 's worth your crying, Joy. Give me just a little
      look!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Looking; in a smothered voice.] Don't!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. You do look so sweet! Oh, Joy, I'll comfort you, I'll take it all on
      myself. I know all about it.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Joy gives a sobbing laugh]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I do. I 've had trouble too, I swear I have. It gets better, it does
      really.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. You don't know&mdash;it's&mdash;it's&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. Don't think about it! No, no, no! I know exactly what it's like. [He
      strokes her arm.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Shrinking, in a whisper.] You mustn't.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The music of a waltz is heard again.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      DICK. Look here, joy! It's no good, we must talk it over calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. You don't see! It's the&mdash;it 's the disgrace&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. Oh! as to disgrace&mdash;she's your Mother, whatever she does; I'd
      like to see anybody say anything about her&mdash;[viciously]&mdash;I'd
      punch his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Gulping her tears.] That does n't help.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. But if she doesn't love your Father&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. But she's married to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [Hastily.] Yes, of course, I know, marriage is awfully important;
      but a man understands these things.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Joy looks at him. Seeing the impression he has made, he tries again.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I mean, he understands better than a woman. I've often argued about moral
      questions with men up at Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Catching at a straw.] But there's nothing to argue about.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [Hastily.] Of course, I believe in morals.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [They stare solemnly at each other.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Some men don't. But I can't help seeing marriage is awfully important.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Solemnly.] It's sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. Yes, I know, but there must be exceptions, Joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joy. [Losing herself a little in the stress of this discussion.] How can
      there be exceptions if a thing 's sacred?
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [Earnestly.] All rules have exceptions; that's true, you know; it's
      a proverb.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. It can't be true about marriage&mdash;how can it when&mdash;&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [With intense earnestness.] But look here, Joy, I know a really
      clever man&mdash;an author. He says that if marriage is a failure people
      ought to be perfectly free; it isn't everybody who believes that marriage
      is everything. Of course, I believe it 's sacred, but if it's a failure, I
      do think it seems awful&mdash;don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. I don't know&mdash;yes&mdash;if&mdash;[Suddenly] But it's my own
      Mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [Gravely.] I know, of course. I can't expect you to see it in your
      own case like this. [With desperation.] But look here, Joy, this'll show
      you! If a person loves a person, they have to decide, have n't they? Well,
      then, you see, that 's what your Mother's done.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. But that does n't show me anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. But it does. The thing is to look at it as if it was n't yourself.
      If it had been you and me in love, Joy, and it was wrong, like them, of
      course [ruefully] I know you'd have decided right. [Fiercely.] But I swear
      I should have decided wrong. [Triumphantly.] That 's why I feel I
      understand your Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Brushing her sleeve across her eyes.] Oh, Dick, you are so sweet&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;funny!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [Sliding his arm about her.] I love you, Joy, that 's why, and I 'll
      love you till you don't feel it any more. I will. I'll love you all day
      and every day; you shan't miss anything, I swear it. It 's such a
      beautiful night&mdash;it 's on purpose. Look' [JOY looks; he looks at
      her.] But it 's not so beautiful as you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [Bending her head.] You mustn't. I don't know&mdash;what's coming?
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. [Sidling closer.] Are n't your knees tired, darling? I&mdash;I can't
      get near you properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOY. [With a sob.] Oh! Dick, you are a funny&mdash;comfort!
    </p>
    <p>
      DICK. We'll stick together, Joy, always; nothing'll matter then.
    </p>

    <p>
      You're missing it all! I can't bear you to miss the dancing. It seems so
      queer! Couldn't we? Just a little turn?
    </p>

      DICK. To-morrow shan't hurt you, Joy; nothing shall ever hurt you again.

      [They stand so just a moment in the moon light; then turning to the river
      move slowly out of sight. Again the hollow tree is left alone. The music
      of the waltz has stopped. The voices of MISS BEECH and the COLONEL are
      heard approaching from the house. They appear in the opening of the wall.
      The COLONEL carries a pair of field glasses with which to look at the
      Moon.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Charming to see Molly dance with Lever, their steps go so well
      together! I can always tell when a woman's enjoying herself, Peachey.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Sharply.] Can you? You're very clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. Wonderful, that moon! I'm going to have a look at her! Splendid
      glasses these, Peachy [he screws them out], not a better pair in England.
      I remember in Burmah with these glasses I used to be able to tell a man
      from a woman at two miles and a quarter. And that's no joke, I can tell
      you. [But on his way to the moon, he has taken a survey of the earth to
      the right along the river. In a low but excited voice] I say, I say&mdash;is
      it one of the maids&mdash;the baggage! Why! It's Dick! By George, she's
      got her hair down, Peachey! It's Joy!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MISS BEECH goes to look. He makes as though to hand the glasses to her,
        but puts them to his own eyes instead&mdash; excitedly.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is! What about her headache? By George, they're kissing. I say,
      Peachey! I shall have to tell Nell!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Are you sure they're kissing? Well, that's some comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. They're at the stile now. Oughtn't I to stop them, eh? [He stands
      on tiptoe.] We must n't spy on them, dash it all. [He drops the glasses.]
      They're out of sight now.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [To herself.] He said he wouldn't let her.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. What! have you been encouraging them!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Don't be in such a hurry!

        [She moves towards the hollow tree.]

    <p>
      COLONEL. [Abstractedly.] By George, Peachey, to think that Nell and I were
      once&mdash;Poor Nell! I remember just such a night as this&mdash;

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He stops, and stares before him, sighing.]

    <p>
      MISS BEECH, [Impressively.] It's a comfort she's got that good young man.
      She's found out that her mother and this Mr. Lever are&mdash;you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Losing all traces of his fussiness, and drawing himself up as
      though he were on parade.] You tell me that my niece?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. Out of her own mouth!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Bowing his head.] I never would have believed she'd have
      forgotten herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Very solemnly.] Ah, my dear! We're all the same; we're all as
      hollow as that tree! When it's ourselves it's always a special case!

      COLONEL. [Shaking his head.] I couldn't have believed Molly would forget
      that child.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Sadly.] They must go their own ways, poor things! She can't
      put herself in the child's place, and the child can't put herself in
      Molly's. A woman and a girl&mdash;there's the tree of life between them!
    </p>
    <p>
      COLONEL. [Staring into the tree to see indeed if that were the tree
      alluded to.] It's a grief to me, Peachey, it's a grief! [He sinks into a
      chair, stroking his long moustaches. Then to avenge his hurt.] Shan't tell
      Nell&mdash;dashed if I do anything to make the trouble worse!
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS BEECH. [Nodding.] There's suffering enough, without adding to it with
      our trumpery judgments! If only things would last between them!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
