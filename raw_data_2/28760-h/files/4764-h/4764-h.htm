    <h3>
      SCENE I
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The study of JOHN BUILDER in the provincial town of Breconridge. A
        panelled room wherein nothing is ever studied, except perhaps BUILDER'S
        face in the mirror over the fireplace. It is, however, comfortable, and
        has large leather chairs and a writing table in the centre, on which is
        a typewriter, and many papers. At the back is a large window with French
        outside shutters, overlooking the street, for the house is an old one,
        built in an age when the homes of doctors, lawyers and so forth were
        part of a provincial town, and not yet suburban. There are two or three
        fine old prints on the walls, Right and Left; and a fine, old fireplace,
        Left, with a fender on which one can sit. A door, Left back, leads into
        the dining-room, and a door, Right forward, into the hall. JOHN BUILDER
        is sitting in his after-breakfast chair before the fire with The Times
        in his hands. He has breakfasted well, and is in that condition of
        first-pipe serenity in which the affairs of the nation seem almost
        bearable. He is a tallish, square, personable man of forty-seven, with a
        well-coloured, jowly, fullish face, marked under the eyes, which have
        very small pupils and a good deal of light in them. His bearing has
        force and importance, as of a man accustomed to rising and ownerships,
        sure in his opinions, and not lacking in geniality when things go his
        way. Essentially a Midlander. His wife, a woman of forty-one, of ivory
        tint, with a thin, trim figure and a face so strangely composed as to be
        almost like a mask (essentially from Jersey) is putting a nib into a
        pen-holder, and filling an inkpot at the writing-table. As the curtain
        rises CAMILLE enters with a rather broken-down cardboard box containing
        flowers. She is a young woman with a good figure, a pale face, the warm
        brown eyes and complete poise of a Frenchwoman. She takes the box to MRS
        BUILDER. MRS BUILDER. The blue vase, please, Camille. CAMILLE fetches a
        vase. MRS BUILDER puts the flowers into the vase. CAMILLE gathers up the
        debris; and with a glance at BUILDER goes out.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Glorious October! I ought to have a damned good day's shooting
      with Chantrey tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. [Arranging the flowers] Aren't you going to the office this
      morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Well, no, I was going to take a couple of days off. If you feel
      at the top of your form, take a rest&mdash;then you go on feeling at the
      top. [He looks at her, as if calculating] What do you say to looking up
      Athene?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. [Palpably astonished] Athene? But you said you'd done with
      her?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Smiling] Six weeks ago; but, dash it, one can't have done with
      one's own daughter. That's the weakness of an Englishman; he can't keep up
      his resentments. In a town like this it doesn't do to have her living by
      herself. One of these days it'll get out we've had a row. That wouldn't do
      me any good.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I see.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Besides, I miss her. Maud's so self-absorbed. It makes a big hole
      in the family, Julia. You've got her address, haven't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Yes. [Very still] But do you think it's dignified, John?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Genially] Oh, hang dignity! I rather pride myself on knowing
      when to stand on my dignity and when to sit on it. If she's still crazy
      about Art, she can live at home, and go out to study.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Her craze was for liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. A few weeks' discomfort soon cures that. She can't live on her
      pittance. She'll have found that out by now. Get your things on and come
      with me at twelve o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I think you'll regret it. She'll refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Not if I'm nice to her. A child could play with me to-day. Shall
      I tell you a secret, Julia?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. It would be pleasant for a change.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. The Mayor's coming round at eleven, and I know perfectly well
      what he's coming for.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I'm to be nominated for Mayor next month. Harris tipped me the
      wink at the last Council meeting. Not so bad at forty-seven&mdash;h'm? I
      can make a thundering good Mayor. I can do things for this town that
      nobody else can.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Now I understand about Athene.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Good-humouredly] Well, it's partly that. But [more seriously]
      it's more the feeling I get that I'm not doing my duty by her. Goodness
      knows whom she may be picking up with! Artists are a loose lot. And young
      people in these days are the limit. I quite believe in moving with the
      times, but one's either born a Conservative, or one isn't. So you be ready
      at twelve, see. By the way, that French maid of yours, Julia&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. What about her?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Is she&mdash;er&mdash;is she all right? We don't want any trouble
      with Topping.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MRS BUILDER. There will be none with&mdash;Topping. [She opens the door
        Left.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I don't know; she strikes me as&mdash;very French.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MRS BUILDER smiles and passes out. BUILDER fills his second pipe. He is
        just taking up the paper again when the door from the hall is opened,
        and the manservant TOPPING, dried, dark, sub-humorous, in a black
        cut-away, announces:
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TOPPING. The Mayor, Sir, and Mr Harris!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        THE MAYOR of Breconridge enters, He is clean-shaven, red-faced,
        light-eyed, about sixty, shrewd, poll-parroty, naturally jovial, dressed
        with the indefinable wrongness of a burgher; he is followed by his
        Secretary HARRIS, a man all eyes and cleverness. TOPPING retires.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Rising] Hallo, Mayor! What brings you so early? Glad to see you.
      Morning, Harris!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Morning, Builder, morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. Good-morning, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Sit down-sit down! Have a cigar!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The MAYOR takes a cigar HARRIS a cigarette from his own case.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Well, Mayor, what's gone wrong with the works?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He and HARRIS exchange a look.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [With his first puff] After you left the Council the other day,
      Builder, we came to a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Deuce you did! Shall I agree with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. We shall see. We want to nominate you for Mayor. You willin' to
      stand?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Stolid] That requires consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. The only alternative is Chantrey; but he's a light weight, and
      rather too much County. What's your objection?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. It's a bit unexpected, Mayor. [Looks at HARRIS] Am I the right
      man? Following you, you know. I'm shooting with Chantrey to-morrow. What
      does he feel about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. What do you say, 'Arris?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. Mr Chantrey's a public school and University man, Sir; he's not
      what I call ambitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Nor am I, Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. No, sir; of course you've a high sense of duty. Mr Chantrey's
      rather dilettante.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. We want a solid man.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I'm very busy, you know, Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. But you've got all the qualifications&mdash;big business, family
      man, live in the town, church-goer, experience on the Council and the
      Bench. Better say "yes," Builder.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. It's a lot of extra work. I don't take things up lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Dangerous times, these. Authority questioned all over the place. We
      want a man that feels his responsibilities, and we think we've got him in
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Very good of you, Mayor. I don't know, I'm sure. I must think of
      the good of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. I shouldn't worry about that, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. The name John Builder carries weight. You're looked up to as a man
      who can manage his own affairs. Madam and the young ladies well?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. First-rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [Rises] That's right. Well, if you'd like to talk it over with
      Chantrey to-morrow. With all this extremism, we want a man of principle
      and common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. We want a man that'll grasp the nettle, sir&mdash;and that's you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Hm! I've got a temper, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [Chuckling] We do&mdash;we do! You'll say "yes," I see. No false
      modesty! Come along, 'Arris, we must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Well, Mayor, I'll think it over, and let you have an answer. You
      know my faults, and you know my qualities, such as they are. I'm just a
      plain Englishman.
    </p>

      MAYOR. We don't want anything better than that. I always say the great
      point about an Englishman is that he's got bottom; you may knock him off
      his pins, but you find him on 'em again before you can say "Jack
      Robinson." He may have his moments of aberration, but he's a sticker.
      Morning, Builder, morning! Hope you'll say "yes."

        BUILDER stands a moment quite still with a gratified smile on his face;
        then turns and scrutinises himself in the glass over the hearth. While
        he is doing so the door from the dining-room is opened quietly and
        CAMILLE comes in. BUILDER, suddenly seeing her reflected in the mirror,
        turns.

    <p>
      BUILDER. What is it, Camille?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. Madame send me for a letter she say you have, Monsieur, from the
      dyer and cleaner, with a bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Feeling in his pockets] Yes&mdash;no. It's on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE goes to the writing-table and looks. That blue thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. [Taking it up] Non, Monsieur, this is from the gas.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        BUILDER. Oh! Ah! [He moves up to the table and turns over papers.
        CAMILLE stands motionless close by with her eyes fixed on him.] Here it
        is! [He looks up, sees her looking at him, drops his own gaze, and hands
        her the letter. Their hands touch. Putting his hands in his pockets]
        What made you come to England?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. [Demure] It is better pay, Monsieur, and [With a smile] the
      English are so amiable.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Deuce they are! They haven't got that reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. Oh! I admire Englishmen. They are so strong and kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Bluffly flattered] H'm! We've no manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. The Frenchman is more polite, but not in the 'eart.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Yes. I suppose we're pretty sound at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. And the Englishman have his life in the family&mdash;the
      Frenchman have his life outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [With discomfort] H'm!
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. [With a look] Too mooch in the family&mdash;like a rabbit in a
      'utch.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Oh! So that's your view of us! [His eyes rest on her, attracted
      but resentful].
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. Pardon, Monsieur, my tongue run away with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Half conscious of being led on] Are you from Paris?
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. [Clasping her hands] Yes. What a town for pleasure&mdash;Paris!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I suppose so. Loose place, Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. Loose? What is that, Monsieur?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. The opposite of strict.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. Strict! Oh! certainly we like life, we other French. It is not
      like England. I take this to Madame, Monsieur. [She turns as if to go]
      Excuse me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I thought you Frenchwomen all married young.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. I 'ave been married; my 'usband did die&mdash;en Afrique.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You wear no ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE. [Smiling] I prefare to be mademoiselle, Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Dubiously] Well, it's all the same to us. [He takes a letter up
      from the table] You might take this to Mrs Builder too. [Again their
      fingers touch, and there is a suspicion of encounter between their eyes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CAMILLE goes out.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Turning to his chair] Don't know about that woman&mdash;she's a
      tantalizer.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        He compresses his lips, and is settling back into his chair, when the
        door from the hall is opened and his daughter MAUD comes in; a pretty
        girl, rather pale, with fine eyes. Though her face has a determined cast
        her manner at this moment is by no means decisive. She has a letter in
        her hand, and advances rather as if she were stalking her father, who,
        after a "Hallo, Maud!" has begun to read his paper.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Getting as far as the table] Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Not lowering the paper] Well? I know that tone. What do you want&mdash;money?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I always want money, of course; but&mdash;but&mdash;

      BUILDER. [Pulling out a note-abstractedly] Here's five pounds for you.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

      BUILDER. [Unconscious] Will you take a letter for me?

    <p>
      [Dictating] "Dear Mr Mayor,&mdash;Referring to your call this morning, I
      have &mdash;er&mdash;given the matter very careful consideration, and
      though somewhat reluctant&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Are you really reluctant, father?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Go on&mdash;"To assume greater responsibilities, I feel it my
      duty to come forward in accordance with your wish. The&mdash;er&mdash;honour
      is one of which I hardly feel myself worthy, but you may rest assured&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Worthy. But you do, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Look here! Are you trying to get a rise out of me?&mdash;because
      you won't succeed this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I thought you were trying to get one out of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Well, how would you express it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. "I know I'm the best man for the place, and so do you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. The disrespect of you young people is something extraordinary.
      And that reminds me where do you go every evening now after tea?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I&mdash;I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Come now, that won't do&mdash;you're never in the house from six
      to seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Well! It has to do with my education.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Why, you finished that two years ago!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Well, call it a hobby, if you like, then, father.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

    <p>
      BUILDER. Hobby? Well, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I don't want to irritate you, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You can't irritate me more than by having secrets. See what that
      led to in your sister's case. And, by the way, I'm going to put an end to
      that this morning. You'll be glad to have her back, won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Startled] What!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Your mother and I are going round to Athene at twelve o'clock. I
      shall make it up with her. She must come back here.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Aghast, but hiding it] Oh! It's&mdash;it's no good, father. She
      won't.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. We shall see that. I've quite got over my tantrum, and I expect
      she has.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Earnestly] Father! I do really assure you she won't; it's only
      wasting your time, and making you eat humble pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Well, I can eat a good deal this morning. It's all nonsense! A
      family's a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [More and more disturbed, but hiding it] Father, if I were you, I
      wouldn't-really! It's not-dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You can leave me to judge of that. It's not dignified for the
      Mayor of this town to have an unmarried daughter as young as Athene living
      by herself away from home. This idea that she's on a visit won't wash any
      longer. Now finish that letter&mdash;"worthy, but you may rest assured
      that I shall do my best to sustain the&mdash;er&mdash;dignity of the
      office." [MAUD types desperately.] Got that? "And&mdash;er&mdash;preserve
      the tradition so worthily&mdash;" No&mdash; "so staunchly"&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Upheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Ah! "&mdash;upheld by yourself.&mdash;Faithfully yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Finishing] Father, you thought Athene went off in a huff. It wasn't
      that a bit. She always meant to go. She just got you into a rage to make
      it easier. She hated living at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Nonsense! Why on earth should she?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Well, she did! And so do&mdash; [Checking herself] And so you see
      it'll only make you ridiculous to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Rises] Now what's behind this, Maud?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Behind&mdash;Oh! nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. The fact is, you girls have been spoiled, and you enjoy twisting
      my tail; but you can't make me roar this morning. I'm too pleased with
      things. You'll see, it'll be all right with Athene.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Very suddenly] Father!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Grimly humorous] Well! Get it off your chest. What's that letter
      about?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Failing again and crumpling the letter behind her back] Oh!
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Everything's nothing this morning. Do you know what sort of
      people Athene associates with now&mdash;I suppose you see her?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Nobody much. There isn't anybody here to associate with. It's all
      hopelessly behind the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Oh! you think so! That's the inflammatory fiction you pick up. I
      tell you what, young woman&mdash;the sooner you and your sister get rid of
      your silly notions about not living at home, and making your own way, the
      sooner you'll both get married and make it. Men don't like the new spirit
      in women&mdash;they may say they do, but they don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. You don't, father, I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Well, I'm very ordinary. If you keep your eyes open, you'll soon
      see that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Men don't like freedom for anybody but themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. That's not the way to put it. [Tapping out his pipe] Women in
      your class have never had to face realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. No, but we want to.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Good-humouredly] Well, I'll bet you what you like, Athene's dose
      of reality will have cured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. And I'll bet you&mdash;No, I won't!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You'd better not. Athene will come home, and only too glad to do
      it. Ring for Topping and order the car at twelve.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      TOPPING. Did you ring, Miss?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [With the paper] Yes. Look here, Topping! Can you manage&mdash; on
      your bicycle&mdash;now at once? I want to send a message to Miss Athene
      &mdash;awfully important. It's just this: "Look out! Father is coming."
      [Holding out the paper] Here's her address. You must get there and away
      again by twelve. Father and mother want the car then to go there. Order it
      before you go. It won't take you twenty minutes on your bicycle. It's down
      by the river near the ferry. But you mustn't be seen by them either going
      or coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. If I should fall into their hands, Miss, shall I eat the
      despatch?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Rather! You're a brick, Topping. Hurry up!
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. Nothing more precise, Miss?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. M&mdash;m&mdash;No.

    <p>
      TOPPING. Very good, Miss Maud. [Conning the address] "Briary Studio, River
      Road. Look out! Father is coming!" I'll go out the back way. Any answer?

        reappears with a bread pan, which she deposits in the centre of the
        room; then crosses again to the bedroom, and once more reappears with a
        clothes brush, two hair brushes, and a Norfolk jacket. As she stuffs all
        these into the bread pan and bears it back into the kitchen, there is
        the sound of a car driving up and stopping. ANNIE reappears at the
        kitchen door just as the knocker sounds.

      BUILDER. [After the girl is gone] Quaint and Dutch&mdash;pretty little
      figure! [Staring round] H'm! Extraordinary girls are! Fancy Athene
      preferring this to home. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I didn't say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Placing a chair for his wife, and sitting down himself] Well, we
      must wait, I suppose. Confound that Nixon legacy! If Athene hadn't had
      that potty little legacy left her, she couldn't have done this. Well, I
      daresay it's all spent by now. I made a mistake to lose my temper with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Isn't it always a mistake to lose one's temper?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. That's very nice and placid; sort of thing you women who live
      sheltered lives can say. I often wonder if you women realise the strain on
      a business man.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. [In her softly ironical voice] It seems a shame to add the
      strain of family life.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You've always been so passive. When I want a thing, I've got to
      have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I've noticed that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [With a short laugh] Odd if you hadn't, in twenty-three years.
      [Touching a canvas standing against the chair with his toe] Art! Just a
      pretext. We shall be having Maud wanting to cut loose next. She's very
      restive. Still, I oughtn't to have had that scene with Athene. I ought to
      have put quiet pressure.

      BUILDER. What! I shall stay and clear this up if I have to wait a week.
      Men who let their daughters&mdash;! This age is the limit. [He makes a
      vicious movement with the strop, as though laying it across someone's
      back.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. She would never stand that. Even wives object, nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Grimly] The war's upset everything. Women are utterly out of
      hand. Why the deuce doesn't she come?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Suppose you leave me here to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Ominously] This is my job.

    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I think it's more mine.

    <p>
      BUILDER. Don't stand there opposing everything I say! I'll go and have
      another look&mdash;[He is going towards the bedroom when the sound of a
      latchkey in the outer door arrests him. He puts the strop and brush behind
      his back, and adds in a low voice] Here she is!

        does, his mouth falls open, and his hand on to the knob of the door. He
        is a comely young man in Harris tweeds. Moreover, he is smoking. He
        would speak if he could, but his surprise is too excessive. BUILDER.

    <p>
      BUILDER. Oh! And you have a key?

    <p>
      GUY. I&mdash;I don't think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. No. Then perhaps you'll tell me what these mean? [He takes out
      the strop and shaving stick].

    <p>
      BUILDER. Yes. Now then?

      GUY. [Addressing MRS BUILDER] Need we go into this in your presence,

    <p>
      BUILDER. Julia, will you leave me to manage this?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. [To Guy] When do you expect my daughter in?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. Now&mdash;directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. [Quietly] Are you married to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. Yes. That is&mdash;no&mdash;o; not altogether, I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. What's that? Say that again!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. [Folding his arms] I'm not going to say another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. John&mdash;please!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Don't put your oar in! I've had wonderful patience so far. [He
      puts his boot through a drawing] Art! This is what comes of it! Are you an
      artist?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. No; a flying man. The truth is&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I don't want to hear you speak the truth. I'll wait for my
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. If you do, I hope you'll be so very good as to be gentle. If you get
      angry I might too, and that would be awfully ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Well, I'm damned!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. I quite understand that, sir. But, as a man of the world, I hope
      you'll take a pull before she comes, if you mean to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. If we mean to stay! That's good!
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. Will you have a cigarette?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I&mdash;I can't express&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. [Soothingly] Don't try, sir. [He jerks up his chin, listening] I
      think that's her. [Goes to the door] Yes. Now, please! [He opens the door]
      Your father and mother, Athene.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE enters. She is flushed and graceful. Twenty-two, with a short upper
      lip, a straight nose, dark hair, and glowing eyes. She wears bright
      colours, and has a slow, musical voice, with a slight lisp.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Oh! How are you, mother dear? This is rather a surprise. Father
      always keeps his word, so I certainly didn't expect him. [She looks
      steadfastly at BUILDER, but does not approach].
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Controlling himself with an effort] Now, Athene, what's this?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. What's what?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [The strop held out] Are you married to this&mdash;this&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. [Quietly] To all intents and purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. In law?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. My God! You&mdash;you&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Father, don't call names, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Why aren't you married to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Do you want a lot of reasons, or the real one?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. This is maddening! [Goes up stage].
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Mother dear, will you go into the other room with Guy? [She points
      to the door Right].
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Because I would rather she didn't hear the reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. [To ATHENE, sotto voce] He's not safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Oh! yes; go on.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

    <p>
      BUILDER. Now then!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Well, father, if you want to know the real reason, it's&mdash;you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. What on earth do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Guy wants to marry me. In fact, we&mdash;But I had such a stunner
      of marriage from watching you at home, that I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Don't be impudent! My patience is at breaking-point, I warn you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. I'm perfectly serious, Father. I tell you, we meant to marry, but
      so far I haven't been able to bring myself to it. You never noticed how we
      children have watched you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Me?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Yes. You and mother, and other things; all sorts of things&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Taking out a handkerchief and wiping his brow] I really think
      you're mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. I'm sure you must, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Don't "dear" me! What have you noticed? D'you mean I'm not a good
      husband and father?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Look at mother. I suppose you can't, now; you're too used to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Of course I'm used to her. What else is marrying for?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. That; and the production of such as me. And it isn't good enough,
      father. You shouldn't have set us such a perfect example.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You're talking the most arrant nonsense I ever heard. [He lifts
      his hands] I've a good mind to shake it out of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Shall I call Guy?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He drops his hands.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Confess that being a good husband and father has tried you terribly. It
      has us, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Taking refuge in sarcasm] When you've quite done being funny,
      perhaps you'll tell me why you've behaved like a common street flapper.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. [Simply] I couldn't bear to think of Guy as a family man. That's
      all&mdash;absolutely. It's not his fault; he's been awfully anxious to be
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You've disgraced us, then; that's what it comes to.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. I don't want to be unkind, but you've brought it on yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Genuinely distracted] I can't even get a glimmer of what you
      mean. I've never been anything but firm. Impatient, perhaps. I'm not an
      angel; no ordinary healthy man is. I've never grudged you girls any
      comfort, or pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Except wills of our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. What do you want with wills of your own till you're married?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. You forget mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. What about her?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. She's very married. Has she a will of her own?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Sullenly] She's learnt to know when I'm in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. I don't ever mean to learn to know when Guy's in the right.
      Mother's forty-one, and twenty-three years of that she's been your wife.
      It's a long time, father. Don't you ever look at her face?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Troubled in a remote way] Rubbish!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. I didn't want my face to get like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. With such views about marriage, what business had you to go near
      a man? Come, now!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Because I fell in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Love leads to marriage&mdash;and to nothing else, but the
      streets. What an example to your sister!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. You don't know Maud any more than you knew me. She's got a will of
      her own too, I can tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Now, look here, Athene. It's always been my way to face
      accomplished facts. What's done can't be undone; but it can be remedied.
      You must marry this young&mdash;&mdash;at once, before it gets out. He's
      behaved like a ruffian: but, by your own confession, you've behaved worse.
      You've been bitten by this modern disease, this&mdash;this, utter lack of
      common decency. There's an eternal order in certain things, and marriage
      is one of them; in fact, it's the chief. Come, now. Give me a promise, and
      I'll try my utmost to forget the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. When we quarrelled, father, you said you didn't care what became
      of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I was angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. So you are now.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Come, Athene, don't be childish! Promise me!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. [With a little shudder] No! We were on the edge of it. But now
      I've seen you again&mdash;Poor mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Very angry] This is simply blasphemous. What do you mean by
      harping on your mother? If you think that&mdash;that&mdash;she doesn't&mdash;that
      she isn't&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Now, father!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I'm damned if I'll sit down under this injustice. Your mother is&mdash;is
      pretty irritating, I can tell you. She&mdash;she&mdash;Everything
      suppressed. And&mdash;and no&mdash;blood in her!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. I knew it!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Aware that he has confirmed some thought in her that he had no
      intention of confirming] What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Don't you ever look at your own face, father? When you shave, for
      instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Of course I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. It isn't satisfied, is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I don't know what on earth you mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. You can't help it, but you'd be ever so much happier if you were a
      Mohammedan, and two or three, instead of one, had&mdash;had learned to
      know when you were in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. 'Pon my soul! This is outrageous!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Truth often is.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Will you be quiet?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. I don't ever want to feel sorry for Guy in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I think you're the most immodest&mdash;I'm ashamed that you're my
      daughter. If your another had ever carried on as you are now&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Would you have been firm with her?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Really sick at heart at this unwonted mockery which meets him at
      every turn] Be quiet, you&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Has mother never turned?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You're an unnatural girl! Go your own way to hell!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. I am not coming back home, father.

        faint smile on her face, looking at the two young people.

      given me?

      MRS BUILDER. My dear, all men are not alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. I've always told her that, ma'am.

      MRS BUILDER. [Shaking her head] I'm going in a moment. [To ATHENE] You owe
      it to me, Athene.

    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Burn them!
    </p>

      GUY. [Slowly] Not quite. You can't imagine I should ever be like that,
      Athene?

    <p>
      ANNIE. Oh! no, Miss; from you. You see, I've got a young man that wants to
      marry me. And if I don't let him, I might get into trouble meself.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. What sort of father and mother have you got, Annie?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. I never thought, Miss. And of course I don't want to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. D'you mean you've never noticed how they treat each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. I don't think they do, Miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. They haven't time. Father's an engine driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. And what's your young man, Annie?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. [Embarrassed] Somethin' like you, sir. But very respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. And suppose you marry him, and he treats you like a piece of
      furniture?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. I&mdash;I could treat him the same, Miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Don't you believe that, Annie!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. He's very mild.

      ANNIE. Oh! yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. [Suppressing a smile] Of course&mdash;but the point is, Annie,
      that marriage makes all the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. Yes, Miss; that's what I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. You don't see. What I mean is that when once he's sure of you, he
      may change completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. [Slowly, looking at her thumb] Oh! I don't&mdash;think&mdash;he'll

      be a continual temptation to me.

    <p>
      ATHENE. Well, all right, Annie. I hope you'll never regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. Oh! no, Miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. I say, Annie, don't go away thinking evil of us; we didn't realise
      you knew we weren't married.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. We certainly did not.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. We beg your pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. Oh! no, sir. Only, seein' Mr and Mrs Builder so upset, brought it
      'ome like. And father can be 'andy with a strap.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. There you are! Force majeure!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. Oh! yes, Miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Well, good-bye, Annie. What are you going to say to your people?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. Oh! I shan't say I've been livin' in a family that wasn't a family,
      Miss. It wouldn't do no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Well, here are your wages.

      ANNIE. Oh! I'm puttin' you out, Miss. [She takes the money].
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Nonsense, Annie. And here's your fare home.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. Oh! thank you, Miss. I'm very sorry. Of course if you was to change
      your mind&mdash;[She stops, embarrassed].
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. I don't think&mdash;

      GUY. So her father has a firm hand too. But it takes her back to the nest.
      How's that, Athene?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. [Playing with a leathern button on his coat] If you'd watched it
      ever since you could watch anything, seen it kill out all&mdash;It's
      having power that does it. I know Father's got awfully good points.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. Well, they don't stick out.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. He works fearfully hard; he's upright, and plucky. He's not
      stingy. But he's smothered his animal nature-and that's done it. I don't
      want to see you smother anything, Guy.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. [Gloomily] I suppose one never knows what one's got under the lid. If
      he hadn't come here to-day&mdash;[He spins the wedding ring] He certainly
      gives one pause. Used he to whack you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. Brute!
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. With the best intentions. You see, he's a Town Councillor, and a
      magistrate. I suppose they have to be "firm." Maud and I sneaked in once
      to listen to him. There was a woman who came for protection from her
      husband. If he'd known we were there, he'd have had a fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. Did he give her the protection?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Yes; he gave her back to the husband. Wasn't it&mdash;English?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. [With a grunt] Hang it! We're not all like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. [Twisting his button] I think it's really a sense of property so
      deep that they don't know they've got it. Father can talk about freedom
      like a&mdash;politician.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. [Fitting the wedding ring on her finger] Well! Let's see how it
      looks, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Don't play with fire, Guy.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. There's something in atavism, darling; there really is. I like it
      &mdash;I do.

    <p>
      GUY. [Opening the door] It is. Come in, Annie. What's wrong now?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. [Entering in confusion] Oh! sir, please, sir&mdash;I've told my
      young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. Well, what does he say?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANNIE. 'E was 'orrified, Miss.

    <p>
      ANNIE. Oh! no, sir&mdash;at mine.

        the keys, and an accentuation of the expression. The door up Left is

      looked a bit green, Miss. I hope nothing'll go wrong with the works. Shall
      I keep lunch back?

      dentist. [He lays a finger on his cheek].

      TOPPING. [Twinkling, and shifting his finger to the side of his nose]
      Well, I don't suppose you've 'eard of it, Miss; but as a matter of fact
      it's the Cesarwitch.

      committed, but I should think pretty 'ot stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Yes; I've got them here. [She pats her chest].
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. Really, Miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Yes. There's just one point, Topping; it's psychological.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. Indeed, Miss?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Should I naturally put my hand on them; or would there be a reaction
      quick enough to stop me? You see, I'm alone&mdash;and the point is whether
      the fear of being seen would stop me although I knew I couldn't be seen.
      It's rather subtle.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. I think there's be a rehaction, Miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. So do I. To touch them [She clasps her chest] is a bit obvious,
      isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. If the haudience knows you've got 'em there.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Oh! yes, it's seen me put them. Look here, I'll show you that too.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      All right?
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. [Nodding] Fine, Miss. You have got a film face. What are they, if
      I may ask?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Reproducing the sealing-wax] The Fanshawe diamonds. There's just
      one thing here too, Topping.
    </p>
    <p>
      In real life, which should I naturally do&mdash;put them in here [She
      touches her chest] or in my bag?
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. [Touching his waistcoat&mdash;earnestly] Well! To put 'em in
      here, Miss, I should say is more&mdash;more pishchological.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Subduing her lips] Yes; but&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. You see, then you've got 'em on you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. But that's just the point. Shouldn't I naturally think: Safer in my
      bag; then I can pretend somebody put them there. You see, nobody could put
      them on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. Well, I should say that depends on your character. Of course I
      don't know what your character is.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. No; that's the beastly part of it&mdash;the author doesn't, either.
      It's all left to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. In that case, I should please myself, Miss. To put 'em in 'ere's
      warmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Yes, I think you're right. It's more human.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. I didn't know you 'ad a taste this way, Miss Maud.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. More than a taste, Topping&mdash;a talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. Well, in my belief, we all have a vice about us somewhere. But if
      I were you, Miss, I wouldn't touch bettin', not with this other on you.
      You might get to feel a bit crowded.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Well, then, only put the ten bob on if you're sure he's going to
      win. You can post the money on after me. I'll send you an address,
      Topping, because I shan't be here.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. [Disturbed] What! You're not going, too, Miss Maud?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. To seek my fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. Oh! Hang it all, Miss, think of what you'll leave behind. Miss
      Athene's leavin' home has made it pretty steep, but this'll touch bottom&mdash;this
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Yes; I expect you'll find it rather difficult for a bit when I'm
      gone. Miss Baldini, you know. I've been studying with her. She's got me
      this chance with the movie people. I'm going on trial as the guilty typist
      in "The Heartache of Miranda."
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. [Surprised out of politeness] Well, I never! That does sound like
      'em! Are you goin' to tell the guv'nor, Miss?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MAUD nods. In that case, I think I'll be gettin' off to my dentist
        before the band plays.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAUD. All right, Topping; hope you won't lose a tooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. [With a grin] It's on the knees of the gods, Miss, as they say in
      the headlines.

    <p>
      CAMILLE. Topping has gone to the dentist, Monsieur; 'e 'as the toothache.

      I'm sorry I beat on that door. I apologize. I was in a towering passion. I
      wish I didn't get into these rages. But&mdash;dash it all&mdash;! I
      couldn't walk away and leave you there.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You keep everything to yourself, so; I never have any notion what
      you're thinking. What did you say to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Told her it would never work.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Well, that's something. She's crazy. D'you suppose she was
      telling the truth about that young blackguard wanting to marry her?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I'm sure of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. When you think of how she's been brought up. You would have
      thought that religion alone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. The girls haven't wanted to go to church for years. They've
      always said they didn't see why they should go to keep up your position. I
      don't know if you remember that you once caned them for running off on a
      Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. They've never had any religion since.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. H'm! [He takes a short turn up the room] What's to be done about
      Athene?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. You said you had done with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You know I didn't mean that. I might just as well have said I'd
      done with you! Apply your wits, Julia! At any moment this thing may come
      out. In a little town like this you can keep nothing dark. How can I take
      this nomination for Mayor?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Perhaps Ralph could help.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. What? His daughters have never done anything disgraceful, and his
      wife's a pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Yes; Ralph isn't at all a family man.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Staring at her] I do wish you wouldn't turn things upside down
      in that ironical way. It isn't&mdash;English.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I can't help having been born in Jersey.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. No; I suppose it's in your blood. The French&mdash; [He stops
      short].
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Very irritating sometimes to a plain Englishman&mdash;that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Shall I get rid of Camille?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Staring at her, then dropping his glance] Camille? What's she
      got to do with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I thought perhaps you found her irritating.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Why should I?

      Can't you suggest any way of making Athene see reason? Think of the
      example! Maud will be kicking over next. I shan't be able to hold my head
      up here.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I'm afraid I can't do that for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Exasperated] Look here, Julia! That wretched girl said something
      to me about our life together. What&mdash;what's the matter with that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. It is irritating.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Be explicit.

      MRS BUILDER. We have lived together twenty-three years, John. No talk will
      change such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Is it a question of money? You can always have more. You know
      that. [MRS BUILDER smiles] Oh! don't smile like that; it makes me feel
      quite sick!

    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. And why?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Some crazy rubbish about family life, of all things.

    <p>
      RALPH. Athene's a most interesting girl. All these young people are so
      queer and delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. By George, Ralph, you may thank your stars you haven't got a
      delightful daughter. Yours are good, decent girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. Athene's tremendously good and decent, John. I'd bet any money
      she's doing this on the highest principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Behaving like a&mdash;

      H'm?
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. Well, old man, you do get blood to the head. But what's Athene's
      point, exactly?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Family life isn't idyllic, so she thinks she and the young man
      oughtn't to have one.
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. I see. Home experience?
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      RALPH. But no tail, old chap.
    </p>
    <p>

      RALPH. Always.

    <p>
      RALPH. Exactly. And she does it. I don't and she doesn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [With a short laugh] Good Lord! I suppose you'd have me eat
      humble pie and tell Athene she can go on living in sin and offending
      society, and have my blessing to round it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. I think if you did she'd probably marry him.

      were.

      I'm any stricter than nine out of ten men?

      principles of government.

    <p>
      MAUD. Oh! father, I&mdash;I've got some news for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Staring at her] News&mdash;what?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I'm awfully sorry, but I-I've got a job.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Now, don't go saying you're going in for Art, too, because I
      won't have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Art? Oh! no! It's the&mdash;[With a jerk]&mdash;the Movies.

    <p>
      BUILDER. [Impressively] I'm not in a joking mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I'm not joking, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Then what are you talking about?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. You see, I&mdash;I've got a film face, and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You've what? [Going up to his daughter, he takes hold of her
      chin] Don't talk nonsense! Your sister has just tried me to the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Removing his hand from her chin] Don't oppose it, father, please!
      I've always wanted to earn my own living.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Living! Living!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Gathering determination] You can't stop me, father, because I
      shan't need support. I've got quite good terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Almost choking, but mastering himself] Do you mean to say you've
      gone as far as that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Yes. It's all settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Who put you up to this?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. No one. I've been meaning to, ever so long. I'm twenty-one, you
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. A film face! Good God! Now, look here! I will not have a daughter
      of mine mixed up with the stage. I've spent goodness knows what on your
      education&mdash;both of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I don't want to be ungrateful; but I&mdash;I can't go on living at
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You can't&mdash;! Why? You've every indulgence.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Clearly and coldly] I can remember occasions when your indulgence
      hurt, father. [She wriggles her shoulders and back] We never forgot or
      forgave that.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Uneasily] That! You were just kids.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Perhaps you'd like to begin again?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Don't twist my tail, Maud. I had the most painful scene with
      Athene this morning. Now come! Give up this silly notion! It's really too
      childish!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Looking at him curiously] I've heard you say ever so many times
      that no man was any good who couldn't make his own way, father. Well,
      women are the same as men, now. It's the law of the country. I only want
      to make my own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Trying to subdue his anger] Now, Maud, don't be foolish.
      Consider my position here&mdash;a Town Councillor, a Magistrate, and Mayor
      next year. With one daughter living with a man she isn't married to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [With lively interest] Oh! So you did catch them out?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. D'you mean to say you knew?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. My God! I thought we were a Christian family.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Oh! father.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Don't sneer at Christianity!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. There's only one thing wrong with Christians&mdash;they aren't!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER Seizes her by the shoulders and shakes her vigorously. When he
      drops her shoulders, she gets up, gives him a vicious look, and suddenly
      stamps her foot on his toe with all her might.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [With a yowl of pain] You little devil!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Who has put the table between them] I won't stand being shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Staring at her across the table] You've got my temper up and
      you'll take the consequences. I'll make you toe the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. If you knew what a Prussian expression you've got!

    <p>
      No! It's too deep!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Are you my daughter or are you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I certainly never wanted to be. I've always disliked you, father,
      ever since I was so high. I've seen through you. Do you remember when you
      used to come into the nursery because Jenny was pretty? You think we
      didn't notice that, but we did. And in the schoolroom&mdash;Miss Tipton.
      And d'you remember knocking our heads together? No, you don't; but we do.
      And&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You disrespectful monkey! Will you be quiet?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. No; you've got to hear things. You don't really love anybody but
      yourself, father. What's good for you has to be good for everybody. I've
      often heard you talk about independence, but it's a limited company and
      you've got all the shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Rot; only people who can support themselves have a right to
      independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. That's why you don't want me to support myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You can't! Film, indeed! You'd be in the gutter in a year.
      Athene's got her pittance, but you&mdash;you've got nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Except my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. It's the face that brings women to ruin, my girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Well, when I'm there I won't come to you to rescue me.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Now, mind&mdash;if you leave my house, I've done with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I'd rather scrub floors now, than stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Almost pathetically] Well, I'm damned! Look here, Maud&mdash;
      all this has been temper. You got my monkey up. I'm sorry I shook you;
      you've had your revenge on my toes. Now, come! Don't make things worse for
      me than they are. You've all the liberty you can reasonably want till you
      marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. He can't see it&mdash;he absolutely can't!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. See what?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. That I want to live a life of my own.

    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Yes. I will put no obstacle in the way of your pleasures.

      say a thing like that? Why, I've only just&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Don't! I saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. The girl fell on my knees. Julia, she did. She's&mdash;she's a
      little devil. I&mdash;I resisted her. I give you my word there's been
      nothing beyond a kiss, under great provocation. I&mdash;I apologise.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. [Bows her head] Thank you! I quite understand. But you must
      forgive my feeling it impossible to remain a wet blanket any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. What! Because of a little thing like that&mdash;all over in two
      minutes, and I doing my utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. My dear John, the fact that you had to do your utmost is
      quite enough. I feel continually humiliated in your house, and I want to
      leave it&mdash;quite quietly, without fuss of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. But&mdash;my God! Julia, this is awful&mdash;it's absurd! How can
      you? I'm your husband. Really&mdash;your saying you don't mind what I do&mdash;it's
      not right; it's immoral!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I'm afraid you don't see what goes on in those who live with
      you. So, I'll just go. Don't bother!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Now, look here, Julia, you can't mean this seriously. You can't!
      Think of my position! You've never set yourself up against me before.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. But I do now.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [After staring at her] I've given you no real reason. I'll send
      the girl away. You ought to thank me for resisting a temptation that most
      men would have yielded to. After twenty-three years of married life, to
      kick up like this&mdash;you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. I'm sure you must think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Oh! for heaven's sake don't be sarcastic! You're my wife, and
      there's an end of it; you've no legal excuse. Don't be absurd!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Good-bye!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. D'you realise that you're encouraging me to go wrong? That's a
      pretty thing for a wife to do. You ought to keep your husband straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. How beautifully put!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Almost pathetically] Don't rile me Julia! I've had an awful day.
      First Athene&mdash;then Maud&mdash;then that girl&mdash;and now you! All
      at once like this! Like a swarm of bees about one's head. [Pleading] Come,
      now, Julia, don't be so&mdash;so im practicable! You'll make us the
      laughing-stock of the whole town. A man in my position, and can't keep his
      own family; it's preposterous!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. Your own family have lives and thoughts and feelings of their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Oh! This damned Woman's business! I knew how it would be when we
      gave you the vote. You and I are married, and our daughters are our
      daughters. Come, Julia. Where's your commonsense? After twenty-three
      years! You know I can't do without you!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. You could&mdash;quite easily. You can tell people what you
      like.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. My God! I never heard anything so immoral in all my life from the
      mother of two grownup girls. No wonder they've turned out as they have!
      What is it you want, for goodness sake?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. We just want to be away from you, that's all. I assure you
      it's best. When you've shown some consideration for our feelings and some
      real sign that we exist apart from you&mdash;we could be friends again&mdash;
      perhaps&mdash;I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Friends! Good heavens! With one's own wife and daughters! [With
      great earnestness] Now, look here, Julia, you haven't lived with me all
      this time without knowing that I'm a man of strong passions; I've been a
      faithful husband to you&mdash;yes, I have. And that means resisting all
      sorts of temptations you know nothing of. If you withdraw from my society
      I won't answer for the consequences. In fact, I can't have you
      withdrawing. I'm not going to see myself going to the devil and losing the
      good opinion of everybody round me. A bargain's a bargain. And until I've
      broken my side of it, and I tell you I haven't&mdash;you've no business to
      break yours. That's flat. So now, put all that out of your head.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS BUILDER. No.

      BUILDER. And how do you propose to live? I shan't give you a penny. Come,

      SCENE I
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Ten o'clock the following morning, in the study of the Mayor of
        Breconridge, a panelled room with no window visible, a door Left back
        and a door Right forward. The entire back wall is furnished with books
        from floor to ceiling; the other walls are panelled and bare. Before the
        fireplace, Left, are two armchairs, and other chairs are against the
        walls. On the Right is a writing-bureau at right angles to the
        footlights, with a chair behind it. At its back corner stands HARRIS,
        telephoning.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HARRIS. What&mdash;[Pause] Well, it's infernally awkward, Sergeant.... The
      Mayor's in a regular stew.... [Listens] New constable? I should think so!
      Young fool! Look here, Martin, the only thing to do is to hear the charge
      here at once. I've sent for Mr Chantrey; he's on his way. Bring Mr Builder
      and the witnesses round sharp. See? And, I say, for God's sake keep it
      dark. Don't let the Press get on to it. Why you didn't let him go home&mdash;!
      Black eye? The constable? Well, serve him right. Blundering young ass! I
      mean, it's undermining all authority.... Well, you oughtn't&mdash;at
      least, I... Damn it all!&mdash;it's a nine days' wonder if it gets out&mdash;!
      All right! As soon as you can. [He hangs up the receiver, puts a second
      chair behind the bureau, and other chairs facing it.] [To himself] Here's
      a mess! Johnny Builder, of all men! What price Mayors!

    <p>
      Hallo?... Poaching charge? Well, bring him too; only, I say, keep him back
      till the other's over. By the way, Mr Chantrey's going shooting. He'll
      want to get off by eleven. What?.. Righto!
    </p>

    <p>
      MAYOR. Well, 'Arris?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. They'll be over in five minutes, Mr Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Mr Chantrey?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. On his way, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. I've had some awkward things to deal with in my time, 'Arris, but
      this is just about the [Sniffs] limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. Most uncomfortable, Sir; most uncomfortable!

      MAYOR. Put a book on the chair, 'Arris; I like to sit 'igh.

      Chantrey.

      MAYOR. Ah, Chantrey!

    <p>
      CHANTREY. How de do, Mr Mayor? [Nodding to HARRIS] This is extraordinarily
      unpleasant.

      <p>
        The MAYOR nods.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      What on earth's he been doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. Assaulting one of his own daughters with a stick; and resisting
      the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHANTREY. [With a low whistle] Daughter! Charity begins at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. There's a black eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Whose?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. The constable's.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHANTREY. How did the police come into it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. I don't know, sir. The worst of it is he's been at the police
      station since four o'clock yesterday. The Superintendent's away, and
      Martin never will take responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHANTREY. By George! he will be mad. John Builder's a choleric fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [Nodding] He is. 'Ot temper, and an 'igh sense of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRIS. There's one other charge, Mr Mayor&mdash;poaching. I told them to
      keep that back till after.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHANTREY. Oh, well, we'll make short work of that. I want to get off by
      eleven, Harris. I shall be late for the first drive anyway. John Builder!
      I say, Mayor&mdash;but for the grace of God, there go we!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Harris, go out and bring them in yourself; don't let the servants&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        HARRIS goes out Left. The MAYOR takes the upper chair behind the bureau,
        sitting rather higher because of the book than CHANTREY, who takes the
        lower. Now that they are in the seats of justice, a sort of reticence
        falls on them, as if they were afraid of giving away their attitudes of
        mind to some unseen presence.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [Suddenly] H'm!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHANTREY. Touch of frost. Birds ought to come well to the guns&mdash;no
      wind. I like these October days.

      MAYOR. I think I 'ear them. H'm.

        spectacles. The MAYOR clears his throat and takes up a pen. They neither

        First HARRIS; then RALPH BUILDER, ATHENE, HERRINGHAME, MAUD, MRS
        BUILDER, SERGEANT MARTIN, carrying a heavy Malacca cane with a silver
        knob; JOHN BUILDER and the CONSTABLE MOON, a young man with one black
        eye. No funeral was ever attended by mutes so solemn and dejected. They
        stand in a sort of row.

        but he stands erect staring straight at the MAYOR. HARRIS goes to the
        side of the bureau, Back, to take down the evidence.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Charges!
    </p>
    <p>
      SERGEANT. John Builder, of The Cornerways, Breconridge, Contractor and
      Justice of the Peace, charged with assaulting his daughter Maud Builder by
      striking her with a stick in the presence of Constable Moon and two other
      persons; also with resisting Constable Moon in the execution of his duty,
      and injuring his eye. Constable Moon!
    </p>
    <p>
      MOON. [Stepping forward-one, two&mdash;like an automaton, and saluting] In
      River Road yesterday afternoon, Your Worship, about three-thirty p.m., I
      was attracted by a young woman callin' "Constable" outside a courtyard. On
      hearing the words "Follow me, quick," I followed her to a painter's studio
      inside the courtyard, where I found three persons in the act of
      disagreement. No sooner 'ad I appeared than the defendant, who was engaged
      in draggin' a woman towards the door, turns to the young woman who
      accompanied me, with violence. "You dare, father," she says; whereupon he
      hit her twice with the stick the same which is produced, in the presence
      of myself and the two other persons, which I'm given to understand is his
      wife and other daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Yes; never mind what you're given to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOON. No, sir. The party struck turns to me and says, "Come in. I give
      this man in charge for assault." I moves accordingly with the words: "I
      saw you. Come along with me." The defendant turns to me sharp and says:
      "You stupid lout&mdash;I'm a magistrate." "Come off it," I says to the
      best of my recollection. "You struck this woman in my presence," I says,
      "and you come along!" We were then at close quarters. The defendant gave
      me a push with the words: "Get out, you idiot!" "Not at all," I replies,
      and took 'old of his arm. A struggle ensues, in the course of which I
      receives the black eye which I herewith produce. [He touches his eye with
      awful solemnity.]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The MAYOR clears his throat; CHANTREY'S eyes goggle; HARRIS bends over
        and writes rapidly.

    <p>
      During the struggle, Your Worship, a young man has appeared on the scene,
      and at the instigation of the young woman, the same who was assaulted,
      assists me in securing the prisoner, whose language and resistance was
      violent in the extreme. We placed him in a cab which we found outside, and
      I conveyed him to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHANTREY. What was his&mdash;er&mdash;conduct in the&mdash;er&mdash;cab?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOON. He sat quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHANTREY. That seems&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MOON. Seein' I had his further arm twisted behind him.

    <p>
      MAYOR [Looking at BUILDER] Any questions to ask him?
    </p>

        MOON steps back two paces, and the SERGEANT steps two paces forward.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SERGEANT. At ten minutes to four, Your Worship, yesterday afternoon,
      Constable Moon brought the defendant to the station in a four-wheeled cab.
      On his recounting the circumstances of the assault, they were taken down
      and read over to the defendant with the usual warning. The defendant said
      nothing. In view of the double assault and the condition of the
      constable's eye, and in the absence of the Superintendent, I thought it my
      duty to retain the defendant for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. The defendant said nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      SERGEANT. He 'as not opened his lips to my knowledge, Your Worship, from
      that hour to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Any questions to ask the Sergeant?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER continues to stare at the MAYOR without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Very well!

    <p>
      MAYOR. Miss Maud Builder, will you tell us what you know of this&mdash;er&mdash;
      occurrence?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Rising; with eyes turning here and there] Must I?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. I'm afraid you must.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [After a look at her father, who never turns his eyes from the
      MAYOR's face] I&mdash;I wish to withdraw the charge of striking me,
      please. I&mdash;I never meant to make it. I was in a temper&mdash;I saw
      red.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. I see. A&mdash;a domestic disagreement. Very well, that charge is
      withdrawn. You do not appear to have been hurt, and that seems to me quite
      proper. Now, tell me what you know of the assault on the constable. Is his
      account correct?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Timidly] Ye-yes. Only&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Yes? Tell us the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Resolutely] Only, I don't think my father hit the constable. I
      think the stick did that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Oh, the stick? But&mdash;er&mdash;the stick was in 'is 'and, wasn't
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Yes; but I mean, my father saw red, and the constable saw red, and
      the stick flew up between them and hit him in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHANTREY. And then he saw black?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [With corrective severity] But did 'e 'it 'im with the stick?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. No&mdash;no. I don't think he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Then who supplied the&mdash;er&mdash;momentum?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I think there was a struggle for the cane, and it flew up.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Hand up the cane.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The SERGEANT hands up the cane. The MAYOR and CHANTREY examine it.
        MAYOR. Which end&mdash;do you suggest&mdash;inflicted this injury?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAUD. Oh! the knob end, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. What do you say to that, constable?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOON. [Stepping the mechanical two paces] I don't deny there was a
      struggle, Your Worship, but it's my impression I was 'it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHANTREY. Of course you were bit; we can see that. But with the cane or
      with the fist?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOON. [A little flurried] I&mdash;I&mdash;with the fist, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Be careful. Will you swear to that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOON. [With that sudden uncertainty which comes over the most honest in
      such circumstances] Not&mdash;not so to speak in black and white, Your
      Worship; but that was my idea at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. You won't swear to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOON. I'll swear he called me an idiot and a lout; the words made a deep
      impression on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHANTREY. [To himself] Mort aux vaches!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Eh? That'll do, constable; stand back. Now, who else saw the
      struggle? Mrs Builder. You're not obliged to say anything unless you like.
      That's your privilege as his wife.

    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. Yes&mdash;No, sir. Miss Maud Builder did that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. What do you say to this blow?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. [Jerking his chin up a little] Oh! I saw that clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Well, let us hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. The constable's arm struck the cane violently and it flew up and
      landed him in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [With a little grunt] You are sure of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. Quite sure, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Did you hear any language?
    </p>
    <p>
      GUY. Nothing out of the ordinary, sir. One or two damns and blasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. You call that ordinary?

      to arrest?

    <p>
      GUY. No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [With a gesture of dismissal] Very well, That seems to be the
      evidence. Defendant John Builder&mdash;what do you say to all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [In a voice different from any we have heard from him] Say! What
      business had he to touch me, a magistrate? I gave my daughter two taps
      with a cane in a private house, for interfering with me for taking my wife
      home&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. That charge is not pressed, and we can't go into the circumstances.
      What do you wish to say about your conduct towards the constable?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [In his throat] Not a damned thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [Embarrassed] I&mdash;I didn't catch.

    <p>
      CHANTREY. Nothing&mdash;nothing, he said, Mr Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [Clearing his throat] I understand, then, that you do not wish to
      offer any explanation?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I consider myself abominably treated, and I refuse to say another
      word.

      was undoubtedly under great strain yesterday; certain circumstances,
      domestic and otherwise&mdash;

    <p>
      MAYOR. Very good. [He clears his throat] As the defendant, wrongly, we
      think, refuses to offer his explanation of this matter, the Bench has to
      decide on the evidence as given. There seems to be some discrepancy as to
      the blow which the constable undoubtedly received. In view of this, we
      incline to take the testimony of Mr&mdash;

      <p>
        HARRIS prompts him.

    <p>
      Mr 'Erringhame&mdash;as the party least implicated personally in the
      affair, and most likely to 'ave a cool and impartial view. That evidence
      is to the effect that the blow was accidental. There is no doubt, however,
      that the defendant used reprehensible language, and offered some
      resistance to the constable in the execution of his duty. Evidence 'as
      been offered that he was in an excited state of mind; and it is possible
      &mdash;I don't say that this is any palliation&mdash;but it is possible
      that he may have thought his position as magistrate made him&mdash;er&mdash;

      of these 'Umanitarians writes to the papers, there's always a Scotchman
      after him next morning. Seems to be a fact of 'uman nature, like
      introducin' rabbits into a new country and then weasels to get rid of 'em.

      could keep down a Scotchman! You seem to reach the hapex there!

      him down, and make up to him. You've tried him pretty high.
    </p>

      MAUD. [Stubbornly] I never wanted him for a father, Uncle.

      you going to be nice to him, both of you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. We're going to try.
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. Good! I don't even now understand how it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. When you went out with Guy, it wasn't three minutes before he came.
      Mother had just told us about&mdash;well, about something beastly. Father
      wanted us to go, and we agreed to go out for five minutes while he talked
      to mother. We went, and when we came back he told me to get a cab to take
      mother home. Poor mother stood there looking like a ghost, and he began
      hunting and hauling her towards the door. I saw red, and instead of a cab
      I fetched that policeman. Of course father did black his eye. Guy was
      splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. You gave him the lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I couldn't help it, seeing father standing there all dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. It was awful! Uncle, why didn't you come back with Guy?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Oh, yes! why didn't you, Uncle?
    </p>
    <p>
      ATHENE. When Maud had gone for the cab, I warned him not to use force. I
      told him it was against the law, but he only said: "The law be damned!"
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. Well, it all sounds pretty undignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Yes; everybody saw red.

        glowering expression. He has a document in his hand. He advances a step
        or two and they see him.

      RALPH. This is an awful jar, old man!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Here's what I've said to that fellow: "MR MAYOR,&mdash;You had
      the effrontery to-day to discharge me with a caution&mdash;forsooth!&mdash;your
      fellow &mdash;magistrate. I've consulted my solicitor as to whether an
      action will lie for false imprisonment. I'm informed that it won't. I take
      this opportunity of saying that justice in this town is a travesty. I have
      no wish to be associated further with you or your fellows; but you are
      vastly mistaken if you imagine that I shall resign my position on the
      Bench or the Town Council.&mdash;Yours,

    <p>
      RALPH. I say&mdash;keep your sense of humour, old boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Grimly] Humour? I've spent a night in a cell. See this! [He
      holds out the document] It disinherits my family.
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. John!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I've done with those two ladies. As to my wife&mdash;if she
      doesn't come back&mdash;! When I suffer, I make others suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. Julia's very upset, my dear fellow; we all are. The girls came here
      to try and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Rising] They may go to hell! If that lousy Mayor thinks I'm done
      with&mdash;he's mistaken! [He rings the bell] I don't want any soft
      sawder. I'm a fighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. [In a low voice] The enemy stands within the gate, old chap.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. Let's boss our own natures before we boss those of other people.
      Have a sleep on it, John, before you do anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Sleep? I hadn't a wink last night. If you'd passed the night I
      had&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      RALPH. I hadn't many myself.

      reach you when you left the Mayor's. I thought you would probably have
      your own side of this unfortunate matter. We shall be glad to give it
      every prominence.

    <p>
      BUILDER. [Drily, regarding the JOURNALIST, who has spoken in a pleasant
      and polite voice] Very good of you!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. Not at all, sir. We felt that you would almost certainly have
      good reasons of your own which would put the matter in quite a different
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Good reasons? I should think so! I tell you&mdash;a very little
      more of this liberty&mdash;licence I call it&mdash;and there isn't a man
      who'll be able to call himself head of a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. [Encouragingly] Quite!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. If the law thinks it can back up revolt, it's damned well
      mistaken. I struck my daughter&mdash;I was in a passion, as you would have
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. [Encouraging] I'm sure&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Glaring at him] Well, I don't know that you would; you look a
      soft sort; but any man with any blood in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. Can one ask what she was doing, sir? We couldn't get that
      point quite clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Doing? I just had my arm round my wife, trying to induce her to
      come home with me after a little family tiff, and this girl came at me. I
      lost my temper, and tapped her with my cane. And&mdash;that policeman
      brought by my own daughter&mdash;a policeman! If the law is going to enter
      private houses and abrogate domestic authority, where the hell shall we
      be?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. [Encouraging] No, I'm sure&mdash;I'm sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. The maudlin sentimentality in these days is absolutely rotting
      this country. A man can't be master in his own house, can't require his
      wife to fulfil her duties, can't attempt to control the conduct of his
      daughters, without coming up against it and incurring odium. A man can't
      control his employees; he can't put his foot down on rebellion anywhere,
      without a lot of humanitarians and licence-lovers howling at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. Excellent, Sir; excellent!
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Excellent? It's damnable. Here am I&mdash;a man who's always
      tried to do his duty in private life and public&mdash;brought up before
      the Bench&mdash; my God! because I was doing that duty; with a little too
      much zeal, perhaps&mdash;I'm not an angel!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. No! No! of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. A proper Englishman never is. But there are no proper Englishmen
      nowadays.

      RALPH. [Suddenly] As I look at faces&mdash;

    <p>
      BUILDER. [Absorbed] What! I told this young man I wasn't an angel.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. [Drawing him on] Yes, Sir; I quite understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. If the law thinks it can force me to be one of your weak-kneed
      sentimentalists who let everybody do what they like&mdash;

    <p>
      RALPH. There are a good many who stand on their rights left, John.

    <p>
      BUILDER. [Absorbed] What! How can men stand on their rights left?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. I'm afraid you had a painful experience, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Every kind of humiliation. I spent the night in a stinking cell.
      I haven't eaten since breakfast yesterday. Did they think I was going to
      eat the muck they shoved in? And all because in a moment of anger&mdash;which
      I regret, I regret!&mdash;I happened to strike my daughter, who was
      interfering between me and my wife. The thing would be funny if it weren't
      so disgusting. A man's house used to be sanctuary. What is it now? With
      all the world poking their noses in?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stands before the fire with his head bent, excluding as it were his
      interviewer and all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. [Preparing to go] Thank you very much, Mr Builder. I'm sure I
      can do you justice. Would you like to see a proof?

    <p>
      BUILDER. [Half conscious of him] What?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. Or will you trust me?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. I wouldn't trust you a yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOURNALIST. [At the door] Very well, sir; you shall have a proof, I
      promise. Good afternoon, and thank you.

      and others.

      my married life I've put a curb on myself for the sake of respectability.

      don't want that! [He draws her close] You can sit on my knee now.

        BUILDER's study is dim and neglected-looking; the window is still open,
        though it has become night. A street lamp outside shines in, and the end
        of its rays fall on BUILDER asleep. He is sitting in a high chair at the
        fireside end of the writing-table, with his elbows on it, and his cheek
        resting on his hand. He is still unshaven, and his clothes unchanged. A
        Boy's head appears above the level of the window-sill, as if beheaded
        and fastened there.

        other hand, makes a sweep before his face, as if to brush away a

        gloomily before him. The door from the hall is opened and TOPPING comes
        in with a long envelope in his hand.

      BUILDER. Did I say that? Muck! Muck! [He drops the proof, sits a moment
      moving his head and rubbing one hand uneasily on the surface of the table,
      then reaches out for the telephone receiver] Town, 245. [Pause] The
      "Comet"? John Builder. Give me the Editor. [Pause] That you, Mr Editor?
      John Builder speaking. That interview. I've got the proof. It won't do.
      Scrap the whole thing, please. I don't want to say anything. [Pause] Yes.
      I know I said it all; I can't help that. [Pause] No; I've changed my mind.
      Scrap it, please. [Pause] No, I will not say anything. [Pause] You can say
      what you dam' well please. [Pause] I mean it; if you put a word into my
      mouth, I'll sue you for defamation of character. It's undignified muck.
      I'm tearing it up. Good-night. [He replaces the receiver, and touches a

      note. Take my resignations.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [In relieved embarrassment] That's right. We must face your
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [With a touch of grim humour] I never yet met a man who couldn't
      face another man's position.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. After all, what is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. Splendid isolation. No wife, no daughters, no Councillorship, no
      Magistracy, no future&mdash;[With a laugh] not even a French maid. And
      why? Because I tried to exercise a little wholesome family authority.
      That's the position you're facing, Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. Dear, dear! You're devilish bitter, Builder. It's unfortunate, this
      publicity. But it'll all blow over; and you'll be back where you were.
      You've a good sound practical sense underneath your temper. [A pause]
      Come, now! [A pause] Well, I'll say good-night, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You shall have them in writing tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAYOR. [With sincerity] Come! Shake 'ands.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER, after a long look, holds out his hand. The two men exchange a
      grip.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The MAYOR, turning abruptly, goes out. BUILDER remains motionless for a
        minute, then resumes his seat at the side of the writing table, leaning
        his head on his hands. The Boy's head is again seen rising above the
        level of the window-sill, and another and another follows, till the
        three, as if decapitated, heads are seen in a row.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BOYS' VOICES. [One after another in a whispered crescendo] Johnny Builder!
      Johnny Builder! Johnny Builder!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        BUILDER rises, turns and stares at them. The THREE HEADS disappear, and
        a Boy's voice cries shrilly: "Johnny Builder!" BUILDER moves towards the
        window; voices are now crying in various pitches and keys: "Johnny
        Builder!" "Beatey Builder!" "Beat 'is wife-er!" "Beatey Builder!"
        BUILDER stands quite motionless, staring, with the street lamp lighting
        up a queer, rather pitiful defiance on his face. The voices swell. There
        comes a sudden swish and splash of water, and broken yells of dismay.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TOPPING'S VOICE. Scat! you young devils!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The sound of scuffling feet and a long-drawnout and distant "Miaou!"
        BUILDER stirs, shuts the window, draws the curtains, goes to the
        armchair before the fireplace and sits down in it. TOPPING enters with a
        little tray on which is a steaming jug of fluid, some biscuits and a
        glass. He comes stealthily up level with the chair. BUILDER stirs and
        looks up at him.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TOPPING. Excuse me, sir, you must 'ave digested yesterday morning's
      breakfast by now&mdash;must live to eat, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. All right. Put it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. [Putting the tray down on the table and taking up BUILDER'S pipe]
      I fair copped those young devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. You're a good fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOPPING. [Filling the pipe] You'll excuse me, sir; the Missis&mdash;has
      come back, sir&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        BUILDER stares at him and TOPPING stops. He hands BUILDER the filled
        pipe and a box of matches.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [With a shiver] Light the fire, Topping. I'm chilly.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        While TOPPING lights the fire BUILDER puts the pipe in his mouth and
        applies a match to it. TOPPING, having lighted the fire, turns to go,
        gets as far as half way, then comes back level with the table and
        regards the silent brooding figure in the chair.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Suddenly] Give me that paper on the table. No; the other one&mdash;the
      Will.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        TOPPING takes up the Will and gives it to him.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TOPPING. [With much hesitation] Excuse me, sir. It's pluck that get's 'em
      'ome, sir&mdash;begging your pardon.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        BUILDER has resumed his attitude and does not answer.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      [In a voice just touched with feeling] Good-night, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [Without turning his head] Good-night.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        TOPPING has gone. BUILDER sits drawing at his pipe between the firelight
        and the light from the standard lamp. He takes the pipe out of his mouth
        and a quiver passes over his face. With a half angry gesture he rubs the
        back of his hand across his eyes.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BUILDER. [To himself] Pluck! Pluck! [His lips quiver again. He presses
      them hard together, puts his pipe back into his mouth, and, taking the
      Will, thrusts it into the newly-lighted fire and holds it there with a
      poker.]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        While he is doing this the door from the hall is opened quietly, and MRS
        BUILDER enters without his hearing her. She has a work bag in her hand.
        She moves slowly to the table, and stands looking at him. Then going up
        to the curtains she mechanically adjusts them, and still keeping her
        eyes on BUILDER, comes down to the table and pours out his usual glass
        of whisky toddy. BUILDER, who has become conscious of her presence,
        turns in his chair as she hands it to him. He sits a moment motionless,
        then takes it from her, and squeezes her hand. MRS BUILDER goes silently
        to her usual chair below the fire, and taking out some knitting begins
        to knit. BUILDER makes an effort to speak, does not succeed, and sits
        drawing at his pipe. The CURTAIN falls.

 one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
 (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
 Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
 charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
 do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
 rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
 such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
 research.  They may be modified and printed and given away&mdash;you may do
 practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
 subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
 redistribution.

 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
 http://gutenberg.net/license).

 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic works

 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 States.

 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 copied or distributed:

 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 1.E.9.

 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm License.

 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 that

 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
      License.  You must require such a user to return or
      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
      Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
      of receipt of the work.

 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.

 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGE.

 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 opportunities to fix the problem.

 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
