    <h2>
      ACT I
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The MARCH'S dining-room opens through French windows on one of those
        gardens which seem infinite, till they are seen to be coterminous with
        the side walls of the house, and finite at the far end, because only the
        thick screen of acacias and sumachs prevents another house from being
        seen. The French and other windows form practically all the outer wall
        of that dining-room, and between them and the screen of trees lies the
        difference between the characters of Mr and Mrs March, with dots and
        dashes of Mary and Johnny thrown in. For instance, it has been
        formalised by MRS MARCH but the grass has not been cut by MR MARCH, and
        daffodils have sprung up there, which MRS MARCH desires for the
        dining-room, but of which MR MARCH says: "For God's sake, Joan, let them
        grow." About half therefore are now in a bowl on the breakfast table,
        and the other half still in the grass, in the compromise essential to
        lasting domesticity. A hammock under the acacias shows that MARY lies
        there sometimes with her eyes on the gleam of sunlight that comes
        through: and a trail in the longish grass, bordered with cigarette ends,
        proves that JOHNNY tramps there with his eyes on the ground or the
        stars, according. But all this is by the way, because except for a yard
        or two of gravel terrace outside the windows, it is all painted on the
        backcloth. The MARCHES have been at breakfast, and the round table,
        covered with blue linen, is thick with remains, seven baskets full. The
        room is gifted with old oak furniture: there is a door, stage Left,
        Forward; a hearth, where a fire is burning, and a high fender on which
        one can sit, stage Right, Middle; and in the wall below the fireplace, a
        service hatch covered with a sliding shutter, for the passage of dishes
        into the adjoining pantry. Against the wall, stage Left, is an old oak
        dresser, and a small writing table across the Left Back corner. MRS
        MARCH still sits behind the coffee pot, making up her daily list on
        tablets with a little gold pencil fastened to her wrist. She is
        personable, forty-eight, trim, well-dressed, and more matter-of-fact
        than seems plausible. MR MARCH is sitting in an armchair, sideways to
        the windows, smoking his pipe and reading his newspaper, with little
        explosions to which no one pays any attention, because it is his daily
        habit. He is a fine-looking man of fifty odd, with red-grey moustaches
        and hair, both of which stiver partly by nature and partly because his
        hands often push them up. MARY and JOHNNY are close to the fireplace,
        stage Right. JOHNNY sits on the fender, smoking a cigarette and warming
        his back. He is a commonplace looking young man, with a decided jaw,
        tall, neat, soulful, who has been in the war and writes poetry. MARY is
        less ordinary; you cannot tell exactly what is the matter with her. She
        too is tall, a little absent, fair, and well-looking. She has a small
        china dog in her hand, taken from the mantelpiece, and faces the
        audience. As the curtain rises she is saying in her soft and pleasant
        voice: "Well, what is the matter with us all, Johnny?"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Stuck, as we were in the trenches&mdash;like china dogs. [He
      points to the ornament in her hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Into his newspaper] Damn these people!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. If there isn't an ideal left, Johnny, it's no good pretending one.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. That's what I'm saying: Bankrupt!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. What do you want?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [To herself] Mutton cutlets. Johnny, will you be in to lunch?
      [JOHNNY shakes his head] Mary? [MARY nods] Geof?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Into his paper] Swine!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. That'll be three. [To herself] Spinach.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. If you'd just missed being killed for three blooming years for no
      spiritual result whatever, you'd want something to bite on, Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Jotting] Soap.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. What price the little and weak, now? Freedom and
      self-determination, and all that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Forty to one&mdash;no takers.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. It doesn't seem to worry you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Well, what's the good?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Oh, you're a looker on, Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [To his newspaper] Of all Godforsaken time-servers!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MARY is moved so lar as to turn and look over his shoulder a minute.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Who?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Only the Old-Un.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. This is absolutely Prussian!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Soup, lobster, chicken salad. Go to Mrs Hunt's.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. And this fellow hasn't the nous to see that if ever there were a
      moment when it would pay us to take risks, and be generous&mdash;My hat!
      He ought to be&mdash;knighted! [Resumes his paper.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. [Muttering] You see, even Dad can't suggest chivalry without
      talking of payment for it. That shows how we've sunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [Contemptuously] Chivalry! Pouf! Chivalry was "off" even before the
      war, Johnny. Who wants chivalry?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Of all shallow-pated humbug&mdash;that sneering at chivalry's the
      worst. Civilisation&mdash;such as we've got&mdash;is built on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [Airily] Then it's built on sand. [She sits beside him on the
      fender.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Sneering and smartness! Pah!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [Roused] I'll tell you what, Johnny, it's mucking about with
      chivalry that makes your poetry rotten. [JOHNNY seizes her arm and twists
      it] Shut up&mdash;that hurts. [JOHNNY twists it more] You brute! [JOHNNY
      lets her arm go.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Ha! So you don't mind taking advantage of the fact that you can
      cheek me with impunity, because you're weaker. You've given the whole show
      away, Mary. Abolish chivalry and I'll make you sit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. What are you two quarrelling about? Will you bring home
      cigarettes, Johnny&mdash;not Bogdogunov's Mamelukes&mdash;something more
      Anglo-American.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. All right! D'you want any more illustrations, Mary?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Pig! [She has risen and stands rubbing her arm and recovering her
      placidity, which is considerable.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Geof, can you eat preserved peaches?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Hell! What a policy! Um?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Can you eat preserved peaches?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Yes. [To his paper] Making the country stink in the eyes of the
      world!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Nostrils, Dad, nostrils.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MR MARCH wriggles, half hearing.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. [Muttering] Shallow idiots! Thinking we can do without chivalry!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I'm doing my best to get a parlourmaid, to-day, Mary, but these
      breakfast things won't clear themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. I'll clear them, Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Good! [She gets up. At the door] Knitting silk.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She goes out.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Mother hasn't an ounce of idealism. You might make her see stars,
      but never in the singular.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [To his paper] If God doesn't open the earth soon&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Is there anything special, Dad?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. This sulphurous government. [He drops the paper] Give me a
      match, Mary.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As soon as the paper is out of his hands he becomes a different&mdash;an
        affable man.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MARY. [Giving him a match] D'you mind writing in here this morning, Dad?
      Your study hasn't been done. There's nobody but Cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Lighting his pipe] Anywhere.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He slews the armchair towards the fire.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MARY. I'll get your things, then.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She goes out.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. [Still on the fender] What do you say, Dad? Is civilisation built
      on chivalry or on self-interest?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. The question is considerable, Johnny. I should say it was built
      on contract, and jerry-built at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Yes; but why do we keep contracts when we can break them with
      advantage and impunity?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. But do we keep them?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Well&mdash;say we do; otherwise you'll admit there isn't such a
      thing as civilisation at all. But why do we keep them? For instance, why
      don't we make Mary and Mother work for us like Kafir women? We could lick
      them into it. Why did we give women the vote? Why free slaves; why
      anything decent for the little and weak?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Well, you might say it was convenient for people living in
      communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. I don't think it's convenient at all. I should like to make Mary
      sweat. Why not jungle law, if there's nothing in chivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Chivalry is altruism, Johnny. Of course it's quite a question
      whether altruism isn't enlightened self-interest!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Oh! Damn!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The lank and shirt-sleeved figure of MR BLY, with a pail of water and
        cloths, has entered, and stands near the window, Left.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BLY. Beg pardon, Mr March; d'you mind me cleanin' the winders here?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Not a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Bankrupt of ideals. That's it!
    </p>

      MR MARCH. [Relighting his pipe and preparing his materials] What do you
      think of things, Mr Bly?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Not much, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Ah! [He looks up at MR BLY, struck by his large philosophical
      eyes and moth-eaten moustache] Nor I.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. I rather thought that, sir, from your writin's.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Oh! Do you read?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. I was at sea, once&mdash;formed the 'abit.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Read any of my novels?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Not to say all through&mdash;I've read some of your articles in the
      Sunday papers, though. Make you think!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. I'm at sea now&mdash;don't see dry land anywhere, Mr Bly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [With a smile] That's right.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. D'you find that the general impression?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. No. People don't think. You 'ave to 'ave some cause for thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Cause enough in the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. It's nearer 'ome with me. I've often thought I'd like a talk with
      you, sir. But I'm keepin' you. [He prepares to swab the pane.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Not at all. I enjoy it. Anything to put off work.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Looking at MR MARCH, then giving a wipe at the window] What's drink
      to one is drought to another. I've seen two men take a drink out of the
      same can&mdash;one die of it and the other get off with a pain in his
      stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. You've seen a lot, I expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Ah! I've been on the beach in my day. [He sponges at the window] It's
      given me a way o' lookin' at things that I don't find in other people.
      Look at the 'Ome Office. They got no philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Pricking his ears] What? Have you had dealings with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Over the reprieve that was got up for my daughter. But I'm keepin'
      you.

    <p>
      MR MARCH. Reprieve?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Ah! She was famous at eighteen. The Sunday Mercury was full of her,
      when she was in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Delicately] Dear me! I'd no idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. She's out now; been out a fortnight. I always say that fame's
      ephemereal. But she'll never settle to that weavin'. Her head got turned a
      bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. I'm afraid I'm in the dark, Mr Bly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Pausing&mdash;dipping his sponge in the pail and then standing with
      it in his hand] Why! Don't you remember the Bly case? They sentenced 'er
      to be 'anged by the neck until she was dead, for smotherin' her baby. She
      was only eighteen at the time of speakin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Oh! yes! An inhuman business!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. All! The jury recommended 'er to mercy. So they reduced it to Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Life! Sweet Heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. That's what I said; so they give her two years. I don't hold with the
      Sunday Mercury, but it put that over. It's a misfortune to a girl to be
      good-lookin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Rumpling his hair] No, no! Dash it all! Beauty's the only thing
      left worth living for.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Well, I like to see green grass and a blue sky; but it's a mistake in
      a 'uman bein'. Look at any young chap that's good-lookin'&mdash;'e's
      doomed to the screen, or hair-dressin'. Same with the girls. My girl went
      into an 'airdresser's at seventeen and in six months she was in trouble.
      When I saw 'er with a rope round her neck, as you might say, I said to
      meself: "Bly," I said, "you're responsible for this. If she 'adn't been
      good-lookin'&mdash;it'd never 'eve 'appened."

    <p>
      MR MARCH. Your wife might not have thought that you were wholly the cause,
      Mr Bly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Ah! My wife. She's passed on. But Faith&mdash;that's my girl's name&mdash;she
      never was like 'er mother; there's no 'eredity in 'er on that side.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. What sort of girl is she?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. One for colour&mdash;likes a bit o' music&mdash;likes a dance, and a
      flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [Interrupting softly] Dad, I was going to clear, but I'll come back
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Come here and listen to this! Here's a story to get your blood
      up! How old was the baby, Mr Bly?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Two days&mdash;'ardly worth mentionin'. They say she 'ad the
      'ighstrikes after&mdash;an' when she comes to she says: "I've saved my
      baby's life." An' that's true enough when you come to think what that sort
      o' baby goes through as a rule; dragged up by somebody else's hand, or
      took away by the Law. What can a workin' girl do with a baby born under
      the rose, as they call it? Wonderful the difference money makes when it
      comes to bein' outside the Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Right you are, Mr Bly. God's on the side of the big battalions.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Ah! Religion! [His eyes roll philosophically] Did you ever read
      'Aigel?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Hegel, or Haekel?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Yes; with an aitch. There's a balance abart 'im that I like. There's
      no doubt the Christian religion went too far. Turn the other cheek! What
      oh! An' this Anti-Christ, Neesha, what came in with the war&mdash;he went
      too far in the other direction. Neither of 'em practical men. You've got
      to strike a balance, and foller it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Balance! Not much balance about us. We just run about and jump
      Jim Crow.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [With a perfunctory wipe] That's right; we 'aven't got a faith these
      days. But what's the use of tellin' the Englishman to act like an angel.
      He ain't either an angel or a blond beast. He's between the two, an
      'ermumphradite. Take my daughter&mdash;&mdash;If I was a blond beast, I'd
      turn 'er out to starve; if I was an angel, I'd starve meself to learn her
      the piano. I don't do either. Why? Becos my instincts tells me not.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Yes, but my doubt is whether our instincts at this moment of the
      world's history are leading us up or down.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. What is up and what is down? Can you answer me that? Is it up or down
      to get so soft that you can't take care of yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Down.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Well, is it up or down to get so 'ard that you can't take care of
      others?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Down.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Well, there you are!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARCH. Then our instincts are taking us down?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Nao. They're strikin' a balance, unbeknownst, all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. You're a philosopher, Mr Bly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Modestly] Well, I do a bit in that line, too. In my opinion Nature
      made the individual believe he's goin' to live after'e's dead just to keep
      'im livin' while 'es alive&mdash;otherwise he'd 'a died out.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Quite a thought&mdash;quite a thought!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. But I go one better than Nature. Follow your instincts is my motto.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Excuse me, Mr Bly, I think Nature got hold of that before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Slightly chilled] Well, I'm keepin' you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Not at all. You're a believer in conscience, or the little voice
      within. When my son was very small, his mother asked him once if he didn't
      hear a little voice within, telling him what was right. [MR MARCH touches
      his diaphragm] And he said "I often hear little voices in here, but they
      never say anything." [MR BLY cannot laugh, but he smiles] Mary, Johnny
      must have been awfully like the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. As a matter of fact, I've got my daughter here&mdash;in obeyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Where? I didn't catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. In the kitchen. Your Cook told me you couldn't get hold of an 'ouse
      parlour-maid. So I thought it was just a chance&mdash;you bein'
      broadminded.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Oh! I see. What would your mother say, Mary?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Mother would say: "Has she had experience?"
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. I've told you about her experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Yes, but&mdash;as a parlour-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Well! She can do hair. [Observing the smile exchanged between MR
      MARCH and MARY] And she's quite handy with a plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Tentatively] I'm a little afraid my wife would feel&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. You see, in this weavin' shop&mdash;all the girls 'ave 'ad to be in
      trouble, otherwise they wouldn't take 'em. [Apologetically towards MARY]
      It's a kind of a disorderly 'ouse without the disorders. Excusin' the
      young lady's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Oh! You needn't mind me, Mr Bly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. And so you want her to come here? H'm!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Well I remember when she was a little bit of a thing&mdash;no higher
      than my knee&mdash;[He holds out his hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Suddenly moved] My God! yes. They've all been that. [To MARY]
      Where's your mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Gone to Mrs Hunt's. Suppose she's engaged one, Dad?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Well, it's only a month's wages.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [Softly] She won't like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Well, let's see her, Mr Bly; let's see her, if you don't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Oh, I don't mind, sir, and she won't neither; she's used to bein'
      inspected by now. Why! she 'ad her bumps gone over just before she came
      out!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Touched on the raw again] H'm! Too bad! Mary, go and fetch her.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MARY, with a doubting smile, goes out. [Rising] You might give me the
        details of that trial, Mr Bly. I'll see if I can't write something
        that'll make people sit up. That's the way to send Youth to hell! How
        can a child who's had a rope round her neck&mdash;!
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BLY. [Who has been fumbling in his pocket, produces some yellow
      paper-cuttings clipped together] Here's her references&mdash;the whole
      literature of the case. And here's a letter from the chaplain in one of
      the prisons sayin' she took a lot of interest in him; a nice young man, I
      believe. [He suddenly brushes a tear out of his eye with the back of his
      hand] I never thought I could 'a felt like I did over her bein' in prison.
      Seemed a crool senseless thing&mdash;that pretty girl o' mine. All over a
      baby that hadn't got used to bein' alive. Tain't as if she'd been
      follerin' her instincts; why, she missed that baby something crool.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Of course, human life&mdash;even an infant's&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. I know you've got to 'ave a close time for it. But when you come to
      think how they take 'uman life in Injia and Ireland, and all those other
      places, it seems 'ard to come down like a cartload o' bricks on a bit of a
      girl that's been carried away by a moment's abiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Who is reading the cuttings] H'm! What hypocrites we are!
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Ah! And 'oo can tell 'oo's the father? She never give us his name. I
      think the better of 'er for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Shake hands, Mr Bly. So do I. [BLY wipes his hand, and MR MARCH
      shakes it] Loyalty's loyalty&mdash;especially when we men benefit by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. That's right, sir.

    <blockquote>

        at the moment. At this moment it is obviously best for her to look at

      down with a crash.

      of power, and blood when they're in. And Lord! 'ow they do abuse other
      Governments for doin' the things they do themselves. Excuse me, I'll want

      now, and come back presently and do these other winders. You can talk it

        another little soft look at MR MARCH, as she and MR BLY go out.

      MR MARCH. Well, Mary, have I done it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. You have, Dad.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Running his hands through his hair] Pathetic little figure!
      Such infernal inhumanity!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. How are you going to put it to mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Tell her the story, and pitch it strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Mother's not impulsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. We must tell her, or she'll think me mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. She'll do that, anyway, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Here she is! Stand by!

      MR MARCH. Well, what luck?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. None.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Unguardedly] Good!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Cheerfully] Well, the fact is, Mary and I have caught one for
      'you; Mr Bly's daughter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Are you out of your senses? Don't you know that she's the girl
      who&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. That's it. She wants a lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Geof!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Well, don't we want a maid?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Ineffably] Ridiculous!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. We tested her, didn't we, Mary?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Crossing to the bell, and ringing] You'll just send for Mr Bly
      and get rid of her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Joan, if we comfortable people can't put ourselves a little out
      of the way to give a helping hand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. To girls who smother their babies?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Joan, I revolt. I won't be a hypocrite and a Pharisee.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Well, for goodness sake let me be one.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [As the door opens]. Here's Cook!
    </p>

    <p>
      COOK. Did you ring, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. We're in a moral difficulty, Cook, so naturally we come to you.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        COOK beams.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Impatiently] Nothing of the sort, Cook; it's a question of
      common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Yes, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. That girl, Faith Bly, wants to come here as parlour-maid.
      Absurd!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARCH. You know her story, Cook? I want to give the poor girl a chance.
      Mrs March thinks it's taking chances. What do you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      COCK. Of course, it is a risk, sir; but there! you've got to take 'em to
      get maids nowadays. If it isn't in the past, it's in the future. I daresay
      I could learn 'er.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. It's not her work, Cook, it's her instincts. A girl who
      smothered a baby that she oughtn't to have had&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Remonstrant] If she hadn't had it how could she have smothered
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. [Soothingly] Perhaps she's repented, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Of course she's repented. But did you ever know repentance
      change anybody, Cook?
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. [Smiling] Well, generally it's a way of gettin' ready for the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. If we never get another chance because we repent&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. I always think of Master Johnny, ma'am, and my jam; he used to
      repent so beautiful, dear little feller&mdash;such a conscience! I never
      could bear to lock it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Cook, you're wandering. I'm surprised at your encouraging the
      idea; I really am.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Cook plaits her hands.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Cook's been in the family longer than I have&mdash;haven't you,
      Cook? [COOK beams] She knows much more about a girl like that than we do.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. We had a girl like her, I remember, in your dear mother's time, Mr
      Geoffrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. How did she turn out?
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Oh! She didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. There!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Well, I can't bear behaving like everybody else. Don't you think
      we might give her a chance, Cook?
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. My 'eart says yes, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. And my 'ead says no, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Strike your balance, Cook.

    <p>
      Well?... I didn't catch the little voice within.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Ask Master Johnny, sir; he's been in the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [To MARY] Get Johnny.

    <blockquote>

    <p>
      MRS MARCH. What on earth has the war to do with it?
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. The things he tells me, ma'am, is too wonderful for words. He's 'ad
      to do with prisoners and generals, every sort of 'orror.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Cook's quite right. The war destroyed all our ideals and
      probably created the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. It didn't smother it; or condemn the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Running his hands through his hair] The more I think of that&mdash;!
      [He turns away.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Indicating her husband] You see, Cook, that's the mood in
      which I have to engage a parlour-maid. What am I to do with your master?
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. It's an 'ealthy rage, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I'm tired of being the only sober person in this house.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. [Reproachfully] Oh! ma'am, I never touch a drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I didn't mean anything of that sort. But they do break out so.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Not Master Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Johnny! He's the worst of all. His poetry is nothing but one
      long explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Coming from the window] I say We ought to have faith and jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. If we do have Faith, we shall jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. [Blankly] Of course, in the Bible they 'ad faith, and just look what
      it did to them!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. I mean faith in human instincts, human nature, Cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. [Scandalised] Oh! no, sir, not human nature; I never let that get
      the upper hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. You talk to Mr Bly. He's a remarkable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. I do, sir, every fortnight when he does the kitchen windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Well, doesn't he impress you?
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Ah! When he's got a drop o' stout in 'im&mdash;Oh! dear! [She smiles
      placidly.]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        JOHNNY has come in.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Well, Johnny, has Mary told you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Looking at his face] Now, my dear boy, don't be hasty and
      foolish!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Of course you ought to take her, Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Fixing him] Have you seen her, Johnny?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. She's in the hall, poor little devil, waiting for her sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. There are plenty of other chances, Johnny. Why on earth should
      we&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Mother, it's just an instance. When something comes along that
      takes a bit of doing&mdash;Give it to the other chap!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Bravo, Johnny!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Drily] Let me see, which of us will have to put up with her
      shortcomings&mdash;Johnny or I?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. She looks quick, Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Girls pick up all sorts of things in prison. We can hardly
      expect her to be honest. You don't mind that, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. It's a chance to make something decent out of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I can't understand this passion for vicarious heroism, Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Vicarious!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Well, where do you come in? You'll make poems about the
      injustice of the Law. Your father will use her in a novel. She'll wear
      Mary's blouses, and everybody will be happy&mdash;except Cook and me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Hang it all, Joan, you might be the Great Public itself!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I am&mdash;get all the kicks and none of the ha'pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. We'll all help you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. For Heaven's sake&mdash;no, Johnny!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Well, make up your mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. It was made up long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. [Gloomily] The more I see of things the more disgusting they seem.
      I don't see what we're living for. All right. Chuck the girl out, and
      let's go rooting along with our noses in the dirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Steady, Johnny!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Well, Dad, there was one thing anyway we learned out there&mdash;
      When a chap was in a hole&mdash;to pull him out, even at a risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. There are people who&mdash;the moment you pull them out&mdash;jump
      in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. We can't tell till we've tried, Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. It's wonderful the difference good food'll make, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Well, you're all against me. Have it your own way, and when you
      regret it&mdash;remember me!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. We will&mdash;we will! That's settled, then. Bring her in and
      tell her. We'll go on to the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He goes out through the window, followed by JOHNNY.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [Opening the door] Come in, please.

      us, I hear.

    <p>
      FAITH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. And you don't know much?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. No.

    <p>
      COOK. [Softly] Say ma'am, dearie.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Cook is going to do her best for you. Are you going to do yours
      for us?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. [With a quick look up] Yes&mdash;ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Can you begin at once?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Well, then, Cook will show you where things are kept, and how
      to lay the table and that. Your wages will be thirty until we see where we
      are. Every other Sunday, and Thursday afternoon. What about dresses?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. [Looking at her dress] I've only got this&mdash;I had it before, of
      course, it hasn't been worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Very neat. But I meant for the house. You've no money, I
      suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. Only one pound thirteen, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. We shall have to find you some dresses, then. Cook will take
      you to-morrow to Needham's. You needn't wear a cap unless you like. Well,
      I hope you'll get on. I'll leave you with Cook now.

      spirits in the tantaliser 'tisn't ever kept locked, in case Master Johnny
      should bring a friend in. Have you noticed Master Johnny? [FAITH nods] Ah!
      He's a dear boy; and wonderful high-principled since he's been in the war.
      He'll come to me sometimes and say: "Cook, we're all going to the devil!"

      my young days [Pulling out a drawer] Here's the napkins. You change the
      master's every day at least because of his moustache and the others every
      two days, but always clean ones Sundays. Did you keep Sundays in there?

      FAITH. Twenty.

    <p>
      COOK. Think of that&mdash;and such a life! Now, dearie, I'm your friend.
      Let the present bury the past&mdash;as the sayin' is. Forget all about
      yourself, and you'll be a different girl in no time.

        pail and cloths, appears outside.

    <p>
      BLY. [Preparing to work, while FAITH prepares to set the salt cellars] So
      you've got it! You never know your luck. Up to-day and down to-morrow.
      I'll 'ave a glass over this to-night. What d'you get?

    <p>
      FAITH. Thirty.

    <p>
      BLY. It's not the market price, still, you're not the market article. Now,
      put a good heart into it and get to know your job; you'll find Cook full
      o' philosophy if you treat her right&mdash;she can make a dumplin' with
      anybody. But look 'ere; you confine yourself to the ladies!

    <p>
      FAITH. I don't want your advice, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. I know parents are out of date; still, I've put up with a lot on your
      account, so gimme a bit of me own back.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. I don't know whether I shall like this. I've been shut up so long.
      I want to see some life.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Well, that's natural. But I want you to do well. I suppose you'll be
      comin' 'ome to fetch your things to-night?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. I'll have a flower for you. What'd you like&mdash;daffydils?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. No; one with a scent to it.

    <p>
      FAITH. [A little touched] Did you? Did you really?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Ah! I suppose I've drunk more glasses over your bein' in there than
      over anything that ever 'appened to me. Why! I couldn't relish the war for
      it! And I suppose you 'ad none to relish. Well, it's over. So, put an
      'eart into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. I'll try.

    <p>
      BLY. "There's compensation for everything," 'Aigel says. At least, if it
      wasn't 'Aigel it was one o' the others. I'll move on to the study now. Ah!
      He's got some winders there lookin' right over the country. And a
      wonderful lot o' books, if you feel inclined for a read one of these days.

      BLY. [Raising himself] I'd like to shake your 'and, sir. [They shake
      hands] It's a great weight off my mind.

    <p>
      MR MARCH. It's rather a weight on my wife's, I'm afraid. But we must hope
      for the best. The country wants rain, but&mdash;I doubt if we shall get it
      with this Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Ah! We want the good old times-when you could depend on the seasons.
      The further you look back the more dependable the times get; 'ave you
      noticed that, sir?

    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Suddenly] Suppose they'd hanged your daughter, Mr Bly. What
      would you have done?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Well, to be quite frank, I should 'ave got drunk on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Public opinion's always in advance of the Law. I think your
      daughter's a most pathetic little figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Her looks are against her. I never found a man that didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [A little disconcerted] Well, we'll try and give her a good show
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Taking up his pail] I'm greatly obliged; she'll appreciate anything
      you can do for her. [He moves to the door and pauses there to say] Fact is&mdash;her
      winders wants cleanin', she 'ad a dusty time in there.

    <p>
      MARY. Then only Mother hasn't.

    <p>
      MR MARCH. I've always found your mother extremely good at seeming not to
      notice things, Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Faith! She's got on very fast this fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. The glad eye, Mary. I got it that first morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. You, Dad?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. No, no! Johnny got it, and I got him getting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. What are you going to do about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. What does one do with a glad eye that belongs to some one else?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [Laughing] No. But, seriously, Dad, Johnny's not like you and me.
      Why not speak to Mr Bly?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Mr Bly's eyes are not glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Dad! Do be serious! Johnny's capable of anything except a sense of
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. The girl's past makes it impossible to say anything to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Well, I warn you. Johnny's very queer just now; he's in the "lose
      the world to save your soul" mood. It really is too bad of that girl.
      After all, we did what most people wouldn't.

      BLY. Very tryin' for winders. [Resting] My daughter givin' satisfaction, I
      hope?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [With difficulty] Er&mdash;in her work, I believe, coming on
      well. But the question is, Mr Bly, do&mdash;er&mdash;any of us ever really
      give satisfaction except to ourselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Taking it as an invitation to his philosophical vein] Ah! that's one
      as goes to the roots of 'uman nature. There's a lot of disposition in all
      of us. And what I always say is: One man's disposition is another man's
      indisposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. By George! Just hits the mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Filling his sponge] Question is: How far are you to give rein to
      your disposition? When I was in Durban, Natal, I knew a man who had the
      biggest disposition I ever come across. 'E struck 'is wife, 'e smoked
      opium, 'e was a liar, 'e gave all the rein 'e could, and yet withal one of
      the pleasantest men I ever met.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Perhaps in giving rein he didn't strike you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [With a big wipe, following his thought] He said to me once: "Joe,"
      he said, "if I was to hold meself in, I should be a devil." There's where
      you get it. Policemen, priests, prisoners. Cab'net Ministers, any one who
      leads an unnatural life, see how it twists 'em. You can't suppress a thing
      without it swellin' you up in another place.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. And the moral of that is&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Follow your instincts. You see&mdash;if I'm not keepin' you&mdash;now
      that we ain't got no faith, as we were sayin' the other day, no Ten
      Commandments in black an' white&mdash;we've just got to be 'uman bein's&mdash;
      raisin' Cain, and havin' feelin' hearts. What's the use of all these lofty
      ideas that you can't live up to? Liberty, Fraternity, Equality, Democracy&mdash;see
      what comes o' fightin' for 'em! 'Ere we are-wipin' out the lot. We thought
      they was fixed stars; they was only comets&mdash;hot air. No; trust 'uman
      nature, I say, and follow your instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. We were talking of your daughter&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. There's a case in point. Her instincts was starved goin' on for three
      years, because, mind you, they kept her hangin' about in prison months
      before they tried her. I read your article, and I thought to meself after
      I'd finished: Which would I feel smallest&mdash;if I was&mdash;the Judge,
      the Jury, or the 'Ome Secretary? It was a treat, that article! They ought
      to abolish that in'uman "To be hanged by the neck until she is dead." It's
      my belief they only keep it because it's poetry; that and the wigs&mdash;they're
      hard up for a bit of beauty in the Courts of Law. Excuse my 'and, sir; I
      do thank you for that article.

    <p>
      MR MARCH. But, apropos of your daughter, Mr Bly. I suppose none of us ever
      change our natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Again responding to the appeal that he senses to his philosophical
      vein] Ah! but 'oo can see what our natures are? Why, I've known people
      that could see nothin' but theirselves and their own families, unless they
      was drunk. At my daughter's trial, I see right into the lawyers, judge and
      all. There she was, hub of the whole thing, and all they could see of her
      was 'ow far she affected 'em personally&mdash;one tryin' to get 'er
      guilty, the other tryin' to get 'er off, and the judge summin' 'er up
      cold-blooded.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. But that's what they're paid for, Mr Bly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Ah! But which of 'em was thinkin' "'Ere's a little bit o' warm life
      on its own. 'Ere's a little dancin' creature. What's she feelin', wot's
      'er complaint?"&mdash;impersonal-like. I like to see a man do a bit of
      speculatin', with his mind off of 'imself, for once.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. "The man that hath not speculation in his soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. That's right, sir. When I see a mangy cat or a dog that's lost, or a
      fellow-creature down on his luck, I always try to put meself in his place.
      It's a weakness I've got.

        lilac-coloured linen, without a cap, and looks prettier than ever. She

      in the streets, after-being in there.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Well! Don't follow your instincts too much, that's all! I must get on
      to the drawin' room now. There's a shower comin'. [Philosophically] It's
      'ardly worth while to do these winders. You clean 'em, and they're dirty
      again in no time. It's like life. And people talk o' progress. What a
      sooperstition! Of course there ain't progress; it's a world-without-end
      affair. You've got to make up your mind to it, and not be discouraged. All
      this depression comes from 'avin' 'igh 'opes. 'Ave low 'opes, and you'll
      be all right.

        mirror a reflection of JOHNNY, who has come in. Her face grows just a
        little scared, as if she had caught the eye of a warder peering through
        the peep-hole of her cell door, then brazens, and slowly sweetens as she
        turns round to him.

      FAITH. Yes. [She puts back the flower] Ever so!

      FAITH. It's quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Ha! I wonder if you've got the feeling I have. We've both had
      hell, you know; I had three years of it, out there, and you've had three
      years of it here. The feeling that you can't catch up; can't live fast
      enough to get even.

    <p>
      JOHNNY. Beastly things, babies; and absolutely unnecessary in the present
      state of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. [With a faint smile] My baby wasn't beastly; but I&mdash;I got
      upset.

      JOHNNY. Well, I should think so!
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. My friend in the manicure came and told me about hers when I was
      lying in the hospital. She couldn't have it with her, so it got neglected
      and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Um! I believe that's quite common.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. And she told me about another girl&mdash;the Law took her baby from
      her. And after she was gone, I&mdash;got all worked up&mdash; [She
      hesitates, then goes swiftly on] And I looked at mine; it was asleep just
      here, quite close. I just put out my arm like that, over its face&mdash;quite
      soft&mdash; I didn't hurt it. I didn't really. [She suddenly swallows, and
      her lips quiver] I didn't feel anything under my arm. And&mdash;and a
      beast of a nurse came on me, and said "You've smothered your baby, you
      wretched girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't want to kill it&mdash;I only wanted to save it from living. And
      when I looked at it, I went off screaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. I nearly screamed when I saved my first German from living. I
      never felt the same again. They say the human race has got to go on, but I
      say they've first got to prove that the human race wants to. Would you
      rather be alive or dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. Alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. But would you have in prison?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. I don't know. You can't tell anything in there. [With sudden
      vehemence] I wish I had my baby back, though. It was mine; and I&mdash;I
      don't like thinking about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. I know. I hate to think about anything I've killed, really. At
      least, I should&mdash;but it's better not to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. I could have killed that judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Did he come the heavy father? That's what I can't stand. When they
      jaw a chap and hang him afterwards. Or was he one of the joking ones?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. I've sat in my cell and cried all night&mdash;night after night, I
      have. [With a little laugh] I cried all the softness out of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. You never believed they were going to hang you, did you?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. I didn't care if they did&mdash;not then.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. [With a reflective grunt] You had a much worse time than I. You
      were lonely&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. Have you been in a prison, ever?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. No, thank God!
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. It's awfully clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. You bet.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. And it's stone cold. It turns your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Ah! Did you ever see a stalactite?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. In caves. The water drops like tears, and each drop has some sort
      of salt, and leaves it behind till there's just a long salt petrified drip
      hanging from the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. Ah! [Staring at him] I used to stand behind my door. I'd stand
      there sometimes I don't know how long. I'd listen and listen&mdash;the
      noises are all hollow in a prison. You'd think you'd get used to being
      shut up, but I never did.

    <p>
      It's awful the feeling you get here-so tight and chokey. People who are
      free don't know what it's like to be shut up. If I'd had a proper window
      even&mdash;When you can see things living, it makes you feel alive.

    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. [Doubtful] No-o.... Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. At the corner out of the Regent. That's where we had our shop. I
      liked the hair-dressing. We had fun. Perhaps I've seen you before. Did you
      ever come in there?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. I'd go back there; only they wouldn't take me&mdash;I'm too
      conspicuous now.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. I expect you're well out of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. [With a sigh] But I did like it. I felt free. We had an hour off in
      the middle of the day; you could go where you liked; and then, after hours&mdash;I
      love the streets at night&mdash;all lighted. Olga&mdash;that's one of the
      other girls&mdash;and I used to walk about for hours. That's life! Fancy!
      I never saw a street for more than two years. Didn't you miss them in the
      war?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. I missed grass and trees more&mdash;the trees! All burnt, and
      splintered. Gah!
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. Yes, I like trees too; anything beautiful, you know. I think the
      parks are lovely&mdash;but they might let you pick the flowers. But the
      lights are best, really&mdash;they make you feel happy. And music&mdash;I
      love an organ. There was one used to come and play outside the prison&mdash;before
      I was tried. It sounded so far away and lovely. If I could 'ave met the
      man that played that organ, I'd have kissed him. D'you think he did it on
      purpose?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. He would have, if he'd been me.

      Damn it! We went into the war to save the little and weak; at least we
      said so; and look at us now! The bottom's out of all that. [Bitterly]
      There isn't a faith or an illusion left. Look here! I want to help you.

    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. [Blankly] Oh! I didn't mean her to.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Obviously.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. I&mdash;I&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Now go and pack up your things.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. He asked me to be a friend to him. He said he was lonely here.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Don't be ridiculous. Cook saw you kissing him with p&mdash;p&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. [Quickly] Not with pep.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I was going to say "passion." Now, go quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. Where am I to go?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. You will have four pounds, and you can get another place.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. How?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. That's hardly my affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. [Tossing her head] All right!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I'll speak to your father, if he isn't gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. Why do you send me away&mdash;just for a kiss! What's a kiss?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. That will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. [Desperately] He wanted to&mdash;to save me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. You know perfectly well people can only save themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. I don't care for your son; I've got a young&mdash;[She checks
      herself] I&mdash;I'll leave your son alone, if he leaves me.

    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Cook, if Mr Bly's still here, I want to see him. Oh! And it's
      three now. Have a cab at four o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. [Almost tearful] Oh, ma'am&mdash;anybody but Master Johnny, and I'd
      'ave been a deaf an' dummy. Poor girl! She's not responsive, I daresay.
      Suppose I was to speak to Master Johnny?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. No, no, Cook! Where's Mr Bly?
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. He's done his windows; he's just waiting for his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Then get him; and take that tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. I remember the master kissin' me, when he was a boy. But then he
      never meant anything; so different from Master Johnny. Master Johnny takes
      things to 'eart.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Just so, Cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. There's not an ounce of vice in 'im. It's all his goodness, dear
      little feller.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. That's the danger, with a girl like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. It's eatin' hearty all of a sudden that's made her poptious. But
      there, ma'am, try her again. Master Johnny'll be so cut up!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. No playing with fire, Cook. We were foolish to let her come.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Oh! dear, he will be angry with me. If you hadn't been in the
      kitchen and heard me, ma'am, I'd ha' let it pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. That would have been very wrong of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Ah! But I'd do a lot of wrong things for Master Johnny. There's
      always some one you'll go wrong for!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Well, get Mr Bly; and take that tray, there's a good soul.

    <p>
      BLY. Your service, ma'am!
    </p>

      MRS MARCH. [With embarrassment] I'm very sorry, Mr Bly, but circumstances
      over which I have no control&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [With deprecation] Ah! we all has them. The winders ought to be done
      once a week now the Spring's on 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. No, no; it's your daughter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Deeply] Not been given' way to'er instincts, I do trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Yes. I've just had to say good-bye to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Very blank] Nothing to do with property, I hope?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. No, no! Giddiness with my son. It's impossible; she really must
      learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Oh! but 'oo's to learn 'er? Couldn't you learn your son instead?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. No. My son is very high-minded.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. [Dubiously] I see. How am I goin' to get over this? Shall I tell you
      what I think, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I'm afraid it'll be no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. That's it. Character's born, not made. You can clean yer winders and
      clean 'em, but that don't change the colour of the glass. My father would
      have given her a good hidin', but I shan't. Why not? Because my glass
      ain't as thick as his. I see through it; I see my girl's temptations, I
      see what she is&mdash;likes a bit o' life, likes a flower, an' a dance.
      She's a natural morganatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. A what?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. Nothin'll ever make her regular. Mr March'll understand how I feel.
      Poor girl! In the mud again. Well, we must keep smilin'. [His face is as
      long as his arm] The poor 'ave their troubles, there's no doubt. [He turns
      to go] There's nothin' can save her but money, so as she can do as she
      likes. Then she wouldn't want to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I'm very sorry, but there it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. And I thought she was goin' to be a success here. Fact is, you can't
      see anything till it 'appens. There's winders all round, but you can't
      see. Follow your instincts&mdash;it's the only way.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. It hasn't helped your daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. I was speakin' philosophic! Well, I'll go 'ome now, and prepare
      meself for the worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Has Cook given you your money?
    </p>
    <p>
      BLY. She 'as.

    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Now, Johnny, be sensible. She's a very pretty girl, and this is
      my house.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Of course you think the worst. Trust anyone who wasn't in the war
      for that!

      MRS MARCH. I don't think either the better or the worse. Kisses are
      kisses!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Mother, you're like the papers&mdash;you put in all the vice and
      leave out all the virtue, and call that human nature. The kiss was an
      accident that I bitterly regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Johnny, how can you?
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Till next time.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Mother, you make me despair. You're so matter-of-fact, you never
      give one credit for a pure ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I know where ideals lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Into the soup. And the purer they are, the hotter the soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. And you married father!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I did.
    </p>

      JOHNNY. Well, that girl is not to be chucked out; won't have her on my
      chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. That's why she's going, Johnny.

    <p>
      MRS MARCH. How are you going to stop her?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Oh, I'll stop her right enough. If I stuck it out in Hell, I can
      stick it out in Highgate.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Johnny, listen. I've watched this girl; and I don't watch what
      I want to see&mdash;like your father&mdash;I watch what is. She's not a
      hard case&mdash;yet; but she will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. And why? Because all you matter-of-fact people make up your minds
      to it. What earthly chance has she had?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. She's a baggage. There are such things, you know, Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. She's a little creature who went down in the scrum and has been
      kicked about ever since.

      MRS MARCH. I'll give her money, if you'll keep her at arm's length.

    <p>
      Johnny, what is the use of wrapping the thing up in catchwords? Human
      touch! A young man like you never saved a girl like her. It's as fantastic
      as&mdash;as Tolstoi's "Resurrection."
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Tolstoi was the most truthful writer that ever lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Tolstoi was a Russian&mdash;always proving that what isn't, is.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Russians are charitable, anyway, and see into other people's
      souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. That's why they're hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Well&mdash;for cynicism&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. It's at least as important, Johnny, to see into ourselves as
      into other people. I've been trying to make your father understand that
      ever since we married. He'd be such a good writer if he did&mdash;he
      wouldn't write at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Father has imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. And no business to meddle with practical affairs. You and he
      always ride in front of the hounds. Do you remember when the war broke
      out, how angry you were with me because I said we were fighting from a
      sense of self-preservation? Well, weren't we?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. That's what I'm doing now, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Saving this girl, to save yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. I must have something decent to do sometimes. There isn't an ideal
      left.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. If you knew how tired I am of the word, Johnny!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. There are thousands who feel like me&mdash;that the bottom's out
      of everything. It sickens me that anything in the least generous should
      get sat on by all you people who haven't risked your lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [With a smile] I risked mine when you were born, Johnny. You
      were always very difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. That girl's been telling me&mdash;I can see the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. The fact that she suffered doesn't alter her nature; or the
      danger to you and us.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. There is no danger&mdash;I told her I didn't mean it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. And she smiled? Didn't she?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. I&mdash;I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. If you were ordinary, Johnny, it would be the girl's look-out.
      But you're not, and I'm not going to have you in the trap she'll set for
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. You think she's a designing minx. I tell you she's got no more
      design in her than a rabbit. She's just at the mercy of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. That's the trap. She'll play on your feelings, and you'll be
      caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. I'm not a baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. You are&mdash;and she'll smother you.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. How beastly women are to each other!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. We know ourselves, you see. The girl's father realises
      perfectly what she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Mr Bly is a dodderer. And she's got no mother. I'll bet you've
      never realised the life girls who get outed lead. I've seen them&mdash;I
      saw them in France. It gives one the horrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I can imagine it. But no girl gets "outed," as you call it,
      unless she's predisposed that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. That's all you know of the pressure of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Excuse me, Johnny. I worked three years among factory girls,
      and I know how they manage to resist things when they've got stuff in
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Yes, I know what you mean by stuff&mdash;good hard
      self-preservative instinct. Why should the wretched girl who hasn't got
      that be turned down? She wants protection all the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I've offered to help with money till she gets a place.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. And you know she won't take it. She's got that much stuff in her.
      This place is her only chance. I appeal to you, Mother&mdash;please tell
      her not to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I shall not, Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. [Turning abruptly] Then we know where we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. I know where you'll be before a week's over.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. In her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. [From the door, grimly] If I am, I'll have the right to be!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Father must have opinions of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. He has only one: Whatever is, is wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. He can't help being intellectual, Mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. If he would only learn that the value of a sentiment is the
      amount of sacrifice you are prepared to make for it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Yes: I read that in "The Times" yesterday. Father's much safer than
      Johnny. Johnny isn't safe at all; he might make a sacrifice any day. What
      were they doing?
    </p>

      MARY. Do you want him here?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [Dubiously] Well&mdash;if I can.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She goes out. A silence, during which the MARCHES look at each other by
        those turns which characterise exasperated domesticity.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. If she doesn't go, Johnny must. Are you going to turn him out?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Of course not. We must reason with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Reason with young people whose lips were glued together half an
      hour ago! Why ever did you force me to take this girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Ruefully] One can't always resist a kindly impulse, Joan. What
      does Mr Bly say to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Mr Bly? "Follow your instincts" and then complains of his
      daughter for following them.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. The man's a philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Before we know where we are, we shall be having Johnny married
      to that girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Nonsense!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Oh, Geof! Whenever you're faced with reality, you say
      "Nonsense!" You know Johnny's got chivalry on the brain.

    <blockquote>

        MARY comes in.

    <p>
      MARY. He's at the top of the servants' staircase; outside her room. He's
      sitting in an armchair, with its back to her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Good Lord! Direct action!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. He's got his pipe, a pound of chocolate, three volumes of "Monte
      Cristo," and his old concertina. He says it's better than the trenches.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. My hat! Johnny's made a joke. This is serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Nobody can get up, and she can't get down. He says he'll stay there
      till all's blue, and it's no use either of you coming unless mother caves
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. I wonder if Cook could do anything with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. She's tried. He told her to go to hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. I Say! And what did Cook&mdash;?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. She's gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Tt! tt! This is very awkward.

    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [With a laugh] We must devise means!
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Oh, ma'am, it does remind me so of the tantrums he used to get into,
      dear little feller! Smiles with recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Sharply] You're not to take him up anything to eat, Cook!
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Oh! But Master Johnny does get so hungry. It'll drive him wild,
      ma'am. Just a Snack now and then!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. No, Cook. Mind&mdash;that's flat!
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Aren't I to feed Faith, ma'am?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Gad! It wants it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Johnny must come down to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Ah! I remember how he used to fall down when he was little&mdash;he
      would go about with his head in the air. But he always picked himself up
      like a little man.
    </p>

      ACT III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The MARCH'S dining-room on the same evening at the end of a perfunctory
      dinner. MRS MARCH sits at the dining-table with her back to the windows,
      MARY opposite the hearth, and MR MARCH with his back to it. JOHNNY is not
      present. Silence and gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. We always seem to be eating.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. You've eaten nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Pouring himself out a liqueur glass of brandy but not drinking
      it] It's humiliating to think we can't exist without. [Relapses into
      gloom.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Mary, pass him the walnuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. I was thinking of taking them up to Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Looking at his watch] He's been there six hours; even he can't
      live on faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. If Johnny wants to make a martyr of himself, I can't help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. How many days are you going to let him sit up there, Mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Glancing at MRS MARCH] I never in my life knew anything so
      ridiculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Give me a little glass of brandy, Geof.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Good! That's the first step towards seeing reason.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He pours brandy into a liqueur glass from the decanter which stands
        between them. MRS MARCH puts the brandy to her lips and makes a little
        face, then swallows it down manfully. MARY gets up with the walnuts and
        goes. Silence. Gloom.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Horrid stuff!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Haven't you begun to see that your policy's hopeless, Joan?
      Come! Tell the girl she can stay. If we make Johnny feel victorious&mdash;we
      can deal with him. It's just personal pride&mdash;the curse of this world.
      Both you and Johnny are as stubborn as mules.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Human nature is stubborn, Geof. That's what you easy&mdash;going
      people never see.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MR MARCH gets up, vexed, and goes to the fireplace.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Turning] Well! This goes further than you think. It involves
      Johnny's affection and respect for you.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MRS MARCH nervously refills the little brandy glass, and again empties
        it, with a grimacing shudder.

    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Noticing] That's better! You'll begin to see things presently.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MARY re-enters.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MARY. He's been digging himself in. He's put a screen across the head of
      the stairs, and got Cook's blankets. He's going to sleep there.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Did he take the walnuts?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. No; he passed them in to her. He says he's on hunger strike. But
      he's eaten all the chocolate and smoked himself sick. He's having the time
      of his life, mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. There you are!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Wait till this time to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Cook's been up again. He wouldn't let her pass. She'll have to sleep
      in the spare room.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. I say!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. And he's got the books out of her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. D'you know what they are? "The Scarlet Pimpernel," "The Wide
      Wide World," and the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Johnny likes romance.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She crosses to the fire.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [In a low voice] Are you going to leave him up there with the
      girl and that inflammatory literature, all night? Where's your common
      sense, Joan?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MRS MARCH starts up, presses her hand over her brow, and sits down
        again. She is stumped.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      [With consideration for her defeat] Have another tot! [He pours it out]
      Let Mary go up with a flag of truce, and ask them both to come down for a
      thorough discussion of the whole thing, on condition that they can go up
      again if we don't come to terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Very well! I'm quite willing to meet him. I hate quarrelling
      with Johnny.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Good! I'll go myself. [He goes out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Mother, this isn't a coal strike; don't discuss it for three hours
      and then at the end ask Johnny and the girl to do precisely what you're
      asking them to do now.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Why should I?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Because it's so usual. Do fix on half-way at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. There is no half-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Well, for goodness sake think of a plan which will make you both
      look victorious. That's always done in the end. Why not let her stay, and
      make Johnny promise only to see her in the presence of a third party?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Because she'd see him every day while he was looking for the
      third party. She'd help him look for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [With a gurgle] Mother, I'd no idea you were so&mdash;French.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. It seems to me you none of you have any idea what I am.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Well, do remember that there'll be no publicity to make either of
      you look small. You can have Peace with Honour, whatever you decide.
      [Listening] There they are! Now, Mother, don't be logical! It's so
      feminine.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As the door opens, MRS MARCH nervously fortifies herself with the third
        little glass of brandy. She remains seated. MARY is on her right. MR
        MARCH leads into the room and stands next his daughter, then FAITH in
        hat and coat to the left of the table, and JOHNNY, pale but determined,
        last. Assembled thus, in a half fan, of which MRS MARCH is the apex, so
        to speak, they are all extremely embarrassed, and no wonder. Suddenly
        MARY gives a little gurgle.

      JOHNNY. You'd think it funnier if you'd just come out of prison and were
      going to be chucked out of your job, on to the world again.

    <p>
      FAITH. I didn't want to come down here. If I'm to go I want to go at once.
      And if I'm not, it's my evening out, please.

    <p>
      JOHNNY. Stand still, and leave it to me. [FAITH looks up at him,
      hypnotized by his determination] Now, mother, I've come down at your
      request to discuss this; are you ready to keep her? Otherwise up we go
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. That's not the way to go to work, Johnny. You mustn't ask people
      to eat their words raw&mdash;like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Well, I've had no dinner, but I'm not going to eat my words, I
      tell you plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. Very well then; go up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [Muttering] Mother&mdash;logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Great Scott! You two haven't the faintest idea of how to conduct
      a parley. We have&mdash;to&mdash;er&mdash;explore every path to&mdash;find
      a way to peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [To FAITH] Have you thought of anything to do, if you leave
      here?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. I shan't say.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Of course, she'll just chuck herself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. No, I won't. I'll go to a place I know of, where they don't want
      references.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. Exactly!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [To FAITH] I want to ask you a question. Since you came out, is
      this the first young man who's kissed you?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FAITH has hardly had time to start and manifest what may or may not be
        indignation when MR MARCH dashes his hands through his hair.

      MR MARCH. Joan, really!
    </p>

      JOHNNY. [Grimly] Don't condescend to answer!

      MRS MARCH. I thought we'd met to get at the truth.

    <p>
      FAITH. I will go out!

      that you're not insulted any more.

      MRS MARCH. To devise means.

      MR MARCH. [Roused] Of course, if nobody will modify their attitude &mdash;Johnny,
      you ought to be ashamed of yourself, and [To MRS MARCH] so ought you,
      Joan.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. [Suddenly] I'll modify mine. [To FAITH] Come here&mdash;close! [In
      a low voice to FAITH] Will you give me your word to stay here, if I make
      them keep you?
    </p>

      JOHNNY. Then why did you&mdash;[He is going to say: "Kiss me," but checks
      himself]&mdash;let me think you hadn't any friends? Who is this fellow?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG M. A little more civility, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. You look a blackguard, and I believe you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [With perfunctory authority] I really can't have this sort of
      thing in my house. Johnny, go upstairs; and you two, please go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG M. [To JOHNNY] We know the sort of chap you are&mdash;takin'
      advantage of workin' girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. That's a foul lie. Come into the garden and I'll prove it on your
      carcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG M. All right!
    </p>
    <p>
      FAITH. No; he'll hurt you. He's been in the war.

    <p>
      JOHNNY. [To the YOUNG MAN] You haven't, I'll bet.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG M. I didn't come here to be slanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. This poor girl is going to have a fair deal, and you're not going
      to give it her. I can see that with half an eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG M. You'll see it with no eyes when I've done with you.

      talks wild. [JOHNNY clutches the edge of the writing-table] Thinks he can
      "rescue" me. I don't want to be rescued. I&mdash;[All the feeling of years
      rises to the surface now that the barrier has broken] &mdash;I want to be
      let alone. I've paid for everything I've done&mdash;a pound for every
      shilling's worth.
    </p>

      And all because of one minute when I was half crazy. [Flashing round at
      MARY] Wait till you've had a baby you oughtn't to have had, and not a
      penny in your pocket! It's money&mdash;money&mdash;all money!

      been waiting for a chance to speak to this young woman quietly. It's
      rather public here, sir; but if you wish, of course, I'll mention it. [He
      waits for some word from some one; no one speaks, so he goes on almost
      apologetically] Well, now, you're in a good place here, and you ought to
      keep it. You don't want fresh trouble, I'm sure.

    </p>
    <p>
      P. C. MAN. I don't want to frighten you; but we've had word passed that
      you're associating with the young man there. I observed him to-night
      again, waiting outside here and whistling.

      YOUNG M. What's the matter with whistling?
    </p>
    <p>

      speakin' to you to-night was for the good of the girl. Strictly, I've gone
      a bit out of my way. If my job was to get men into trouble, as he says,
      I'd only to wait till he's got hold of her. These fellows, you know, are
      as cunning as lynxes and as impudent as the devil.

      COOK. [Who has entered with a tray] Yes, my dearie, I'm sure you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. [Staring at his father] A vision, Dad! Windows of Clubs&mdash;men
      sitting there; and that girl going by with rouge on her cheeks&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Oh! Master Johnny!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOHNNY. A blue night&mdash;the moon over the Park. And she stops and looks
      at it.&mdash;What has she wanted&mdash;the beautiful&mdash;something
      better than she's got&mdash;something that she'll never get!
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Oh! Master Johnny!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She goes up to JOHNNY and touches his forehead. He comes to himself and
        hurries to the door, but suddenly MRS MARCH utters a little feathery
        laugh. She stands up, swaying slightly. There is something unusual and
        charming in her appearance, as if formality had dropped from her.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [With a sort of delicate slow lack of perfect sobriety] I see&mdash;it&mdash;all.
      You&mdash;can't&mdash;help&mdash;unless&mdash;you&mdash;love!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        JOHNNY stops and looks round at her.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. [Moving a little towards her] Joan!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. She&mdash;wants&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;loved. It's the way of
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. [Turning] Mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. You thought she wanted&mdash;to be saved. Silly! She&mdash;just&mdash;
      wants&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;loved. Quite natural!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Joan, what's happened to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Smiling and nodding] See&mdash;people&mdash;as&mdash;they&mdash;are!
      Then you won't be&mdash;disappointed. Don't&mdash;have&mdash;ideals! Have&mdash;vision&mdash;just
      simple &mdash;vision!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Your mother's not well.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Passing her hand over her forehead] It's hot in here!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Mary!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        MARY throws open the French windows.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS MARCH. [Delightfully] The room's full of GAS. Open the windows! Open!
      And let's walk&mdash;out&mdash;into the air!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She turns and walks delicately out through the opened windows; JOHNNY
        and MARY follow her. The moonlight and the air flood in.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COOK. [Coming to the table and taking up the empty decanter] My Holy Ma!
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Is this the Millennium, Cook?
    </p>
    <p>
      COOK. Oh! Master Geoffrey&mdash;there isn't a millehennium. There's too
      much human nature. We must look things in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR MARCH. Ah! Neither up&mdash;nor down&mdash;but straight in the face!
      Quite a thought, Cook! Quite a thought!

 Produced by David Widger

 Updated editions will replace the previous one&mdash;the old editions
 will be renamed.

 Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
 one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
 (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
 Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
 charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
 do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
 rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
 such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
 research.  They may be modified and printed and given away&mdash;you may do
 practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
 subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
 redistribution.

 *** START: FULL LICENSE ***

 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
 http://gutenberg.net/license).

 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic works

 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 States.

 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 copied or distributed:

 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 1.E.9.

 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm License.

 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 that

 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
      License.  You must require such a user to return or
      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
      Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
      of receipt of the work.

 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.

 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGE.

 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 opportunities to fix the problem.

 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
 To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
 and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
