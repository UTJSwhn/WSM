<p>Upon the throne and crying about the streets</p>

<h3>THE OLD AGE OF QUEEN MAEVE.</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>Maeve the great queen was pacing to and fro,</p>
<p>Between the walls covered with beaten bronze,</p>
<p>In her high house at Cruachan; the long hearth,</p>
<p>Flickering with ash and hazel, but half showed</p>
<p>Where the tired horse-boys lay upon the rushes,</p>
<p>Or on the benches underneath the walls,</p>
<p>In comfortable sleep; all living slept</p>
<p>But that great queen, who more than half the night</p>
<p>Had paced from door to fire and fire to door.</p>
<p>Though now in her old age, in her young age</p>
<p>She had been beautiful in that old way</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all but gone; for the proud heart is gone</p>
<p>And the fool heart of the counting-house fears all</p>
<p>But soft beauty and indolent desire.</p>
<p>She could have called over the rim of the world</p>
<p>Whatever woman&rsquo;s lover had hit her fancy,</p>
<p>And yet had been great bodied and great limbed,</p>
<p>Fashioned to be the mother of strong children;</p>
<p>And she&rsquo;d had lucky eyes and a high heart,</p>
<p>And wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>3</span></p>
<p>At need, and made her beautiful and fierce,</p>
<p>Sudden and laughing.</p>
                      <p class="i8">O unquiet heart,</p>
<p>Why do you praise another, praising her,</p>
<p>As if there were no tale but your own tale</p>
<p>Worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound?</p>
<p>Have I not bid you tell of that great queen</p>
<p>Who has been buried some two thousand years?</p>

<p class="s">When night was at its deepest, a wild goose</p>
<p>Cried from the porter&rsquo;s lodge, and with long clamour</p>
<p>Shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks;</p>
<p>But the horse-boys slept on, as though some power</p>
<p>Had filled the house with Druid heaviness;</p>
<p>And wondering who of the many changing Sidhe</p>
<p>Had come as in the old times to counsel her,</p>
<p>Maeve walked, yet with slow footfall being old,</p>
<p>To that small chamber by the outer gate.</p>
<p>The porter slept although he sat upright</p>
<p>With still and stony limbs and open eyes.</p>
<p>Maeve waited, and when that ear-piercing noise</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>4</span></p>
<p>Broke from his parted lips and broke again,</p>
<p>She laid a hand on either of his shoulders,</p>
<p>And shook him wide awake, and bid him say</p>
<p>Who of the wandering many-changing ones</p>
<p>Had troubled his sleep. But all he had to say</p>
<p>Was that, the air being heavy and the dogs</p>
<p>More still than they had been for a good month,</p>
<p>He had fallen asleep, and, though he had dreamed nothing,</p>
<p>He could remember when he had had fine dreams.</p>
<p>It was before the time of the great war</p>
<p>Over the White-Horned Bull, and the Brown Bull.</p>

<p class="s">She turned away; he turned again to sleep</p>
<p>That no god troubled now, and, wondering</p>
<p>What matters were afoot among the Sidhe,</p>
<p>Maeve walked through that great hall, and with a sigh</p>
<p>Lifted the curtain of her sleeping room,</p>
<p>Remembering that she too had seemed divine</p>
<p>To many thousand eyes, and to her own</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>5</span></p>
<p>One that the generations had long waited</p>
<p>That work too difficult for mortal hands</p>
<p>Might be accomplished. Bunching the curtain up</p>
<p>She saw her husband Ailell sleeping there,</p>
<p>And thought of days when he&rsquo;d had a straight body,</p>
<p>And of that famous Fergus, Nessa&rsquo;s husband,</p>
<p>Who had been the lover of her middle life.</p>

<p class="s">Suddenly Ailell spoke out of his sleep,</p>
<p>And not with his own voice or a man&rsquo;s voice,</p>
<p>But with the burning, live, unshaken voice</p>
<p>Of those that it may be can never age.</p>
<p>He said, &lsquo;High Queen of Cruachan and Mag Ai</p>
<p>A king of the Great Plain would speak with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with glad voice Maeve answered him, &lsquo;What King</p>
<p>Of the far wandering shadows has come to me?</p>
<p>As in the old days when they would come and go</p>
<p>About my threshold to counsel and to help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The parted lips replied, &lsquo;I seek your help,</p>
<p>For I am Aengus and I am crossed in love.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>6</span></p>
<p class="s">&lsquo;How may a mortal whose life gutters out</p>
<p>Help them that wander with hand clasping hand</p>
<p>By rivers where nor rain nor hail has dimmed</p>
<p>Their haughty images, that cannot fade</p>
<p>Although their beauty&rsquo;s like a hollow dream.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="s">&lsquo;I come from the undimmed rivers to bid you call</p>
<p>The children of the Maines out of sleep,</p>
<p>And set them digging into Anbual&rsquo;s hill.</p>
<p>We shadows, while they uproot his earthy house,</p>
<p>Will overthrow his shadows and carry off</p>
<p>Caer, his blue eyed daughter that I love.</p>
<p>I helped your fathers when they built these walls</p>
<p>And I would have your help in my great need,</p>
<p>Queen of high Cruachan.&rsquo;</p>
                          <p class="i10">&lsquo;I obey your will</p>
<p>With speedy feet and a most thankful heart:</p>
<p>For you have been, O Aengus of the birds,</p>
<p>Our giver of good counsel and good luck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with a groan, as if the mortal breath</p>
<p>Could but awaken sadly upon lips</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>7</span></p>
<p>That happier breath had moved, her husband turned</p>
<p>Face downward, tossing in a troubled sleep;</p>
<p>But Maeve, and not with a slow feeble foot,</p>
<p>Came to the threshold of the painted house,</p>
<p>Where her grandchildren slept, and cried aloud,</p>
<p>Until the pillared dark began to stir</p>
<p>With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms.</p>

<p class="s">She told them of the many-changing ones;</p>
<p>And all that night, and all through the next day</p>
<p>To middle night, they dug into the hill.</p>
<p>At middle night great cats with silver claws,</p>
<p>Bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls,</p>
<p>Came up out of the hole, and red-eared hounds</p>
<p>With long white bodies came out of the air</p>
<p>Suddenly, and ran at them and harried them.</p>

<p class="s">The Maines&rsquo; children dropped their spades, and stood</p>
<p>With quaking joints and terror strucken faces,</p>
<p>Till Maeve called out, &lsquo;These are but common men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>8</span></p>
<p>The Maines&rsquo; children have not dropped their spades</p>
<p>Because Earth crazy for its broken power</p>
<p>Casts up a show and the winds answer it</p>
<p>With holy shadows.&rsquo; Her high heart was glad,</p>
<p>And when the uproar ran along the grass</p>
<p>She followed with light footfall in the midst,</p>
<p>Till it died out where an old thorn tree stood.</p>

<p class="s">Friend of these many years, you too had stood</p>
<p>With equal courage in that whirling rout;</p>
<p>For you, although you&rsquo;ve not her wandering heart,</p>
<p>Have all that greatness, and not hers alone.</p>
<p>For there is no high story about queens</p>
<p>In any ancient book but tells of you,</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;ve heard how they grew old and died</p>
<p>Or fell into unhappiness I&rsquo;ve said;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will grow old and die and she has wept!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And when I&rsquo;d write it out anew, the words,</p>
<p>Half crazy with the thought, She too has wept!</p>
<p>Outrun the measure.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>9</span></p>
                      <p class="i8">I&rsquo;d tell of that great queen</p>
<p>Who stood amid a silence by the thorn</p>
<p>Until two lovers came out of the air</p>
<p>With bodies made out of soft fire. The one</p>
<p>About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings</p>
<p>Said, &lsquo;Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks</p>
<p>To Maeve and to Maeve&rsquo;s household, owing all</p>
<p>In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then Maeve, &lsquo;O Aengus, Master of all lovers,</p>
<p>A thousand years ago you held high talk</p>
<p>With the first kings of many pillared Cruachan.</p>
<p>O when will you grow weary.&rsquo;</p>
                              <p class="i12">They had vanished,</p>
<p>But out of the dark air over her head there came</p>
<p>A murmur of soft words and meeting lips.</p>

<h3>BAILE AND AILLINN.</h3>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>Argument. Baile and Aillinn were lovers, but</p>
<p>Aengus, the Master of Love, wishing them to be</p>
<p>happy in his own land among the dead, told to</p>
<p>each a story of the other&rsquo;s death, so that their</p>
<p>hearts were broken and they died.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>10</span></p>
<p>I hardly hear the curlew cry,</p>
<p>Nor the grey rush when wind is high,</p>
<p>Before my thoughts begin to run</p>
<p>On the heir of Ulad, Buan&rsquo;s son,</p>
<p>Baile who had the honey mouth,</p>
<p>And that mild woman of the south,</p>
<p>Aillinn, who was King Lugaid&rsquo;s heir.</p>
<p>Their love was never drowned in care</p>
<p>Of this or that thing, nor grew cold</p>
<p>Because their bodies had grown old;</p>
<p>Being forbid to marry on earth</p>
<p>They blossomed to immortal mirth.</p>

<p class="s">About the time when Christ was born,</p>
<p>When the long wars for the White Horn</p>
<p>And the Brown Bull had not yet come,</p>
<p>Young Baile Honey-Mouth, whom some</p>
<p>Called rather Baile Little-Land,</p>
<p>Rode out of Emain with a band</p>
<p>Of harpers and young men, and they</p>
<p>Imagined, as they struck the way</p>
<p>To many pastured Muirthemne,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>11</span></p>
<p>That all things fell out happily</p>
<p>And there, for all that fools had said,</p>
<p>Baile and Aillinn would be wed.</p>

<p class="s">They found an old man running there,</p>
<p>He had ragged long grass-yellow hair;</p>
<p>He had knees that stuck out of his hose;</p>
<p>He had puddle water in his shoes;</p>
<p>He had half a cloak to keep him dry;</p>
<p>Although he had a squirrel&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p class="s">O wandering birds and rushy beds</p>
<p>You put such folly in our heads</p>
<p>With all this crying in the wind</p>
<p>No common love is to our mind,</p>
<p>And our poor Kate or Nan is less</p>
<p>Than any whose unhappiness</p>
<p>Awoke the harp strings long ago.</p>
<p>Yet they that know all things but know</p>
<p>That all life had to give us is</p>
<p>A child&rsquo;s laughter, a woman&rsquo;s kiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>12</span></p>
<p class="s">Who was it put so great a scorn</p>
<p>In the grey reeds that night and morn</p>
<p>Are trodden and broken by the herds,</p>
<p>And in the light bodies of birds</p>
<p>That north wind tumbles to and fro</p>
<p>And pinches among hail and snow?</p>

<p class="s">That runner said, &lsquo;I am from the south;</p>
<p>I run to Baile Honey-Mouth</p>
<p>To tell him how the girl Aillinn</p>
<p>Rode from the country of her kin</p>
<p>And old and young men rode with her:</p>
<p>For all that country had been astir</p>
<p>If anybody half as fair</p>
<p>Had chosen a husband anywhere</p>
<p>But where it could see her every day.</p>
<p>When they had ridden a little way</p>
<p>An old man caught the horse&rsquo;s head</p>
<p>With &ldquo;You must home again and wed</p>
<p>With somebody in your own land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A young man cried and kissed her hand</p>
<p>&ldquo;O lady, wed with one of us;&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>13</span></p>
<p>And when no face grew piteous</p>
<p>For any gentle thing she spake</p>
<p>She fell and died of the heart-break.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="s">Because a lover&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s worn out</p>
<p>Being tumbled and blown about</p>
<p>By its own blind imagining,</p>
<p>And will believe that anything</p>
<p>That is bad enough to be true, is true,</p>
<p>Baile&rsquo;s heart was broken in two;</p>
<p>And he being laid upon green boughs</p>
<p>Was carried to the goodly house</p>
<p>Where the Hound of Ulad sat before</p>
<p>The brazen pillars of his door;</p>
<p>His face bowed low to weep the end</p>
<p>Of the harper&rsquo;s daughter and her friend;</p>
<p>For although years had passed away</p>
<p>He always wept them on that day,</p>
<p>For on that day they had been betrayed;</p>
<p>And now that Honey-Mouth is laid</p>
<p>Under a cairn of sleepy stone</p>
<p>Before his eyes, he has tears for none,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>14</span></p>
<p>Although he is carrying stone, but two</p>
<p>For whom the cairn&rsquo;s but heaped anew.</p>

<p class="s">We hold because our memory is</p>
<p>So full of that thing and of this</p>
<p>That out of sight is out of mind.</p>
<p>But the grey rush under the wind</p>
<p>And the grey bird with crooked bill</p>
<p>Have such long memories that they still</p>
<p>Remember Deirdre and her man,</p>
<p>And when we walk with Kate or Nan</p>
<p>About the windy water side</p>
<p>Our heart can hear the voices chide.</p>
<p>How could we be so soon content</p>
<p>Who know the way that Naoise went?</p>
<p>And they have news of Deirdre&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<p>Who being lovely was so wise,</p>
<p>Ah wise, my heart knows well how wise.</p>

<p class="s">Now had that old gaunt crafty one,</p>
<p>Gathering his cloak about him, run</p>
<p>Where Aillinn rode with waiting maids</p>
<p>Who amid leafy lights and shades</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>15</span></p>
<p>Dreamed of the hands that would unlace</p>
<p>Their bodices in some dim place</p>
<p>When they had come to the marriage bed;</p>
<p>And harpers pondering with bowed head</p>
<p>A music that had thought enough</p>
<p>Of the ebb of all things to make love</p>
<p>Grow gentle without sorrowings;</p>
<p>And leather-coated men with slings</p>
<p>Who peered about on every side;</p>
<p>And amid leafy light he cried,</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is well out of wind and wave,</p>
<p>They have heaped the stones above his grave</p>
<p>In Muirthemne and over it</p>
<p>In changeless Ogham letters writ</p>
<p>Baile that was of Rury&rsquo;s seed.</p>
<p>But the gods long ago decreed</p>
<p>No waiting maid should ever spread</p>
<p>Baile and Aillinn&rsquo;s marriage bed,</p>
<p>For they should clip and clip again</p>
<p>Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain.</p>
<p>Therefore it is but little news</p>
<p>That put this hurry in my shoes.&rsquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>16</span></p>
<p>And hurrying to the south he came</p>
<p>To that high hill the herdsmen name</p>
<p>The Hill Seat of Leighin, because</p>
<p>Some god or king had made the laws</p>
<p>That held the land together there,</p>
<p>In old times among the clouds of the air.</p>

<p class="s">That old man climbed; the day grew dim;</p>
<p>Two swans came flying up to him</p>
<p>Linked by a gold chain each to each</p>
<p>And with low murmuring laughing speech</p>
<p>Alighted on the windy grass.</p>
<p>They knew him: his changed body was</p>
<p>Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings</p>
<p>Were hovering over the harp strings</p>
<p>That Etain, Midhir&rsquo;s wife, had wove</p>
<p>In the hid place, being crazed by love.</p>

<p class="s">What shall I call them? fish that swim</p>
<p>Scale rubbing scale where light is dim</p>
<p>By a broad water-lily leaf;</p>
<p>Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf</p>
<p>Forgotten at the threshing place;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>17</span></p>
<p>Or birds lost in the one clear space</p>
<p>Of morning light in a dim sky;</p>
<p>Or it may be, the eyelids of one eye</p>
<p>Or the door pillars of one house,</p>
<p>Or two sweet blossoming apple boughs</p>
<p>That have one shadow on the ground;</p>
<p>Or the two strings that made one sound</p>
<p>Where that wise harper&rsquo;s finger ran;</p>
<p>For this young girl and this young man</p>
<p>Have happiness without an end</p>
<p>Because they have made so good a friend.</p>

<p class="s">They know all wonders, for they pass</p>
<p>The towery gates of Gorias</p>
<p>And Findrias and Falias</p>
<p>And long-forgotten Murias,</p>
<p>Among the giant kings whose hoard</p>
<p>Cauldron and spear and stone and sword</p>
<p>Was robbed before Earth gave the wheat;</p>
<p>Wandering from broken street to street</p>
<p>They come where some huge watcher is</p>
<p>And tremble with their love and kiss.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>18</span></p>
<p>They know undying things, for they</p>
<p>Wander where earth withers away,</p>
<p>Though nothing troubles the great streams</p>
<p>But light from the pale stars, and gleams</p>
<p>From the holy orchards, where there is none</p>
<p>But fruit that is of precious stone,</p>
<p>Or apples of the sun and moon.</p>

<p class="s">What were our praise to them: they eat</p>
<p>Quiet&rsquo;s wild heart, like daily meat,</p>
<p>Who when night thickens are afloat</p>
<p>On dappled skins in a glass boat</p>
<p>Far out under a windless sky,</p>
<p>While over them birds of Aengus fly,</p>
<p>And over the tiller and the prow</p>
<p>And waving white wings to and fro</p>
<p>Awaken wanderings of light air</p>
<p>To stir their coverlet and their hair.</p>

<p class="s">And poets found, old writers say,</p>
<p>A yew tree where his body lay,</p>
<p>But a wild apple hid the grass</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>19</span></p>
<p>With its sweet blossom where hers was;</p>
<p>And being in good heart, because</p>
<p>A better time had come again</p>
<p>After the deaths of many men,</p>
<p>And that long fighting at the ford,</p>
<p>They wrote on tablets of thin board,</p>
<p>Made of the apple and the yew,</p>
<p>All the love stories that they knew.</p>

<p class="s">Let rush and bird cry out their fill</p>
<p>Of the harper&rsquo;s daughter if they will,</p>
<p>Beloved, I am not afraid of her</p>
<p>She is not wiser nor lovelier,</p>
<p>And you are more high of heart than she</p>
<p>For all her wanderings over-sea;</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d have bird and rush forget</p>
<p>Those other two, for never yet</p>
<p>Has lover lived but longed to wive</p>
<p>Like them that are no more alive.</p>

<p>I made some of these poems walking about
among the Seven Woods, before the big wind of
nineteen hundred and three blew down so many
trees, &amp; troubled the wild creatures, &amp; changed the
look of things; and I thought out there a good
part of the play which follows. The first shape of
it came to me in a dream, but it changed much in
the making, foreshadowing, it may be, a change
that may bring a less dream-burdened will into my
verses. I never re-wrote anything so many times;
for at first I could not make these wills that stream
into mere life poetical. But now I hope to do
easily much more of the kind, and that our new
Irish players will find the buskin and the sock.</p>

<p>SCENE: A great hall by the sea close to Dundalgan.
There are two great chairs on either
side of the hall, each raised a little from the
ground, and on the back of the one chair is
carved and painted a woman with a fish&rsquo;s tail,
and on the back of the other a hound. There
are smaller chairs and benches raised in tiers
round the walls. There is a great ale vat at one
side near a small door, &amp; a large door at the
back through which one can see the sea. Barach,
a tall thin man with long ragged hair, dressed in
skins, comes in at the side door. He is leading
Fintain, a fat blind man, who is somewhat older.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>35</span></p>
<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>I will shut the door, for this wind out of the sea
gets into my bones, and if I leave but an inch
for the wind there is one like a flake of sea-frost
that might come into the house.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>What is his name, fool?</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a woman from among the Riders of the
Sidhe. It&rsquo;s Boann herself from the river. She
has left the Dagda&rsquo;s bed, and gone through the
salt of the sea &amp; up here to the strand of Baile,
and all for love of me. Let her keep her husband&rsquo;s
bed, for she&rsquo;ll have none of me. Nobody
knows how lecherous these goddesses are.
I see her in every kind of shape but oftener
than not she&rsquo;s in the wind and cries &lsquo;give a kiss
and put your arms about me.&rsquo; But no, she&rsquo;ll
have no more of me. Yesterday when I put
out my lips to kiss her, there was nothing there
but the wind. She&rsquo;s bad, Fintain. O, she&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>36</span>
bad. I had better shut the big door too. (He
is going towards the big door but turns hearing
Fintain&rsquo;s voice.)</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

of the hall.</p>

<p>Lead me to it. (He mutters while the fool is
leading him.) That is what the High King
Concobar has on his shield. The High King
will be coming. They have brought out his
chair. (He begins feeling the back of the other
chair.) And there is a dog&rsquo;s head on this. They
have brought out our master&rsquo;s chair. Now I
know what the horse-boys were talking about.
We must not stay here. The Kings are going
to meet here. Now that Concobar and our
master, that is his chief man, have put down all
the enemies of Ullad, they are going to build
up Emain again. They are going to talk over
their plans for building it. Were you ever in
Concobar&rsquo;s town before it was burnt? O, he is
a great King, for though Emain was burnt down,
every war had made him richer. He has gold
and silver dishes, and chessboards and candle-sticks
made of precious stones. Fool, have
they taken the top from the ale vat?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>38</span></p>

<p>Time enough, time enough. You&rsquo;re in as great
a hurry as when you brought me to Aine&rsquo;s Seat,
where the mad dogs gather when the moon&rsquo;s at
the full. Go on with your story.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>I was creeping under a ditch, with the fowl in
my leather bag, keeping to the shore where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>39</span>
farmer could not see me, when I came upon a
ship drawn up upon the sands, a great red ship
with a woman&rsquo;s head upon it.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>A ship out of Aoife&rsquo;s country. They have all a
woman&rsquo;s head on the bow.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>There was a young man with a pale face and red
hair standing beside it. Some of our people came
up whose turn it was to guard the shore. I heard
them ask the young man his name. He said he
was under bonds not to tell it. Then words came
between them, and they fought, &amp; the young
man killed half of them, and the others ran away.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>It matters nothing to us, but he has come at last.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>Who has come?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>40</span></p>
<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>I know who that young man is. There is not
another like him in the world. I saw him when
I had my eyesight.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>You saw him?</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>I used to be in Aoife&rsquo;s country when I had my
eyesight.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>That was before you went on shipboard and were
blinded for putting a curse on the wind?</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>Queen Aoife had a son that was red haired and
pale faced like herself, and everyone said that he
would kill Cuchullain some day, but I would not
have that spoken of.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>Nobody could do that. Who was his father?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>41</span></p>
<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>Nobody but Aoife knew that, not even he himself.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>Not even he himself! Was Aoife a goddess &amp;
lecherous?</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>I overheard her telling that she never had but
one lover, and that he was the only man who
overcame her in battle. There were some who
thought him one of the Riders of the Sidhe,
because the child was great of limb and strong
beyond others. The child was begotten over
the mountains; but come nearer and I will tell
you something.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>You have thought something?</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>When I hear the young girls talking about the
colour of Cuchullain&rsquo;s eyes, &amp; how they have
seven colours, I have thought about it. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>42</span>
young man has Aoife&rsquo;s face and hair, but he has
Cuchullain&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>How can he have Cuchullain&rsquo;s eyes?</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>He is Cuchullain&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>And his mother has sent him hither to fight his
father.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>It is all quite plain. Cuchullain went into Aoife&rsquo;s
country when he was a young man that he might
learn skill in arms, and there he became Aoife&rsquo;s
lover.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>And now she hates him because he went away,
and has sent the son to kill the father. I knew
she was a goddess.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>And she never told him who his father was, that
he might do it. I have thought it all out, fool. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>43</span>
know a great many things because I listen when
nobody is noticing and I keep my wits awake.
What ails you now?</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>I have remembered that I am hungry.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>Well, forget it again, and I will tell you about
Aoife&rsquo;s country. It is full of wonders. There
are a great many Queens there who can change
themselves into wolves and into swine and into
white hares, and when they are in their own
shapes they are stronger than almost any man;
and there are young men there who have cat&rsquo;s
eyes and if a bird chirrup or a mouse squeak
they cannot keep them shut even though it is
bedtime and they sleepy; and listen, for this is
a great wonder, a very great wonder, there is a
long narrow bridge, and when anybody goes to
cross it, that the Queens do not like, it flies up
as this bench would if you were to sit on the end
of it. Everybody who goes there to learn skill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>44</span>
in arms has to cross it. It was in that country
too that Cuchullain got his spear made out of
dragon bones. There were two dragons fighting
in the foam of the sea, &amp; their grandam was the
moon, and six Queens came along the shore.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t listen to your story.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>It is a very wonderful story. Wait till you hear
what the six Queens did. Their right hands were
all made of silver.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>No, I will have my dinner first. You have eaten
the fowl I left in front of the fire. The last time
you sent me to steal something you made me forget
all about it till you had eaten it up.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>No, there is plenty for us both.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>Come with me where it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>45</span></p>
<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>(Who is being led towards the door at the back
by Barach.) O, it is all right, it is in a safe place.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>It is a fine fowl. It was the biggest in the yard.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>It had a good smell, but I hope that the wild
dogs have not smelt it. (Voices are heard outside
the door at the side.) Here is our master.
Let us stay and talk with him. Perhaps Cuchullain
will give you a new cap with a feather. He
told me that he would give you a new cap with a
feather, a feather with an eye that looks at you,
a peacock&rsquo;s feather.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>No, no. (He begins pulling Fintain towards the
door.)</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>If you do not get it now, you may never get it,
for the young man may kill him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>46</span></p>
<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>No, no, I am hungry. What a head you have,
blind man. Who but you would have remembered
that the hen-wife slept for a little at noon
every day.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>(Who is being led along very slowly and unwillingly.)</p>

<p>Yes, I have a good head. The fowl
should be done just right, but one never knows
when a wild dog may come out of the woods.</p>

<p>(They go out through the big door at the back.
As they go out Cuchullain &amp; certain young
Kings come in at the side door. Cuchullain
though still young is a good deal older than
the others. They are all very gaily dressed,
and have their hair fastened with balls of gold.
The young men crowd about Cuchullain with
wondering attention.)</p>

<p>All the rulers there were Queens.</p>
</div>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>No, not Scathach.</p>

<p class="person">CUCHULLAIN.</p>

<p>It was Uathach then. Speak, speak!</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>I cannot speak, you are clutching me too tightly.
(Cuchullain lets him go.) I cannot remember
who it was. I am not certain. It was some
Queen.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>He said a while ago that the young man was
Aoife&rsquo;s son.</p>

<p class="person">CUCHULLAIN.</p>

<p>She? No, no, she had no son when I was
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>82</span></p>
<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>That blind man there said that she owned him
for her son.</p>

<p class="person">CUCHULLAIN.</p>

<p>I had rather he had been some other woman&rsquo;s
son. What father had he? A soldier out of
Alba? She was an amorous woman, a proud
pale amorous woman.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>None knew whose son he was.</p>

<p class="person">CUCHULLAIN.</p>

<p>None knew? Did you know, old listener at
doors?</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>No, no, I knew nothing.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>He said a while ago that he heard Aoife boast
that she&rsquo;d never but the one lover, and he the
only man that had overcome her in battle. (A
pause.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>83</span></p>
<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>Somebody is trembling. Why are you trembling,
fool? the bench is shaking, why are you trembling?
Is Cuchullain going to hurt us? It was
not I who told you, Cuchullain.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>It is Cuchullain who is trembling. He is shaking
the bench with his knees.</p>

<p class="person">CUCHULLAIN.</p>

<p>He was my son, and I have killed my son.</p>

<p>(A pause.)</p>

<div class="poemr">
<p>&rsquo;Twas they that did it, the pale windy people,</p>
<p>Where, where, where? My sword against the thunder.</p>
<p>But no, for they have always been my friends;</p>
<p>And though they love to blow a smoking coal</p>
<p>Till it&rsquo;s all flame, the wars they blow aflame</p>
<p>Are full of glory, and heart uplifting pride,</p>
<p>And not like this; the wars they love awaken</p>
<p>Old fingers and the sleepy strings of harps.</p>
<p>Who did it then? Are you afraid; speak out,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>84</span></p>
<p>For I have put you under my protection</p>
<p>And will reward you well. Dubthach the Chafer.</p>
<p>He had an old grudge. No, for he is with Maeve.</p>
<p>Laegaire did it. Why do you not speak?</p>
<p>What is this house?</p>
</div>

<p>(A pause.)</p>

<p>Now I remember all.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>He will kill us. O, I am afraid!</p>

<p class="person">CUCHULLAIN.</p>

<p>(Who is before Concobar&rsquo;s chair.)</p>

<div class="poemr">
<p>&rsquo;Twas you who did it, you who sat up there</p>
<p>With that old branch of silver, like a magpie</p>
<p>Nursing a stolen spoon. Magpie, Magpie,</p>
<p>A maggot that is eating up the earth!</p>
</div>

<p>(Begins hacking at the chair with his sword.)</p>

<div class="poemr">
<p>No, but a magpie for he&rsquo;s flown away.</p>
<p>Where did he fly to?</p>
</div>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

                        <p class="i8">He is outside the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>85</span></p>
<p class="person">CUCHULLAIN.</p>

<p>Outside the door?</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

                   <p class="i6">He is under Baile&rsquo;s yew-tree.</p>

<p class="person">CUCHULLAIN.</p>

<p>Concobar, Concobar, the sword into your heart.</p>

<p>(He goes out. A pause. The fool goes to the
great door at back and looks out after him.)</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>He is going up to King Concobar; they are all
under the tree. No, no, he is standing still.
There is a great wave going to break and he is
looking at it. Ah! now he is running down to
the sea, but he is holding up his sword as if he
were going into a fight. (A pause.) Well struck,
well struck!</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>What is he doing now?</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>O! he is fighting the waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>86</span></p>
<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>He sees King Concobar&rsquo;s crown on every one of
them.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>There, he has struck at a big one. He has
struck the crown off it, he has made the foam fly.
There again another big one. (Shouting without.)</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>Where are the Kings? What are the Kings
doing?</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>They are shouting and running down to the
shore, and the people are running out of the
houses, they are all running.</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>You say they are running out of the houses,
there will be nobody left in the houses. Listen,
fool.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>There, he is down! He is up again! He is
going out into the deep water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>87</span></p>
<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>Come here, fool; come here, I say.</p>

<p class="person">BARACH.</p>

<p>(Coming towards him but looking backward
towards the door.) What is it?</p>

<p class="person">FINTAIN.</p>

<p>There will be nobody in the houses. Come this
way, come quickly; the ovens will be full; we
will put our hands into the ovens. (They go
out.)</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
