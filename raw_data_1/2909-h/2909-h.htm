      ACT I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SCENE I
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The scene is a well-lighted, and large, oak-panelled hall, with an air
        of being lived in, and a broad, oak staircase. The dining-room,
        drawing-room, billiard-room, all open into it; and under the staircase a
        door leads to the servants' quarters. In a huge fireplace a log fire is
        burning. There are tiger-skins on the floor, horns on the walls; and a
        writing-table against the wall opposite the fireplace. FREDA STUDDENHAM,
        a pretty, pale girl with dark eyes, in the black dress of a lady's-maid,
        is standing at the foot of the staircase with a bunch of white roses in
        one hand, and a bunch of yellow roses in the other. A door closes above,
        and SIR WILLIAM CHESHIRE, in evening dress, comes downstairs. He is
        perhaps fifty-eight, of strong build, rather bull-necked, with grey
        eyes, and a well-coloured face, whose choleric autocracy is veiled by a
        thin urbanity. He speaks before he reaches the bottom.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Well, Freda! Nice roses. Who are they for?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. My lady told me to give the yellow to Mrs. Keith, Sir William, and
      the white to Miss Lanfarne, for their first evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Capital. [Passing on towards the drawing-room] Your father
      coming up to-night?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Be good enough to tell him I specially want to see him here
      after dinner, will you?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Yes, Sir William.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. By the way, just ask him to bring the game-book in, if he's
      got it.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He goes out into the drawing-room; and FREDA stands restlessly tapping
        her foot against the bottom stair. With a flutter of skirts CHRISTINE
        KEITH comes rapidly down. She is a nice-looking, fresh-coloured young
        woman in a low-necked dress.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Hullo, Freda! How are YOU?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Quite well, thank you, Miss Christine&mdash;Mrs. Keith, I mean. My
      lady told me to give you these.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. [Taking the roses] Oh! Thanks! How sweet of mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. [In a quick, toneless voice] The others are for Miss Lanfarne. My
      lady thought white would suit her better.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. They suit you in that black dress.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [FREDA lowers the roses quickly.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      What do you think of Joan's engagement?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. It's very nice for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. I say, Freda, have they been going hard at rehearsals?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Every day. Miss Dot gets very cross, stage-managing.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. I do hate learning a part. Thanks awfully for unpacking. Any
      news?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. [In the same quick, dull voice] The under-keeper, Dunning, won't
      marry Rose Taylor, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. What a shame! But I say that's serious. I thought there was&mdash;she
      was&mdash;I mean&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. He's taken up with another girl, they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Too bad! [Pinning the roses] D'you know if Mr. Bill's come?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. [With a swift upward look] Yes, by the six-forty.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        RONALD KEITH comes slowly down, a weathered firm-lipped man, in evening
        dress, with eyelids half drawn over his keen eyes, and the air of a
        horseman.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      KEITH. Hallo! Roses in December. I say, Freda, your father missed a
      wigging this morning when they drew blank at Warnham's spinney. Where's
      that litter of little foxes?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. [Smiling faintly] I expect father knows, Captain Keith.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. You bet he does. Emigration? Or thin air? What?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Studdenham'd never shoot a fox, Ronny. He's been here since the
      flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. There's more ways of killing a cat&mdash;eh, Freda?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. [Moving with her husband towards the drawing-room] Young
      Dunning won't marry that girl, Ronny.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. Phew! Wouldn't be in his shoes, then! Sir William'll never keep a
      servant who's made a scandal in the village, old girl. Bill come?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As they disappear from the hall, JOHN LATTER in a clergyman's evening
        dress, comes sedately downstairs, a tall, rather pale young man, with
        something in him, as it were, both of heaven, and a drawing-room. He
        passes FREDA with a formal little nod. HAROLD, a fresh-cheeked,
        cheery-looking youth, comes down, three steps at a time.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Hallo, Freda! Patience on the monument. Let's have a sniff! For
      Miss Lanfarne? Bill come down yet?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. No, Mr. Harold.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        HAROLD crosses the hall, whistling, and follows LATTER into the
        drawing-room. There is the sound of a scuffle above, and a voice crying:
        "Shut up, Dot!" And JOAN comes down screwing her head back. She is
        pretty and small, with large clinging eyes.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JOAN. Am I all right behind, Freda? That beast, Dot!
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Quite, Miss Joan.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        DOT's face, like a full moon, appears over the upper banisters. She too
        comes running down, a frank figure, with the face of a rebel.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      DOT. You little being!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOAN. [Flying towards the drawing-roam, is overtaken at the door] Oh! Dot!
      You're pinching!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As they disappear into the drawing-room, MABEL LANFARNE, a tall girl
        with a rather charming Irish face, comes slowly down. And at sight of
        her FREDA's whole figure becomes set and meaningfull.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FREDA. For you, Miss Lanfarne, from my lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. [In whose speech is a touch of wilful Irishry] How sweet!
      [Fastening the roses] And how are you, Freda?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Very well, thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. And your father? Hope he's going to let me come out with the guns
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. [Stolidly] He'll be delighted, I'm sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. Ye-es! I haven't forgotten his face-last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. You stood with Mr. Bill. He's better to stand with than Mr. Harold,
      or Captain Keith?
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. He didn't touch a feather, that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. People don't when they're anxious to do their best.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A gong sounds. And MABEL LANFARNE, giving FREDA a rather inquisitive
        stare, moves on to the drawing-room. Left alone without the roses, FREDA
        still lingers. At the slamming of a door above, and hasty footsteps, she
        shrinks back against the stairs. BILL runs down, and comes on her
        suddenly. He is a tall, good-looking edition of his father, with the
        same stubborn look of veiled choler.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BILL. Freda! [And as she shrinks still further back] what's the matter?
      [Then at some sound he looks round uneasily and draws away from her]
      Aren't you glad to see me?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. I've something to say to you, Mr. Bill. After dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Mister&mdash;&mdash;?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She passes him, and rushes away upstairs. And BILL, who stands frowning
        and looking after her, recovers himself sharply as the drawing-room door
        is opened, and SIR WILLIAM and MISS LANFARNE come forth, followed by
        KEITH, DOT, HAROLD, CHRISTINE, LATTER, and JOAN, all leaning across each
        other, and talking. By herself, behind them, comes LADY CHESHIRE, a
        refined-looking woman of fifty, with silvery dark hair, and an
        expression at once gentle, and ironic. They move across the hall towards
        the dining-room.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Ah! Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. How do you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. How are you, old chap?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. [gloomily] Do you know your part?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Hallo, old man!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE gives her brother a flying kiss. JOAN and LATTER pause and look
      at him shyly without speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. [Putting his hand on JOAN's shoulder] Good luck, you two! Well
      mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Well, my dear boy! Nice to see you at last. What a long
      time!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She draws his arm through hers, and they move towards the dining-room.
        The curtain falls. The curtain rises again at once.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SCENE II
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        CHRISTINE, LADY CHESHIRE, DOT, MABEL LANFARNE, and JOAN, are returning
        to the hall after dinner.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. [in a low voice] Mother, is it true about young Dunning and
      Rose Taylor?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. I'm afraid so, dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. But can't they be&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Ah! ah-h! [CHRISTINE and her mother are silent.] My child, I'm not
      the young person.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. No, of course not&mdash;only&mdash;[nodding towards JOAN and
      Mable].
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Look here! This is just an instance of what I hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. My dear? Another one?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Yes, mother, and don't you pretend you don't understand, because you
      know you do.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Instance? Of what?
    </p>
    <p>
      JOAN and MABEL have ceased talking, and listen, still at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Humbug, of course. Why should you want them to marry, if he's tired
      of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. [Ironically] Well! If your imagination doesn't carry you as far
      as that!
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. When people marry, do you believe they ought to be in love with each
      other?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. [With a shrug] That's not the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Oh? Were you in love with Ronny?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Don't be idiotic!
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Would you have married him if you hadn't been?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Of course not!
    </p>
    <p>
      JOAN. Dot! You are!&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Hallo! my little snipe!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Dot, dear!
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Don't shut me up, mother! [To JOAN.] Are you in love with John? [JOAN
      turns hurriedly to the fire.] Would you be going to marry him if you were
      not?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. You are a brute, Dot.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Is Mabel in love with&mdash;whoever she is in love with?
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. And I wonder who that is.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Well, would you marry him if you weren't?
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. No, I would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Now, mother; did you love father?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Dot, you really are awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. [Rueful and detached] Well, it is a bit too thick, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      JOAN. Dot!
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Well, mother, did you&mdash;I mean quite calmly?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Yes, dear, quite calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Would you have married him if you hadn't? [LADY CHESHIRE shakes her
      head] Then we're all agreed!
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. Except yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. [Grimly] Even if I loved him, he might think himself lucky if I
      married him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. Indeed, and I'm not so sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. [Making a face at her] What I was going to&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. But don't you think, dear, you'd better not?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Well, I won't say what I was going to say, but what I do say is&mdash;Why
      the devil&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Quite so, Dot!
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. [A little disconcerted.] If they're tired of each other, they ought
      not to marry, and if father's going to make them&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. You don't understand in the least. It's for the sake of the&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Out with it, Old Sweetness! The approaching infant! God bless it!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        There is a sudden silence, for KEITH and LATTER are seen coming from the
        dining-room.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LATTER. That must be so, Ronny.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. No, John; not a bit of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. You don't think!
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. Good Gad, who wants to think after dinner!

    <p>
      DOT. Come on! Let's play pool. [She turns at the billiard-room door.] Look
      here! Rehearsal to-morrow is directly after breakfast; from "Eccles enters
      breathless" to the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. Whatever made you choose "Caste," DOT? You know it's awfully
      difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Because it's the only play that's not too advanced. [The girls all go
      into the billiard-room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Where's Bill, Ronny?
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. [With a grimace] I rather think Sir William and he are in Committee
      of Supply&mdash;Mem-Sahib.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Oh!
    </p>

      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LATTER. [In the tone of one resuming an argument] There can't be two
      opinions about it, Ronny. Young Dunning's refusal is simply indefensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. I don't agree a bit, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. Of course, if you won't listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. [Clipping a cigar] Draw it mild, my dear chap. We've had the whole
      thing over twice at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. My point is this&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. [Regarding LATTER quizzically with his halfclosed eyes] I know&mdash;I
      know&mdash;but the point is, how far your point is simply professional.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. If a man wrongs a woman, he ought to right her again. There's no
      answer to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. It all depends.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. That's rank opportunism.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. Rats! Look here&mdash;Oh! hang it, John, one can't argue this out
      with a parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. [Frigidly] Why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. [Who has entered from the dining-room] Pull devil, pull baker!
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. Shut up, Harold!
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. "To play the game" is the religion even of the Army.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. Exactly, but what is the game?
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. What else can it be in this case?
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. You're too puritanical, young John. You can't help it&mdash;line of
      country laid down for you. All drag-huntin'! What!
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. [With concentration] Look here!
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. [Imitating the action of a man pulling at a horse's head] 'Come
      hup, I say, you hugly beast!'
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. [To LATTER] You're not going to draw me, old chap. You don't see
      where you'd land us all. [He smokes calmly]
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. How do you imagine vice takes its rise? From precisely this sort
      of thing of young Dunning's.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. From human nature, I should have thought, John. I admit that I
      don't like a fellow's leavin' a girl in the lurch; but I don't see the use
      in drawin' hard and fast rules. You only have to break 'em. Sir William
      and you would just tie Dunning and the girl up together, willy-nilly, to
      save appearances, and ten to one but there'll be the deuce to pay in a
      year's time. You can take a horse to the water, you can't make him drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. I entirely and absolutely disagree with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Good old John!
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. At all events we know where your principles take you.
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. [Rather dangerously] Where, please? [HAROLD turns up his eyes, and
      points downwards] Dry up, Harold!
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. Did you ever hear the story of Faust?
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. Now look here, John; with all due respect to your cloth, and all
      the politeness in the world, you may go to-blazes.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. Well, I must say, Ronny&mdash;of all the rude boors&mdash;&mdash;[He
      turns towards the billiard-room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. Sorry I smashed the glass, old chap.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        LATTER passes out. There comes a mingled sound through the opened door,
        of female voices, laughter, and the click of billiard balls, dipped of
        by the sudden closing of the door.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      KEITH. [Impersonally] Deuced odd, the way a parson puts one's back up!
      Because you know I agree with him really; young Dunning ought to play the
      game; and I hope Sir William'll make him.

    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Ah! Studdenham. Bad business this, about young Dunning!
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Yes, Sir William.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. He definitely refuses to marry her?
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. He does that.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. That won't do, you know. What reason does he give?
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Won't say other than that he don't want no more to do with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. God bless me! That's not a reason. I can't have a keeper of
      mine playing fast and loose in the village like this. [Turning to LADY
      CHESHIRE, who has come in from the billiard-room] That affair of young
      Dunning's, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Oh! Yes! I'm so sorry, Studdenham. The poor girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [Respectfully] Fancy he's got a feeling she's not his equal,
      now, my lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [To herself] Yes, I suppose he has made her his superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. What? Eh! Quite! Quite! I was just telling Studdenham the
      fellow must set the matter straight. We can't have open scandals in the
      village. If he wants to keep his place he must marry her at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [To her husband in a low voice] Is it right to force them?
      Do you know what the girl wishes, Studdenham?
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Shows a spirit, my lady&mdash;says she'll have him&mdash;willin'
      or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. A spirit? I see. If they marry like that they're sure to be
      miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. What! Doesn't follow at all. Besides, my dear, you ought to
      know by this time, there's an unwritten law in these matters. They're
      perfectly well aware that when there are consequences, they have to take
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Some o' these young people, my lady, they don't put two and
      two together no more than an old cock pheasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I'll give him till to-morrow. If he remains obstinate, he'll
      have to go; he'll get no character, Studdenham. Let him know what I've
      said. I like the fellow, he's a good keeper. I don't want to lose him. But
      this sort of thing I won't have. He must toe the mark or take himself off.
      Is he up here to-night?
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Hangin' partridges, Sir William. Will you have him in?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [Hesitating] Yes&mdash;yes. I'll see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Good-night to you, my lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Freda's not looking well, Studdenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. She's a bit pernickitty with her food, that's where it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. I must try and make her eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Oh! Studdenham. We'll shoot the home covert first. What did
      we get last year?
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [Producing the game-book; but without reference to it] Two
      hundred and fifty-three pheasants, eleven hares, fifty-two rabbits, three
      woodcock, sundry.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Sundry? Didn't include a fox did it? [Gravely] I was
      seriously upset this morning at Warnham's spinney&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SUDDENHAM. [Very gravely] You don't say, Sir William; that four-year-old
      he du look a handful!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [With a sharp look] You know well enough what I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [Unmoved] Shall I send young Dunning, Sir William?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

      SIR WILLIAM. [Patting her arm] My dear, you don't understand young
      fellows, how should you?

      SIR WILLIAM. Studdenham's told you what I want to see you about?
    </p>
    <p>
      DUNNING. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. The thing's in your hands. Take it or leave it. I don't put
      pressure on you. I simply won't have this sort of thing on my estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      DUNNING. I'd like to say, Sir William, that she [He stops].
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Yes, I daresay-Six of one and half a dozen of the other.
      Can't go into that.
    </p>
    <p>
      DUNNING. No, Sir William.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I'm quite mild with you. This is your first place. If you
      leave here you'll get no character.
    </p>
    <p>
      DUNNING. I never meant any harm, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. My good fellow, you know the custom of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      DUNNING. Yes, Sir William, but&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. You should have looked before you leaped. I'm not forcing
      you. If you refuse you must go, that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      DUNNING. Yes. Sir William.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Well, now go along and take a day to think it over.

      something of the kind.

    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. I would, for two straws!
    </p>

      place, and the name, and your career. The Cheshires are all like that.
      They've been here so long; they're all&mdash;root.

      But, Bill, why must you spend more than your allowance?
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Why&mdash;anything? I didn't make myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. I'm afraid we did that. It was inconsiderate, perhaps.
    </p>

      things, and takes up a pen] I must write these letters, please.

      LADY CHESHIRE. [Still speaking to the fire] It seems dreadful to force

      SIR WILLIAM. [Genially] Can you give me another five minutes, Bill?
      [Pointing to the billiard-room] We'll come directly, my dear.

    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I shall give young Dunning short shrift. [He moves over to
      the fireplace and divides hip coat-tails] Now, about you, Bill! I don't
      want to bully you the moment you come down, but you know, this can't go
      on. I've paid your debts twice. Shan't pay them this time unless I see a
      disposition to change your mode of life. [A pause] You get your
      extravagance from your mother. She's very queer&mdash;[A pause]&mdash;All
      the Winterleighs are like that about money....
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Mother's particularly generous, if that's what you mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [Drily] We will put it that way. [A pause] At the present
      moment you owe, as I understand it, eleven hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. About that.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Mere flea-bite. [A pause] I've a proposition to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Won't it do to-morrow, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. "To-morrow" appears to be your motto in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Thanks!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I'm anxious to change it to-day. [BILL looks at him in
      silence] It's time you took your position seriously, instead of hanging
      about town, racing, and playing polo, and what not.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Go ahead!
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        At something dangerous in his voice, SIR WILLIAM modifies his attitude.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SIR, WILLIAM. The proposition's very simple. I can't suppose anything so
      rational and to your advantage will appeal to you, but [drily] I mention
      it. Marry a nice girl, settle down, and stand for the division; you can
      have the Dower House and fifteen hundred a year, and I'll pay your debts
      into the bargain. If you're elected I'll make it two thousand. Plenty of
      time to work up the constituency before we kick out these infernal Rads.
      Carpetbagger against you; if you go hard at it in the summer, it'll be odd
      if you don't manage to get in your three days a week, next season. You can
      take Rocketer and that four-year-old&mdash;he's well up to your weight,
      fully eight and a half inches of bone. You'll only want one other. And if
      Miss&mdash;if your wife means to hunt&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. You've chosen my wife, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [With a quick look] I imagine, you've some girl in your mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM: Used not to be unnatural at your age. I married your mother
      at twenty-eight. Here you are, eldest son of a family that stands for
      something. The more I see of the times the more I'm convinced that
      everybody who is anybody has got to buckle to, and save the landmarks
      left. Unless we're true to our caste, and prepared to work for it, the
      landed classes are going to go under to this infernal democratic spirit in
      the air. The outlook's very serious. We're threatened in a hundred ways.
      If you mean business, you'll want a wife. When I came into the property I
      should have been lost without your mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. I thought this was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [With a certain geniality] My dear fellow, I don't want to
      put a pistol to your head. You've had a slack rein so far. I've never
      objected to your sowing a few wild oats-so long as you &mdash;er&mdash;[Unseen
      by SIR WILLIAM, BILL makes a sudden movement] Short of that&mdash;at all
      events, I've not inquired into your affairs. I can only judge by the&mdash;er&mdash;pecuniary
      evidence you've been good enough to afford me from time to time. I imagine
      you've lived like a good many young men in your position&mdash;I'm not
      blaming you, but there's a time for all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Why don't you say outright that you want me to marry Mabel Lanfarne?
    </p>
    <p>
      SITS WILLIAM. Well, I do. Girl's a nice one. Good family&mdash;got a
      little money&mdash;rides well. Isn't she good-looking enough for you, or
      what?
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Quite, thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I understood from your mother that you and she were on good
      terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Please don't drag mother into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [With dangerous politeness] Perhaps you'll be good enough to
      state your objections.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Must we go on with this?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I've never asked you to do anything for me before; I expect
      you to pay attention now. I've no wish to dragoon you into this particular
      marriage. If you don't care for Miss Lanfarne, marry a girl you're fond
      of.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. I refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. In that case you know what to look out for. [With a sudden
      rush of choler] You young.... [He checks himself and stands glaring at
      BILL, who glares back at him] This means, I suppose, that you've got some
      entanglement or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Suppose what you like, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      SITS WILLIAM. I warn you, if you play the blackguard&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. You can't force me like young Dunning.

        drawing-room, them opens the door under the stairs; and backing away
        towards the writing-table, sits down there, and takes up a pen. FREDA
        who has evidently been waiting, comes in and stands by the table.

    <p>
      FREDA. Quite&mdash;long enough&mdash;for you to have forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Forgotten! I don't forget people so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. No?
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. What's the matter with you, Freda?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. [After a long look] It'll never be as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. [Jumping up] How d'you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. I've got something for you. [She takes a diamond ring out of her
      dress and holds it out to him] I've not worn it since Cromer.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Now, look here
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. I've had my holiday; I shan't get another in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Freda!
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. You'll be glad to be free. That fortnight's all you really loved me
      in.
    </p>

      BILL. [Putting his hands on her arms] I swear&mdash;&mdash;

      FREDA. [Between her teeth] Miss Lanfarne need never know about me.

      FREDA. When you marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. This is too bad.

    <p>
      FREDA. It's what always happens&mdash;even when it's not a&mdash;gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. That's enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. But I'm not like that girl down in the village. You needn't be
      afraid I'll say anything when&mdash;it comes. That's what I had to tell
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. What!
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. I can keep a secret.

    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Good God!

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The scene is LADY CHESHIRE's morning room, at ten o'clock on the
        following day. It is a pretty room, with white panelled walls; and
        chrysanthemums and carmine lilies in bowls. A large bow window overlooks
        the park under a sou'-westerly sky. A piano stands open; a fire is
        burning; and the morning's correspondence is scattered on a
        writing-table. Doors opposite each other lead to the maid's workroom,
        and to a corridor. LADY CHESHIRE is standing in the middle of the room,
        looking at an opera cloak, which FREDA is holding out.

    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Well, Freda, suppose you just give it up!

      FREDA. I don't like to be beaten.

    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. You're not to worry over your work. And by the way, I
      promised your father to make you eat more. [FREDA smiles.]

    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. It's all very well to smile. You want bracing up. Now don't
      be naughty. I shall give you a tonic. And I think you had better put that
      cloak away.

    <p>
      FREDA. I'd rather have one more try, my lady.

    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. I just wondered whether you'd like to ask my advice. Your

    <p>
      ROSE. Yes&mdash;but I've told him he's got to marry me.

    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. I see! And you think that'll be the wisest thing?

    <p>
      ROSE. [Stolidly] I don't know, my lady. He's got to.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. I do hope you're a little fond of him still.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROSE. I'm not. He don't deserve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE: And&mdash;do you think he's quite lost his affection for
      you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROSE. I suppose so, else he wouldn't treat me as he's done. He's after
      that&mdash;that&mdash;He didn't ought to treat me as if I was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. No, no&mdash;of course. But you will think it all well
      over, won't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROSE. I've a&mdash;got nothing to think over, except what I know of.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. But for you both to marry in that spirit! You know it's for
      life, Rose. [Looking into her face] I'm always ready to help you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROSE. [Dropping a very slight curtsey] Thank you, my lady, but I think he
      ought to marry me. I've told him he ought.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Sighing] Well, that's all I wanted to say. It's a question
      of your self-respect; I can't give you any real advice. But just remember
      that if you want a friend&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROSE. [With a gulp] I'm not so 'ard, really. I only want him to do what's
      right by me.

    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [With a little lift of her eyebrow&mdash;gently] Yes, yes&mdash;I
      see.

    <p>
      ROSE. [Glancing back at the door] I don't like meeting the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Come along, I'll take you out another way. [As they reach
      the door, DOT comes in.]

      rehearsal, Mother?

      as he advances] And overturning people on the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Hadn't you better be a little careful?
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. And never to see the hedge until they're stuck in it. And then
      straight from that hedge into the opposite one.

    <p>
      BILL. [Savagely] What makes you bait me this morning of all mornings?
    </p>
    <p>
      MABEL. The beautiful morning! [Suddenly] It must be dull for poor Freda
      working in there with all this fun going on?

    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. No.

      smile] You can't help coming after me! [Then with a sudden change to a
      sort of sierra gravity] Can you? You'll feel that when I've gone.

      married quietly, and&mdash;and&mdash;go to Canada.

      LADY CHESHIRE. [With painful irony] It is not so as a rule.

      BILL. Up to now I've never heard you or the girls say a word against
      Freda. This isn't the moment to begin, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Solemnly] All such marriages end in wretchedness. You
      haven't a taste or tradition in common. You don't know what marriage is.
      Day after day, year after year. It's no use being sentimental&mdash;for
      people brought up as we are to have different manners is worse than to
      have different souls. Besides, it's poverty. Your father will never
      forgive you, and I've practically nothing. What can you do? You have no
      profession. How are you going to stand it; with a woman who&mdash;? It's
      the little things.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. I know all that, thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Nobody does till they've been through it. Marriage is hard
      enough when people are of the same class. [With a sudden movement towards
      him] Oh! my dear-before it's too late!
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. [After a struggle] It's no good.

    <p>

      LADY CHESHIRE. [With an almost angry vehemence] Only the very finest can
      do such things. And you don't even know what trouble's like.

      BILL. Drop it, please, mother.

      whatever happens. [She walks to the window, and speaks from there] I know
      well enough how love comes. I don't blame you. Don't cry. But, you see,
      it's my eldest son. [FREDA puts her hand to her breast] Yes, I know. Women
      always get the worst of these things. That's natural. But it's not only
      you is it? Does any one guess?

    <p>
      FREDA. No.

    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Not even your father? [FREDA shakes her head] There's

      neck. How far has it gone? Tell me!

    <p>
      FREDA. I can't.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Come!
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. I&mdash;won't.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Smiling painfully]. Won't give him away? Both of you the
      same. What's the use of that with me? Look at me! Wasn't he with you when
      you went for your holiday this summer?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. He's&mdash;always&mdash;behaved&mdash;like&mdash;a&mdash;gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Like a man you mean!
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. It hasn't been his fault! I love him so.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        LADY CHESHIRE turns abruptly, and begins to walk up and down the room.
        Then stopping, she looks intently at FREDA.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. I don't know what to say to you. It's simple madness! It
      can't, and shan't go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. [Sullenly] I know I'm not his equal, but I am&mdash;somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Answering this first assertion of rights with a sudden
      steeliness] Does he love you now?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. That's not fair&mdash;it's not fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. If men are like gunpowder, Freda, women are not. If you've
      lost him it's been your own fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. But he does love me, he must. It's only four months.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Looking down, and speaking rapidly] Listen to me. I love
      my son, but I know him&mdash;I know all his kind of man. I've lived with
      one for thirty years. I know the way their senses work. When they want a
      thing they must have it, and then&mdash;they're sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. [Sullenly] He's not sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Is his love big enough to carry you both over
      everything?.... You know it isn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. If I were a lady, you wouldn't talk like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. If you were a lady there'd be no trouble before either of
      you. You'll make him hate you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. I won't believe it. I could make him happy&mdash;out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. I don't want to be so odious as to say all the things you
      must know. I only ask you to try and put yourself in our position.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Ah, yes!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. You ought to know me better than to think I'm purely
      selfish.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Would you like to put yourself in my position?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. What!
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Yes. Just like Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [In a low, horror-stricken voice] Oh!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        There is a dead silence, then going swiftly up to her, she looks
        straight into FREDA's eyes.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FREDA. [Meeting her gaze] Oh! Yes&mdash;it's the truth. [Then to Bill who
      has come in from the workroom, she gasps out] I never meant to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Well, are you satisfied?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Below her breath] This is terrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. The Governor had better know.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Oh! no; not yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. Waiting won't cure it!

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The door from the corridor is thrown open; CHRISTINE and DOT run in with
        their copies of the play in their hands; seeing that something is wrong,

        goes back into the workroom. LADY CHESHIRE moves towards the window.

    <p>

      LADY CHESHIRE] Good-bye, my dear! Sampson's Gorse &mdash;best day of the

      JOAN. Chris?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. [In a hard voice] Mother ought to have told us.

        No one moves or speaks. Suddenly MABEL LANFARNE goes towards him,

      ACT III
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is five o'clock of the same day. The scene is the smoking-room, with
        walls of Leander red, covered by old steeplechase and hunting prints.
        Armchairs encircle a high ferulered hearth, in which a fire is burning.
        The curtains are not yet drawn across mullioned windows, but electric
        light is burning. There are two doors, leading, the one to the
        billiard-room, the other to a corridor. BILL is pacing up and doom;
        HAROLD, at the fireplace, stands looking at him with commiseration.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BILL. What's the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Nearly five. They won't be in yet, if that's any consolation.
      Always a tough meet&mdash;[softly] as the tiger said when he ate the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. By Jove! You're the only person I can stand within a mile of me,
      Harold.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Old boy! Do you seriously think you're going to make it any better
      by marrying her?

      HAROLD. No, old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. But I've got a kind of self-respect though you wouldn't think it!

    <p>
      HAROLD. My dear old chap!

    <p>
      BILL. This is about as low-down a thing as one could have done, I suppose&mdash;one's
      own mother's maid; we've known her since she was so high. I see it now
      that&mdash;I've got over the attack.

    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. It's simply that I shall feel such a d&mdash;-d skunk, if I leave
      her in the lurch, with everybody knowing. Try it yourself; you'd soon see!
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Poor old chap!
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. It's not as if she'd tried to force me into it. And she's a soft
      little thing. Why I ever made such a sickening ass of myself, I can't
      think. I never meant&mdash;&mdash;

      HAROLD. No, I know! But, don't do anything rash, Bill; keep your head, old
      man!

    <p>
      BILL. I don't see what loss I should be, if I did clear out of the
      country. [The sound of cannoning billiard balls is heard] Who's that
      knocking the balls about?

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. [Pacing up and down in his turn] Rat in a cage is a fool to him.
      This is the sort of thing you read of in books, John! What price your
      argument with Runny now? Well, it's not too late for you luckily.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. What do you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. You needn't connect yourself with this eccentric family!

    <p>
      HAROLD. Good!

    <p>
      LATTER. It's terrible for your sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Deuced lucky we haven't a lot of people staying here! Poor mother!
      John, I feel awfully bad about this. If something isn't done, pretty mess
      I shall be in.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. How?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. There's no entail. If the Governor cuts Bill off, it'll all come
      to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. Oh!
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Poor old Bill! I say, the play! Nemesis! What? Moral! Caste don't
      matter. Got us fairly on the hop.

    <p>
      LATTER. It's too bad of Bill. It really is. He's behaved disgracefully.

    <p>
      HAROLD. [Warningly] Well! There are thousands of fellows who'd never dream
      of sticking to the girl, considering what it means.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. Perfectly disgusting!
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Hang you, John! Haven't you any human sympathy? Don't you know how
      these things come about? It's like a spark in a straw-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. One doesn't take lighted pipes into strawyards unless one's an
      idiot, or worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. H'm! [With a grin] You're not allowed tobacco. In the good old
      days no one would hive thought anything of this. My great-grandfather&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. Spare me your great-grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. I could tell you of at least a dozen men I know who've been
      through this same business, and got off scot-free; and now because Bill's
      going to play the game, it'll smash him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. Why didn't he play the game at the beginning?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. I can't stand your sort, John. When a thing like this happens, all
      you can do is to cry out: Why didn't he&mdash;? Why didn't she&mdash;?
      What's to be done&mdash;that's the point!
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. Of course he'll have to&mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Ha!
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. What do you mean by&mdash;that?
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Look here, John! You feel in your bones that a marriage'll be
      hopeless, just as I do, knowing Bill and the girl and everything! Now
      don't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      LATTER. The whole thing is&mdash;is most unfortunate.

      HAROLD. By Jove! I should think it was!

      CHRISTINE. I've told Ronny.

      KEITH. Clackenham. He'll be home in ten minutes.

      DOT. Mabel's going. [They all stir, as if at fresh consciousness of
      discomfiture]. She walked into Gracely and sent herself a telegram.

    <p>
      DOT. And we shall say good-bye, as if nothing had happened.

      CHRISTINE. [In a hard voice] As we're all doing.

      DOT. She's so soft, that's what's so horrible. If one could only feel&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. She's got to face the music like the rest of us.
    </p>

      one jigging it!

      KEITH. What's our line of country to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. All depends on father.

    <p>
      KEITH. Sir William's between the devil and the deep sea, as it strikes me.

    <p>
      CHRISTINE. He'll simply forbid it utterly, of course.

    <p>
      KEITH. [Patting his wife's arm] Hardly the point, is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. If it wasn't for mother! Freda's just as much of a lady as most
      girls. Why shouldn't he marry her, and go to Canada? It's what he's really
      fit for.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Steady on, Dot!
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Well, imagine him in Parliament! That's what he'll come to, if he
      stays here&mdash;jolly for the country!

    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Don't be cynical! We must find a way of stopping Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Me cynical!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Let's go and beg him, Ronny!
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. No earthly! The only hope is in the girl.

      HAROLD. I say! What price young Dunning! Right about face! Poor old Dad!

      CHRISTINE. It's ridiculous&mdash;monstrous! It's fantastic!

      LADY CHESHIRE. [Straightening herself] What sort of a run, Ronny?

    <p>
      KEITH. Quite fair, M'm. Brazier's to Caffyn's Dyke, good straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. And the young horse?
    </p>
    <p>
      KEITH. Carries his ears in your mouth a bit, that's all. [Putting his hand
      on her shoulder] Cheer up, Mem-Sahib!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Mother, must anything be said to father? Ronny thinks it all
      depends on her. Can't you use your influence? [LADY CHESHIRE shakes her
      head.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. But, mother, it's desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Shut up, Chris! Of course mother can't. We simply couldn't beg her to
      let us off!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. There must be some way. What do you think in your heart,
      mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Leave mother alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. It must be faced, now or never.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. [In a low voice] Haven't you any self-respect?
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. We shall be the laughing-stock of the whole county. Oh! mother
      do speak to her! You know it'll be misery for both of them. [LADY CHESHIRE
      bows her head] Well, then? [LADY CHESHIRE shakes her head.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Not even for Bill's sake?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOT. Chris!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. Well, for heaven's sake, speak to Bill again, mother! We ought
      all to go on our knees to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. He's with your father now.
    </p>
    <p>
      HAROLD. Poor old Bill!

    <p>
      CHRISTINE. [Passionately] He didn't think of us! That wretched girl!

      LADY CHESHIRE. Chris!
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. There are limits!
    </p>

      LADY CHESHIRE. Not to self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. No, mother! I can't I never shall&mdash;Something must be done!
      You know what Bill is. He rushes at things so, when he gets his head down.
      Oh! do try! It's only fair to her, and all of us!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Painfully] There are things one can't do.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTINE. But it's Bill! I know you can make her give him up, if you'll
      only say all you can. And, after all, what's coming won't affect her as if
      she'd been a lady. Only you can do it, mother: Do back me up, all of you!

        splashed; his face very grim and set. He walks to the fore without a
        glance at any one, and stands looking down into it. Very quietly, every

    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Rising] If he were a blackguard he would not be what you
      call a fool.

      SIR WILLIAM. [After staring angrily, makes her a slight bow] Very well!

      terrible.

    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. In all my life I've never been face to face with a thing like
      this. [Gripping the mantelpiece so hard that his hands and arms are seen
      shaking] You ask me to be calm. I am trying to be. Be good enough in turn
      not to take his part against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Bill!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I am trying to think. I understand that you've known this&mdash;piece
      of news since this morning. I've known it ten minutes. Give me a little
      time, please. [Then, after a silence] Where's the girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. In the workroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [Raising his clenched fist] What in God's name is he about?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. What have you said to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Nothing-by a miracle. [He breaks away from the fire and walks
      up and down] My family goes back to the thirteenth century. Nowadays they
      laugh at that! I don't! Nowadays they laugh at everything&mdash;they even
      laugh at the word lady. I married you, and I don't .... Married his
      mother's maid! By George! Dorothy! I don't know what we've done to deserve
      this; it's a death blow! I'm not prepared to sit down and wait for it. By
      Gad! I am not. [With sudden fierceness] There are plenty in these days
      who'll be glad enough for this to happen; plenty of these d&mdash;-d
      Socialists and Radicals, who'll laugh their souls out over what they
      haven't the bowels to sees a&mdash;tragedy. I say it would be a tragedy;
      for you, and me, and all of us. You and I were brought up, and we've
      brought the children up, with certain beliefs, and wants, and habits. A
      man's past&mdash;his traditions&mdash;he can't get rid of them. They're&mdash;they're
      himself! [Suddenly] It shan't go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. What's to prevent it?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I utterly forbid this piece of madness. I'll stop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. But the thing we can't stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Provision must be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. The unwritten law!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. What! [Suddenly perceiving what she is alluding to] You're
      thinking of young&mdash;young&mdash;&mdash;[Shortly] I don't see the
      connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. What's so awful, is that the boy's trying to do what's
      loyal&mdash;and we&mdash;his father and mother&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I'm not going to see my eldest son ruin his life. I must
      think this out.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Beneath her breath] I've tried that&mdash;it doesn't help.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. This girl, who was born on the estate, had the run of the
      house&mdash;brought up with money earned from me&mdash;nothing but
      kindness from all of us; she's broken the common rules of gratitude and
      decency&mdash;she lured him on, I haven't a doubt!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [To herself] In a way, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. What! It's ruin. We've always been here. Who the deuce are we
      if we leave this place? D'you think we could stay? Go out and meet
      everybody just as if nothing had happened? Good-bye to any prestige,
      political, social, or anything! This is the sort of business nothing can
      get over. I've seen it before. As to that other matter&mdash;it's soon
      forgotten&mdash;constantly happening&mdash;Why, my own grandfather&mdash;&mdash;!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Does he help?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [Stares before him in silence-suddenly] You must go to the
      girl. She's soft. She'll never hold out against you.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. I did before I knew what was in front of her&mdash;I said
      all I could. I can't go again now. I can't do it, Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. What are you going to do, then&mdash;fold your hands? [Then
      as LADY CHESHIRE makes a move of distress.] If he marries her, I've done
      with him. As far as I'm concerned he'll cease to exist. The title&mdash;I
      can't help. My God! Does that meet your wishes?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [With sudden fire] You've no right to put such an
      alternative to me. I'd give ten years of my life to prevent this marriage.
      I'll go to Bill. I'll beg him on my knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Then why can't you go to the girl? She deserves no
      consideration. It's not a question of morality: Morality be d&mdash;-d!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. But not self-respect....
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. What! You're his mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. I've tried; I [putting her hand to her throat] can't get it
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [Staring at her] You won't go to her? It's the only chance.
      [LADY CHESHIRE turns away.]
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. In the whole course of our married life, Dorothy, I've never
      known you set yourself up against me. I resent this, I warn you&mdash;I
      resent it. Send the girl to me. I'll do it myself.

      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I've not a word to say for my son. He's behaved like a scamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Oh! no!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [With a silencing gesture] At the same, time&mdash;What made
      you forget yourself? You've no excuse, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. You'll deserve all you'll get. Confound it! To expect me to&mdash;It's
      intolerable! Do you know where my son is?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. [Faintly] I think he's in the billiard-room with my lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [With renewed resolution] I wanted to&mdash;to put it to you&mdash;as
      a&mdash;as a&mdash;what! [Seeing her stand so absolutely motionless,
      looking at him, he turns abruptly, and opens the billiard-room door] I'll
      speak to him first. Come in here, please! [To FREDA] Go in, and wait!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        LADY CHESHIRE and BILL Come in, and FREDA passing them, goes into the
        billiard-room to wait.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [Speaking with a pause between each sentence] Your mother and
      I have spoken of this&mdash;calamity. I imagine that even you have some
      dim perception of the monstrous nature of it. I must tell you this: If you
      do this mad thing, you fend for yourself. You'll receive nothing from me
      now or hereafter. I consider that only due to the position our family has
      always held here. Your brother will take your place. We shall&mdash;get on
      as best we can without you. [There is a dead silence till he adds sharply]
      Well!
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. I shall marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Oh! Bill! Without love-without anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. All right, mother! [To SIR WILLIAM] you've mistaken your man, sir.
      Because I'm a rotter in one way, I'm not necessarily a rotter in all. You
      put the butt end of the pistol to Dunning's head yesterday, you put the
      other end to mine to-day. Well! [He turns round to go out] Let the d&mdash;-d
      thing off!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Bill!
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. [Turning to her] I'm not going to leave her in the lurch.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Do me the justice to admit that I have not attempted to
      persuade you to.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. No! you've chucked me out. I don't see what else you could have done
      under the circumstances. It's quite all right. But if you wanted me to
      throw her over, father, you went the wrong way to work, that's all;
      neither you nor I are very good at seeing consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Do you realise your position?
    </p>
    <p>
      BILK. [Grimly] I've a fair notion of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [With a sudden outburst] You have none&mdash;not the
      faintest, brought up as you've been.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. I didn't bring myself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [With a movement of uncontrolled anger, to which his son
      responds] You&mdash;ungrateful young dog!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. How can you&mdash;both? [They drop their eyes, and stand
      silent.]
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [With grimly suppressed emotion] I am speaking under the
      stress of very great pain&mdash;some consideration is due to me. This is a
      disaster which I never expected to have to face. It is a matter which I
      naturally can never hope to forget. I shall carry this down to my death.
      We shall all of us do that. I have had the misfortune all my life to
      believe in our position here&mdash;to believe that we counted for
      something&mdash;that the country wanted us. I have tried to do my duty by
      that position. I find in one moment that it is gone&mdash; smoke&mdash;gone.
      My philosophy is not equal to that. To countenance this marriage would be
      unnatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. I know. I'm sorry. I've got her into this&mdash;I don't see any
      other way out. It's a bad business for me, father, as well as for you&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He stops, seeing that JACKSON has route in, and is standing there
        waiting.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JACKSON. Will you speak to Studdenham, Sir William? It's about young
      Dunning.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        After a moment of dead silence, SIR WILLIAM nods, and the butler
        withdraws.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BILL. [Stolidly] He'd better be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. He shall be.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        STUDDENHAM enters, and touches his forehead to them all with a
        comprehensive gesture.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Good evenin', my lady! Evenin', Sir William!
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Glad to be able to tell you, the young man's to do the proper
      thing. Asked me to let you know, Sir William. Banns'll be up next Sunday.
      [Struck by the silence, he looks round at all three in turn, and suddenly
      seeing that LADY CHESHIRE is shivering] Beg pardon, my lady, you're
      shakin' like a leaf!
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. [Blurting it out] I've a painful piece of news for you, Studdenham;
      I'm engaged to your daughter. We're to be married at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. I&mdash;don't&mdash;understand you&mdash;sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. The fact is, I've behaved badly; but I mean to put it straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. I'm a little deaf. Did you say&mdash;my daughter?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. There's no use mincing matters, Studdenham. It's a
      thunderbolt&mdash;young Dunning's case over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. I don't rightly follow. She's&mdash;You've&mdash;! I must see
      my daughter. Have the goodness to send for her, m'lady.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        LADY CHESHIRE goes to the billiard-room, and calls: "FREDA, come here,
        please."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [TO SIR WILLIAM] YOU tell me that my daughter's in the
      position of that girl owing to your son? Men ha' been shot for less.
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. If you like to have a pot at me, Studdenham you're welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [Averting his eyes from BILL at the sheer idiocy of this
      sequel to his words] I've been in your service five and twenty years, Sir
      William; but this is man to man&mdash;this is!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I don't deny that, Studdenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [With eyes shifting in sheer anger] No&mdash;'twouldn't be
      very easy. Did I understand him to say that he offers her marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. You did.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [Into his beard] Well&mdash;that's something! [Moving his
      hands as if wringing the neck of a bird] I'm tryin' to see the rights o'
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. [Bitterly] You've all your work cut out for you, Studdenham.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Again STUDDENHAM makes the unconscious wringing movement with his hands.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Turning from it with a sort of horror] Don't, Studdenham!
      Please!
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. What's that, m'lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. [Under her breath] Your&mdash;your&mdash;hands.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        While STUDDENHAM is still staring at her, FREDA is seen standing in the
        doorway, like a black ghost.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Come here! You! [FREDA moves a few steps towards her father]
      When did you start this?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. [Almost inaudibly] In the summer, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE. Don't be harsh to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Harsh! [His eyes again move from side to side as if pain and
      anger had bewildered them. Then looking sideways at FREDA, but in a
      gentler voice] And when did you tell him about&mdash;what's come to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      FREDA. Last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Oh! [With sudden menace] You young&mdash;! [He makes a
      convulsive movement of one hand; then, in the silence, seems to lose grip
      of his thoughts, and pits his hand up to his head] I want to clear me mind
      a bit&mdash;I don't see it plain at all. [Without looking at BILL] 'Tis
      said there's been an offer of marriage?
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. I've made it, I stick to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Oh! [With slow, puzzled anger] I want time to get the pith o'
      this. You don't say anything, Sir William?
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. The facts are all before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [Scarcely moving his lips] M'lady?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        LADY CHESHIRE is silent.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [Stammering] My girl was&mdash;was good enough for any man.
      It's not for him that's&mdash;that's to look down on her. [To FREDA] You
      hear the handsome offer that's been made you? Well? [FREDA moistens her
      lips and tries to speak, but cannot] If nobody's to speak a word, we won't
      get much forrarder. I'd like for you to say what's in your mind, Sir
      William.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I&mdash;If my son marries her he'll have to make his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [Savagely] I'm not puttin' thought to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. I didn't suppose you were, Studdenham. It appears to rest
      with your daughter. [He suddenly takes out his handkerchief, and puts it
      to his forehead] Infernal fires they make up here!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY CHESHIRE, who is again shivering desperately, as if with intense
      cold, makes a violent attempt to control her shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [Suddenly] There's luxuries that's got to be paid for. [To
      FREDA] Speak up, now.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FREDA turns slowly and looks up at SIR WILLIAM; he involuntarily raises
        his hand to his mouth. Her eyes travel on to LADY CHESHIRE, who faces
        her, but so deadly pale that she looks as if she were going to faint.
        The girl's gaze passes on to BILL, standing rigid, with his jaw set.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FREDA. I want&mdash;[Then flinging her arm up over her eyes, she turns
      from him] No!
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Ah!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        At that sound of profound relief, STUDDENHAM, whose eyes have been
        following his daughter's, moves towards SIR WILLIAM, all his emotion
        turned into sheer angry pride.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Don't be afraid, Sir William! We want none of you! She'll not
      force herself where she's not welcome. She may ha' slipped her good name,
      but she'll keep her proper pride. I'll have no charity marriage in my
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. Steady, Studdenham!
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. If the young gentleman has tired of her in three months, as a
      blind man can see by the looks of him&mdash;she's not for him!
    </p>
    <p>
      BILL. [Stepping forward] I'm ready to make it up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. Keep back, there? [He takes hold of FREDA, and looks around
      him] Well! She's not the first this has happened to since the world began,
      an' she won't be the last. Come away, now, come away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking FREDA by the shoulders, he guides her towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIR WILLIAM. D&mdash;-n 'it, Studdenham! Give us credit for something!
    </p>
    <p>
      STUDDENHAM. [Turning his face and eyes lighted up by a sort of smiling
      snarl] Ah! I do that, Sir William. But there's things that can't be
      undone!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He follows FREDA Out. As the door closes, SIR WILLIAM'S Calm gives way.
        He staggers past his wife, and sinks heavily, as though exhausted, into
        a chair by the fire. BILL, following FREDA and STUDDENHAM, has stopped
        at the shut door. LADY CHESHIRE moves swiftly close to him. The door of
        the billiard-room is opened, and DOT appears. With a glance round, she
        crosses quickly to her mother.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      DOT. [In a low voice] Mabel's just going, mother! [Almost whispering]
      Where's Freda? Is it&mdash;Has she really had the pluck?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        LADY CHESHIRE bending her head for "Yes," goes out into the
        billiard-room. DOT clasps her hands together, and standing there in the
        middle of the room, looks from her brother to her father, from her
        father to her brother. A quaint little pitying smile comes on her lips.
        She gives a faint shrug of her shoulders.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

      The curtain falls.

 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 States.

      License.  You must require such a user to return or

      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
      Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.

 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 opportunities to fix the problem.

 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
