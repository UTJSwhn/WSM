      I
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of St. George's registry office, Charles Clare Winton strolled
      forward in the wake of the taxi-cab that was bearing his daughter away
      with &ldquo;the fiddler fellow&rdquo; she had married. His sense of decorum forbade
      his walking with Nurse Betty&mdash;the only other witness of the wedding.
      A stout woman in a highly emotional condition would have been an
      incongruous companion to his slim, upright figure, moving with just that
      unexaggerated swing and balance becoming to a lancer of the old school,
      even if he has been on the retired list for sixteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Betty! He thought of her with irritated sympathy&mdash;she need not
      have given way to tears on the door-step. She might well feel lost now Gyp
      was gone, but not so lost as himself! His pale-gloved hand&mdash;the one
      real hand he had, for his right hand had been amputated at the wrist&mdash;twisted
      vexedly at the small, grizzling moustache lifting itself from the corners
      of his firm lips. On this grey February day he wore no overcoat; faithful
      to the absolute, almost shamefaced quietness of that wedding, he had not
      even donned black coat and silk hat, but wore a blue suit and a hard black
      felt. The instinct of a soldier and hunting man to exhibit no sign
      whatever of emotion did not desert him this dark day of his life; but his
      grey-hazel eyes kept contracting, staring fiercely, contracting again;
      and, at moments, as if overpowered by some deep feeling, they darkened and
      seemed to draw back in his head. His face was narrow and weathered and
      thin-cheeked, with a clean-cut jaw, small ears, hair darker than the
      moustache, but touched at the side wings with grey&mdash;the face of a man
      of action, self-reliant, resourceful. And his bearing was that of one who
      has always been a bit of a dandy, and paid attention to &ldquo;form,&rdquo; yet been
      conscious sometimes that there were things beyond. A man, who, preserving
      all the precision of a type, yet had in him a streak of something that was
      not typical. Such often have tragedy in their pasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making his way towards the park, he turned into Mount Street. There was
      the house still, though the street had been very different then&mdash;the
      house he had passed, up and down, up and down in the fog, like a ghost,
      that November afternoon, like a cast-out dog, in such awful, unutterable
      agony of mind, twenty-three years ago, when Gyp was born. And then to be
      told at the door&mdash;he, with no right to enter, he, loving as he
      believed man never loved woman&mdash;to be told at the door that SHE was
      dead&mdash;dead in bearing what he and she alone knew was their child! Up
      and down in the fog, hour after hour, knowing her time was upon her; and
      at last to be told that! Of all fates that befall man, surely the most
      awful is to love too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queer that his route should take him past the very house to-day, after
      this new bereavement! Accursed luck&mdash;that gout which had sent him to
      Wiesbaden, last September! Accursed luck that Gyp had ever set eyes on
      this fellow Fiorsen, with his fatal fiddle! Certainly not since Gyp had
      come to live with him, fifteen years ago, had he felt so forlorn and fit
      for nothing. To-morrow he would get back to Mildenham and see what hard
      riding would do. Without Gyp&mdash;to be without Gyp! A fiddler! A chap
      who had never been on a horse in his life! And with his crutch-handled
      cane he switched viciously at the air, as though carving a man in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      His club, near Hyde Park Corner, had never seemed to him so desolate. From
      sheer force of habit he went into the card-room. The afternoon had so
      darkened that electric light already burned, and there were the usual
      dozen of players seated among the shaded gleams falling decorously on
      dark-wood tables, on the backs of chairs, on cards and tumblers, the
      little gilded coffee-cups, the polished nails of fingers holding cigars. A
      crony challenged him to piquet. He sat down listless. That three-legged
      whist&mdash;bridge&mdash;had always offended his fastidiousness&mdash;a
      mangled short cut of a game! Poker had something blatant in it. Piquet,
      though out of fashion, remained for him the only game worth playing&mdash;the
      only game which still had style. He held good cards and rose the winner of
      five pounds that he would willingly have paid to escape the boredom of the
      bout. Where would they be by now? Past Newbury; Gyp sitting opposite that
      Swedish fellow with his greenish wildcat's eyes. Something furtive, and so
      foreign, about him! A mess&mdash;if he were any judge of horse or man!
      Thank God he had tied Gyp's money up&mdash;every farthing! And an emotion
      that was almost jealousy swept him at the thought of the fellow's arms
      round his soft-haired, dark-eyed daughter&mdash;that pretty, willowy
      creature, so like in face and limb to her whom he had loved so
      desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eyes followed him when he left the card-room, for he was one who inspired
      in other men a kind of admiration&mdash;none could say exactly why. Many
      quite as noted for general good sportsmanship attracted no such attention.
      Was it &ldquo;style,&rdquo; or was it the streak of something not quite typical&mdash;the
      brand left on him by the past?
    </p>
    <p>
      Abandoning the club, he walked slowly along the railings of Piccadilly
      towards home, that house in Bury Street, St. James's, which had been his
      London abode since he was quite young&mdash;one of the few in the street
      that had been left untouched by the general passion for puffing down and
      building up, which had spoiled half London in his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man, more silent than anything on earth, with the soft, quick, dark eyes
      of a woodcock and a long, greenish, knitted waistcoat, black cutaway, and
      tight trousers strapped over his boots, opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't go out again, Markey. Mrs. Markey must give me some dinner.
      Anything'll do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Markey signalled that he had heard, and those brown eyes under eyebrows
      meeting and forming one long, dark line, took his master in from head to
      heel. He had already nodded last night, when his wife had said the gov'nor
      would take it hard. Retiring to the back premises, he jerked his head
      toward the street and made a motion upward with his hand, by which Mrs.
      Markey, an astute woman, understood that she had to go out and shop
      because the gov'nor was dining in. When she had gone, Markey sat down
      opposite Betty, Gyp's old nurse. The stout woman was still crying in a
      quiet way. It gave him the fair hump, for he felt inclined to howl like a
      dog himself. After watching her broad, rosy, tearful face in silence for
      some minutes, he shook his head, and, with a gulp and a tremor of her
      comfortable body, Betty desisted. One paid attention to Markey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton went first into his daughter's bedroom, and gazed at its emptied
      silken order, its deserted silver mirror, twisting viciously at his little
      moustache. Then, in his sanctum, he sat down before the fire, without
      turning up the light. Anyone looking in, would have thought he was asleep;
      but the drowsy influence of that deep chair and cosy fire had drawn him
      back into the long-ago. What unhappy chance had made him pass HER house
      to-day!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some say there is no such thing as an affinity, no case&mdash;of a man, at
      least&mdash;made bankrupt of passion by a single love. In theory, it may
      be so; in fact, there are such men&mdash;neck-or-nothing men, quiet and
      self-contained, the last to expect that nature will play them such a
      trick, the last to desire such surrender of themselves, the last to know
      when their fate is on them. Who could have seemed to himself, and, indeed,
      to others, less likely than Charles Clare Winton to fall over head and
      ears in love when he stepped into the Belvoir Hunt ballroom at Grantham
      that December evening, twenty-four years ago? A keen soldier, a dandy, a
      first-rate man to hounds, already almost a proverb in his regiment for
      coolness and for a sort of courteous disregard of women as among the minor
      things of life&mdash;he had stood there by the door, in no hurry to dance,
      taking a survey with an air that just did not give an impression of &ldquo;side&rdquo;
       because it was not at all put on. And&mdash;behold!&mdash;SHE had walked
      past him, and his world was changed for ever. Was it an illusion of light
      that made her whole spirit seem to shine through a half-startled glance?
      Or a little trick of gait, a swaying, seductive balance of body; was it
      the way her hair waved back, or a subtle scent, as of a flower? What was
      it? The wife of a squire of those parts, with a house in London. Her name?
      It doesn't matter&mdash;she has been long enough dead. There was no excuse&mdash;not
      an ill-treated woman; an ordinary, humdrum marriage, of three years
      standing; no children. An amiable good fellow of a husband, fifteen years
      older than herself, inclined already to be an invalid. No excuse! Yet, in
      one month from that night, Winton and she were lovers, not only in thought
      but in deed. A thing so utterly beyond &ldquo;good form&rdquo; and his sense of what
      was honourable and becoming in an officer and gentleman that it was simply
      never a question of weighing pro and con, the cons had it so completely.
      And yet from that first evening, he was hers, she his. For each of them
      the one thought was how to be with the other. If so&mdash;why did they not
      at least go off together? Not for want of his beseeching. And no doubt, if
      she had survived Gyp's birth, they would have gone. But to face the
      prospect of ruining two men, as it looked to her, had till then been too
      much for that soft-hearted creature. Death stilled her struggle before it
      was decided. There are women in whom utter devotion can still go hand in
      hand with a doubting soul. Such are generally the most fascinating; for
      the power of hard and prompt decision robs women of mystery, of the subtle
      atmosphere of change and chance. Though she had but one part in four of
      foreign blood, she was not at all English. But Winton was English to his
      back-bone, English in his sense of form, and in that curious streak of
      whole-hearted desperation that will break form to smithereens in one
      department and leave it untouched in every other of its owner's life. To
      have called Winton a &ldquo;crank&rdquo; would never have occurred to any one&mdash;his
      hair was always perfectly parted; his boots glowed; he was hard and
      reticent, accepting and observing every canon of well-bred existence. Yet,
      in that, his one infatuation, he was as lost to the world and its opinion
      as the longest-haired lentil-eater of us all. Though at any moment during
      that one year of their love he would have risked his life and sacrificed
      his career for a whole day in her company, he never, by word or look,
      compromised her. He had carried his punctilious observance of her &ldquo;honour&rdquo;
       to a point more bitter than death, consenting, even, to her covering up
      the tracks of their child's coming. Paying that gambler's debt was by far
      the bravest deed of his life, and even now its memory festered.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this very room he had come back after hearing she was dead; this very
      room which he had refurnished to her taste, so that even now, with its
      satinwood chairs, little dainty Jacobean bureau, shaded old brass
      candelabra, divan, it still had an air exotic to bachelordom. There, on
      the table, had been a letter recalling him to his regiment, ordered on
      active service. If he had realized what he would go through before he had
      the chance of trying to lose his life out there, he would undoubtedly have
      taken that life, sitting in this very chair before the fire&mdash;the
      chair sacred to her and memory. He had not the luck he wished for in that
      little war&mdash;men who don't care whether they live or die seldom have.
      He secured nothing but distinction. When it was over, he went on, with a
      few more lines in his face, a few more wrinkles in his heart, soldiering,
      shooting tigers, pig-sticking, playing polo, riding to hounds harder than
      ever; giving nothing away to the world; winning steadily the curious,
      uneasy admiration that men feel for those who combine reckless daring with
      an ice-cool manner. Since he was less of a talker even than most of his
      kind, and had never in his life talked of women, he did not gain the
      reputation of a woman-hater, though he so manifestly avoided them. After
      six years' service in India and Egypt, he lost his right hand in a charge
      against dervishes, and had, perforce, to retire, with the rank of major,
      aged thirty-four. For a long time he had hated the very thought of the
      child&mdash;his child, in giving birth to whom the woman he loved had
      died. Then came a curious change of feeling; and for three years before
      his return to England, he had been in the habit of sending home odds and
      ends picked up in the bazaars, to serve as toys. In return, he had
      received, twice annually at least, a letter from the man who thought
      himself Gyp's father. These letters he read and answered. The squire was
      likable, and had been fond of HER; and though never once had it seemed
      possible to Winton to have acted otherwise than he did, he had all the
      time preserved a just and formal sense of the wrong he had done this man.
      He did not experience remorse, but he had always an irksome feeling as of
      a debt unpaid, mitigated by knowledge that no one had ever suspected, and
      discounted by memory of the awful torture he had endured to make sure
      against suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, plus distinction and minus his hand, he was at last back in England,
      the squire had come to see him. The poor man was failing fast from
      Bright's disease. Winton entered again that house in Mount Street with an
      emotion, to stifle which required more courage than any cavalry charge.
      But one whose heart, as he would have put it, is &ldquo;in the right place&rdquo; does
      not indulge the quaverings of his nerves, and he faced those rooms where
      he had last seen her, faced that lonely little dinner with her husband,
      without sign of feeling. He did not see little Ghita, or Gyp, as she had
      nicknamed herself, for she was already in her bed; and it was a whole
      month before he brought himself to go there at an hour when he could see
      the child if he would. The fact is, he was afraid. What would the sight of
      this little creature stir in him? When Betty, the nurse, brought her in to
      see the soldier gentleman with &ldquo;the leather hand,&rdquo; who had sent her those
      funny toys, she stood calmly staring with her large, deep-brown eyes.
      Being seven, her little brown-velvet frock barely reached the knees of her
      thin, brown-stockinged legs planted one just in front of the other, as
      might be the legs of a small brown bird; the oval of her gravely wondering
      face was warm cream colour without red in it, except that of the lips,
      which were neither full nor thin, and had a little tuck, the tiniest
      possible dimple at one corner. Her hair of warm dark brown had been
      specially brushed and tied with a narrow red ribbon back from her
      forehead, which was broad and rather low, and this added to her gravity.
      Her eyebrows were thin and dark and perfectly arched; her little nose was
      perfectly straight, her little chin in perfect balance between round and
      point. She stood and stared till Winton smiled. Then the gravity of her
      face broke, her lips parted, her eyes seemed to fly a little. And Winton's
      heart turned over within him&mdash;she was the very child of her that he
      had lost! And he said, in a voice that seemed to him to tremble:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for my toys; I like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand, and she gravely put her small hand into it. A sense
      of solace, as if some one had slipped a finger in and smoothed his heart,
      came over Winton. Gently, so as not to startle her, he raised her hand a
      little, bent, and kissed it. It may have been from his instant recognition
      that here was one as sensitive as child could be, or the way many soldiers
      acquire from dealing with their men&mdash;those simple, shrewd children&mdash;or
      some deeper instinctive sense of ownership between them; whatever it was,
      from that moment, Gyp conceived for him a rushing admiration, one of those
      headlong affections children will sometimes take for the most unlikely
      persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      He used to go there at an hour when he knew the squire would be asleep,
      between two and five. After he had been with Gyp, walking in the park,
      riding with her in the Row, or on wet days sitting in her lonely nursery
      telling stories, while stout Betty looked on half hypnotized, a rather
      queer and doubting look on her comfortable face&mdash;after such hours, he
      found it difficult to go to the squire's study and sit opposite him,
      smoking. Those interviews reminded him too much of past days, when he had
      kept such desperate check on himself&mdash;too much of the old inward
      chafing against the other man's legal ownership&mdash;too much of the debt
      owing. But Winton was triple-proofed against betrayal of feeling. The
      squire welcomed him eagerly, saw nothing, felt nothing, was grateful for
      his goodness to the child. Well, well! He had died in the following
      spring. And Winton found that he had been made Gyp's guardian and trustee.
      Since his wife's death, the squire had muddled his affairs, his estate was
      heavily mortgaged; but Winton accepted the position with an almost savage
      satisfaction, and, from that moment, schemed deeply to get Gyp all to
      himself. The Mount Street house was sold; the Lincolnshire place let. She
      and Nurse Betty were installed at his own hunting-box, Mildenham. In this
      effort to get her away from all the squire's relations, he did not scruple
      to employ to the utmost the power he undoubtedly had of making people feel
      him unapproachable. He was never impolite to any of them; he simply froze
      them out. Having plenty of money himself, his motives could not be called
      in question. In one year he had isolated her from all except stout Betty.
      He had no qualms, for Gyp was no more happy away from him than he from
      her. He had but one bad half-hour. It came when he had at last decided
      that she should be called by his name, if not legally at least by custom,
      round Mildenham. It was to Markey he had given the order that Gyp was to
      be little Miss Winton for the future. When he came in from hunting that
      day, Betty was waiting in his study. She stood in the centre of the
      emptiest part of that rather dingy room, as far as possible away from any
      good or chattel. How long she had been standing there, heaven only knew;
      but her round, rosy face was confused between awe and resolution, and she
      had made a sad mess of her white apron. Her blue eyes met Winton's with a
      sort of desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what Markey told me, sir. My old master wouldn't have liked it,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Touched on the raw by this reminder that before the world he had been
      nothing to the loved one, that before the world the squire, who had been
      nothing to her, had been everything, Winton said icily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! You will be good enough to comply with my wish, all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stout woman's face grew very red. She burst out, breathless:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; but I've seen what I've seen. I never said anything, but I've
      got eyes. If Miss Gyp's to take your name, sir, then tongues'll wag, and
      my dear, dead mistress&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at the look on his face she stopped, with her mouth open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be kind enough to keep your thoughts to yourself. If any word or
      deed of yours gives the slightest excuse for talk&mdash;you go. Understand
      me, you go, and you never see Gyp again! In the meantime you will do what
      I ask. Gyp is my adopted daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had always been a little afraid of him, but she had never seen that
      look in his eyes or heard him speak in that voice. And she bent her full
      moon of a face and went, with her apron crumpled as apron had never been,
      and tears in her eyes. And Winton, at the window, watching the darkness
      gather, the leaves flying by on a sou'-westerly wind, drank to the dregs a
      cup of bitter triumph. He had never had the right to that dead,
      forever-loved mother of his child. He meant to have the child. If tongues
      must wag, let them! This was a defeat of all his previous precaution, a
      deep victory of natural instinct. And his eyes narrowed and stared into
      the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his victory over all human rivals in the heart of Gyp, Winton
      had a rival whose strength he fully realized perhaps for the first time
      now that she was gone, and he, before the fire, was brooding over her
      departure and the past. Not likely that one of his decisive type, whose
      life had so long been bound up with swords and horses, would grasp what
      music might mean to a little girl. Such ones, he knew, required to be
      taught scales, and &ldquo;In a Cottage near a Wood&rdquo; with other melodies. He took
      care not to go within sound of them, so that he had no conception of the
      avidity with which Gyp had mopped up all, and more than all, her governess
      could teach her. He was blind to the rapture with which she listened to
      any stray music that came its way to Mildenham&mdash;to carols in the
      Christmas dark, to certain hymns, and one special &ldquo;Nunc Dimittis&rdquo; in the
      village church, attended with a hopeless regularity; to the horn of the
      hunter far out in the quivering, dripping coverts; even to Markey's
      whistling, which was full and strangely sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could share her love of dogs and horses, take an anxious interest in
      her way of catching bumblebees in the hollow of her hand and putting them
      to her small, delicate ears to hear them buzz, sympathize with her
      continual ravages among the flowerbeds, in the old-fashioned garden, full
      of lilacs and laburnums in spring, pinks, roses, cornflowers in summer,
      dahlias and sunflowers in autumn, and always a little neglected and
      overgrown, a little squeezed in, and elbowed by the more important
      surrounding paddocks. He could sympathize with her attempts to draw his
      attention to the song of birds; but it was simply not in him to understand
      how she loved and craved for music. She was a cloudy little creature, up
      and down in mood&mdash;rather like a brown lady spaniel that she had, now
      gay as a butterfly, now brooding as night. Any touch of harshness she took
      to heart fearfully. She was the strangest compound of pride and
      sell-disparagement; the qualities seemed mixed in her so deeply that
      neither she nor any one knew of which her cloudy fits were the result.
      Being so sensitive, she &ldquo;fancied&rdquo; things terribly. Things that others did
      to her, and thought nothing of, often seemed to her conclusive evidence
      that she was not loved by anybody, which was dreadfully unjust, because
      she wanted to love everyone&mdash;nearly. Then suddenly she would feel:
      &ldquo;If they don't love me, I don't care. I don't want anything of anybody!&rdquo;
       Presently, all would blow away just like a cloud, and she would love and
      be gay, until something fresh, perhaps not at all meant to hurt her, would
      again hurt her horribly. In reality, the whole household loved and admired
      her. But she was one of those delicate-treading beings, born with a skin
      too few, who&mdash;and especially in childhood&mdash;suffer from
      themselves in a world born with a skin too many.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Winton's extreme delight, she took to riding as a duck to water, and
      knew no fear on horseback. She had the best governess he could get her,
      the daughter of an admiral, and, therefore, in distressed circumstances;
      and later on, a tutor for her music, who came twice a week all the way
      from London&mdash;a sardonic man who cherished for her even more secret
      admiration than she for him. In fact, every male thing fell in love with
      her at least a little. Unlike most girls, she never had an epoch of
      awkward plainness, but grew like a flower, evenly, steadily. Winton often
      gazed at her with a sort of intoxication; the turn of her head, the way
      those perfectly shaped, wonderfully clear brown eyes would &ldquo;fly,&rdquo; the set
      of her straight, round neck, the very shaping of her limbs were all such
      poignant reminders of what he had so loved. And yet, for all that likeness
      to her mother, there was a difference, both in form and character. Gyp
      had, as it were, an extra touch of &ldquo;breeding,&rdquo; more chiselling in body,
      more fastidiousness in soul, a little more poise, a little more sheer
      grace; in mood, more variance, in mind, more clarity and, mixed with her
      sweetness, a distinct spice of scepticism which her mother had lacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      In modern times there are no longer &ldquo;toasts,&rdquo; or she would have been one
      with both the hunts. Though delicate in build, she was not frail, and when
      her blood was up would &ldquo;go&rdquo; all day, and come in so bone-tired that she
      would drop on to the tiger skin before the fire, rather than face the
      stairs. Life at Mildenham was lonely, save for Winton's hunting cronies,
      and they but few, for his spiritual dandyism did not gladly suffer the
      average country gentleman and his frigid courtesy frightened women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, as Betty had foreseen, tongues did wag&mdash;those tongues of the
      countryside, avid of anything that might spice the tedium of dull lives
      and brains. And, though no breath of gossip came to Winton's ears, no
      women visited at Mildenham. Save for the friendly casual acquaintanceships
      of churchyard, hunting-field, and local race-meetings, Gyp grew up knowing
      hardly any of her own sex. This dearth developed her reserve, kept her
      backward in sex-perception, gave her a faint, unconscious contempt for men&mdash;creatures
      always at the beck and call of her smile, and so easily disquieted by a
      little frown&mdash;gave her also a secret yearning for companions of her
      own gender. Any girl or woman that she did chance to meet always took a
      fancy to her, because she was so nice to them, which made the transitory
      nature of these friendships tantalizing. She was incapable of jealousies
      or backbiting. Let men beware of such&mdash;there is coiled in their fibre
      a secret fascination!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp's moral and spiritual growth was not the sort of subject that Winton
      could pay much attention to. It was pre-eminently a matter one did not
      talk about. Outward forms, such as going to church, should be preserved;
      manners should be taught her by his own example as much as possible;
      beyond this, nature must look after things. His view had much real wisdom.
      She was a quick and voracious reader, bad at remembering what she read;
      and though she had soon devoured all the books in Winton's meagre library,
      including Byron, Whyte-Melville, and Humboldt's &ldquo;Cosmos,&rdquo; they had not
      left too much on her mind. The attempts of her little governess to impart
      religion were somewhat arid of result, and the interest of the vicar, Gyp,
      with her instinctive spice of scepticism soon put into the same category
      as the interest of all the other males she knew. She felt that he enjoyed
      calling her &ldquo;my dear&rdquo; and patting her shoulder, and that this enjoyment
      was enough reward for his exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tucked away in that little old dark manor house, whose stables alone were
      up to date&mdash;three hours from London, and some thirty miles from The
      Wash, it must be confessed that her upbringing lacked modernity. About
      twice a year, Winton took her up to town to stay with his unmarried sister
      Rosamund in Curzon Street. Those weeks, if they did nothing else,
      increased her natural taste for charming clothes, fortified her teeth, and
      fostered her passion for music and the theatre. But the two main
      nourishments of the modern girl&mdash;discussion and games&mdash;she
      lacked utterly. Moreover, those years of her life from fifteen to nineteen
      were before the social resurrection of 1906, and the world still crawled
      like a winter fly on a window-pane. Winton was a Tory, Aunt Rosamund a
      Tory, everybody round her a Tory. The only spiritual development she
      underwent all those years of her girlhood was through her headlong love
      for her father. After all, was there any other way in which she could
      really have developed? Only love makes fruitful the soul. The sense of
      form that both had in such high degree prevented much demonstration; but
      to be with him, do things for him, to admire, and credit him with
      perfection; and, since she could not exactly wear the same clothes or
      speak in the same clipped, quiet, decisive voice, to dislike the clothes
      and voices of other men&mdash;all this was precious to her beyond
      everything. If she inherited from him that fastidious sense of form, she
      also inherited his capacity for putting all her eggs in one basket. And
      since her company alone gave him real happiness, the current of love
      flowed over her heart all the time. Though she never realized it, abundant
      love FOR somebody was as necessary to her as water running up the stems of
      flowers, abundant love FROM somebody as needful as sunshine on their
      petals. And Winton's somewhat frequent little runs to town, to Newmarket,
      or where not, were always marked in her by a fall of the barometer, which
      recovered as his return grew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      One part of her education, at all events, was not neglected&mdash;cultivation
      of an habitual sympathy with her poorer neighbours. Without concerning
      himself in the least with problems of sociology, Winton had by nature an
      open hand and heart for cottagers, and abominated interference with their
      lives. And so it came about that Gyp, who, by nature also never set foot
      anywhere without invitation, was always hearing the words: &ldquo;Step in, Miss
      Gyp&rdquo;; &ldquo;Step in, and sit down, lovey,&rdquo; and a good many words besides from
      even the boldest and baddest characters. There is nothing like a soft and
      pretty face and sympathetic listening for seducing the hearts of &ldquo;the
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So passed the eleven years till she was nineteen and Winton forty-six.
      Then, under the wing of her little governess, she went to the hunt-ball.
      She had revolted against appearing a &ldquo;fluffy miss,&rdquo; wanting to be
      considered at once full-fledged; so that her dress, perfect in fit, was
      not white but palest maize-colour, as if she had already been to dances.
      She had all Winton's dandyism, and just so much more as was appropriate to
      her sex. With her dark hair, wonderfully fluffed and coiled, waving across
      her forehead, her neck bare for the first time, her eyes really &ldquo;flying,&rdquo;
       and a demeanour perfectly cool&mdash;as though she knew that light and
      movement, covetous looks, soft speeches, and admiration were her
      birthright&mdash;she was more beautiful than even Winton had thought her.
      At her breast she wore some sprigs of yellow jasmine procured by him from
      town&mdash;a flower of whose scent she was very fond, and that he had
      never seen worn in ballrooms. That swaying, delicate creature, warmed by
      excitement, reminded him, in every movement and by every glance of her
      eyes, of her whom he had first met at just such a ball as this. And by the
      carriage of his head, the twist of his little moustache, he conveyed to
      the world the pride he was feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening held many sensations for Gyp&mdash;some delightful, one
      confused, one unpleasant. She revelled in her success. Admiration was very
      dear to her. She passionately enjoyed dancing, loved feeling that she was
      dancing well and giving pleasure. But, twice over, she sent away her
      partners, smitten with compassion for her little governess sitting there
      against the wall&mdash;all alone, with no one to take notice of her,
      because she was elderly, and roundabout, poor darling! And, to that loyal
      person's horror, she insisted on sitting beside her all through two
      dances. Nor would she go in to supper with anyone but Winton. Returning to
      the ballroom on his arm, she overheard an elderly woman say: &ldquo;Oh, don't
      you know? Of course he really IS her father!&rdquo; and an elderly man answer:
      &ldquo;Ah, that accounts for it&mdash;quite so!&rdquo; With those eyes at the back of
      the head which the very sensitive possess, she could see their
      inquisitive, cold, slightly malicious glances, and knew they were speaking
      of her. And just then her partner came for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really IS her father!&rdquo; The words meant TOO much to be grasped this
      evening of full sensations. They left a little bruise somewhere, but
      softened and anointed, just a sense of confusion at the back of her mind.
      And very soon came that other sensation, so disillusioning, that all else
      was crowded out. It was after a dance&mdash;a splendid dance with a
      good-looking man quite twice her age. They were sitting behind some palms,
      he murmuring in his mellow, flown voice admiration for her dress, when
      suddenly he bent his flushed face and kissed her bare arm above the elbow.
      If he had hit her he could not have astonished or hurt her more. It seemed
      to her innocence that he would never have done such a thing if she had not
      said something dreadful to encourage him. Without a word she got up, gazed
      at him a moment with eyes dark from pain, shivered, and slipped away. She
      went straight to Winton. From her face, all closed up, tightened lips, and
      the familiar little droop at their corners, he knew something dire had
      happened, and his eyes boded ill for the person who had hurt her; but she
      would say nothing except that she was tired and wanted to go home. And so,
      with the little faithful governess, who, having been silent perforce
      nearly all the evening, was now full of conversation, they drove out into
      the frosty night. Winton sat beside the chauffeur, smoking viciously, his
      fur collar turned up over his ears, his eyes stabbing the darkness, under
      his round, low-drawn fur cap. Who had dared upset his darling? And, within
      the car, the little governess chattered softly, and Gyp, shrouded in lace,
      in her dark corner sat silent, seeing nothing but the vision of that
      insult. Sad end to a lovely night!
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay awake long hours in the darkness, while a sort of coherence was
      forming in her mind. Those words: &ldquo;Really IS her father!&rdquo; and that man's
      kissing of her bare arm were a sort of revelation of sex-mystery,
      hardening the consciousness that there was something at the back of her
      life. A child so sensitive had not, of course, quite failed to feel the
      spiritual draughts around her; but instinctively she had recoiled from
      more definite perceptions. The time before Winton came was all so faint&mdash;Betty,
      toys, short glimpses of a kind, invalidish man called &ldquo;Papa.&rdquo; As in that
      word there was no depth compared with the word &ldquo;Dad&rdquo; bestowed on Winton,
      so there had been no depth in her feelings towards the squire. When a girl
      has no memory of her mother, how dark are many things! None, except Betty,
      had ever talked of her mother. There was nothing sacred in Gyp's
      associations, no faiths to be broken by any knowledge that might come to
      her; isolated from other girls, she had little realisation even of the
      conventions. Still, she suffered horribly, lying there in the dark&mdash;from
      bewilderment, from thorns dragged over her skin, rather than from a stab
      in the heart. The knowledge of something about her conspicuous, doubtful,
      provocative of insult, as she thought, grievously hurt her delicacy. Those
      few wakeful hours made a heavy mark. She fell asleep at last, still all in
      confusion, and woke up with a passionate desire to KNOW. All that morning
      she sat at her piano, playing, refusing to go out, frigid to Betty and the
      little governess, till the former was reduced to tears and the latter to
      Wordsworth. After tea she went to Winton's study, that dingy little room
      where he never studied anything, with leather chairs and books which&mdash;except
      &ldquo;Mr. Jorrocks,&rdquo; Byron, those on the care of horses, and the novels of
      Whyte-Melville&mdash;were never read; with prints of superequine
      celebrities, his sword, and photographs of Gyp and of brother officers on
      the walls. Two bright spots there were indeed&mdash;the fire, and the
      little bowl that Gyp always kept filled with flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came gliding in like that, a slender, rounded figure, her creamy,
      dark-eyed, oval face all cloudy, she seemed to Winton to have grown up of
      a sudden. He had known all day that something was coming, and had been
      cudgelling his brains finely. From the fervour of his love for her, he
      felt an anxiety that was almost fear. What could have happened last night&mdash;that
      first night of her entrance into society&mdash;meddlesome, gossiping
      society! She slid down to the floor against his knee. He could not see her
      face, could not even touch her; for she had settled down on his right
      side. He mastered his tremors and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gyp&mdash;tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little bit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it up to what you thought, last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The logs hissed and crackled; the long flames ruffled in the
      chimney-draught; the wind roared outside&mdash;then, so suddenly that it
      took his breath away:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, are you really and truly my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When that which one has always known might happen at last does happen, how
      little one is prepared! In the few seconds before an answer that could in
      no way be evaded, Winton had time for a tumult of reflection. A less
      resolute character would have been caught by utter mental blankness, then
      flung itself in panic on &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No.&rdquo; But Winton was incapable of losing
      his head; he would not answer without having faced the consequences of his
      reply. To be her father was the most warming thing in his life; but if he
      avowed it, how far would he injure her love for him? What did a girl know?
      How make her understand? What would her feeling be about her dead mother?
      How would that dead loved one feel? What would she have wished?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cruel moment. And the girl, pressed against his knee, with face
      hidden, gave him no help. Impossible to keep it from her, now that her
      instinct was roused! Silence, too, would answer for him. And clenching his
      hand on the arm of his chair, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Gyp; your mother and I loved each other.&rdquo; He felt a quiver go
      through her, would have given much to see her face. What, even now, did
      she understand? Well, it must be gone through with, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grief, shock, even surprise would have roused all his loyalty to the dead,
      all the old stubborn bitterness, and he would have frozen up against her.
      But this acquiescent murmur made him long to smooth it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody has ever known. She died when you were born. It was a fearful
      grief to me. If you've heard anything, it's just gossip, because you go by
      my name. Your mother was never talked about. But it's best you should
      know, now you're grown up. People don't often love as she and I loved. You
      needn't be ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had not moved, and her face was still turned from him. She said
      quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not ashamed. Am I very like her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; more than I could ever have hoped.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very low she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't love me for myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton was but dimly conscious of how that question revealed her nature,
      its power of piercing instinctively to the heart of things, its sensitive
      pride, and demand for utter and exclusive love. To things that go too
      deep, one opposes the bulwark of obtuseness. And, smiling, he simply said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, to his dismay, he perceived that she was crying&mdash;struggling
      against it so that her shoulder shook against his knee. He had hardly ever
      known her cry, not in all the disasters of unstable youth, and she had
      received her full meed of knocks and tumbles. He could only stroke that
      shoulder, and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't cry, Gyp; don't cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased as suddenly as she had begun, got up, and, before he too could
      rise, was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, at dinner, she was just as usual. He could not detect the
      slightest difference in her voice or manner, or in her good-night kiss.
      And so a moment that he had dreaded for years was over, leaving only the
      faint shame which follows a breach of reticence on the spirits of those
      who worship it. While the old secret had been quite undisclosed, it had
      not troubled him. Disclosed, it hurt him. But Gyp, in those twenty-four
      hours, had left childhood behind for good; her feeling toward men had
      hardened. If she did not hurt them a little, they would hurt her! The
      sex-instinct had come to life. To Winton she gave as much love as ever,
      even more, perhaps; but the dew was off.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      The next two years were much less solitary, passed in more or less
      constant gaiety. His confession spurred Winton on to the fortification of
      his daughter's position. He would stand no nonsense, would not have her
      looked on askance. There is nothing like &ldquo;style&rdquo; for carrying the defences
      of society&mdash;only, it must be the genuine thing. Whether at Mildenham,
      or in London under the wing of his sister, there was no difficulty. Gyp
      was too pretty, Winton too cool, his quietness too formidable. She had
      every advantage. Society only troubles itself to make front against the
      visibly weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happiest time of a girl's life is that when all appreciate and covet
      her, and she herself is free as air&mdash;a queen of hearts, for none of
      which she hankers; or, if not the happiest, at all events it is the gayest
      time. What did Gyp care whether hearts ached for her&mdash;she knew not
      love as yet, perhaps would never know the pains of unrequited love.
      Intoxicated with life, she led her many admirers a pretty dance, treating
      them with a sort of bravura. She did not want them to be unhappy, but she
      simply could not take them seriously. Never was any girl so heart-free.
      She was a queer mixture in those days, would give up any pleasure for
      Winton, and most for Betty or her aunt&mdash;her little governess was gone&mdash;but
      of nobody else did she seem to take account, accepting all that was laid
      at her feet as the due of her looks, her dainty frocks, her music, her
      good riding and dancing, her talent for amateur theatricals and mimicry.
      Winton, whom at least she never failed, watched that glorious fluttering
      with quiet pride and satisfaction. He was getting to those years when a
      man of action dislikes interruption of the grooves into which his activity
      has fallen. He pursued his hunting, racing, card-playing, and his very
      stealthy alms and services to lame ducks of his old regiment, their
      families, and other unfortunates&mdash;happy in knowing that Gyp was
      always as glad to be with him as he to be with her. Hereditary gout, too,
      had begun to bother him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day that she came of age they were up in town, and he summoned her to
      the room, in which he now sat by the fire recalling all these things, to
      receive an account of his stewardship. He had nursed her greatly
      embarrassed inheritance very carefully till it amounted to some twenty
      thousand pounds. He had never told her of it&mdash;the subject was
      dangerous, and, since his own means were ample, she had not wanted for
      anything. When he had explained exactly what she owned, shown her how it
      was invested, and told her that she must now open her own banking account,
      she stood gazing at the sheets of paper, whose items she had been supposed
      to understand, and her face gathered the look which meant that she was
      troubled. Without lifting her eyes she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it all come from&mdash;him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not expected that, and flushed under his tan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; eight thousand of it was your mother's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp looked at him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I won't take the rest&mdash;please, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton felt a sort of crabbed pleasure. What should be done with that
      money if she did not take it, he did not in the least know. But not to
      take it was like her, made her more than ever his daughter&mdash;a kind of
      final victory. He turned away to the window from which he had so often
      watched for her mother. There was the corner she used to turn! In one
      minute, surely she would be standing there, colour glowing in her cheeks,
      her eyes soft behind her veil, her breast heaving a little with her haste,
      waiting for his embrace. There she would stand, drawing up her veil. He
      turned round. Difficult to believe it was not she! And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my love. But you will take the equivalent from me instead. The
      other can be put by; some one will benefit some day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At those unaccustomed words, &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; from his undemonstrative lips, the
      colour mounted in her cheeks and her eyes shone. She threw her arms round
      his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had her fill of music in those days, taking piano lessons from a
      Monsieur Harmost, a grey-haired native of Liege, with mahogany cheeks and
      the touch of an angel, who kept her hard at it and called her his &ldquo;little
      friend.&rdquo; There was scarcely a concert of merit that she did not attend or
      a musician of mark whose playing she did not know, and, though
      fastidiousness saved her from squirming in adoration round the feet of
      those prodigious performers, she perched them all on pedestals, men and
      women alike, and now and then met them at her aunt's house in Curzon
      Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Rosamund, also musical, so far as breeding would allow, stood for a
      good deal to Gyp, who had built up about her a romantic story of love
      wrecked by pride from a few words she had once let drop. She was a tall
      and handsome woman, a year older than Winton, with a long, aristocratic
      face, deep-blue, rather shining eyes, a gentlemanly manner, warm heart,
      and one of those indescribable, not unmelodious drawls that one connects
      with an unshakable sense of privilege. She, in turn, was very fond of Gyp;
      and what passed within her mind, by no means devoid of shrewdness, as to
      their real relationship, remained ever discreetly hidden. She was, so far
      again as breeding would allow, something of a humanitarian and rebel,
      loving horses and dogs, and hating cats, except when they had four legs.
      The girl had just that softness which fascinates women who perhaps might
      have been happier if they had been born men. Not that Rosamund Winton was
      of an aggressive type&mdash;she merely had the resolute &ldquo;catch hold of
      your tail, old fellow&rdquo; spirit so often found in Englishwomen of the upper
      classes. A cheery soul, given to long coats and waistcoats, stocks, and a
      crutch-handled stick, she&mdash;like her brother&mdash;had &ldquo;style,&rdquo; but
      more sense of humour&mdash;valuable in musical circles! At her house, the
      girl was practically compelled to see fun as well as merit in all those
      prodigies, haloed with hair and filled to overflowing with music and
      themselves. And, since Gyp's natural sense of the ludicrous was extreme,
      she and her aunt could rarely talk about anything without going into fits
      of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton had his first really bad attack of gout when Gyp was twenty-two,
      and, terrified lest he might not be able to sit a horse in time for the
      opening meets, he went off with her and Markey to Wiesbaden. They had
      rooms in the Wilhelmstrasse, overlooking the gardens, where leaves were
      already turning, that gorgeous September. The cure was long and obstinate,
      and Winton badly bored. Gyp fared much better. Attended by the silent
      Markey, she rode daily on the Neroberg, chafing at regulations which
      reduced her to specified tracks in that majestic wood where the beeches
      glowed. Once or even twice a day she went to the concerts in the Kurhaus,
      either with her father or alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time she heard Fiorsen play she was alone. Unlike most
      violinists, he was tall and thin, with great pliancy of body and swift
      sway of movement. His face was pale, and went strangely with hair and
      moustache of a sort of dirt-gold colour, and his thin cheeks with very
      broad high cheek-bones had little narrow scraps of whisker. Those little
      whiskers seemed to Gyp awful&mdash;indeed, he seemed rather awful
      altogether&mdash;but his playing stirred and swept her in the most uncanny
      way. He had evidently remarkable technique; and the emotion, the intense
      wayward feeling of his playing was chiselled by that technique, as if a
      flame were being frozen in its swaying. When he stopped, she did not join
      in the tornado of applause, but sat motionless, looking up at him. Quite
      unconstrained by all those people, he passed the back of his hand across
      his hot brow, shoving up a wave or two of that queer-coloured hair; then,
      with a rather disagreeable smile, he made a short supple bow or two. And
      she thought, &ldquo;What strange eyes he has&mdash;like a great cat's!&rdquo; Surely
      they were green; fierce, yet shy, almost furtive&mdash;mesmeric! Certainly
      the strangest man she had ever seen, and the most frightening. He seemed
      looking straight at her; and, dropping her gaze, she clapped. When she
      looked again, his face had lost that smile for a kind of wistfulness. He
      made another of those little supple bows straight at her&mdash;it seemed
      to Gyp&mdash;and jerked his violin up to his shoulder. &ldquo;He's going to play
      to me,&rdquo; she thought absurdly. He played without accompaniment a little
      tune that seemed to twitch the heart. When he finished, this time she did
      not look up, but was conscious that he gave one impatient bow and walked
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening at dinner she said to Winton:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard a violinist to-day, Dad, the most wonderful playing&mdash;Gustav
      Fiorsen. Is that Swedish, do you think&mdash;or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely. What sort of a bounder was he to look at? I used to know a
      Swede in the Turkish army&mdash;nice fellow, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tall and thin and white-faced, with bumpy cheek-bones, and hollows under
      them, and queer green eyes. Oh, and little goldy side-whiskers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! It sounds the limit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp murmured, with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I think perhaps he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw him next day in the gardens. They were sitting close to the
      Schiller statue, Winton reading The Times, to whose advent he looked
      forward more than he admitted, for he was loath by confessions of boredom
      to disturb Gyp's manifest enjoyment of her stay. While perusing the
      customary comforting animadversions on the conduct of those &ldquo;rascally
      Radicals&rdquo; who had just come into power, and the account of a Newmarket
      meeting, he kept stealing sidelong glances at his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly she had never looked prettier, daintier, shown more breeding
      than she did out here among these Germans with their thick pasterns, and
      all the cosmopolitan hairy-heeled crowd in this God-forsaken place! The
      girl, unconscious of his stealthy regalement, was letting her clear eyes
      rest, in turn, on each figure that passed, on the movements of birds and
      dogs, watching the sunlight glisten on the grass, burnish the copper
      beeches, the lime-trees, and those tall poplars down there by the water.
      The doctor at Mildenham, once consulted on a bout of headache, had called
      her eyes &ldquo;perfect organs,&rdquo; and certainly no eyes could take things in more
      swiftly or completely. She was attractive to dogs, and every now and then
      one would stop, in two minds whether or no to put his nose into this
      foreign girl's hand. From a flirtation of eyes with a great Dane, she
      looked up and saw Fiorsen passing, in company with a shorter, square man,
      having very fashionable trousers and a corseted waist. The violinist's
      tall, thin, loping figure was tightly buttoned into a brownish-grey
      frock-coat suit; he wore a rather broad-brimmed, grey, velvety hat; in his
      buttonhole was a white flower; his cloth-topped boots were of patent
      leather; his tie was bunched out at the ends over a soft white-linen shirt&mdash;altogether
      quite a dandy! His most strange eyes suddenly swept down on hers, and he
      made a movement as if to put his hand to his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, he remembers me,' thought Gyp. That thin-waisted figure with head
      set just a little forward between rather high shoulders, and its long
      stride, curiously suggested a leopard or some lithe creature. He touched
      his short companion's arm, muttered something, turned round, and came
      back. She could see him staring her way, and knew he was coming simply to
      look at her. She knew, too, that her father was watching. And she felt
      that those greenish eyes would waver before his stare&mdash;that stare of
      the Englishman of a certain class, which never condescends to be
      inquisitive. They passed; Gyp saw Fiorsen turn to his companion, slightly
      tossing back his head in their direction, and heard the companion laugh. A
      little flame shot up in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rum-looking Johnnies one sees here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the violinist I told you of&mdash;Fiorsen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Ah!&rdquo; But he had evidently forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought that Fiorsen should have picked her out of all that audience
      for remembrance subtly flattered her vanity. She lost her ruffled feeling.
      Though her father thought his dress awful, it was really rather becoming.
      He would not have looked as well in proper English clothes. Once, at
      least, during the next two days, she noticed the short, square young man
      who had been walking with him, and was conscious that he followed her with
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a certain Baroness von Maisen, a cosmopolitan friend of Aunt
      Rosamund's, German by marriage, half-Dutch, half-French by birth, asked
      her if she had heard the Swedish violinist, Fiorsen. He would be, she
      said, the best violinist of the day, if&mdash;and she shook her head.
      Finding that expressive shake unquestioned, the baroness pursued her
      thoughts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, these musicians! He wants saving from himself. If he does not halt
      soon, he will be lost. Pity! A great talent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp looked at her steadily and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he drink, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pas mal! But there are things besides drink, ma chere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instinct and so much life with Winton made the girl regard it as beneath
      her to be shocked. She did not seek knowledge of life, but refused to shy
      away from it or be discomfited; and the baroness, to whom innocence was
      piquant, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Des femmes&mdash;toujours des femmes! C'est grand dommage. It will spoil
      his spirit. His sole chance is to find one woman, but I pity her;
      sapristi, quelle vie pour elle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would a man like that ever love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baroness goggled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have known such a man become a slave. I have known him running after a
      woman like a lamb while she was deceiving him here and there. On ne peut
      jamais dire. Ma belle, il y a des choses que vous ne savez pas encore.&rdquo;
       She took Gyp's hand. &ldquo;And yet, one thing is certain. With those eyes and
      those lips and that figure, YOU have a time before you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp withdrew her hand, smiled, and shook her head; she did not believe in
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you will turn some heads! No fear! as you English say. There is
      fatality in those pretty brown eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A girl may be pardoned who takes as a compliment the saying that her eyes
      are fatal. The words warmed Gyp, uncontrollably light-hearted in these
      days, just as she was warmed when people turned to stare at her. The soft
      air, the mellowness of this gay place, much music, a sense of being a rara
      avis among people who, by their heavier type, enhanced her own, had
      produced in her a kind of intoxication, making her what the baroness
      called &ldquo;un peu folle.&rdquo; She was always breaking into laughter, having that
      precious feeling of twisting the world round her thumb, which does not
      come too often in the life of one who is sensitive. Everything to her just
      then was either &ldquo;funny&rdquo; or &ldquo;lovely.&rdquo; And the baroness, conscious of the
      girl's chic, genuinely attracted by one so pretty, took care that she saw
      all the people, perhaps more than all, that were desirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      To women and artists, between whom there is ever a certain kinship,
      curiosity is a vivid emotion. Besides, the more a man has conquered, the
      more precious field he is for a woman's conquest. To attract a man who has
      attracted many, what is it but a proof that one's charm is superior to
      that of all those others? The words of the baroness deepened in Gyp the
      impression that Fiorsen was &ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; but secretly fortified the faint
      excitement she felt that he should have remembered her out of all that
      audience. Later on, they bore more fruit than that. But first came that
      queer incident of the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming in from a ride, a week after she had sat with Winton under the
      Schiller statue, Gyp found on her dressing-table a bunch of Gloire de
      Dijon and La France roses. Plunging her nose into them, she thought: &ldquo;How
      lovely! Who sent me these?&rdquo; There was no card. All that the German maid
      could say was that a boy had brought them from a flower shop &ldquo;fur Fraulein
      Vinton&rdquo;; it was surmised that they came from the baroness. In her bodice
      at dinner, and to the concert after, Gyp wore one La France and one Gloire
      de Dijon&mdash;a daring mixture of pink and orange against her
      oyster-coloured frock, which delighted her, who had a passion for
      experiments in colour. They had bought no programme, all music being the
      same to Winton, and Gyp not needing any. When she saw Fiorsen come
      forward, her cheeks began to colour from sheer anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He played first a minuet by Mozart; then the Cesar Franck sonata; and when
      he came back to make his bow, he was holding in his hand a Gloire de Dijon
      and a La France rose. Involuntarily, Gyp raised her hand to her own roses.
      His eyes met hers; he bowed just a little lower. Then, quite naturally,
      put the roses to his lips as he was walking off the platform. Gyp dropped
      her hand, as if it had been stung. Then, with the swift thought: &ldquo;Oh,
      that's schoolgirlish!&rdquo; she contrived a little smile. But her cheeks were
      flushing. Should she take out those roses and let them fall? Her father
      might see, might notice Fiorsen's&mdash;put two and two together! He would
      consider she had been insulted. Had she? She could not bring herself to
      think so. It was too pretty a compliment, as if he wished to tell her that
      he was playing to her alone. The baroness's words flashed through her
      mind: &ldquo;He wants saving from himself. Pity! A great talent!&rdquo; It WAS a great
      talent. There must be something worth saving in one who could play like
      that! They left after his last solo. Gyp put the two roses carefully back
      among the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later, she went to an afternoon &ldquo;at home&rdquo; at the Baroness von
      Maisen's. She saw him at once, over by the piano, with his short, square
      companion, listening to a voluble lady, and looking very bored and
      restless. All that overcast afternoon, still and with queer lights in the
      sky, as if rain were coming, Gyp had been feeling out of mood, a little
      homesick. Now she felt excited. She saw the short companion detach himself
      and go up to the baroness; a minute later, he was brought up to her and
      introduced&mdash;Count Rosek. Gyp did not like his face; there were dark
      rings under the eyes, and he was too perfectly self-possessed, with a kind
      of cold sweetness; but he was very agreeable and polite, and spoke English
      well. He was&mdash;it seemed&mdash;a Pole, who lived in London, and seemed
      to know all that was to be known about music. Miss Winton&mdash;he
      believed&mdash;had heard his friend Fiorsen play; but not in London? No?
      That was odd; he had been there some months last season. Faintly annoyed
      at her ignorance, Gyp answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but I was in the country nearly all last summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a great success. I shall take him back; it is best for his future.
      What do you think of his playing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself, for she did not like expanding to this sphinxlike
      little man, Gyp murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, simply wonderful, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and then rather suddenly said, with a peculiar little smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I introduce him? Gustav&mdash;Miss Winton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp turned. There he was, just behind her, bowing; and his eyes had a look
      of humble adoration which he made no attempt whatever to conceal. Gyp saw
      another smile slide over the Pole's lips; and she was alone in the bay
      window with Fiorsen. The moment might well have fluttered a girl's nerves
      after his recognition of her by the Schiller statue, after that episode of
      the flowers, and what she had heard of him. But life had not yet touched
      either her nerves or spirit; she only felt amused and a little excited.
      Close to, he had not so much that look of an animal behind bars, and he
      certainly was in his way a dandy, beautifully washed&mdash;always an
      important thing&mdash;and having some pleasant essence on his handkerchief
      or hair, of which Gyp would have disapproved if he had been English. He
      wore a diamond ring also, which did not somehow seem bad form on that
      particular little finger. His height, his broad cheek-bones, thick but not
      long hair, the hungry vitality of his face, figure, movements, annulled
      those evidences of femininity. He was male enough, rather too male.
      Speaking with a queer, crisp accent, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Winton, you are my audience here. I play to you&mdash;only to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You laugh at me; but you need not. I play for you because I admire you. I
      admire you terribly. If I sent you those flowers, it was not to be rude.
      It was my gratitude for the pleasure of your face.&rdquo; His voice actually
      trembled. And, looking down, Gyp answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. It was very kind of you. I want to thank you for your playing.
      It is beautiful&mdash;really beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made her another little bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I go back to London, will you come and hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think any one would go to hear you, if they had the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! Here, I do it for money; I hate this place. It bores me&mdash;bores
      me! Was that your father sitting with you under the statue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp nodded, suddenly grave. She had not forgotten the slighting turn of
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed his hand over his face, as if to wipe off its expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is very English. But you&mdash;of no country&mdash;you belong to all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp made him an ironical little bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I should not know your country&mdash;you are neither of the North nor
      of the South. You are just Woman, made to be adored. I came here hoping to
      meet you; I am extremely happy. Miss Winton, I am your very devoted
      servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was speaking very fast, very low, with an agitated earnestness that
      surely could not be put on. But suddenly muttering: &ldquo;These people!&rdquo; he
      made her another of his little bows and abruptly slipped away. The
      baroness was bringing up another man. The chief thought left by that
      meeting was: &ldquo;Is that how he begins to everyone?&rdquo; She could not quite
      believe it. The stammering earnestness of his voice, those humbly adoring
      looks! Then she remembered the smile on the lips of the little Pole, and
      thought: &ldquo;But he must know I'm not silly enough just to be taken in by
      vulgar flattery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Too sensitive to confide in anyone, she had no chance to ventilate the
      curious sensations of attraction and repulsion that began fermenting in
      her, feelings defying analysis, mingling and quarrelling deep down in her
      heart. It was certainly not love, not even the beginning of that; but it
      was the kind of dangerous interest children feel in things mysterious, out
      of reach, yet within reach, if only they dared! And the tug of music was
      there, and the tug of those words of the baroness about salvation&mdash;the
      thought of achieving the impossible, reserved only for the woman of
      supreme charm, for the true victress. But all these thoughts and feelings
      were as yet in embryo. She might never see him again! And she certainly
      did not know whether she even wanted to.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp was in the habit of walking with Winton to the Kochbrunnen, where,
      with other patient-folk, he was required to drink slowly for twenty
      minutes every morning. While he was imbibing she would sit in a remote
      corner of the garden, and read a novel in the Reclam edition, as a daily
      German lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting there, the morning after the &ldquo;at-home&rdquo; at the Baroness von
      Maisen's, reading Turgenev's &ldquo;Torrents of Spring,&rdquo; when she saw Count
      Rosek sauntering down the path with a glass of the waters in his hand.
      Instant memory of the smile with which he had introduced Fiorsen made her
      take cover beneath her sunshade. She could see his patent-leathered feet,
      and well-turned, peg-top-trousered legs go by with the gait of a man whose
      waist is corseted. The certainty that he wore those prerogatives of
      womanhood increased her dislike. How dare men be so effeminate? Yet
      someone had told her that he was a good rider, a good fencer, and very
      strong. She drew a breath of relief when he was past, and, for fear he
      might turn and come back, closed her little book and slipped away. But her
      figure and her springing step were more unmistakable than she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, on the same bench, she was reading breathlessly the scene
      between Gemma and Sanin at the window, when she heard Fiorsen's voice,
      behind her, say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Winton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, too, held a glass of the waters in one hand, and his hat in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just made your father's acquaintance. May I sit down a minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp drew to one side on the bench, and he sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you reading?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A story called 'Torrents of Spring.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the finest ever written! Where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gemma and Sanin in the thunderstorm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! You have Madame Polozov to come! What a creation! How old are you,
      Miss Winton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would be too young to appreciate that story if you were not YOU. But
      you know much&mdash;by instinct. What is your Christian name&mdash;forgive
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghita? Not soft enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am always called Gyp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp&mdash;ah, Gyp! Yes; Gyp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He repeated her name so impersonally that she could not be angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told your father I have had the pleasure of meeting you. He was very
      polite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is always polite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the ice in which they put champagne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp smiled; she could not help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they have told you that I am a mauvais sujet.&rdquo; Gyp inclined her
      head. He looked at her steadily, and said: &ldquo;It is true. But I could be
      better&mdash;much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to look at him, but could not. A queer sort of exultation had
      seized on her. This man had power; yet she had power over him. If she
      wished she could make him her slave, her dog, chain him to her. She had
      but to hold out her hand, and he would go on his knees to kiss it. She had
      but to say, &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; and he would come from wherever he might be. She had
      but to say, &ldquo;Be good,&rdquo; and he would be good. It was her first experience
      of power; and it was intoxicating. But&mdash;but! Gyp could never be
      self-confident for long; over her most victorious moments brooded the
      shadow of distrust. As if he read her thought, Fiorsen said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me to do something&mdash;anything; I will do it, Miss Winton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;go back to London at once. You are wasting yourself here, you
      know. You said so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, bewildered and upset, and muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have asked me the one thing I can't do, Miss&mdash;Miss Gyp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please&mdash;not that; it's like a servant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I AM your servant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that why you won't do what I ask you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cruel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and said, with sudden fierceness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not going away from you; do not think it.&rdquo; Bending with the utmost
      swiftness, he took her hand, put his lips to it, and turned on his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp, uneasy and astonished, stared at her hand, still tingling from the
      pressure of his bristly moustache. Then she laughed again&mdash;it was
      just &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; to have your hand kissed&mdash;and went back to her book,
      without taking in the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was ever courtship more strange than that which followed? It is said that
      the cat fascinates the bird it desires to eat; here the bird fascinated
      the cat, but the bird too was fascinated. Gyp never lost the sense of
      having the whip-hand, always felt like one giving alms, or extending
      favour, yet had a feeling of being unable to get away, which seemed to
      come from the very strength of the spell she laid on him. The magnetism
      with which she held him reacted on herself. Thoroughly sceptical at first,
      she could not remain so. He was too utterly morose and unhappy if she did
      not smile on him, too alive and excited and grateful if she did. The
      change in his eyes from their ordinary restless, fierce, and furtive
      expression to humble adoration or wistful hunger when they looked at her
      could never have been simulated. And she had no lack of chance to see that
      metamorphosis. Wherever she went, there he was. If to a concert, he would
      be a few paces from the door, waiting for her entrance. If to a
      confectioner's for tea, as likely as not he would come in. Every afternoon
      he walked where she must pass, riding to the Neroberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except in the gardens of the Kochbrunnen, when he would come up humbly and
      ask to sit with her five minutes, he never forced his company, or tried in
      any way to compromise her. Experience, no doubt, served him there; but he
      must have had an instinct that it was dangerous with one so sensitive.
      There were other moths, too, round that bright candle, and they served to
      keep his attentions from being too conspicuous. Did she comprehend what
      was going on, understand how her defences were being sapped, grasp the
      danger to retreat that lay in permitting him to hover round her? Not
      really. It all served to swell the triumphant intoxication of days when
      she was ever more and more in love with living, more and more conscious
      that the world appreciated and admired her, that she had power to do what
      others couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was not Fiorsen, with his great talent, and his dubious reputation, proof
      of that? And he excited her. Whatever else one might be in his moody,
      vivid company, one would not be dull. One morning, he told her something
      of his life. His father had been a small Swedish landowner, a very strong
      man and a very hard drinker; his mother, the daughter of a painter. She
      had taught him the violin, but died while he was still a boy. When he was
      seventeen he had quarrelled with his father, and had to play his violin
      for a living in the streets of Stockholm. A well-known violinist, hearing
      him one day, took him in hand. Then his father had drunk himself to death,
      and he had inherited the little estate. He had sold it at once&mdash;&ldquo;for
      follies,&rdquo; as he put it crudely. &ldquo;Yes, Miss Winton; I have committed many
      follies, but they are nothing to those I shall commit the day I do not see
      you any more!&rdquo; And, with that disturbing remark, he got up and left her.
      She had smiled at his words, but within herself she felt excitement,
      scepticism, compassion, and something she did not understand at all. In
      those days, she understood herself very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how far did Winton understand, how far see what was going on? He was a
      stoic; but that did not prevent jealousy from taking alarm, and causing
      him twinges more acute than those he still felt in his left foot. He was
      afraid of showing disquiet by any dramatic change, or he would have
      carried her off a fortnight at least before his cure was over. He knew too
      well the signs of passion. That long, loping, wolfish fiddling fellow with
      the broad cheekbones and little side-whiskers (Good God!) and greenish
      eyes whose looks at Gyp he secretly marked down, roused his complete
      distrust. Perhaps his inbred English contempt for foreigners and artists
      kept him from direct action. He COULD not take it quite seriously. Gyp,
      his fastidious perfect Gyp, succumbing, even a little to a fellow like
      that! Never! His jealous affection, too, could not admit that she would
      neglect to consult him in any doubt or difficulty. He forgot the sensitive
      secrecy of girls, forgot that his love for her had ever shunned words, her
      love for him never indulged in confidences. Nor did he see more than a
      little of what there was to see, and that little was doctored by Fiorsen
      for his eyes, shrewd though they were. Nor was there in all so very much,
      except one episode the day before they left, and of that he knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      That last afternoon was very still, a little mournful. It had rained the
      night before, and the soaked tree-trunks, the soaked fallen leaves gave
      off a faint liquorice-like perfume. In Gyp there was a feeling, as if her
      spirit had been suddenly emptied of excitement and delight. Was it the
      day, or the thought of leaving this place where she had so enjoyed
      herself? After lunch, when Winton was settling his accounts, she wandered
      out through the long park stretching up the valley. The sky was
      brooding-grey, the trees were still and melancholy. It was all a little
      melancholy, and she went on and on, across the stream, round into a muddy
      lane that led up through the outskirts of a village, on to the higher
      ground whence she could return by the main road. Why must things come to
      an end? For the first time in her life, she thought of Mildenham and
      hunting without enthusiasm. She would rather stay in London. There she
      would not be cut off from music, from dancing, from people, and all the
      exhilaration of being appreciated. On the air came the shrilly, hollow
      droning of a thresher, and the sound seemed exactly to express her
      feelings. A pigeon flew over, white against the leaden sky; some
      birch-trees that had gone golden shivered and let fall a shower of drops.
      It was lonely here! And, suddenly, two little boys bolted out of the
      hedge, nearly upsetting her, and scurried down the road. Something had
      startled them. Gyp, putting up her face to see, felt on it soft pin-points
      of rain. Her frock would be spoiled, and it was one she was fond of&mdash;dove-coloured,
      velvety, not meant for weather. She turned for refuge to the birch-trees.
      It would be over directly, perhaps. Muffled in distance, the whining drone
      of that thresher still came travelling, deepening her discomfort. Then in
      the hedge, whence the boys had bolted down, a man reared himself above the
      lane, and came striding along toward her. He jumped down the bank, among
      the birch-trees. And she saw it was Fiorsen&mdash;panting, dishevelled,
      pale with heat. He must have followed her, and climbed straight up the
      hillside from the path she had come along in the bottom, before crossing
      the stream. His artistic dandyism had been harshly treated by that
      scramble. She might have laughed; but, instead, she felt excited, a little
      scared by the look on his hot, pale face. He said, breathlessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have caught you. So you are going to-morrow, and never told me! You
      thought you would slip away&mdash;not a word for me! Are you always so
      cruel? Well, I will not spare you, either!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crouching suddenly, he took hold of her broad ribbon sash, and buried his
      face in it. Gyp stood trembling&mdash;the action had not stirred her sense
      of the ridiculous. He circled her knees with his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gyp, I love you&mdash;I love you&mdash;don't send me away&mdash;let
      me be with you! I am your dog&mdash;your slave. Oh, Gyp, I love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice moved and terrified her. Men had said &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; several times
      during those last two years, but never with that lost-soul ring of
      passion, never with that look in the eyes at once fiercely hungry and so
      supplicating, never with that restless, eager, timid touch of hands. She
      could only murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please get up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love me a little, only a little&mdash;love me! Oh, Gyp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought flashed through Gyp: 'To how many has he knelt, I wonder?' His
      face had a kind of beauty in its abandonment&mdash;the beauty that comes
      from yearning&mdash;and she lost her frightened feeling. He went on, with
      his stammering murmur: &ldquo;I am a prodigal, I know; but if you love me, I
      will no longer be. I will do great things for you. Oh, Gyp, if you will
      some day marry me! Not now. When I have proved. Oh, Gyp, you are so sweet&mdash;so
      wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His arms crept up till he had buried his face against her waist. Without
      quite knowing what she did, Gyp touched his hair, and said again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; please get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up then, and standing near, with his hands hard clenched at his
      sides, whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have mercy! Speak to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not. All was strange and mazed and quivering in her, her spirit
      straining away, drawn to him, fantastically confused. She could only look
      into his face with her troubled, dark eyes. And suddenly she was seized
      and crushed to him. She shrank away, pushing him back with all her
      strength. He hung his head, abashed, suffering, with eyes shut, lips
      trembling; and her heart felt again that quiver of compassion. She
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I will tell you later&mdash;later&mdash;in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed, folding his arms, as if to make her feel safe from him. And
      when, regardless of the rain, she began to move on, he walked beside her,
      a yard or so away, humbly, as though he had never poured out those words
      or hurt her lips with the violence of his kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in her room, taking off her wet dress, Gyp tried to remember what he
      had said and what she had answered. She had not promised anything. But she
      had given him her address, both in London and the country. Unless she
      resolutely thought of other things, she still felt the restless touch of
      his hands, the grip of his arms, and saw his eyes as they were when he was
      kissing her; and once more she felt frightened and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was playing at the concert that evening&mdash;her last concert. And
      surely he had never played like that&mdash;with a despairing beauty, a
      sort of frenzied rapture. Listening, there came to her a feeling&mdash;a
      feeling of fatality&mdash;that, whether she would or no, she could not
      free herself from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      Once back in England, Gyp lost that feeling, or very nearly. Her
      scepticism told her that Fiorsen would soon see someone else who seemed
      all he had said she was! How ridiculous to suppose that he would stop his
      follies for her, that she had any real power over him! But, deep down, she
      did not quite believe this. It would have wounded her belief in herself
      too much&mdash;a belief so subtle and intimate that she was not conscious
      of it; belief in that something about her which had inspired the baroness
      to use the word &ldquo;fatality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton, who breathed again, hurried her off to Mildenham. He had bought
      her a new horse. They were in time for the last of the cubbing. And, for a
      week at least, the passion for riding and the sight of hounds carried all
      before it. Then, just as the real business of the season was beginning,
      she began to feel dull and restless. Mildenham was dark; the autumn winds
      made dreary noises. Her little brown spaniel, very old, who seemed only to
      have held on to life just for her return, died. She accused herself
      terribly for having left it so long when it was failing. Thinking of all
      the days Lass had been watching for her to come home&mdash;as Betty, with
      that love of woeful recital so dear to simple hearts, took good care to
      make plain&mdash;she felt as if she had been cruel. For events such as
      these, Gyp was both too tender-hearted and too hard on herself. She was
      quite ill for several days. The moment she was better, Winton, in dismay,
      whisked her back to Aunt Rosamund, in town. He would lose her company, but
      if it did her good, took her out of herself, he would be content. Running
      up for the week-end, three days later, he was relieved to find her
      decidedly perked-up, and left her again with the easier heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the day after he went back to Mildenham that she received a
      letter from Fiorsen, forwarded from Bury Street. He was&mdash;it said&mdash;just
      returning to London; he had not forgotten any look she had ever given him,
      or any word she had spoken. He should not rest till he could see her
      again. &ldquo;For a long time,&rdquo; the letter ended, &ldquo;before I first saw you, I was
      like the dead&mdash;lost. All was bitter apples to me. Now I am a ship
      that comes from the whirlpools to a warm blue sea; now I see again the
      evening star. I kiss your hands, and am your faithful slave&mdash;Gustav
      Fiorsen.&rdquo; These words, which from any other man would have excited her
      derision, renewed in Gyp that fluttered feeling, the pleasurable,
      frightened sense that she could not get away from his pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote in answer to the address he gave her in London, to say that she
      was staying for a few days in Curzon Street with her aunt, who would be
      glad to see him if he cared to come in any afternoon between five and six,
      and signed herself &ldquo;Ghita Winton.&rdquo; She was long over that little note. Its
      curt formality gave her satisfaction. Was she really mistress of herself&mdash;and
      him; able to dispose as she wished? Yes; and surely the note showed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was never easy to tell Gyp's feelings from her face; even Winton was
      often baffled. Her preparation of Aunt Rosamund for the reception of
      Fiorsen was a masterpiece of casualness. When he duly came, he, too,
      seemed doubly alive to the need for caution, only gazing at Gyp when he
      could not be seen doing so. But, going out, he whispered: &ldquo;Not like this&mdash;not
      like this; I must see you alone&mdash;I must!&rdquo; She smiled and shook her
      head. But bubbles had come back to the wine in her cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening she said quietly to Aunt Rosamund:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad doesn't like Mr. Fiorsen&mdash;can't appreciate his playing, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this most discreet remark caused Aunt Rosamund, avid&mdash;in a
      well-bred way&mdash;of music, to omit mention of the intruder when writing
      to her brother. The next two weeks he came almost every day, always
      bringing his violin, Gyp playing his accompaniments, and though his hungry
      stare sometimes made her feel hot, she would have missed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Winton next came up to Bury Street, she was in a quandary. To
      confess that Fiorsen was here, having omitted to speak of him in her
      letters? Not to confess, and leave him to find it out from Aunt Rosamund?
      Which was worse? Seized with panic, she did neither, but told her father
      she was dying for a gallop. Hailing that as the best of signs, he took her
      forthwith back to Mildenham. And curious were her feelings&mdash;light-hearted,
      compunctious, as of one who escapes yet knows she will soon be seeking to
      return. The meet was rather far next day, but she insisted on riding to
      it, since old Pettance, the superannuated jockey, charitably employed as
      extra stable help at Mildenham, was to bring on her second horse. There
      was a good scenting-wind, with rain in the offing, and outside the covert
      they had a corner to themselves&mdash;Winton knowing a trick worth two of
      the field's at-large. They had slipped there, luckily unseen, for the
      knowing were given to following the one-handed horseman in faded pink,
      who, on his bang-tailed black mare, had a knack of getting so well away.
      One of the whips, a little dark fellow with smouldery eyes and sucked-in
      weathered cheeks, dashed out of covert, rode past, saluting, and dashed in
      again. A jay came out with a screech, dived, and doubled back; a hare made
      off across the fallow&mdash;the light-brown lopping creature was barely
      visible against the brownish soil. Pigeons, very high up, flew over and
      away to the next wood. The shrilling voices of the whips rose from the
      covert-depths, and just a whimper now and then from the hounds, swiftly
      wheeling their noses among the fern and briers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp, crisping her fingers on the reins, drew-in deep breaths. It smelled
      so sweet and soft and fresh under that sky, pied of blue, and of white and
      light-grey swift-moving clouds&mdash;not half the wind down here that
      there was up there, just enough to be carrying off the beech and oak
      leaves, loosened by frost two days before. If only a fox would break this
      side, and they could have the first fields to themselves! It was so lovely
      to be alone with hounds! One of these came trotting out, a pretty young
      creature, busy and unconcerned, raising its tan-and-white head, its mild
      reproachful deep-brown eyes, at Winton's, &ldquo;Loo-in Trix!&rdquo; What a darling! A
      burst of music from the covert, and the darling vanished among the briers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp's new brown horse pricked its ears. A young man in a grey cutaway,
      buff cords, and jack-boots, on a low chestnut mare, came slipping round
      the covert. Oh&mdash;did that mean they were all coming? Impatiently she
      glanced at this intruder, who raised his hat a little and smiled. That
      smile, faintly impudent, was so infectious, that Gyp was melted to a
      slight response. Then she frowned. He had spoiled their lovely loneliness.
      Who was he? He looked unpardonably serene and happy sitting there. She did
      not remember his face at all, yet there was something familiar about it.
      He had taken his hat off&mdash;a broad face, very well cut, and
      clean-shaved, with dark curly hair, extraordinary clear eyes, a bold,
      cool, merry look. Where had she seen somebody like him?
    </p>
    <p>
      A tiny sound from Winton made her turn her head. The fox&mdash;stealing
      out beyond those further bushes! Breathless, she fixed her eyes on her
      father's face. It was hard as steel, watching. Not a sound, not a quiver,
      as if horse and man had turned to metal. Was he never going to give the
      view-halloo? Then his lips writhed, and out it came. Gyp cast a swift
      smile of gratitude at the young man for having had taste and sense to
      leave that to her father, and again he smiled at her. There were the first
      hounds streaming out&mdash;one on the other&mdash;music and feather! Why
      didn't Dad go? They would all be round this way in a minute!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the black mare slid past her, and, with a bound, her horse followed.
      The young man on the chestnut was away on the left. Only the hunts-man and
      one whip&mdash;beside their three selves! Glorious! The brown horse went
      too fast at that first fence and Winton called back: &ldquo;Steady, Gyp! Steady
      him!&rdquo; But she couldn't; and it didn't matter. Grass, three fields of
      grass! Oh, what a lovely fox&mdash;going so straight! And each time the
      brown horse rose, she thought: &ldquo;Perfect! I CAN ride! Oh, I am happy!&rdquo; And
      she hoped her father and the young man were looking. There was no feeling
      in the world like this, with a leader like Dad, hounds moving free, good
      going, and the field distanced. Better than dancing; better&mdash;yes,
      better than listening to music. If one could spend one's life galloping,
      sailing over fences; if it would never stop! The new horse was a darling,
      though he DID pull.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the next fence level with the young man, whose low chestnut
      mare moved with a stealthy action. His hat was crammed down now, and his
      face very determined, but his lips still had something of that smile. Gyp
      thought: &ldquo;He's got a good seat&mdash;very strong, only he looks like
      'thrusting.' Nobody rides like Dad&mdash;so beautifully quiet!&rdquo; Indeed,
      Winton's seat on a horse was perfection, all done with such a minimum
      expenditure. The hounds swung round in a curve. Now she was with them,
      really with them! What a pace&mdash;cracking! No fox could stand this
      long!
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she caught sight of him, barely a field ahead, scurrying
      desperately, brush down; and the thought flashed through her: 'Oh! don't
      let's catch you. Go on, fox; go on! Get away!' Were they really all after
      that little hunted red thing&mdash;a hundred great creatures, horses and
      men and women and dogs, and only that one little fox! But then came
      another fence, and quickly another, and she lost feelings of shame and
      pity in the exultation of flying over them. A minute later the fox went to
      earth within a few hundred yards of the leading hound, and she was glad.
      She had been in at deaths before&mdash;horrid! But it had been a lovely
      gallop. And, breathless, smiling rapturously, she wondered whether she
      could mop her face before the field came up, without that young man
      noticing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could see him talking to her father, and taking out a wisp of a
      handkerchief that smelled of cyclamen, she had a good scrub round. When
      she rode up, the young man raised his hat, and looking full at her said:
      &ldquo;You did go!&rdquo; His voice, rather high-pitched, had in it a spice of
      pleasant laziness. Gyp made him an ironical little bow, and murmured: &ldquo;My
      new horse, you mean.&rdquo; He broke again into that irrepressible smile, but,
      all the same, she knew that he admired her. And she kept thinking: 'Where
      HAVE I seen someone like him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      They had two more runs, but nothing like that first gallop. Nor did she
      again see the young man, whose name&mdash;it seemed&mdash;was Summerhay,
      son of a certain Lady Summerhay at Widrington, ten miles from Mildenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that long, silent jog home with Winton in fading daylight, she felt
      very happy&mdash;saturated with air and elation. The trees and fields, the
      hay-stacks, gates, and ponds beside the lanes grew dim; lights came up in
      the cottage windows; the air smelled sweet of wood smoke. And, for the
      first time all day, she thought of Fiorsen, thought of him almost
      longingly. If he could be there in the cosy old drawing-room, to play to
      her while she lay back&mdash;drowsing, dreaming by the fire in the scent
      of burning cedar logs&mdash;the Mozart minuet, or that little
      heart-catching tune of Poise, played the first time she heard him, or a
      dozen other of the things he played unaccompanied! That would be the most
      lovely ending to this lovely day. Just the glow and warmth wanting, to
      make all perfect&mdash;the glow and warmth of music and adoration!
    </p>
    <p>
      And touching the mare with her heel, she sighed. To indulge fancies about
      music and Fiorsen was safe here, far away from him; she even thought she
      would not mind if he were to behave again as he had under the birch-trees
      in the rain at Wiesbaden. It was so good to be adored. Her old mare,
      ridden now six years, began the series of contented snuffles that
      signified she smelt home. Here was the last turn, and the loom of the
      short beech-tree avenue to the house&mdash;the old manor-house,
      comfortable, roomy, rather dark, with wide shallow stairs. Ah, she was
      tired; and it was drizzling now. She would be nicely stiff to-morrow. In
      the light coming from the open door she saw Markey standing; and while
      fishing from her pocket the usual lumps of sugar, heard him say: &ldquo;Mr.
      Fiorsen, sir&mdash;gentleman from Wiesbaden&mdash;to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her heart thumped. What did this mean? Why had he come? How had he dared?
      How could he have been so treacherous to her? Ah, but he was ignorant, of
      course, that she had not told her father. A veritable judgment on her! She
      ran straight in and up the stairs. The voice of Betty, &ldquo;Your bath's ready,
      Miss Gyp,&rdquo; roused her. And crying, &ldquo;Oh, Betty darling, bring me up my
      tea!&rdquo; she ran into the bathroom. She was safe there; and in the delicious
      heat of the bath faced the situation better.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be only one meaning. He had come to ask for her. And,
      suddenly, she took comfort. Better so; there would be no more secrecy from
      Dad! And he would stand between her and Fiorsen if&mdash;if she decided
      not to marry him. The thought staggered her. Had she, without knowing it,
      got so far as this? Yes, and further. It was all no good; Fiorsen would
      never accept refusal, even if she gave it! But, did she want to refuse?
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved hot baths, but had never stayed in one so long. Life was so easy
      there, and so difficult outside. Betty's knock forced her to get out at
      last, and let her in with tea and the message. Would Miss Gyp please to go
      down when she was ready?
    </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton was staggered. With a glance at Gyp's vanishing figure, he said
      curtly to Markey, &ldquo;Where have you put this gentleman?&rdquo; But the use of the
      word &ldquo;this&rdquo; was the only trace he showed of his emotions. In that little
      journey across the hall he entertained many extravagant thoughts. Arrived
      at the study, he inclined his head courteously enough, waiting for Fiorsen
      to speak. The &ldquo;fiddler,&rdquo; still in his fur-lined coat, was twisting a
      squash hat in his hands. In his own peculiar style he was impressive. But
      why couldn't he look you in the face; or, if he did, why did he seem about
      to eat you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew I was returned to London, Major Winton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Gyp had been seeing the fellow without letting him know! The thought
      was chill and bitter to Winton. He must not give her away, however, and he
      simply bowed. He felt that his visitor was afraid of his frigid courtesy;
      and he did not mean to help him over that fear. He could not, of course,
      realize that this ascendancy would not prevent Fiorsen from laughing at
      him behind his back and acting as if he did not exist. No real contest, in
      fact, was possible between men moving on such different planes, neither
      having the slightest respect for the other's standards or beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen, who had begun to pace the room, stopped, and said with agitation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Winton, your daughter is the most beautiful thing on earth. I love
      her desperately. I am a man with a future, though you may not think it. I
      have what future I like in my art if only I can marry her. I have a little
      money, too&mdash;not much; but in my violin there is all the fortune she
      can want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton's face expressed nothing but cold contempt. That this fellow should
      take him for one who would consider money in connection with his daughter
      simply affronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not like me&mdash;that is clear. I saw it the first moment. You
      are an English gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;he pronounced the words with a sort of
      irony&mdash;&ldquo;I am nothing to you. Yet, in MY world, I am something. I am
      not an adventurer. Will you permit me to beg your daughter to be my wife?&rdquo;
       He raised his hands that still held the hat; involuntarily they had
      assumed the attitude of prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second, Winton realized that he was suffering. That weakness went in
      a flash, and he said frigidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am obliged to you, sir, for coming to me first. You are in my house,
      and I don't want to be discourteous, but I should be glad if you would be
      good enough to withdraw and take it that I shall certainly oppose your
      wish as best I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The almost childish disappointment and trouble in Fiorsen's face changed
      quickly to an expression fierce, furtive, mocking; and then shifted to
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Winton, you have loved; you must have loved her mother. I suffer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton, who had turned abruptly to the fire, faced round again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't control my daughter's affections, sir; she will do as she wishes.
      I merely say it will be against my hopes and judgment if she marries you.
      I imagine you've not altogether waited for my leave. I was not blind to
      the way you hung about her at Wiesbaden, Mr. Fiorsen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen answered with a twisted, miserable smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor wretches do what they can. May I see her? Let me just see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it any good to refuse? She had been seeing the fellow already without
      his knowledge, keeping from him&mdash;HIM&mdash;all her feelings, whatever
      they were. And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send for her. In the meantime, perhaps you'll have some
      refreshment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen shook his head, and there followed half an hour of acute
      discomfort. Winton, in his mud-stained clothes before the fire, supported
      it better than his visitor. That child of nature, after endeavouring to
      emulate his host's quietude, renounced all such efforts with an expressive
      gesture, fidgeted here, fidgeted there, tramped the room, went to the
      window, drew aside the curtains and stared out into the dark; came back as
      if resolved again to confront Winton; then, baffled by that figure so
      motionless before the fire, flung himself down in an armchair, and turned
      his face to the wall. Winton was not cruel by nature, but he enjoyed the
      writhings of this fellow who was endangering Gyp's happiness. Endangering?
      Surely not possible that she would accept him! Yet, if not, why had she
      not told him? And he, too, suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she came. He had expected her to be pale and nervous; but Gyp never
      admitted being naughty till she had been forgiven. Her smiling face had in
      it a kind of warning closeness. She went up to Fiorsen, and holding out
      her hand, said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice of you to come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton had the bitter feeling that he&mdash;he&mdash;was the outsider.
      Well, he would speak plainly; there had been too much underhand doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fiorsen has done us the honour to wish to marry you. I've told him
      that you decide such things for yourself. If you accept him, it will be
      against my wish, naturally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While he was speaking, the glow in her cheeks deepened; she looked neither
      at him nor at Fiorsen. Winton noted the rise and fall of the lace on her
      breast. She was smiling, and gave the tiniest shrug of her shoulders. And,
      suddenly smitten to the heart, he walked stiffly to the door. It was
      evident that she had no use for his guidance. If her love for him was not
      worth to her more than this fellow! But there his resentment stopped. He
      knew that he could not afford wounded feelings; could not get on without
      her. Married to the greatest rascal on earth, he would still be standing
      by her, wanting her companionship and love. She represented too much in
      the present and&mdash;the past. With sore heart, indeed, he went down to
      dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen was gone when he came down again. What the fellow had said, or she
      had answered, he would not for the world have asked. Gulfs between the
      proud are not lightly bridged. And when she came up to say good-night,
      both their faces were as though coated with wax.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days that followed, she gave no sign, uttered no word in any way
      suggesting that she meant to go against his wishes. Fiorsen might not have
      existed, for any mention made of him. But Winton knew well that she was
      moping, and cherishing some feeling against himself. And this he could not
      bear. So, one evening, after dinner, he said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me frankly, Gyp; do you care for that chap?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered as quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a way&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips had quivered; and Winton's heart softened, as it always did when
      he saw her moved. He put his hand out, covered one of hers, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never stand in the way of your happiness, Gyp. But it must BE
      happiness. Can it possibly be that? I don't think so. You know what they
      said of him out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not thought she knew. And his heart sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's pretty bad, you know. And is he of our world at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I belong to 'our world,' Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton turned away. She followed, slipping her hand under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to hurt. But it's true, isn't it? I don't belong among
      society people. They wouldn't have me, you know&mdash;if they knew about
      what you told me. Ever since that I've felt I don't belong to them. I'm
      nearer him. Music means more to me than anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton gave her hand a convulsive grip. A sense of coming defeat and
      bereavement was on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your happiness went wrong, Gyp, I should be most awfully cut up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why shouldn't I be happy, Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were, I could put up with anyone. But, I tell you, I can't believe
      you would be. I beg you, my dear&mdash;for God's sake, make sure. I'll put
      a bullet into the man who treats you badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp laughed, then kissed him. But they were silent. At bedtime he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll go up to town to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether from a feeling of the inevitable, or from the forlorn hope that
      seeing more of the fellow might be the only chance of curing her&mdash;he
      put no more obstacles in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the queer courtship began again. By Christmas she had consented, still
      under the impression that she was the mistress, not the slave&mdash;the
      cat, not the bird. Once or twice, when Fiorsen let passion out of hand and
      his overbold caresses affronted her, she recoiled almost with dread from
      what she was going toward. But, in general, she lived elated, intoxicated
      by music and his adoration, withal remorseful that she was making her
      father sad. She was but little at Mildenham, and he, in his unhappiness,
      was there nearly all the time, riding extra hard, and leaving Gyp with his
      sister. Aunt Rosamund, though under the spell of Fiorsen's music, had
      agreed with her brother that Fiorsen was &ldquo;impossible.&rdquo; But nothing she
      said made any effect on Gyp. It was new and startling to discover in this
      soft, sensitive girl such a vein of stubbornness. Opposition seemed to
      harden her resolution. And the good lady's natural optimism began to
      persuade her that Gyp would make a silk purse out of that sow's ear yet.
      After all, the man was a celebrity in his way!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was settled for February. A house with a garden was taken in St. John's
      Wood. The last month went, as all such last months go, in those
      intoxicating pastimes, the buying of furniture and clothes. If it were not
      for that, who knows how many engagement knots would slip!
    </p>
    <p>
      And to-day they had been married. To the last, Winton had hardly believed
      it would come to that. He had shaken the hand of her husband and kept pain
      and disappointment out of his face, knowing well that he deceived no one.
      Thank heaven, there had been no church, no wedding-cake, invitations,
      congratulations, fal-lals of any kind&mdash;he could never have stood
      them. Not even Rosamund&mdash;who had influenza&mdash;to put up with!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying back in the recesses of that old chair, he stared into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would be just about at Torquay by now&mdash;just about. Music! Who
      would have thought noises made out of string and wood could have stolen
      her away from him? Yes, they would be at Torquay by now, at their hotel.
      And the first prayer Winton had uttered for years escaped his lips:

      &ldquo;Let her be happy! Let her be happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, hearing Markey open the door, he closed his eyes and feigned sleep.

      Part II
    </h2>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      When a girl first sits opposite the man she has married, of what does she
      think? Not of the issues and emotions that lie in wait. They are too
      overwhelming; she would avoid them while she can. Gyp thought of her
      frock, a mushroom-coloured velvet cord. Not many girls of her class are
      married without &ldquo;fal-lals,&rdquo; as Winton had called them. Not many girls sit
      in the corner of their reserved first-class compartments without the
      excitement of having been supreme centre of the world for some flattering
      hours to buoy them up on that train journey, with no memories of friends'
      behaviour, speech, appearance, to chat of with her husband, so as to keep
      thought away. For Gyp, her dress, first worn that day, Betty's breakdown,
      the faces, blank as hats, of the registrar and clerk, were about all she
      had to distract her. She stole a look at her husband, clothed in blue
      serge, just opposite. Her husband! Mrs. Gustav Fiorsen! No! People might
      call her that; to herself, she was Ghita Winton. Ghita Fiorsen would never
      seem right. And, not confessing that she was afraid to meet his eyes, but
      afraid all the same, she looked out of the window. A dull, bleak, dismal
      day; no warmth, no sun, no music in it&mdash;the Thames as grey as lead,
      the willows on its banks forlorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she felt his hand on hers. She had not seen his face like that
      before&mdash;yes; once or twice when he was playing&mdash;a spirit shining
      though. She felt suddenly secure. If it stayed like that, then!&mdash;His
      hand rested on her knee; his face changed just a little; the spirit seemed
      to waver, to be fading; his lips grew fuller. He crossed over and sat
      beside her. Instantly she began to talk about their house, where they were
      going to put certain things&mdash;presents and all that. He, too, talked
      of the house; but every now and then he glanced at the corridor, and
      muttered. It was pleasant to feel that the thought of her possessed him
      through and through, but she was tremulously glad of that corridor. Life
      is mercifully made up of little things! And Gyp was always able to live in
      the moment. In the hours they had spent together, up to now, he had been
      like a starved man snatching hasty meals; now that he had her to himself
      for good, he was another creature altogether&mdash;like a boy out of
      school, and kept her laughing nearly all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he got down his practise violin, and putting on the mute,
      played, looking at her over his shoulder with a droll smile. She felt
      happy, much warmer at heart, now. And when his face was turned away, she
      looked at him. He was so much better looking now than when he had those
      little whiskers. One day she had touched one of them and said: &ldquo;Ah! if
      only these wings could fly!&rdquo; Next morning they had flown. His face was not
      one to be easily got used to; she was not used to it yet, any more than
      she was used to his touch. When it grew dark, and he wanted to draw down
      the blinds, she caught him by the sleeve, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; they'll know we're honeymooners!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my Gyp, and are we not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he obeyed; only, as the hours went on, his eyes seemed never to let
      her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Torquay, the sky was clear and starry; the wind brought whiffs of
      sea-scent into their cab; lights winked far out on a headland; and in the
      little harbour, all bluish dark, many little boats floated like tame
      birds. He had put his arm round her, and she could feel his hand resting
      on her heart. She was grateful that he kept so still. When the cab stopped
      and they entered the hall of the hotel, she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let's let them see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, mercifully, little things! Inspecting the three rooms, getting the
      luggage divided between dressing-room and bedroom, unpacking, wondering
      which dress to put on for dinner, stopping to look out over the dark rocks
      and the sea, where the moon was coming up, wondering if she dared lock the
      door while she was dressing, deciding that it would be silly; dressing so
      quickly, fluttering when she found him suddenly there close behind her,
      beginning to do up her hooks. Those fingers were too skilful! It was the
      first time she had thought of his past with a sort of hurt pride and
      fastidiousness. When he had finished, he twisted her round, held her away,
      looked at her from head to foot, and said below his breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her heart beat fast then; but suddenly he laughed, slipped his arm about
      her, and danced her twice round the room. He let her go demurely down the
      stairs in front of him, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shan't see&mdash;my Gyp. Oh, they shan't see! We are old married
      people, tired of each other&mdash;very!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At dinner it amused him at first&mdash;her too, a little&mdash;to keep up
      this farce of indifference. But every now and then he turned and stared at
      some inoffensive visitor who was taking interest in them, with such fierce
      and genuine contempt that Gyp took alarm; whereon he laughed. When she had
      drunk a little wine and he had drunk a good deal, the farce of
      indifference came to its end. He talked at a great rate now, slying
      nicknaming the waiters and mimicking the people around&mdash;happy thrusts
      that made her smile but shiver a little, lest they should be heard or
      seen. Their heads were close together across the little table. They went
      out into the lounge. Coffee came, and he wanted her to smoke with him. She
      had never smoked in a public room. But it seemed stiff and &ldquo;missish&rdquo; to
      refuse&mdash;she must do now as his world did. And it was another little
      thing; she wanted little things, all the time wanted them. She drew back a
      window-curtain, and they stood there side by side. The sea was deep blue
      beneath bright stars, and the moon shone through a ragged pine-tree on a
      little headland. Though she stood five feet six in her shoes, she was only
      up to his mouth. He sighed and said: &ldquo;Beautiful night, my Gyp!&rdquo; And
      suddenly it struck her that she knew nothing of what was in him, and yet
      he was her husband! &ldquo;Husband&rdquo;&mdash;funny word, not pretty! She felt as a
      child opening the door of a dark room, and, clutching his arm, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! There's a sailing-boat. What's it doing out there at night?&rdquo;
       Another little thing! Any little thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up-stairs! I'll play to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up in their sitting-room was a piano, but&mdash;not possible; to-morrow
      they would have to get another. To-morrow! The fire was hot, and he took
      off his coat to play. In one of his shirt-sleeves there was a rent. She
      thought, with a sort of triumph: 'I shall mend that!' It was something
      definite, actual&mdash;a little thing. There were lilies in the room that
      gave a strong, sweet scent. He brought them up to her to sniff, and, while
      she was sniffing, stooped suddenly and kissed her neck. She shut her eyes
      with a shiver. He took the flowers away at once, and when she opened her
      eyes again, his violin was at his shoulder. For a whole hour he played,
      and Gyp, in her cream-coloured frock, lay back, listening. She was tired,
      not sleepy. It would have been nice to have been sleepy. Her mouth had its
      little sad tuck or dimple at the corner; her eyes were deep and dark&mdash;a
      cloudy child. His gaze never left her face; he played and played, and his
      own fitful face grew clouded. At last he put away the violin, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to bed, Gyp; you're tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obediently she got up and went into the bedroom. With a sick feeling in
      her heart, and as near the fire as she could get, she undressed with
      desperate haste, and got to bed. An age&mdash;it seemed&mdash;she lay
      there shivering in her flimsy lawn against the cold sheets, her eyes not
      quite closed, watching the flicker of the firelight. She did not think&mdash;could
      not&mdash;just lay stiller than the dead. The door creaked. She shut her
      eyes. Had she a heart at all? It did not seem to beat. She lay thus, with
      eyes shut, till she could bear it no longer. By the firelight she saw him
      crouching at the foot of the bed; could just see his face&mdash;like a
      face&mdash;a face&mdash;where seen? Ah yes!&mdash;a picture&mdash;of a
      wild man crouching at the feet of Iphigenia&mdash;so humble, so hungry&mdash;so
      lost in gazing. She gave a little smothered sob and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp was too proud to give by halves. And in those early days she gave
      Fiorsen everything except&mdash;her heart. She earnestly desired to give
      that too; but hearts only give themselves. Perhaps if the wild man in him,
      maddened by beauty in its power, had not so ousted the spirit man, her
      heart might have gone with her lips and the rest of her. He knew he was
      not getting her heart, and it made him, in the wildness of his nature and
      the perversity of a man, go just the wrong way to work, trying to conquer
      her by the senses, not the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she was not unhappy&mdash;it cannot be said she was unhappy, except
      for a sort of lost feeling sometimes, as if she were trying to grasp
      something that kept slipping, slipping away. She was glad to give him
      pleasure. She felt no repulsion&mdash;this was man's nature. Only there
      was always that feeling that she was not close. When he was playing, with
      the spirit-look on his face, she would feel: 'Now, now, surely I shall get
      close to him!' But the look would go; how to keep it there she did not
      know, and when it went, her feeling went too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their little suite of rooms was at the very end of the hotel, so that he
      might play as much as he wished. While he practised in the mornings she
      would go into the garden, which sloped in rock-terraces down to the sea.
      Wrapped in fur, she would sit there with a book. She soon knew each
      evergreen, or flower that was coming out&mdash;aubretia, and laurustinus,
      a little white flower whose name was uncertain, and one star-periwinkle.
      The air was often soft; the birds sang already and were busy with their
      weddings, and twice, at least, spring came in her heart&mdash;that
      wonderful feeling when first the whole being scents new life preparing in
      the earth and the wind&mdash;the feeling that only comes when spring is
      not yet, and one aches and rejoices all at once. Seagulls often came over
      her, craning down their greedy bills and uttering cries like a kitten's
      mewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out here she had feelings, that she did not get with him, of being at one
      with everything. She did not realize how tremendously she had grown up in
      these few days, how the ground bass had already come into the light music
      of her life. Living with Fiorsen was opening her eyes to much beside mere
      knowledge of &ldquo;man's nature&rdquo;; with her perhaps fatal receptivity, she was
      already soaking up the atmosphere of his philosophy. He was always in
      revolt against accepting things because he was expected to; but, like most
      executant artists, he was no reasoner, just a mere instinctive kicker
      against the pricks. He would lose himself in delight with a sunset, a
      scent, a tune, a new caress, in a rush of pity for a beggar or a blind
      man, a rush of aversion from a man with large feet or a long nose, of
      hatred for a woman with a flat chest or an expression of sanctimony. He
      would swing along when he was walking, or dawdle, dawdle; he would sing
      and laugh, and make her laugh too till she ached, and half an hour later
      would sit staring into some pit of darkness in a sort of powerful brooding
      of his whole being. Insensibly she shared in this deep drinking of
      sensation, but always gracefully, fastidiously, never losing sense of
      other people's feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his love-raptures, he just avoided setting her nerves on edge, because
      he never failed to make her feel his enjoyment of her beauty; that
      perpetual consciousness, too, of not belonging to the proper and
      respectable, which she had tried to explain to her father, made her set
      her teeth against feeling shocked. But in other ways he did shock her. She
      could not get used to his utter oblivion of people's feelings, to the
      ferocious contempt with which he would look at those who got on his
      nerves, and make half-audible comments, just as he had commented on her
      own father when he and Count Rosek passed them, by the Schiller statue.
      She would visibly shrink at those remarks, though they were sometimes so
      excruciatingly funny that she had to laugh, and feel dreadful immediately
      after. She saw that he resented her shrinking; it seemed to excite him to
      run amuck the more. But she could not help it. Once she got up and walked
      away. He followed her, sat on the floor beside her knees, and thrust his
      head, like a great cat, under her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, my Gyp; but they are such brutes. Who could help it? Now tell
      me&mdash;who could, except my Gyp?&rdquo; And she had to forgive him. But, one
      evening, when he had been really outrageous during dinner, she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I can't. It's you that are the brute. You WERE a brute to them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaped up with a face of furious gloom and went out of the room. It was
      the first time he had given way to anger with her. Gyp sat by the fire,
      very disturbed; chiefly because she was not really upset at having hurt
      him. Surely she ought to be feeling miserable at that!
    </p>
    <p>
      But when, at ten o'clock, he had not come back, she began to flutter in
      earnest. She had said a dreadful thing! And yet, in her heart, she did not
      take back her judgment. He really HAD been a brute. She would have liked
      to soothe herself by playing, but it was too late to disturb people, and
      going to the window, she looked out over the sea, feeling beaten and
      confused. This was the first time she had given free rein to her feeling
      against what Winton would have called his &ldquo;bounderism.&rdquo; If he had been
      English, she would never have been attracted by one who could trample so
      on other people's feelings. What, then, had attracted her? His
      strangeness, wildness, the mesmeric pull of his passion for her, his
      music! Nothing could spoil that in him. The sweep, the surge, and sigh in
      his playing was like the sea out there, dark, and surf-edged, beating on
      the rocks; or the sea deep-coloured in daylight, with white gulls over it;
      or the sea with those sinuous paths made by the wandering currents, the
      subtle, smiling, silent sea, holding in suspense its unfathomable
      restlessness, waiting to surge and spring again. That was what she wanted
      from him&mdash;not his embraces, not even his adoration, his wit, or his
      queer, lithe comeliness touched with felinity; no, only that in his soul
      which escaped through his fingers into the air and dragged at her soul.
      If, when he came in, she were to run to him, throw her arms round his
      neck, make herself feel close, lose herself in him! Why not? It was her
      duty; why not her delight, too? But she shivered. Some instinct too deep
      for analysis, something in the very heart of her nerves made her recoil,
      as if she were afraid, literally scared of letting herself go, of loving&mdash;the
      subtlest instinct of self-preservation against something fatal; against
      being led on beyond&mdash;yes, it was like that curious, instinctive
      sinking which some feel at the mere sight of a precipice, a dread of going
      near, lest they should be drawn on and over by resistless attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed into their bedroom and began slowly to undress. To go to bed
      without knowing where he was, what doing, thinking, seemed already a
      little odd; and she sat brushing her hair slowly with the silver-backed
      brushes, staring at her own pale face, whose eyes looked so very large and
      dark. At last there came to her the feeling: &ldquo;I can't help it! I don't
      care!&rdquo; And, getting into bed, she turned out the light. It seemed queer
      and lonely; there was no fire. And then, without more ado, she slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a dream of being between Fiorsen and her father in a
      railway-carriage out at sea, with the water rising higher and higher,
      swishing and sighing. Awakening always, like a dog, to perfect presence of
      mind, she knew that he was playing in the sitting-room, playing&mdash;at
      what time of night? She lay listening to a quivering, gibbering tune that
      she did not know. Should she be first to make it up, or should she wait
      for him? Twice she half slipped out of bed, but both times, as if fate
      meant her not to move, he chose that moment to swell out the sound, and
      each time she thought: 'No, I can't. It's just the same now; he doesn't
      care how many people he wakes up. He does just what he likes, and cares
      nothing for anyone.' And covering her ears with her hands, she continued
      to lie motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she withdrew her hands at last, he had stopped. Then she heard him
      coming, and feigned sleep. But he did not spare even sleep. She submitted
      to his kisses without a word, her heart hardening within her&mdash;surely
      he smelled of brandy! Next morning he seemed to have forgotten it all. But
      Gyp had not. She wanted badly to know what he had felt, where he had gone,
      but was too proud to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote twice to her father in the first week, but afterwards, except
      for a postcard now and then, she never could. Why tell him what she was
      doing, in company of one whom he could not bear to think of? Had he been
      right? To confess that would hurt her pride too much. But she began to
      long for London. The thought of her little house was a green spot to dwell
      on. When they were settled in, and could do what they liked without
      anxiety about people's feelings, it would be all right perhaps. When he
      could start again really working, and she helping him, all would be
      different. Her new house, and so much to do; her new garden, and
      fruit-trees coming into blossom! She would have dogs and cats, would ride
      when Dad was in town. Aunt Rosamund would come, friends, evenings of
      music, dances still, perhaps&mdash;he danced beautifully, and loved it, as
      she did. And his concerts&mdash;the elation of being identified with his
      success! But, above all, the excitement of making her home as dainty as
      she could, with daring experiments in form and colour. And yet, at heart
      she knew that to be already looking forward, banning the present, was a
      bad sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing, at all events, she enjoyed&mdash;sailing. They had blue days
      when even the March sun was warm, and there was just breeze enough. He got
      on excellently well with the old salt whose boat they used, for he was at
      his best with simple folk, whose lingo he could understand about as much
      as they could understand his.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those hours, Gyp had some real sensations of romance. The sea was so
      blue, the rocks and wooded spurs of that Southern coast so dreamy in the
      bright land-haze. Oblivious of &ldquo;the old salt,&rdquo; he would put his arm round
      her; out there, she could swallow down her sense of form, and be grateful
      for feeling nearer to him in spirit. She made loyal efforts to understand
      him in these weeks that were bringing a certain disillusionment. The
      elemental part of marriage was not the trouble; if she did not herself
      feel passion, she did not resent his. When, after one of those embraces,
      his mouth curled with a little bitter smile, as if to say, &ldquo;Yes, much you
      care for me,&rdquo; she would feel compunctious and yet aggrieved. But the
      trouble lay deeper&mdash;the sense of an insuperable barrier; and always
      that deep, instinctive recoil from letting herself go. She could not let
      herself be known, and she could not know him. Why did his eyes often fix
      her with a stare that did not seem to see her? What made him, in the midst
      of serious playing, break into some furious or desolate little tune, or
      drop his violin? What gave him those long hours of dejection, following
      the maddest gaiety? Above all, what dreams had he in those rare moments
      when music transformed his strange pale face? Or was it a mere physical
      illusion&mdash;had he any dreams? &ldquo;The heart of another is a dark forest&rdquo;&mdash;to
      all but the one who loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, he held up a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha! Paul Rosek went to see our house. 'A pretty dove's nest!' he
      calls it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The memory of the Pole's sphinxlike, sweetish face, and eyes that seemed
      to know so many secrets, always affected Gyp unpleasantly. She said
      quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you like him, Gustav?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like him? Oh, he is useful. A good judge of music, and&mdash;many
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he is hateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hateful? Why hateful, my Gyp? He is a good friend. And he admires you&mdash;oh,
      he admires you very much! He has success with women. He always says, 'J'ai
      une technique merveilleuse pour seduire une femme.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! He's like a toad, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I shall tell him that! He will be flattered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do; if you give me away&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up and caught her in his arms; his face was so comically
      compunctious that she calmed down at once. She thought over her words
      afterwards and regretted them. All the same, Rosek was a sneak and a cold
      sensualist, she was sure. And the thought that he had been spying at their
      little house tarnished her anticipations of homecoming.

      They went to Town three days later. While the taxi was skirting Lord's
      Cricket-ground, Gyp slipped her hand into Fiorsen's. She was brimful of
      excitement. The trees were budding in the gardens that they passed; the
      almond-blossom coming&mdash;yes, really coming! They were in the road now.
      Five, seven, nine&mdash;thirteen! Two more! There it was, nineteen, in
      white figures on the leaf-green railings, under the small green lilac
      buds; yes, and their almond-blossom was out, too! She could just catch a
      glimpse over those tall railings of the low white house with its green
      outside shutters. She jumped out almost into the arms of Betty, who stood
      smiling all over her broad, flushed face, while, from under each arm
      peered forth the head of a black devil, with pricked ears and eyes as
      bright as diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty! What darlings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Major Winton's present, my dear&mdash;ma'am!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giving the stout shoulders a hug, Gyp seized the black devils, and ran up
      the path under the trellis, while the Scotch-terrier pups, squeezed
      against her breast, made confused small noises and licked her nose and
      ears. Through the square hall she ran into the drawing-room, which opened
      out on to the lawn; and there, in the French window, stood spying back at
      the spick-and-span room, where everything was, of course, placed just
      wrong. The colouring, white, ebony, and satinwood, looked nicer even than
      she had hoped. Out in the garden&mdash;her own garden&mdash;the pear-trees
      were thickening, but not in blossom yet; a few daffodils were in bloom
      along the walls, and a magnolia had one bud opened. And all the time she
      kept squeezing the puppies to her, enjoying their young, warm, fluffy
      savour, and letting them kiss her. She ran out of the drawing-room, up the
      stairs. Her bedroom, the dressing-room, the spare room, the bathroom&mdash;she
      dashed into them all. Oh, it was nice to be in your own place, to be&mdash;Suddenly
      she felt herself lifted off the ground from behind, and in that
      undignified position, her eyes flying, she turned her face till he could
      reach her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      To wake, and hear the birds at early practise, and feel that winter is
      over&mdash;is there any pleasanter moment?
    </p>
    <p>
      That first morning in her new house, Gyp woke with the sparrow, or
      whatever the bird which utters the first cheeps and twitters, soon
      eclipsed by so much that is more important in bird-song. It seemed as if
      all the feathered creatures in London must be assembled in her garden; and
      the old verse came into her head:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;All dear Nature's children sweet
      Lie at bride and bridegroom's feet,
      Blessing their sense.
      Not a creature of the air,
      Bird melodious or bird fair,
      Be absent hence!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      She turned and looked at her husband. He lay with his head snoozled down
      into the pillow, so that she could only see his thick, rumpled hair. And a
      shiver went through her, exactly as if a strange man were lying there. Did
      he really belong to her, and she to him&mdash;for good? And was this their
      house&mdash;together? It all seemed somehow different, more serious and
      troubling, in this strange bed, of this strange room, that was to be so
      permanent. Careful not to wake him, she slipped out and stood between the
      curtains and the window. Light was all in confusion yet; away low down
      behind the trees, the rose of dawn still clung. One might almost have been
      in the country, but for the faint, rumorous noises of the town beginning
      to wake, and that film of ground-mist which veils the feet of London
      mornings. She thought: &ldquo;I am mistress in this house, have to direct it all&mdash;see
      to everything! And my pups! Oh, what do they eat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the first of many hours of anxiety, for she was very
      conscientious. Her fastidiousness desired perfection, but her
      sensitiveness refused to demand it of others&mdash;especially servants.
      Why should she harry them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen had not the faintest notion of regularity. She found that he could
      not even begin to appreciate her struggles in housekeeping. And she was
      much too proud to ask his help, or perhaps too wise, since he was
      obviously unfit to give it. To live like the birds of the air was his
      motto. Gyp would have liked nothing better; but, for that, one must not
      have a house with three servants, several meals, two puppy-dogs, and no
      great experience of how to deal with any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke of her difficulties to no one and suffered the more. With Betty&mdash;who,
      bone-conservative, admitted Fiorsen as hardly as she had once admitted
      Winton&mdash;she had to be very careful. But her great trouble was with
      her father. Though she longed to see him, she literally dreaded their
      meeting. He first came&mdash;as he had been wont to come when she was a
      tiny girl&mdash;at the hour when he thought the fellow to whom she now
      belonged would most likely be out. Her heart beat, when she saw him under
      the trellis. She opened the door herself, and hung about him so that his
      shrewd eyes should not see her face. And she began at once to talk of the
      puppies, whom she had named Don and Doff. They were perfect darlings;
      nothing was safe from them; her slippers were completely done for; they
      had already got into her china-cabinet and gone to sleep there! He must
      come and see all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hooking her arm into his, and talking all the time, she took him up-stairs
      and down, and out into the garden, to the studio, or music-room, at the
      end, which had an entrance to itself on to a back lane. This room had been
      the great attraction. Fiorsen could practice there in peace. Winton went
      along with her very quietly, making a shrewd comment now and then. At the
      far end of the garden, looking over the wall, down into that narrow
      passage which lay between it and the back of another garden he squeezed
      her arm suddenly and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gyp, what sort of a time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question had come at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rather lovely&mdash;in some ways.&rdquo; But she did not look at him, nor
      he at her. &ldquo;See, Dad! The cats have made quite a path there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton bit his lips and turned from the wall. The thought of that fellow
      was bitter within him. She meant to tell him nothing, meant to keep up
      that lighthearted look&mdash;which didn't deceive him a bit!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at my crocuses! It's really spring today!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was. Even a bee or two had come. The tiny leaves had a transparent
      look, too thin as yet to keep the sunlight from passing through them. The
      purple, delicate-veined crocuses, with little flames of orange blowing
      from their centres, seemed to hold the light as in cups. A wind, without
      harshness, swung the boughs; a dry leaf or two still rustled round here
      and there. And on the grass, and in the blue sky, and on the
      almond-blossom was the first spring brilliance. Gyp clasped her hands
      behind her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely&mdash;to feel the spring!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Winton thought: 'She's changed!' She had softened, quickened&mdash;more
      depth of colour in her, more gravity, more sway in her body, more
      sweetness in her smile. But&mdash;was she happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what a pleasure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fellow had slunk up like the great cat he was. And it seemed to Winton
      that Gyp had winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad thinks we ought to have dark curtains in the music-room, Gustav.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen made a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;like a London club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton, watching, was sure of supplication in her face. And, forcing a
      smile, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem very snug here. Glad to see you again. Gyp looks splendid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another of those bows he so detested! Mountebank! Never, never would he be
      able to stand the fellow! But he must not, would not, show it. And, as
      soon as he decently could, he went, taking his lonely way back through
      this region, of which his knowledge was almost limited to Lord's
      Cricket-ground, with a sense of doubt and desolation, an irritation more
      than ever mixed with the resolve to be always at hand if the child wanted
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been gone ten minutes before Aunt Rosamund appeared, with a
      crutch-handled stick and a gentlemanly limp, for she, too, indulged her
      ancestors in gout. A desire for exclusive possession of their friends is
      natural to some people, and the good lady had not known how fond she was
      of her niece till the girl had slipped off into this marriage. She wanted
      her back, to go about with and make much of, as before. And her well-bred
      drawl did not quite disguise this feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp could detect Fiorsen subtly mimicking that drawl; and her ears began
      to burn. The puppies afforded a diversion&mdash;their points, noses,
      boldness, and food, held the danger in abeyance for some minutes. Then the
      mimicry began again. When Aunt Rosamund had taken a somewhat sudden leave,
      Gyp stood at the window of her drawing-room with the mask off her face.
      Fiorsen came up, put his arm round her from behind, and said with a fierce
      sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they coming often&mdash;these excellent people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp drew back from him against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you love me, why do you try to hurt the people who love me too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am jealous. I am jealous even of those puppies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall you try to hurt them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I see them too much near you, perhaps I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I can be happy if you hurt things because they love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and drew her on to his knee. She did not resist, but made not
      the faintest return to his caresses. The first time&mdash;the very first
      friend to come into her own new home! It was too much!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen said hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not love me. If you loved me, I should feel it through your lips.
      I should see it in your eyes. Oh, love me, Gyp! You shall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But to say to Love: &ldquo;Stand and deliver!&rdquo; was not the way to touch Gyp. It
      seemed to her mere ill-bred stupidity. She froze against him in soul, all
      the more that she yielded her body. When a woman refuses nothing to one
      whom she does not really love, shadows are already falling on the
      bride-house. And Fiorsen knew it; but his self-control about equalled that
      of the two puppies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, on the whole, these first weeks in her new home were happy, too busy
      to allow much room for doubting or regret. Several important concerts were
      fixed for May. She looked forward to these with intense eagerness, and
      pushed everything that interfered with preparation into the background. As
      though to make up for that instinctive recoil from giving her heart, of
      which she was always subconscious, she gave him all her activities,
      without calculation or reserve. She was ready to play for him all day and
      every day, just as from the first she had held herself at the disposal of
      his passion. To fail him in these ways would have tarnished her opinion of
      herself. But she had some free hours in the morning, for he had the habit
      of lying in bed till eleven, and was never ready for practise before
      twelve. In those early hours she got through her orders and her shopping&mdash;that
      pursuit which to so many women is the only real &ldquo;sport&rdquo;&mdash;a chase of
      the ideal; a pitting of one's taste and knowledge against that of the
      world at large; a secret passion, even in the beautiful, for making
      oneself and one's house more beautiful. Gyp never went shopping without
      that faint thrill running up and down her nerves. She hated to be touched
      by strange fingers, but not even that stopped her pleasure in turning and
      turning before long mirrors, while the saleswoman or man, with admiration
      at first crocodilic and then genuine, ran the tips of fingers over those
      curves, smoothing and pinning, and uttering the word, &ldquo;moddam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On other mornings, she would ride with Winton, who would come for her,
      leaving her again at her door after their outings. One day, after a ride
      in Richmond Park, where the horse-chestnuts were just coming into flower,
      they had late breakfast on the veranda of a hotel before starting for
      home. Some fruit-trees were still in blossom just below them, and the
      sunlight showering down from a blue sky brightened to silver the windings
      of the river, and to gold the budding leaves of the oak-trees. Winton,
      smoking his after-breakfast cigar, stared down across the tops of those
      trees toward the river and the wooded fields beyond. Stealing a glance at
      him, Gyp said very softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever ride with my mother, Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only once&mdash;the very ride we've been to-day. She was on a black mare;
      I had a chestnut&mdash;&rdquo; Yes, in that grove on the little hill, which they
      had ridden through that morning, he had dismounted and stood beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp stretched her hand across the table and laid it on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about her, dear. Was she beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dark? Tall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very like you, Gyp. A little&mdash;a little&rdquo;&mdash;he did not know how to
      describe that difference&mdash;&ldquo;a little more foreign-looking perhaps. One
      of her grandmothers was Italian, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come to love her? Suddenly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As suddenly as&rdquo;&mdash;he drew his hand away and laid it on the veranda
      rail&mdash;&ldquo;as that sun came on my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said quietly, as if to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I don't think I understand that&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton drew breath through his teeth with a subdued hiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she love you at first sight, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blew out a long puff of smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One easily believes what one wants to&mdash;but I think she did. She used
      to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said very softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor darling Dad.&rdquo; And suddenly she added: &ldquo;I can't bear to think I
      killed her&mdash;I can't bear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton got up in the discomfort of these sudden confidences; a blackbird,
      startled by the movement, ceased his song. Gyp said in a hard voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don't want to have any children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without that, I shouldn't have had you, Gyp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but I don't want to have them. And I don't&mdash;I don't want to love
      like that. I should be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton looked at her for a long time without speaking, his brows drawn
      down, frowning, puzzled, as though over his own past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it catches you, and you're gone. When it comes, you
      welcome it, whether it's to kill you or not. Shall we start back, my
      child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she got home, it was not quite noon. She hurried over her bath and
      dressing, and ran out to the music-room. Its walls had been hung with
      Willesden scrim gilded over; the curtains were silver-grey; there was a
      divan covered with silver-and-gold stuff, and a beaten brass fireplace. It
      was a study in silver, and gold, save for two touches of fantasy&mdash;a
      screen round the piano-head, covered with brilliantly painted peacocks'
      tails, and a blue Persian vase, in which were flowers of various hues of
      red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen was standing at the window in a fume of cigarette smoke. He did
      not turn round. Gyp put her hand within his arm, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So sorry, dear. But it's only just half-past twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was as if the whole world had injured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pity you came back! Very nice, riding, I'm sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Could she not go riding with her own father? What insensate jealousy and
      egomania! She turned away, without a word, and sat down at the piano. She
      was not good at standing injustice&mdash;not good at all! The scent of
      brandy, too, was mixed with the fumes of his cigarette. Drink in the
      morning was so ugly&mdash;really horrid! She sat at the piano, waiting. He
      would be like this till he had played away the fumes of his ill mood, and
      then he would come and paw her shoulders and put his lips to her neck.
      Yes; but it was not the way to behave, not the way to make her love him.
      And she said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gustav; what exactly have I done that you dislike?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp sat quite still for a few seconds, and then began to laugh. He looked
      so like a sulky child, standing there. He turned swiftly on her and put
      his hand over her mouth. She looked up over that hand which smelled of
      tobacco. Her heart was doing the grand ecart within her, this way in
      compunction, that way in resentment. His eyes fell before hers; he dropped
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, shall we begin?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered roughly: &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and went out into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp was left dismayed, disgusted. Was it possible that she could have
      taken part in such a horrid little scene? She remained sitting at the
      piano, playing over and over a single passage, without heeding what it
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, they had seen nothing of Rosek at the little house. She wondered
      if Fiorsen had passed on to him her remark, though if he had, he would
      surely say he hadn't; she had learned that her husband spoke the truth
      when convenient, not when it caused him pain. About music, or any art,
      however, he could be implicitly relied on; and his frankness was appalling
      when his nerves were ruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the first concert she saw Rosek's unwelcome figure on the other
      side of the gangway, two rows back. He was talking to a young girl, whose
      face, short and beautifully formed, had the opaque transparency of
      alabaster. With her round blue eyes fixed on him, and her lips just
      parted, she had a slightly vacant look. Her laugh, too, was just a little
      vacant. And yet her features were so beautiful, her hair so smooth and
      fair, her colouring so pale and fine, her neck so white and round, the
      poise of her body so perfect that Gyp found it difficult to take her
      glance away. She had refused her aunt's companionship. It might irritate
      Fiorsen and affect his playing to see her with &ldquo;that stiff English
      creature.&rdquo; She wanted, too, to feel again the sensations of Wiesbaden.
      There would be a kind of sacred pleasure in knowing that she had helped to
      perfect sounds which touched the hearts and senses of so many listeners.
      She had looked forward to this concert so long. And she sat scarcely
      breathing, abstracted from consciousness of those about her, soft and
      still, radiating warmth and eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen looked his worst, as ever, when first coming before an audience&mdash;cold,
      furtive, defensive, defiant, half turned away, with those long fingers
      tightening the screws, touching the strings. It seemed queer to think that
      only six hours ago she had stolen out of bed from beside him. Wiesbaden!
      No; this was not like Wiesbaden! And when he played she had not the same
      emotions. She had heard him now too often, knew too exactly how he
      produced those sounds; knew that their fire and sweetness and nobility
      sprang from fingers, ear, brain&mdash;not from his soul. Nor was it
      possible any longer to drift off on those currents of sound into new
      worlds, to hear bells at dawn, and the dews of evening as they fell, to
      feel the divinity of wind and sunlight. The romance and ecstasy that at
      Wiesbaden had soaked her spirit came no more. She was watching for the
      weak spots, the passages with which he had struggled and she had
      struggled; she was distracted by memories of petulance, black moods, and
      sudden caresses. And then she caught his eye. The look was like, yet how
      unlike, those looks at Wiesbaden. It had the old love-hunger, but had lost
      the adoration, its spiritual essence. And she thought: 'Is it my fault, or
      is it only because he has me now to do what he likes with?' It was all
      another disillusionment, perhaps the greatest yet. But she kindled and
      flushed at the applause, and lost herself in pleasure at his success. At
      the interval, she slipped out at once, for her first visit to the artist's
      room, the mysterious enchantment of a peep behind the scenes. He was
      coming down from his last recall; and at sight of her his look of bored
      contempt vanished; lifting her hand, he kissed it. Gyp felt happier than
      she had since her marriage. Her eyes shone, and she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He whispered back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! Do you love me, Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. And at that moment she did, or thought so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then people began to come; amongst them her old music-master, Monsieur
      Harmost, grey and mahogany as ever, who, after a &ldquo;Merveilleux,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tres
      fort&rdquo; or two to Fiorsen, turned his back on him to talk to his old pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she had married Fiorsen&mdash;dear, dear! That was extraordinary, but
      extraordinary! And what was it like, to be always with him&mdash;a little
      funny&mdash;not so? And how was her music? It would be spoiled now. Ah,
      what a pity! No? She must come to him, then; yes, come again. All the time
      he patted her arm, as if playing the piano, and his fingers, that had the
      touch of an angel, felt the firmness of her flesh, as though debating
      whether she were letting it deteriorate. He seemed really to have missed
      &ldquo;his little friend,&rdquo; to be glad at seeing her again; and Gyp, who never
      could withstand appreciation, smiled at him. More people came. She saw
      Rosek talking to her husband, and the young alabaster girl standing
      silent, her lips still a little parted, gazing up at Fiorsen. A perfect
      figure, though rather short; a dovelike face, whose exquisitely shaped,
      just-opened lips seemed to be demanding sugar-plums. She could not be more
      than nineteen. Who was she?
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice said almost in her ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mrs. Fiorsen? I am fortunate to see you again at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was obliged to turn. If Gustav had given her away, one would never
      know it from this velvet-masked creature, with his suave watchfulness and
      ready composure, who talked away so smoothly. What was it that she so
      disliked in him? Gyp had acute instincts, the natural intelligence deep in
      certain natures not over intellectual, but whose &ldquo;feelers&rdquo; are too
      delicate to be deceived. And, for something to say, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the girl you were talking to, Count Rosek? Her face is so lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, exactly the smile she had so disliked at Wiesbaden; following
      his glance, she saw her husband talking to the girl, whose lips at that
      moment seemed more than ever to ask for sugar-plums.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A young dancer, Daphne Wing&mdash;she will make a name. A dove flying! So
      you admire her, Madame Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said, smiling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's very pretty&mdash;I can imagine her dancing beautifully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come one day and see her? She has still to make her debut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I don't know. I love dancing, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! I will arrange it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gyp thought: &ldquo;No, no! I don't want to have anything to do with you!
      Why do I not speak the truth? Why didn't I say I hate dancing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a bell sounded; people began hurrying away. The girl came up to
      Rosek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Daphne Wing&mdash;Mrs. Fiorsen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp put out her hand with a smile&mdash;this girl was certainly a picture.
      Miss Daphne Wing smiled, too, and said, with the intonation of those who
      have been carefully corrected of an accent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, how beautifully your husband plays&mdash;doesn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not merely the careful speech but something lacking when the
      perfect mouth moved&mdash;spirit, sensibility, who could say? And Gyp felt
      sorry, as at blight on a perfect flower. With a friendly nod, she turned
      away to Fiorsen, who was waiting to go up on to the platform. Was it at
      her or at the girl he had been looking? She smiled at him and slid away.
      In the corridor, Rosek, in attendance, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not this evening? Come with Gustav to my rooms. She shall dance to
      us, and we will all have supper. She admires you, Madame Gyp. She will
      love to dance for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp longed for the simple brutality to say: &ldquo;I don't want to come. I don't
      like you!&rdquo; But all she could manage was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I&mdash;I will ask Gustav.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once in her seat again, she rubbed the cheek that his breath had touched.
      A girl was singing now&mdash;one of those faces that Gyp always admired,
      reddish-gold hair, blue eyes&mdash;the very antithesis of herself&mdash;and
      the song was &ldquo;The Bens of Jura,&rdquo; that strange outpouring from a heart
      broken by love:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And my heart reft of its own sun&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Tears rose in her eyes, and the shiver of some very deep response passed
      through her. What was it Dad had said: &ldquo;Love catches you, and you're
      gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She, who was the result of love like that, did not want to love!
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl finished singing. There was little applause. Yet she had sung
      beautifully; and what more wonderful song in the world? Was it too tragic,
      too painful, too strange&mdash;not &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; enough? Gyp felt sorry for
      her. Her head ached now. She would so have liked to slip away when it was
      all over. But she had not the needful rudeness. She would have to go
      through with this evening at Rosek's and be gay. And why not? Why this
      shadow over everything? But it was no new sensation, that of having
      entered by her own free will on a life which, for all effort, would not
      give her a feeling of anchorage or home. Of her own accord she had stepped
      into the cage!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way to Rosek's rooms, she disguised from Fiorsen her headache and
      depression. He was in one of his boy-out-of-school moods, elated by
      applause, mimicking her old master, the idolatries of his worshippers,
      Rosek, the girl dancer's upturned expectant lips. And he slipped his arm
      round Gyp in the cab, crushing her against him and sniffing at her cheek
      as if she had been a flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosek had the first floor of an old-time mansion in Russell Square. The
      smell of incense or some kindred perfume was at once about one; and, on
      the walls of the dark hall, electric light burned, in jars of alabaster
      picked up in the East. The whole place was in fact a sanctum of the
      collector's spirit. Its owner had a passion for black&mdash;the walls,
      divans, picture-frames, even some of the tilings were black, with
      glimmerings of gold, ivory, and moonlight. On a round black table there
      stood a golden bowl filled with moonlight-coloured velvety &ldquo;palm&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;honesty&rdquo;; from a black wall gleamed out the ivory mask of a faun's face;
      from a dark niche the little silver figure of a dancing girl. It was
      beautiful, but deathly. And Gyp, though excited always by anything new,
      keenly alive to every sort of beauty, felt a longing for air and sunlight.
      It was a relief to get close to one of the black-curtained windows, and
      see the westering sun shower warmth and light on the trees of the Square
      gardens. She was introduced to a Mr. and Mrs. Gallant, a dark-faced, cynical-looking
      man with clever, malicious eyes, and one of those large cornucopias of
      women with avid blue stares. The little dancer was not there. She had
      &ldquo;gone to put on nothing,&rdquo; Rosek informed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took Gyp the round of his treasures, scarabs, Rops drawings,
      death-masks, Chinese pictures, and queer old flutes, with an air of
      displaying them for the first time to one who could truly appreciate. And
      she kept thinking of that saying, &ldquo;Une technique merveilleuse.&rdquo; Her
      instinct apprehended the refined bone-viciousness of this place, where
      nothing, save perhaps taste, would be sacred. It was her first glimpse
      into that gilt-edged bohemia, whence the generosities, the elans, the
      struggles of the true bohemia are as rigidly excluded as from the spheres
      where bishops moved. But she talked and smiled; and no one could have told
      that her nerves were crisping as if at contact with a corpse. While
      showing her those alabaster jars, her host had laid his hand softly on her
      wrist, and in taking it away, he let his fingers, with a touch softer than
      a kitten's paw, ripple over the skin, then put them to his lips. Ah, there
      it was&mdash;the&mdash;the TECHNIQUE! A desperate desire to laugh seized
      her. And he saw it&mdash;oh, yes, he saw it! He gave her one look, passed
      that same hand over his smooth face, and&mdash;behold!&mdash;it showed as
      before, unmortified, unconscious. A deadly little man!
    </p>
    <p>
      When they returned to the salon, as it was called, Miss Daphne Wing in a
      black kimono, whence her face and arms emerged more like alabaster than
      ever, was sitting on a divan beside Fiorsen. She rose at once and came
      across to Gyp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen&rdquo;&mdash;why did everything she said begin with &ldquo;Oh&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;isn't
      this room lovely? It's perfect for dancing. I only brought cream, and
      flame-colour; they go so beautifully with black.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw back her kimono for Gyp to inspect her dress&mdash;a girdled
      cream-coloured shift, which made her ivory arms and neck seem more than
      ever dazzling; and her mouth opened, as if for a sugar-plum of praise.
      Then, lowering her voice, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I'm rather afraid of Count Rosek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know; he's so critical, and smooth, and he comes up so
      quietly. I do think your husband plays wonderfully. Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, you
      are beautiful, aren't you?&rdquo; Gyp laughed. &ldquo;What would you like me to dance
      first? A waltz of Chopin's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I love Chopin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall. I shall dance exactly what you like, because I do admire
      you, and I'm sure you're awfully sweet. Oh, yes; you are; I can see that!
      And I think your husband's awfully in love with you. I should be, if I
      were a man. You know, I've been studying five years, and I haven't come
      out yet. But now Count Rosek's going to back me, I expect it'll be very
      soon. Will you come to my first night? Mother says I've got to be awfully
      careful. She only let me come this evening because you were going to be
      here. Would you like me to begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slid across to Rosek, and Gyp heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen wants me to begin; a Chopin waltz, please. The one that
      goes like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosek went to the piano, the little dancer to the centre of the room. Gyp
      sat down beside Fiorsen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosek began playing, his eyes fixed on the girl, and his mouth loosened
      from compression in a sweetish smile. Miss Daphne Wing was standing with
      her finger-tips joined at her breast&mdash;a perfect statue of ebony and
      palest wax. Suddenly she flung away the black kimono. A thrill swept Gyp
      from head to foot. She COULD dance&mdash;that common little girl! Every
      movement of her round, sinuous body, of her bare limbs, had the ecstasy of
      natural genius, controlled by the quivering balance of a really fine
      training. &ldquo;A dove flying!&rdquo; So she was. Her face had lost its vacancy, or
      rather its vacancy had become divine, having that look&mdash;not lost but
      gone before&mdash;which dance demands. Yes, she was a gem, even if she had
      a common soul. Tears came up in Gyp's eyes. It was so lovely&mdash;like a
      dove, when it flings itself up in the wind, breasting on up, up&mdash;wings
      bent back, poised. Abandonment, freedom&mdash;chastened, shaped,
      controlled!
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after the dance, the girl came and sat down beside her, she squeezed
      her hot little hand, but the caress was for her art, not for this moist
      little person with the lips avid of sugar-plums.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did you like it? I'm so glad. Shall I go and put on my flame-colour,
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment she was gone, comment broke out freely. The dark and cynical
      Gallant thought the girl's dancing like a certain Napierkowska whom he had
      seen in Moscow, without her fire&mdash;the touch of passion would have to
      be supplied. She wanted love! Love! And suddenly Gyp was back in the
      concert-hall, listening to that other girl singing the song of a broken
      heart.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Thy kiss, dear love&mdash;
     Like watercress gathered fresh from cool streams.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Love! in this abode&mdash;of fauns' heads, deep cushions, silver dancing
      girls! Love! She had a sudden sense of deep abasement. What was she,
      herself, but just a feast for a man's senses? Her home, what but a place
      like this? Miss Daphne Wing was back again. Gyp looked at her husband's
      face while she was dancing. His lips! How was it that she could see that
      disturbance in him, and not care? If she had really loved him, to see his
      lips like that would have hurt her, but she might have understood perhaps,
      and forgiven. Now she neither quite understood nor quite forgave.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that night, when he kissed her, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you rather it were that girl&mdash;not me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl! I could swallow her at a draft. But you, my Gyp&mdash;I want
      to drink for ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was that true? IF she had loved him&mdash;how good to hear!
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, Gyp was daily more and more in contact with high bohemia, that
      curious composite section of society which embraces the neck of music,
      poetry, and the drama. She was a success, but secretly she felt that she
      did not belong to it, nor, in truth, did Fiorsen, who was much too genuine
      a bohemian, and artist, and mocked at the Gallants and even the Roseks of
      this life, as he mocked at Winton, Aunt Rosamund, and their world. Life
      with him had certainly one effect on Gyp; it made her feel less and less a
      part of that old orthodox, well-bred world which she had known before she
      married him; but to which she had confessed to Winton she had never felt
      that she belonged, since she knew the secret of her birth. She was, in
      truth, much too impressionable, too avid of beauty, and perhaps too
      naturally critical to accept the dictates of their fact-and-form-governed
      routine; only, of her own accord, she would never have had initiative
      enough to step out of its circle. Loosened from those roots, unable to
      attach herself to this new soil, and not spiritually leagued with her
      husband, she was more and more lonely. Her only truly happy hours were
      those spent with Winton or at her piano or with her puppies. She was
      always wondering at what she had done, longing to find the deep, the
      sufficient reason for having done it. But the more she sought and longed,
      the deeper grew her bewilderment, her feeling of being in a cage. Of late,
      too, another and more definite uneasiness had come to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spent much time in her garden, where the blossoms had all dropped,
      lilac was over, acacias coming into bloom, and blackbirds silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton, who, by careful experiment, had found that from half-past three to
      six there was little or no chance of stumbling across his son-in-law, came
      in nearly every day for tea and a quiet cigar on the lawn. He was sitting
      there with Gyp one afternoon, when Betty, who usurped the functions of
      parlour-maid whenever the whim moved her, brought out a card on which were
      printed the words, &ldquo;Miss Daphne Wing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring her out, please, Betty dear, and some fresh tea, and buttered toast&mdash;plenty
      of buttered toast; yes, and the chocolates, and any other sweets there
      are, Betty darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty, with that expression which always came over her when she was called
      &ldquo;darling,&rdquo; withdrew across the grass, and Gyp said to her father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the little dancer I told you of, Dad. Now you'll see something
      perfect. Only, she'll be dressed. It's a pity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was. The occasion had evidently exercised her spirit. In warm ivory,
      shrouded by leaf-green chiffon, with a girdle of tiny artificial leaves,
      and a lightly covered head encircled by other green leaves, she was
      somewhat like a nymph peering from a bower. If rather too arresting, it
      was charming, and, after all, no frock could quite disguise the beauty of
      her figure. She was evidently nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I thought you wouldn't mind my coming. I did so want to
      see you again. Count Rosek said he thought I might. It's all fixed for my
      coming-out. Oh, how do you do?&rdquo; And with lips and eyes opening at Winton,
      she sat down in the chair he placed for her. Gyp, watching his expression,
      felt inclined to laugh. Dad, and Daphne Wing! And the poor girl so
      evidently anxious to make a good impression! Presently she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been dancing at Count Rosek's again lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, haven't you&mdash;didn't you&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; And she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought flashed through Gyp, 'So Gustav's been seeing her, and hasn't
      told me!' But she said at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, of course; I forgot. When is the night of your coming-out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next Friday week. Fancy! The Octagon. Isn't it splendid? They've given me
      such a good engagement. I do so want you and Mr. Fiorsen to come, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp, smiling, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we will. My father loves dancing, too; don't you, Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton took his cigar from his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it's good,&rdquo; he said, urbanely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mine IS good; isn't it, Mrs. Fiorsen? I mean, I HAVE worked&mdash;ever
      since I was thirteen, you know. I simply love it. I think YOU would dance
      beautifully, Mrs. Fiorsen. You've got such a perfect figure. I simply love
      to see you walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp flushed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do have one of these, Miss Wing&mdash;they've got whole raspberries
      inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little dancer put one in her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but please don't call me Miss Wing! I wish you'd call me Daphne. Mr.
      Fior&mdash;everybody does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conscious of her father's face, Gyp murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a lovely name. Won't you have another? These are apricot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're perfect. You know, my first dress is going to be all
      orange-blossom; Mr. Fiorsen suggested that. But I expect he told you.
      Perhaps you suggested it really; did you?&rdquo; Gyp shook her head. &ldquo;Count
      Rosek says the world is waiting for me&mdash;&rdquo; She paused with a
      sugar-plum halfway to her lips, and added doubtfully: &ldquo;Do you think that's
      true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp answered with a soft: &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says I'm something new. It would be nice to think that. He has great
      taste; so has Mr. Fiorsen, hasn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conscious of the compression in the lips behind the smoke of her father's
      cigar, and with a sudden longing to get up and walk away, Gyp nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little dancer placed the sweet in her mouth, and said complacently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he has; because he married you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, seeming to grow conscious of Winton's eyes fixed so intently on her,
      she became confused, swallowed hastily, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, isn't it lovely here&mdash;like the country! I'm afraid I must go;
      it's my practice-time. It's so important for me not to miss any now, isn't
      it?&rdquo; And she rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton got up, too. Gyp saw the girl's eyes, lighting on his rigid hand,
      grow round and rounder; and from her, walking past the side of the house,
      the careful voice floated back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I do hope&mdash;&rdquo; But what, could not be heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sinking back in her chair, Gyp sat motionless. Bees were murmurous among
      her flowers, pigeons murmurous among the trees; the sunlight warmed her
      knees, and her stretched-out feet through the openwork of her stockings.
      The maid's laughter, the delicious growling of the puppies at play in the
      kitchen came drifting down the garden, with the distant cry of a milkman
      up the road. All was very peaceful. But in her heart were such curious,
      baffled emotions, such strange, tangled feelings. This moment of
      enlightenment regarding the measure of her husband's frankness came close
      on the heels of the moment fate had chosen for another revelation, for
      clinching within her a fear felt for weeks past. She had said to Winton
      that she did not want to have a child. In those conscious that their birth
      has caused death or even too great suffering, there is sometimes this
      hostile instinct. She had not even the consolation that Fiorsen wanted
      children; she knew that he did not. And now she was sure one was coming.
      But it was more than that. She had not reached, and knew she could not
      reach, that point of spirit-union which alone makes marriage sacred, and
      the sacrifices demanded by motherhood a joy. She was fairly caught in the
      web of her foolish and presumptuous mistake! So few months of marriage&mdash;and
      so sure that it was a failure, so hopeless for the future! In the light of
      this new certainty, it was terrifying. A hard, natural fact is needed to
      bring a yearning and bewildered spirit to knowledge of the truth.
      Disillusionment is not welcome to a woman's heart; the less welcome when
      it is disillusionment with self as much as with another. Her great
      dedication&mdash;her scheme of life! She had been going to&mdash;what?&mdash;save
      Fiorsen from himself! It was laughable. She had only lost herself. Already
      she felt in prison, and by a child would be all the more bound. To some
      women, the knowledge that a thing must be brings assuagement of the
      nerves. Gyp was the opposite of those. To force her was the way to stiver
      up every contrary emotion. She might will herself to acquiesce, but&mdash;one
      cannot change one's nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, while the pigeons cooed and the sunlight warmed her feet, she
      spent the bitterest moments of her life&mdash;so far. Pride came to her
      help. She had made a miserable mess of it, but no one must know&mdash;certainly
      not her father, who had warned her so desperately! She had made her bed,
      and she would have to lie on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Winton came back, he found her smiling, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see the fascination, Gyp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think her face really rather perfect?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but that drops off when she's dancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton looked at her from under half-closed eyelids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With her clothes? What does Fiorsen think of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he think of her? I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could feel the watchful tightening of his face. And suddenly he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daphne Wing! By George!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were a masterpiece of resentment and distrust. His daughter in
      peril from&mdash;such as that!
    </p>
    <p>
      After he was gone Gyp sat on till the sun had quite vanished and the dew
      was stealing through her thin frock. She would think of anything, anybody
      except herself! To make others happy was the way to be happy&mdash;or so
      they said. She would try&mdash;must try. Betty&mdash;so stout, and with
      that rheumatism in her leg&mdash;did she ever think of herself? Or Aunt
      Rosamund, with her perpetual rescuings of lost dogs, lame horses, and
      penniless musicians? And Dad, for all his man-of-the-world ways, was he
      not always doing little things for the men of his old regiment, always
      thinking of her, too, and what he could do to give her pleasure? To love
      everybody, and bring them happiness! Was it not possible? Only, people
      were hard to love, different from birds and beasts and flowers, to love
      which seemed natural and easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up to her room and began to dress for dinner. Which of her frocks
      did he like best? The pale, low-cut amber, or that white, soft one, with
      the coffee-dipped lace? She decided on the latter. Scrutinizing her
      supple, slender image in the glass, a shudder went through her. That would
      all go; she would be like those women taking careful exercise in the
      streets, who made her wonder at their hardihood in showing themselves. It
      wasn't fair that one must become unsightly, offensive to the eye, in order
      to bring life into the world. Some women seemed proud to be like that. How
      was that possible? She would never dare to show herself in the days
      coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      She finished dressing and went downstairs. It was nearly eight, and
      Fiorsen had not come in. When the gong was struck, she turned from the
      window with a sigh, and went in to dinner. That sigh had been relief. She
      ate her dinner with the two pups beside her, sent them off, and sat down
      at her piano. She played Chopin&mdash;studies, waltzes, mazurkas,
      preludes, a polonaise or two. And Betty, who had a weakness for that
      composer, sat on a chair by the door which partitioned off the back
      premises, having opened it a little. She wished she could go and take a
      peep at her &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; in her white frock, with the candle-flames on each
      side, and those lovely lilies in the vase close by, smelling beautiful.
      And one of the maids coming too near, she shooed her angrily away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew late. The tray had been brought up; the maids had gone to bed. Gyp
      had long stopped playing, had turned out, ready to go up, and, by the
      French window, stood gazing out into the dark. How warm it was&mdash;warm
      enough to draw forth the scent of the jessamine along the garden wall! Not
      a star. There always seemed so few stars in London. A sound made her swing
      round. Something tall was over there in the darkness, by the open door.
      She heard a sigh, and called out, frightened:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Gustav?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke some words that she could not understand. Shutting the window
      quickly, she went toward him. Light from the hall lit up one side of his
      face and figure. He was pale; his eyes shone strangely; his sleeve was all
      white. He said thickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little ghost!&rdquo; and then some words that must be Swedish. It was the first
      time Gyp had ever come to close quarters with drunkenness. And her thought
      was simply: 'How awful if anybody were to see&mdash;how awful!' She made a
      rush to get into the hall and lock the door leading to the back regions,
      but he caught her frock, ripping the lace from her neck, and his entangled
      fingers clutched her shoulder. She stopped dead, fearing to make a noise
      or pull him over, and his other hand clutched her other shoulder, so that
      he stood steadying himself by her. Why was she not shocked, smitten to the
      ground with grief and shame and rage? She only felt: &ldquo;What am I to do? How
      get him upstairs without anyone knowing?&rdquo; And she looked up into his face&mdash;it
      seemed to her so pathetic with its shining eyes and its staring whiteness
      that she could have burst into tears. She said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gustav, it's all right. Lean on me; we'll go up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hands, that seemed to have no power or purpose, touched her cheeks,
      mechanically caressing. More than disgust, she felt that awful pity.
      Putting her arm round his waist, she moved with him toward the stairs. If
      only no one heard; if only she could get him quietly up! And she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk; you're not well. Lean on me hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to make a big effort; his lips puffed out, and with an
      expression of pride that would have been comic if not so tragic, he
      muttered something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding him close with all her strength, as she might have held one
      desperately loved, she began to mount. It was easier than she had thought.
      Only across the landing now, into the bedroom, and then the danger would
      be over. Done! He was lying across the bed, and the door shut. Then, for a
      moment, she gave way to a fit of shivering so violent that she could hear
      her teeth chattering yet could not stop them. She caught sight of herself
      in the big mirror. Her pretty lace was all torn; her shoulders were red
      where his hands had gripped her, holding himself up. She threw off her
      dress, put on a wrapper, and went up to him. He was lying in a sort of
      stupor, and with difficulty she got him to sit up and lean against the
      bed-rail. Taking off his tie and collar, she racked her brains for what to
      give him. Sal volatile! Surely that must be right. It brought him to
      himself, so that he even tried to kiss her. At last he was in bed, and she
      stood looking at him. His eyes were closed; he would not see if she gave
      way now. But she would not cry&mdash;she would not. One sob came&mdash;but
      that was all. Well, there was nothing to be done now but get into bed too.
      She undressed, and turned out the light. He was in a stertorous sleep. And
      lying there, with eyes wide open, staring into the dark, a smile came on
      her lips&mdash;a very strange smile! She was thinking of all those
      preposterous young wives she had read of, who, blushing, trembling, murmur
      into the ears of their young husbands that they &ldquo;have something&mdash;something
      to tell them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at Fiorsen, next morning, still sunk in heavy sleep, her first
      thought was: 'He looks exactly the same.' And, suddenly, it seemed queer
      to her that she had not been, and still was not, disgusted. It was all too
      deep for disgust, and somehow, too natural. She took this new revelation
      of his unbridled ways without resentment. Besides, she had long known of
      this taste of his&mdash;one cannot drink brandy and not betray it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stole noiselessly from bed, noiselessly gathered up his boots and
      clothes all tumbled on to a chair, and took them forth to the
      dressing-room. There she held the garments up to the early light and
      brushed them, then, noiseless, stole back to bed, with needle and thread
      and her lace. No one must know; not even he must know. For the moment she
      had forgotten that other thing so terrifically important. It came back to
      her, very sudden, very sickening. So long as she could keep it secret, no
      one should know that either&mdash;he least of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning passed as usual; but when she came to the music-room at noon,
      she found that he had gone out. She was just sitting down to lunch when
      Betty, with the broad smile which prevailed on her moon-face when someone
      had tickled the right side of her, announced:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count Rosek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp got up, startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say that Mr. Fiorsen is not in, Betty. But&mdash;but ask if he will come
      and have some lunch, and get a bottle of hock up, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the few seconds before her visitor appeared, Gyp experienced the sort
      of excitement one has entering a field where a bull is grazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not even his severest critics could accuse Rosek of want of tact. He
      had hoped to see Gustav, but it was charming of her to give him lunch&mdash;a
      great delight!
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have put off, as if for her benefit, his corsets, and some,
      at all events, of his offending looks&mdash;seemed simpler, more genuine.
      His face was slightly browned, as if, for once, he had been taking his due
      of air and sun. He talked without cynical submeanings, was most
      appreciative of her &ldquo;charming little house,&rdquo; and even showed some warmth
      in his sayings about art and music. Gyp had never disliked him less. But
      her instincts were on the watch. After lunch, they went out across the
      garden to see the music-room, and he sat down at the piano. He had the
      deep, caressing touch that lies in fingers of steel worked by a real
      passion for tone. Gyp sat on the divan and listened. She was out of his
      sight there; and she looked at him, wondering. He was playing Schumann's
      Child Music. How could one who produced such fresh idyllic sounds have
      sinister intentions? And presently she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count Rosek!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you please tell me why you sent Daphne Wing here yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I send her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But instantly she regretted having asked that question. He had swung round
      on the music-stool and was looking full at her. His face had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you ask me, I thought you should know that Gustav is seeing a good
      deal of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had given the exact answer she had divined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I mind that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flicker passed over his face. He got up and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad that you do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She, too, had risen. Though he was little taller than herself, she was
      conscious suddenly of how thick and steely he was beneath his dapper
      garments, and of a kind of snaky will-power in his face. Her heart beat
      faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came toward her and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you understand that it is over with Gustav&mdash;finished&mdash;&rdquo;
       He stopped dead, seeing at once that he had gone wrong, and not knowing
      quite where. Gyp had simply smiled. A flush coloured his cheeks, and he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a volcano soon extinguished. You see, I know him. Better you should
      know him, too. Why do you smile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it better I should know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went very pale, and said between his teeth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you may not waste your time; there is love waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gyp still smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it from love of me that you made him drunk last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His lips quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp!&rdquo; Gyp turned. But with the merest change of front, he had put himself
      between her and the door. &ldquo;You never loved him. That is my excuse. You
      have given him too much already&mdash;more than he is worth. Ah! God! I am
      tortured by you; I am possessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had gone white through and through like a flame, save for his
      smouldering eyes. She was afraid, and because she was afraid, she stood
      her ground. Should she make a dash for the door that opened into the
      little lane and escape that way? Then suddenly he seemed to regain
      control; but she could feel that he was trying to break through her
      defences by the sheer intensity of his gaze&mdash;by a kind of mesmerism,
      knowing that he had frightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the strain of this duel of eyes, she felt herself beginning to sway,
      to get dizzy. Whether or no he really moved his feet, he seemed coming
      closer inch by inch. She had a horrible feeling&mdash;as if his arms were
      already round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort, she wrenched her gaze from his, and suddenly his crisp
      hair caught her eyes. Surely&mdash;surely it was curled with tongs! A kind
      of spasm of amusement was set free in her heart, and, almost inaudibly,
      the words escaped her lips: &ldquo;Une technique merveilleuse!&rdquo; His eyes
      wavered; he uttered a little gasp; his lips fell apart. Gyp walked across
      the room and put her hand on the bell. She had lost her fear. Without a
      word, he turned, and went out into the garden. She watched him cross the
      lawn. Gone! She had beaten him by the one thing not even violent passions
      can withstand&mdash;ridicule, almost unconscious ridicule. Then she gave
      way and pulled the bell with nervous violence. The sight of the maid, in
      her trim black dress and spotless white apron, coming from the house
      completed her restoration. Was it possible that she had really been
      frightened, nearly failing in that encounter, nearly dominated by that man&mdash;in
      her own house, with her own maids down there at hand? And she said
      quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want the puppies, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over the garden, the day brooded in the first-gathered warmth of summer.
      Mid-June of a fine year. The air was drowsy with hum and scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gyp, sitting in the shade, while the puppies rolled and snapped,
      searched her little world for comfort and some sense of safety, and could
      not find it; as if there were all round her a hot heavy fog in which
      things lurked, and where she kept erect only by pride and the will not to
      cry out that she was struggling and afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen, leaving his house that morning, had walked till he saw a
      taxi-cab. Leaning back therein, with hat thrown off, he caused himself to
      be driven rapidly, at random. This was one of his habits when his mind was
      not at ease&mdash;an expensive idiosyncrasy, ill-afforded by a pocket that
      had holes. The swift motion and titillation by the perpetual close shaving
      of other vehicles were sedative to him. He needed sedatives this morning.
      To wake in his own bed without the least remembering how he had got there
      was no more new to him than to many another man of twenty-eight, but it
      was new since his marriage. If he had remembered even less he would have
      been more at ease. But he could just recollect standing in the dark
      drawing-room, seeing and touching a ghostly Gyp quite close to him. And,
      somehow, he was afraid. And when he was afraid&mdash;like most people&mdash;he
      was at his worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had been like all the other women in whose company he had eaten
      passion-fruit, he would not have felt this carking humiliation. If she had
      been like them, at the pace he had been going since he obtained possession
      of her, he would already have &ldquo;finished,&rdquo; as Rosek had said. And he knew
      well enough that he had not &ldquo;finished.&rdquo; He might get drunk, might be
      loose-ended in every way, but Gyp was hooked into his senses, and, for all
      that he could not get near her, into his spirit. Her very passivity was
      her strength, the secret of her magnetism. In her, he felt some of that
      mysterious sentiency of nature, which, even in yielding to man's fevers,
      lies apart with a faint smile&mdash;the uncapturable smile of the woods
      and fields by day or night, that makes one ache with longing. He felt in
      her some of the unfathomable, soft, vibrating indifference of the flowers
      and trees and streams, of the rocks, of birdsongs, and the eternal hum,
      under sunshine or star-shine. Her dark, half-smiling eyes enticed him,
      inspired an unquenchable thirst. And his was one of those natures which,
      encountering spiritual difficulty, at once jib off, seek anodynes, try to
      bandage wounded egoism with excess&mdash;a spoiled child, with the
      desperations and the inherent pathos, the something repulsive and the
      something lovable that belong to all such. Having wished for this moon,
      and got her, he now did not know what to do with her, kept taking great
      bites at her, with a feeling all the time of getting further and further
      away. At moments, he desired revenge for his failure to get near her
      spiritually, and was ready to commit follies of all kinds. He was only
      kept in control at all by his work. For he did work hard; though, even
      there, something was lacking. He had all the qualities of making good,
      except the moral backbone holding them together, which alone could give
      him his rightful&mdash;as he thought&mdash;pre-eminence. It often
      surprised and vexed him to find that some contemporary held higher rank
      than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Threading the streets in his cab, he mused:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I do anything that really shocked her last night? Why didn't I wait
      for her this morning and find out the worst?&rdquo; And his lips twisted awry&mdash;for
      to find out the worst was not his forte. Meditation, seeking as usual a
      scapegoat, lighted on Rosek. Like most egoists addicted to women, he had
      not many friends. Rosek was the most constant. But even for him, Fiorsen
      had at once the contempt and fear that a man naturally uncontrolled and
      yet of greater scope has for one of less talent but stronger will-power.
      He had for him, too, the feeling of a wayward child for its nurse, mixed
      with the need that an artist, especially an executant artist, feels for a
      connoisseur and patron with well-lined pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Curse Paul!' he thought. 'He must know&mdash;he does know&mdash;that
      brandy of his goes down like water. Trust him, he saw I was getting silly!
      He had some game on. Where did I go after? How did I get home?' And again:
      'Did I hurt Gyp?' If the servants had seen&mdash;that would be the worst;
      that would upset her fearfully! And he laughed. Then he had a fresh access
      of fear. He didn't know her, never knew what she was thinking or feeling,
      never knew anything about her. And he thought angrily: 'That's not fair! I
      don't hide myself from her. I am as free as nature; I let her see
      everything. What did I do? That maid looked very queerly at me this
      morning!' And suddenly he said to the driver: &ldquo;Bury Street, St. James's.&rdquo;
       He could find out, at all events, whether Gyp had been to her father's.
      The thought of Winton ever afflicted him; and he changed his mind several
      times before the cab reached that little street, but so swiftly that he
      had not time to alter his instructions to the driver. A light sweat broke
      out on his forehead while he was waiting for the door to be opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Fiorsen here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not been here this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged away the thought that he ought to give some explanation of his
      question, and got into the cab again, telling the man to drive to Curzon
      Street. If she had not been to &ldquo;that Aunt Rosamund&rdquo; either it would be all
      right. She had not. There was no one else she would go to. And, with a
      sigh of relief, he began to feel hungry, having had no breakfast. He would
      go to Rosek's, borrow the money to pay his cab, and lunch there. But Rosek
      was not in. He would have to go home to get the cab paid. The driver
      seemed to eye him queerly now, as though conceiving doubts about the fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going in under the trellis, Fiorsen passed a man coming out, who held in
      his hand a long envelope and eyed him askance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp, who was sitting at her bureau, seemed to be adding up the
      counterfoils in her cheque-book. She did not turn round, and Fiorsen
      paused. How was she going to receive him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any lunch?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached out and rang the bell. He felt sorry for himself. He had been
      quite ready to take her in his arms and say: &ldquo;Forgive me, little Gyp; I'm
      sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty answered the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please bring up some lunch for Mr. Fiorsen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard the stout woman sniff as she went out. She was a part of his
      ostracism. And, with sudden rage, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want for a husband&mdash;a bourgeois who would die if he
      missed his lunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp turned round to him and held out her cheque-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't in the least mind about meals; but I do about this.&rdquo; He read on
      the counterfoil:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Messrs. Travers &amp; Sanborn, Tailors, Account rendered: L54 35s. 7d.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Are there many of these, Gustav?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen had turned the peculiar white that marked deep injury to his
      sell-esteem. He said violently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of that? A bill! Did you pay it? You have no business to pay
      my bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man said if it wasn't paid this time, he'd sue you.&rdquo; Her lips
      quivered. &ldquo;I think owing money is horrible. It's undignified. Are there
      many others? Please tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not tell you. What is it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a lot to me. I have to keep this house and pay the maids and
      everything, and I want to know how I stand. I am not going to make debts.
      That's hateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face had a hardness that he did not know. He perceived dimly that she
      was different from the Gyp of this hour yesterday&mdash;the last time
      when, in possession of his senses, he had seen or spoken to her. The
      novelty of her revolt stirred him in strange ways, wounded his
      self-conceit, inspired a curious fear, and yet excited his senses. He came
      up to her, said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money! Curse money! Kiss me!&rdquo; With a certain amazement at the sheer
      distaste in her face, he heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's childish to curse money. I will spend all the income I have; but I
      will not spend more, and I will not ask Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flung himself down in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! Ho! Virtue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said gloomily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you don't believe in me. You don't believe I can earn as much as I
      want&mdash;more than you have&mdash;any time? You never have believed in
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you earn now as much as you are ever likely to earn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what you think! I don't want money&mdash;your money! I can live
      on nothing, any time. I have done it&mdash;often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hssh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round and saw the maid in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, the driver says can he have his fare, or do you want him
      again? Twelve shillings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen stared at her a moment in the way that&mdash;as the maid often
      said&mdash;made you feel like a silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Pay him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl glanced at Gyp, answered: &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen laughed; he laughed, holding his sides. It was droll coming on the
      top of his assertion, too droll! And, looking up at her, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was good, wasn't it, Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her face had not abated its gravity; and, knowing that she was even
      more easily tickled by the incongruous than himself, he felt again that
      catch of fear. Something was different. Yes; something was really
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I hurt you last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders and went to the window. He looked at her
      darkly, jumped up, and swung out past her into the garden. And, almost at
      once, the sound of his violin, furiously played in the music-room, came
      across the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp listened with a bitter smile. Money, too! But what did it matter? She
      could not get out of what she had done. She could never get out. Tonight
      he would kiss her; and she would pretend it was all right. And so it would
      go on and on! Well, it was her own fault. Taking twelve shillings from her
      purse, she put them aside on the bureau to give the maid. And suddenly she
      thought: 'Perhaps he'll get tired of me. If only he would get tired!' That
      was a long way the furthest she had yet gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      VII
    </p>
    <p>
      They who have known the doldrums&mdash;how the sails of the listless ship
      droop, and the hope of escape dies day by day&mdash;may understand
      something of the life Gyp began living now. On a ship, even doldrums come
      to an end. But a young woman of twenty-three, who has made a mistake in
      her marriage, and has only herself to blame, looks forward to no end,
      unless she be the new woman, which Gyp was not. Having settled that she
      would not admit failure, and clenched her teeth on the knowledge that she
      was going to have a child, she went on keeping things sealed up even from
      Winton. To Fiorsen, she managed to behave as usual, making material life
      easy and pleasant for him&mdash;playing for him, feeding him well,
      indulging his amorousness. It did not matter; she loved no one else. To
      count herself a martyr would be silly! Her malaise, successfully
      concealed, was deeper&mdash;of the spirit; the subtle utter discouragement
      of one who has done for herself, clipped her own wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Rosek, she treated him as if that little scene had never taken
      place. The idea of appealing to her husband in a difficulty was gone for
      ever since the night he came home drunk. And she did not dare to tell her
      father. He would&mdash;what would he not do? But she was always on her
      guard, knowing that Rosek would not forgive her for that dart of ridicule.
      His insinuations about Daphne Wing she put out of mind, as she never could
      have if she had loved Fiorsen. She set up for herself the idol of pride,
      and became its faithful worshipper. Only Winton, and perhaps Betty, could
      tell she was not happy. Fiorsen's debts and irresponsibility about money
      did not worry her much, for she paid everything in the house&mdash;rent,
      wages, food, and her own dress&mdash;and had so far made ends meet; and
      what he did outside the house she could not help.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the summer wore on till concerts were over, and it was supposed to be
      impossible to stay in London. But she dreaded going away. She wanted to be
      left quiet in her little house. It was this which made her tell Fiorsen
      her secret one night, after the theatre. He had begun to talk of a
      holiday, sitting on the edge of the settee, with a glass in his hand and a
      cigarette between his lips. His cheeks, white and hollow from too much
      London, went a curious dull red; he got up and stared at her. Gyp made an
      involuntary movement with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't look at me. It's true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put down glass and cigarette and began to tramp the room. And Gyp stood
      with a little smile, not even watching him. Suddenly he clasped his
      forehead and broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want it; I won't have it&mdash;spoiling my Gyp.&rdquo; Then quickly
      going up to her with a scared face: &ldquo;I don't want it; I'm afraid of it.
      Don't have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Gyp's heart came the same feeling as when he had stood there drunk,
      against the wall&mdash;compassion, rather than contempt of his
      childishness. And taking his hand she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Gustav. It shan't bother you. When I begin to get ugly, I'll
      go away with Betty till it's over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went down on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! My beautiful Gyp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gyp sat like a sphinx, for fear that she too might let slip those
      words: &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The windows were open, and moths had come in. One had settled on the
      hydrangea plant that filled the hearth. Gyp looked at the soft, white,
      downy thing, whose head was like a tiny owl's against the bluish petals;
      looked at the purple-grey tiles down there, and the stuff of her own
      frock, in the shaded gleam of the lamps. And all her love of beauty
      rebelled, called up by his: &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; She would be unsightly soon, and
      suffer pain, and perhaps die of it, as her own mother had died. She set
      her teeth, listening to that grown-up child revolting against what he had
      brought on her, and touched his hand, protectingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It interested, even amused her this night and next day to watch his
      treatment of the disconcerting piece of knowledge. For when at last he
      realized that he had to acquiesce in nature, he began, as she had known he
      would, to jib away from all reminder of it. She was careful not to suggest
      that he should go away without her, knowing his perversity. But when he
      proposed that she should come to Ostend with him and Rosek, she answered,
      after seeming deliberation, that she thought she had better not&mdash;she
      would rather stay at home quite quietly; but he must certainly go and get
      a good holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was really gone, peace fell on Gyp&mdash;peace such as one feels,
      having no longer the tight, banded sensations of a fever. To be without
      that strange, disorderly presence in the house! When she woke in the
      sultry silence of the next morning, she utterly failed to persuade herself
      that she was missing him, missing the sound of his breathing, the sight of
      his rumpled hair on the pillow, the outline of his long form under the
      sheet. Her heart was devoid of any emptiness or ache; she only felt how
      pleasant and cool and tranquil it was to lie there alone. She stayed quite
      late in bed. It was delicious, with window and door wide open and the
      puppies running in and out, to lie and doze off, or listen to the pigeons'
      cooing, and the distant sounds of traffic, and feel in command once more
      of herself, body and soul. Now that she had told Fiorsen, she had no
      longer any desire to keep her condition secret. Feeling that it would hurt
      her father to learn of it from anyone but herself, she telephoned to tell
      him she was alone, and asked if she might come to Bury Street and dine
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton had not gone away, because, between Goodwood and Doncaster there
      was no racing that he cared for; one could not ride at this time of year,
      so might just as well be in London. In fact, August was perhaps the
      pleasantest of all months in town; the club was empty, and he could sit
      there without some old bore buttonholing him. Little Boncarte, the
      fencing-master, was always free for a bout&mdash;Winton had long learned
      to make his left hand what his right hand used to be; the Turkish baths in
      Jermyn Street were nearly void of their fat clients; he could saunter over
      to Covent Garden, buy a melon, and carry it home without meeting any but
      the most inferior duchesses in Piccadilly; on warm nights he could stroll
      the streets or the parks, smoking his cigar, his hat pushed back to cool
      his forehead, thinking vague thoughts, recalling vague memories. He
      received the news that his daughter was alone and free from that fellow
      with something like delight. Where should he dine her? Mrs. Markey was on
      her holiday. Why not Blafard's? Quiet&mdash;-small rooms&mdash;not too
      respectable&mdash;quite fairly cool&mdash;good things to eat. Yes;
      Blafard's!
    </p>
    <p>
      When she drove up, he was ready in the doorway, his thin brown face with
      its keen, half-veiled eyes the picture of composure, but feeling at heart
      like a schoolboy off for an exeat. How pretty she was looking&mdash;though
      pale from London&mdash;her dark eyes, her smile! And stepping quickly to
      the cab, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I'm getting in&mdash;dining at Blafard's, Gyp&mdash;a night out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It gave him a thrill to walk into that little restaurant behind her; and
      passing through its low red rooms to mark the diners turn and stare with
      envy&mdash;taking him, perhaps, for a different sort of relation. He
      settled her into a far corner by a window, where she could see the people
      and be seen. He wanted her to be seen; while he himself turned to the
      world only the short back wings of his glossy greyish hair. He had no
      notion of being disturbed in his enjoyment by the sight of Hivites and
      Amorites, or whatever they might be, lapping champagne and shining in the
      heat. For, secretly, he was living not only in this evening but in a
      certain evening of the past, when, in this very corner, he had dined with
      her mother. HIS face then had borne the brunt; hers had been turned away
      from inquisition. But he did not speak of this to Gyp.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drank two full glasses of wine before she told him her news. He took
      it with the expression she knew so well&mdash;tightening his lips and
      staring a little upward. Then he said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;November, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shudder, not to be repressed, went through Winton. The very month! And
      stretching his hand across the table, he took hers and pressed it tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'll be all right, child; I'm glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clinging to his hand, Gyp murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not; but I won't be frightened&mdash;I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Each was trying to deceive the other; and neither was deceived. But both
      were good at putting a calm face on things. Besides, this was &ldquo;a night
      out&rdquo;&mdash;for her, the first since her marriage&mdash;of freedom, of
      feeling somewhat as she used to feel with all before her in a ballroom of
      a world; for him, the unfettered resumption of a dear companionship and a
      stealthy revel in the past. After his, &ldquo;So he's gone to Ostend?&rdquo; and his
      thought: 'He would!' they never alluded to Fiorsen, but talked of horses,
      of Mildenham&mdash;it seemed to Gyp years since she had been there&mdash;of
      her childish escapades. And, looking at him quizzically, she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you like as a boy, Dad? Aunt Rosamund says that you used to get
      into white rages when nobody could go near you. She says you were always
      climbing trees, or shooting with a catapult, or stalking things, and that
      you never told anybody what you didn't want to tell them. And weren't you
      desperately in love with your nursery-governess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton smiled. How long since he had thought of that first affection. Miss
      Huntley! Helena Huntley&mdash;with crinkly brown hair, and blue eyes, and
      fascinating frocks! He remembered with what grief and sense of bitter
      injury he heard in his first school-holidays that she was gone. And he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. By Jove, what a time ago! And my father's going off to India.
      He never came back; killed in that first Afghan business. When I was fond,
      I WAS fond. But I didn't feel things like you&mdash;not half so sensitive.
      No; not a bit like you, Gyp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And watching her unconscious eyes following the movements of the waiters,
      never staring, but taking in all that was going on, he thought: 'Prettiest
      creature in the world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;What would you like to do now&mdash;drop into a theatre
      or music-hall, or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp shook her head. It was so hot. Could they just drive, and then perhaps
      sit in the park? That would be lovely. It had gone dark, and the air was
      not quite so exhausted&mdash;a little freshness of scent from the trees in
      the squares and parks mingled with the fumes of dung and petrol. Winton
      gave the same order he had given that long past evening: &ldquo;Knightsbridge
      Gate.&rdquo; It had been a hansom then, and the night air had blown in their
      faces, instead of as now in these infernal taxis, down the back of one's
      neck. They left the cab and crossed the Row; passed the end of the Long
      Water, up among the trees. There, on two chairs covered by Winton's coat,
      they sat side by side. No dew was falling yet; the heavy leaves hung
      unstirring; the air was warm, sweet-smelling. Blotted against trees or on
      the grass were other couples darker than the darkness, very silent. All
      was quiet save for the never-ceasing hum of traffic. From Winton's lips,
      the cigar smoke wreathed and curled. He was dreaming. The cigar between
      his teeth trembled; a long ash fell. Mechanically he raised his hand to
      brush it off&mdash;his right hand! A voice said softly in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it delicious, and warm, and gloomy black?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton shivered, as one shivers recalled from dreams; and, carefully
      brushing off the ash with his left hand, he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; very jolly. My cigar's out, though, and I haven't a match.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp's hand slipped through his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these people in love, and so dark and whispery&mdash;it makes a sort
      of strangeness in the air. Don't you feel it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No moon to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again they were silent. A puff of wind ruffled the leaves; the night, for
      a moment, seemed full of whispering; then the sound of a giggle jarred out
      and a girl's voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Chuck it, 'Arry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel the dew now, Dad. Can we walk on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went along paths, so as not to wet her feet in her thin shoes. And
      they talked. The spell was over; the night again but a common London
      night; the park a space of parching grass and gravel; the people just
      clerks and shop-girls walking out.
    </p>

      VIII
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen's letters were the source of one long smile to Gyp. He missed her
      horribly; if only she were there!&mdash;and so forth&mdash;blended in the
      queerest way with the impression that he was enjoying himself uncommonly.
      There were requests for money, and careful omission of any real account of
      what he was doing. Out of a balance running rather low, she sent him
      remittances; this was her holiday, too, and she could afford to pay for
      it. She even sought out a shop where she could sell jewelry, and, with a
      certain malicious joy, forwarded him the proceeds. It would give him and
      herself another week.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night she went with Winton to the Octagon, where Daphne Wing was still
      performing. Remembering the girl's squeaks of rapture at her garden, she
      wrote next day, asking her to lunch and spend a lazy afternoon under the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little dancer came with avidity. She was pale, and droopy from the
      heat, but happily dressed in Liberty silk, with a plain turn-down straw
      hat. They lunched off sweetbreads, ices, and fruit, and then, with coffee,
      cigarettes, and plenty of sugar-plums, settled down in the deepest shade
      of the garden, Gyp in a low wicker chair, Daphne Wing on cushions and the
      grass. Once past the exclamatory stage, she seemed a great talker, laying
      bare her little soul with perfect liberality. And Gyp&mdash;excellent
      listener&mdash;enjoyed it, as one enjoys all confidential revelations of
      existences very different from one's own, especially when regarded as a
      superior being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don't mean to stay at home any longer than I can help; only
      it's no good going out into life&rdquo;&mdash;this phrase she often used&mdash;&ldquo;till
      you know where you are. In my profession, one has to be so careful. Of
      course, people think it's worse than it is; father gets fits sometimes.
      But you know, Mrs. Fiorsen, home's awful. We have mutton&mdash;you know
      what mutton is&mdash;it's really awful in your bedroom in hot weather. And
      there's nowhere to practise. What I should like would be a studio. It
      would be lovely, somewhere down by the river, or up here near you. That
      WOULD be lovely. You know, I'm putting by. As soon as ever I have two
      hundred pounds, I shall skip. What I think would be perfectly lovely would
      be to inspire painters and musicians. I don't want to be just a common
      'turn'&mdash;ballet business year after year, and that; I want to be
      something rather special. But mother's so silly about me; she thinks I
      oughtn't to take any risks at all. I shall never get on that way. It IS so
      nice to talk to you, Mrs. Fiorsen, because you're young enough to know
      what I feel; and I'm sure you'd never be shocked at anything. You see,
      about men: Ought one to marry, or ought one to take a lover? They say you
      can't be a perfect artist till you've felt passion. But, then, if you
      marry, that means mutton over again, and perhaps babies, and perhaps the
      wrong man after all. Ugh! But then, on the other hand, I don't want to be
      raffish. I hate raffish people&mdash;I simply hate them. What do you
      think? It's awfully difficult, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp, perfectly grave, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sort of thing settles itself. I shouldn't bother beforehand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Daphne Wing buried her perfect chin deeper in her hands, and said
      meditatively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I rather thought that, too; of course I could do either now. But,
      you see, I really don't care for men who are not distinguished. I'm sure I
      shall only fall in love with a really distinguished man. That's what you
      did&mdash;isn't it?&mdash;so you MUST understand. I think Mr. Fiorsen is
      wonderfully distinguished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sunlight, piercing the shade, suddenly fell warm on Gyp's neck where her
      blouse ceased, and fortunately stilled the medley of emotion and laughter
      a little lower down. She continued to look gravely at Daphne Wing, who
      resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Mother would have fits if I asked her such a question, and I
      don't know what Father would do. Only it is important, isn't it? One may
      go all wrong from the start; and I do really want to get on. I simply
      adore my work. I don't mean to let love stand in its way; I want to make
      it help, you know. Count Rosek says my dancing lacks passion. I wish you'd
      tell me if you think it does. I should believe YOU.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing looked up reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm sure you are! If I were a man, I should be passionately in love
      with you. I've got a new dance where I'm supposed to be a nymph pursued by
      a faun; it's so difficult to feel like a nymph when you know it's only the
      ballet-master. Do you think I ought to put passion into that? You see, I'm
      supposed to be flying all the time; but it would be much more subtle,
      wouldn't it, if I could give the impression that I wanted to be caught.
      Don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think it WOULD do you good to be in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Daphne's mouth fell a little open; her eyes grew round. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You frightened me when you said that. You looked so different&mdash;so&mdash;intense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flame indeed had leaped up in Gyp. This fluffy, flabby talk of love set
      her instincts in revolt. She did not want to love; she had failed to fall
      in love. But, whatever love was like, it did not bear talking about. How
      was it that this little suburban girl, when she once got on her toes,
      could twirl one's emotions as she did?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'you know what I should simply revel in?&rdquo; Daphne Wing went on: &ldquo;To dance
      to you here in the garden some night. It must be wonderful to dance out of
      doors; and the grass is nice and hard now. Only, I suppose it would shock
      the servants. Do they look out this way?&rdquo; Gyp shook her head. &ldquo;I could
      dance over there in front of the drawing-room window. Only it would have
      to be moonlight. I could come any Sunday. I've got a dance where I'm
      supposed to be a lotus flower&mdash;that would do splendidly. And there's
      my real moonlight dance that goes to Chopin. I could bring my dresses, and
      change in the music-room, couldn't I?&rdquo; She wriggled up, and sat
      cross-legged, gazing at Gyp, and clasping her hands. &ldquo;Oh, may I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her excitement infected Gyp. A desire to give pleasure, the queerness of
      the notion, and her real love of seeing this girl dance, made her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; next Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing got up, made a rush, and kissed her. Her mouth was soft, and
      she smelled of orange blossom; but Gyp recoiled a little&mdash;she hated
      promiscuous kisses. Somewhat abashed, Miss Daphne hung her head, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did look so lovely; I couldn't help it, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gyp gave her hand the squeeze of compunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went indoors, to try over the music of the two dances; and soon after
      Daphne Wing departed, full of sugar-plums and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived punctually at eight o'clock next Sunday, carrying an exiguous
      green linen bag, which contained her dresses. She was subdued, and, now
      that it had come to the point, evidently a little scared. Lobster salad,
      hock, and peaches restored her courage. She ate heartily. It did not
      apparently matter to her whether she danced full or empty; but she would
      not smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's bad for the&mdash;&rdquo; She checked herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had finished supper, Gyp shut the dogs into the back premises;
      she had visions of their rending Miss Wing's draperies, or calves. Then
      they went into the drawing-room, not lighting up, that they might tell
      when the moonlight was strong enough outside. Though it was the last night
      of August, the heat was as great as ever&mdash;a deep, unstirring warmth;
      the climbing moon shot as yet but a thin shaft here and there through the
      heavy foliage. They talked in low voices, unconsciously playing up to the
      nature of the escapade. As the moon drew up, they stole out across the
      garden to the music-room. Gyp lighted the candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you manage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Daphne had already shed half her garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm so excited, Mrs. Fiorsen! I do hope I shall dance well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp stole back to the house; it being Sunday evening, the servants had
      been easily disposed of. She sat down at the piano, turning her eyes
      toward the garden. A blurred white shape flitted suddenly across the
      darkness at the far end and became motionless, as it might be a
      white-flowering bush under the trees. Miss Daphne had come out, and was
      waiting for the moon. Gyp began to play. She pitched on a little Sicilian
      pastorale that the herdsmen play on their pipes coming down from the
      hills, softly, from very far, rising, rising, swelling to full cadence,
      and failing, failing away again to nothing. The moon rose over the trees;
      its light flooded the face of the house, down on to the grass, and spread
      slowly back toward where the girl stood waiting. It caught the border of
      sunflowers along the garden wall with a stroke of magical, unearthly
      colour&mdash;gold that was not gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp began to play the dance. The pale blurr in the darkness stirred. The
      moonlight fell on the girl now, standing with arms spread, holding out her
      drapery&mdash;a white, winged statue. Then, like a gigantic moth she
      fluttered forth, blanched and noiseless flew over the grass, spun and
      hovered. The moonlight etched out the shape of her head, painted her hair
      with pallid gold. In the silence, with that unearthly gleam of colour
      along the sunflowers and on the girl's head, it was as if a spirit had
      dropped into the garden and was fluttering to and fro, unable to get out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice behind Gyp said: &ldquo;My God! What's this? An angel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen was standing hall-way in the darkened room staring out into the
      garden, where the girl had halted, transfixed before the window, her eyes
      as round as saucers, her mouth open, her limbs rigid with interest and
      affright. Suddenly she turned and, gathering her garment, fled, her limbs
      gleaming in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gyp sat looking up at the apparition of her husband. She could just
      see his eyes straining after that flying nymph. Miss Daphne's faun! Why,
      even his ears were pointed! Had she never noticed before, how like a faun
      he was? Yes&mdash;on her wedding-night! And she said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daphne Wing was rehearsing her new dance. So you're back! Why didn't you
      let me know? Are you all right&mdash;you look splendid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen bent down and clutched her by the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Gyp! Kiss me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But even while his lips were pressed on hers, she felt rather than saw his
      eyes straying to the garden, and thought, &ldquo;He would like to be kissing
      that girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment he had gone to get his things from the cab, she slipped out to
      the music-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Daphne was dressed, and stuffing her garments into the green linen
      bag. She looked up, and said piteously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Does he mind? It's awful, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp strangled her desire to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's for you to mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't, if you don't! How did you like the dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovely! When you're ready&mdash;come along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think I'd rather go home, please! It must seem so funny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to go by this back way into the lane? You turn to the
      right, into the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; please. It would have been better if he could have seen the
      dance properly, wouldn't it? What will he think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp smiled, and opened the door into the lane. When she returned, Fiorsen
      was at the window, gazing out. Was it for her or for that flying nymph?
    </p>
    <p>
      IX
    </p>
    <p>
      September and October passed. There were more concerts, not very well
      attended. Fiorsen's novelty had worn off, nor had his playing sweetness
      and sentiment enough for the big Public. There was also a financial
      crisis. It did not seem to Gyp to matter. Everything seemed remote and
      unreal in the shadow of her coming time. Unlike most mothers to be, she
      made no garments, no preparations of any kind. Why make what might never
      be needed? She played for Fiorsen a great deal, for herself not at all,
      read many books&mdash;poetry, novels, biographies&mdash;taking them in at
      the moment, and forgetting them at once, as one does with books read just
      to distract the mind. Winton and Aunt Rosamund, by tacit agreement, came
      on alternate afternoons. And Winton, almost as much under that shadow as
      Gyp herself, would take the evening train after leaving her, and spend the
      next day racing or cub-hunting, returning the morning of the day after to
      pay his next visit. He had no dread just then like that of an unoccupied
      day face to face with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, who had been present at Gyp's birth, was in a queer state. The
      obvious desirability of such events to one of motherly type defrauded by
      fate of children was terribly impinged on by that old memory, and a
      solicitude for her &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; far exceeding what she would have had for a
      daughter of her own. What a peony regards as a natural happening to a
      peony, she watches with awe when it happens to the lily. That other single
      lady of a certain age, Aunt Rosamund, the very antithesis to Betty&mdash;a
      long, thin nose and a mere button, a sense of divine rights and no sense
      of rights at all, a drawl and a comforting wheeze, length and
      circumference, decision and the curtsey to providence, humour and none,
      dyspepsia, and the digestion of an ostrich, with other oppositions&mdash;Aunt
      Rosamund was also uneasy, as only one could be who disapproved heartily of
      uneasiness, and habitually joked and drawled it into retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all those round Gyp, Fiorsen gave the most interesting display. He
      had not even an elementary notion of disguising his state of mind. And his
      state of mind was weirdly, wistfully primitive. He wanted Gyp as she had
      been. The thought that she might never become herself again terrified him
      so at times that he was forced to drink brandy, and come home only a
      little less far gone than that first time. Gyp had often to help him go to
      bed. On two or three occasions, he suffered so that he was out all night.
      To account for this, she devised the formula of a room at Count Rosek's,
      where he slept when music kept him late, so as not to disturb her. Whether
      the servants believed her or not, she never knew. Nor did she ever ask him
      where he went&mdash;too proud, and not feeling that she had the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deeply conscious of the unaesthetic nature of her condition, she was
      convinced that she could no longer be attractive to one so easily upset in
      his nerves, so intolerant of ugliness. As to deeper feelings about her&mdash;had
      he any? He certainly never gave anything up, or sacrificed himself in any
      way. If she had loved, she felt she would want to give up everything to
      the loved one; but then&mdash;she would never love! And yet he seemed
      frightened about her. It was puzzling! But perhaps she would not be
      puzzled much longer about that or anything; for she often had the feeling
      that she would die. How could she be going to live, grudging her fate?
      What would give her strength to go through with it? And, at times, she
      felt as if she would be glad to die. Life had defrauded her, or she had
      defrauded herself of life. Was it really only a year since that glorious
      day's hunting when Dad and she, and the young man with the clear eyes and
      the irrepressible smile, had slipped away with the hounds ahead of all the
      field&mdash;the fatal day Fiorsen descended from the clouds and asked for
      her? An overwhelming longing for Mildenham came on her, to get away there
      with her father and Betty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went at the beginning of November.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over her departure, Fiorsen behaved like a tired child that will not go to
      bed. He could not bear to be away from her, and so forth; but when she had
      gone, he spent a furious bohemian evening. At about five, he woke with &ldquo;an
      awful cold feeling in my heart,&rdquo; as he wrote to Gyp next day&mdash;&ldquo;an
      awful feeling, my Gyp; I walked up and down for hours&rdquo; (in reality, half
      an hour at most). &ldquo;How shall I bear to be away from you at this time? I
      feel lost.&rdquo; Next day, he found himself in Paris with Rosek. &ldquo;I could not
      stand,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;the sight of the streets, of the garden, of our room.
      When I come back I shall stay with Rosek. Nearer to the day I will come; I
      must come to you.&rdquo; But Gyp, when she read the letter, said to Winton:
      &ldquo;Dad, when it comes, don't send for him. I don't want him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With those letters of his, she buried the last remnants of her feeling
      that somewhere in him there must be something as fine and beautiful as the
      sounds he made with his violin. And yet she felt those letters genuine in
      a way, pathetic, and with real feeling of a sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment she reached Mildenham, she began to lose that hopelessness
      about herself; and, for the first time, had the sensation of wanting to
      live in the new life within her. She first felt it, going into her old
      nursery, where everything was the same as it had been when she first saw
      it, a child of eight; there was her old red doll's house, the whole side
      of which opened to display the various floors; the worn Venetian blinds,
      the rattle of whose fall had sounded in her ears so many hundred times;
      the high fender, near which she had lain so often on the floor, her chin
      on her hands, reading Grimm, or &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland,&rdquo; or histories of
      England. Here, too, perhaps this new child would live amongst the old
      familiars. And the whim seized her to face her hour in her old nursery,
      not in the room where she had slept as a girl. She would not like the
      daintiness of that room deflowered. Let it stay the room of her girlhood.
      But in the nursery&mdash;there was safety, comfort! And when she had been
      at Mildenham a week, she made Betty change her over.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one in that house was half so calm to look at in those days as Gyp.
      Betty was not guiltless of sitting on the stairs and crying at odd
      moments. Mrs. Markey had never made such bad soups. Markey so far forgot
      himself as frequently to talk. Winton lamed a horse trying an impossible
      jump that he might get home the quicker, and, once back, was like an
      unquiet spirit. If Gyp were in the room, he would make the pretence of
      wanting to warm his feet or hand, just to stroke her shoulder as he went
      back to his chair. His voice, so measured and dry, had a ring in it, that
      too plainly disclosed the anxiety of his heart. Gyp, always sensitive to
      atmosphere, felt cradled in all the love about her. Wonderful that they
      should all care so much! What had she done for anyone, that people should
      be so sweet&mdash;he especially, whom she had so grievously distressed by
      her wretched marriage? She would sit staring into the fire with her wide,
      dark eyes, unblinking as an owl's at night&mdash;wondering what she could
      do to make up to her father, whom already once she had nearly killed by
      coming into life. And she began to practise the bearing of the coming
      pain, trying to project herself into this unknown suffering, so that it
      should not surprise from her cries and contortions.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had one dream, over and over again, of sinking and sinking into a
      feather bed, growing hotter and more deeply walled in by that which had no
      stay in it, yet through which her body could not fall and reach anything
      more solid. Once, after this dream, she got up and spent the rest of the
      night wrapped in a blanket and the eider-down, on the old sofa, where, as
      a child, they had made her lie flat on her back from twelve to one every
      day. Betty was aghast at finding her there asleep in the morning. Gyp's
      face was so like the child-face she had seen lying there in the old days,
      that she bundled out of the room and cried bitterly into the cup of tea.
      It did her good. Going back with the tea, she scolded her &ldquo;pretty&rdquo; for
      sleeping out there, with the fire out, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gyp only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty, darling, the tea's awfully cold! Please get me some more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      X
    </p>
    <p>
      From the day of the nurse's arrival, Winton gave up hunting. He could not
      bring himself to be out of doors for more than half an hour at a time.
      Distrust of doctors did not prevent him having ten minutes every morning
      with the old practitioner who had treated Gyp for mumps, measles, and the
      other blessings of childhood. The old fellow&mdash;his name was Rivershaw&mdash;was
      a most peculiar survival. He smelled of mackintosh, had round purplish
      cheeks, a rim of hair which people said he dyed, and bulging grey eyes
      slightly bloodshot. He was short in body and wind, drank port wine, was
      suspected of taking snuff, read The Times, spoke always in a husky voice,
      and used a very small brougham with a very old black horse. But he had a
      certain low cunning, which had defeated many ailments, and his reputation
      for assisting people into the world stood extremely high. Every morning
      punctually at twelve, the crunch of his little brougham's wheels would be
      heard. Winton would get up, and, taking a deep breath, cross the hall to
      the dining-room, extract from a sideboard a decanter of port, a
      biscuit-canister, and one glass. He would then stand with his eyes fixed
      on the door, till, in due time, the doctor would appear, and he could say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, doctor? How is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nicely; quite nicely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to make one anxious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, puffing out his cheeks, with eyes straying to the decanter,
      would murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardiac condition, capital&mdash;a little&mdash;um&mdash;not to matter.
      Taking its course. These things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Winton, with another deep breath, would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glass of port, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An expression of surprise would pass over the doctor's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold day&mdash;ah, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo; And he would blow his nose on his
      purple-and-red bandanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching him drink his port, Winton would mark:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can get you at any time, can't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the doctor, sucking his lips, would answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never fear, my dear sir! Little Miss Gyp&mdash;old friend of mine. At her
      service day and night. Never fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sensation of comfort would pass through Winton, which would last quite
      twenty minutes after the crunching of the wheels and the mingled perfumes
      of him had died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these days, his greatest friend was an old watch that had been his
      father's before him; a gold repeater from Switzerland, with a chipped
      dial-plate, and a case worn wondrous thin and smooth&mdash;a favourite of
      Gyp's childhood. He would take it out about every quarter of an hour, look
      at its face without discovering the time, finger it, all smooth and warm
      from contact with his body, and put it back. Then he would listen. There
      was nothing whatever to listen to, but he could not help it. Apart from
      this, his chief distraction was to take a foil and make passes at a
      leather cushion, set up on the top of a low bookshelf. In these
      occupations, varied by constant visits to the room next the nursery, where&mdash;to
      save her the stairs&mdash;Gyp was now established, and by excursions to
      the conservatory to see if he could not find some new flower to take her,
      he passed all his time, save when he was eating, sleeping, or smoking
      cigars, which he had constantly to be relighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Gyp's request, they kept from him knowledge of when her pains began.
      After that first bout was over and she was lying half asleep in the old
      nursery, he happened to go up. The nurse&mdash;a bonny creature&mdash;one
      of those free, independent, economic agents that now abound&mdash;met him
      in the sitting-room. Accustomed to the &ldquo;fuss and botheration of men&rdquo; at
      such times, she was prepared to deliver him a little lecture. But, in
      approaching, she became affected by the look on his face, and, realizing
      somehow that she was in the presence of one whose self-control was proof,
      she simply whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's beginning; but don't be anxious&mdash;she's not suffering just now.
      We shall send for the doctor soon. She's very plucky&rdquo;; and with an
      unaccustomed sensation of respect and pity she repeated: &ldquo;Don't be
      anxious, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she wants to see me at any time, I shall be in my study. Save her all
      you can, nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse was left with a feeling of surprise at having used the word
      &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;; she had not done such a thing since&mdash;since&mdash;! And,
      pensive, she returned to the nursery, where Gyp said at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that my father? I didn't want him to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse answered mechanically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you think before&mdash;before it'll begin again, nurse? I'd
      like to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse stroked her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon enough when it's all over and comfy. Men are always fidgety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp looked at her, and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You see, my mother died when I was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse, watching those lips, still pale with pain, felt a queer pang.
      She smoothed the bed-clothes and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothing&mdash;it often happens&mdash;that is, I mean,&mdash;you
      know it has no connection whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And seeing Gyp smile, she thought: 'Well, I am a fool.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If by any chance I don't get through, I want to be cremated; I want to go
      back as quick as I can. I can't bear the thought of the other thing. Will
      you remember, nurse? I can't tell my father that just now; it might upset
      him. But promise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the nurse thought: 'That can't be done without a will or something,
      but I'd better promise. It's a morbid fancy, and yet she's not a morbid
      subject, either.' And she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my dear; only, you're not going to do anything of the sort.
      That's flat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp smiled again, and there was silence, till she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully ashamed, wanting all this attention, and making people
      miserable. I've read that Japanese women quietly go out somewhere by
      themselves and sit on a gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse, still busy with the bedclothes, murmured abstractedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's a very good way. But don't you fancy you're half the trouble
      most of them are. You're very good, and you're going to get on
      splendidly.&rdquo; And she thought: 'Odd! She's never once spoken of her
      husband. I don't like it for this sort&mdash;too perfect, too sensitive;
      her face touches you so!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp murmured again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to see my father, please; and rather quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nurse, after one swift look, went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp, who had clinched her hands under the bedclothes, fixed her eyes on
      the window. November! Acorns and the leaves&mdash;the nice, damp, earthy
      smell! Acorns all over the grass. She used to drive the old retriever in
      harness on the lawn covered with acorns and the dead leaves, and the wind
      still blowing them off the trees&mdash;in her brown velvet&mdash;that was
      a ducky dress! Who was it had called her once &ldquo;a wise little owl,&rdquo; in that
      dress? And, suddenly, her heart sank. The pain was coming again. Winton's
      voice from the door said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my pet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only to see how you are. I'm all right. What sort of a day is it?
      You'll go riding, won't you? Give my love to the horses. Good-bye, Dad;
      just for now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her forehead was wet to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, in the passage, her smile, like something actual on the air,
      preceded him&mdash;the smile that had just lasted out. But when he was
      back in the study, he suffered&mdash;suffered! Why could he not have that
      pain to bear instead?
    </p>
    <p>
      The crunch of the brougham brought his ceaseless march over the carpet to
      an end. He went out into the hall and looked into the doctor's face&mdash;he
      had forgotten that this old fellow knew nothing of his special reason for
      deadly fear. Then he turned back into his study. The wild south wind
      brought wet drift-leaves whirling against the panes. It was here that he
      had stood looking out into the dark, when Fiorsen came down to ask for Gyp
      a year ago. Why had he not bundled the fellow out neck and crop, and taken
      her away?&mdash;India, Japan&mdash;anywhere would have done! She had not
      loved that fiddler, never really loved him. Monstrous&mdash;monstrous! The
      full bitterness of having missed right action swept over Winton, and he
      positively groaned aloud. He moved from the window and went over to the
      bookcase; there in one row were the few books he ever read, and he took
      one out. &ldquo;Life of General Lee.&rdquo; He put it back and took another, a novel
      of Whyte Melville's: &ldquo;Good for Nothing.&rdquo; Sad book&mdash;sad ending! The
      book dropped from his hand and fell with a flump on the floor. In a sort
      of icy discovery, he had seen his life as it would be if for a second time
      he had to bear such loss. She must not&mdash;could not die! If she did&mdash;then,
      for him&mdash;! In old times they buried a man with his horse and his dog,
      as if at the end of a good run. There was always that! The extremity of
      this thought brought relief. He sat down, and, for a long time, stayed
      staring into the fire in a sort of coma. Then his feverish fears began
      again. Why the devil didn't they come and tell him something, anything&mdash;rather
      than this silence, this deadly solitude and waiting? What was that? The
      front door shutting. Wheels? Had that hell-hound of an old doctor sneaked
      off? He started up. There at the door was Markey, holding in his hand some
      cards. Winton scanned them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Summerhay; Mr. Bryan Summerhay. I said, 'Not at home,' sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at present. You have had no lunch, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring in my fur coat and the port, and make the fire up. I want any news
      there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Markey nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Odd to sit in a fur coat before a fire, and the day not cold! They said
      you lived on after death. He had never been able to feel that SHE was
      living on. SHE lived in Gyp. And now if Gyp&mdash;! Death&mdash;your own&mdash;no
      great matter! But&mdash;for her! The wind was dropping with the darkness.
      He got up and drew the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was seven o'clock when the doctor came down into the hall, and stood
      rubbing his freshly washed hands before opening the study door. Winton was
      still sitting before the fire, motionless, shrunk into his fur coat. He
      raised himself a little and looked round dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's face puckered, his eyelids drooped half-way across his
      bulging eyes; it was his way of smiling. &ldquo;Nicely,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;nicely&mdash;a
      girl. No complications.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton's whole body seemed to swell, his lips opened, he raised his hand.
      Then, the habit of a lifetime catching him by the throat, he stayed
      motionless. At last he got up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glass of port, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor spying at him above the glass thought: 'This is &ldquo;the
      fifty-two.&rdquo; Give me &ldquo;the sixty-eight&rdquo;&mdash;more body.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time, Winton went upstairs. Waiting in the outer room he had a
      return of his cold dread. &ldquo;Perfectly successful&mdash;the patient died
      from exhaustion!&rdquo; The tiny squawking noise that fell on his ears entirely
      failed to reassure him. He cared nothing for that new being. Suddenly he
      found Betty just behind him, her bosom heaving horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, woman? Don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had leaned against his shoulder, appearing to have lost all sense of
      right and wrong, and, out of her sobbing, gurgled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks so lovely&mdash;oh dear, she looks so lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pushing her abruptly from him, Winton peered in through the just-opened
      door. Gyp was lying extremely still, and very white; her eyes, very large,
      very dark, were fastened on her baby. Her face wore a kind of wonder. She
      did not see Winton, who stood stone-quiet, watching, while the nurse moved
      about her business behind a screen. This was the first time in his life
      that he had seen a mother with her just-born baby. That look on her face&mdash;gone
      right away somewhere, right away&mdash;amazed him. She had never seemed to
      like children, had said she did not want a child. She turned her head and
      saw him. He went in. She made a faint motion toward the baby, and her eyes
      smiled. Winton looked at that swaddled speckled mite; then, bending down,
      he kissed her hand and tiptoed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner he drank champagne, and benevolence towards all the world spread
      in his being. Watching the smoke of his cigar wreathe about him, he
      thought: 'Must send that chap a wire.' After all, he was a fellow being&mdash;might
      be suffering, as he himself had suffered only two hours ago. To keep him
      in ignorance&mdash;it wouldn't do! And he wrote out the form&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;All well, a daughter.&mdash;WINTON,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and sent it out with the order that a groom should take it in that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp was sleeping when he stole up at ten o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, turned in, and slept like a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      XI
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning the next afternoon from the first ride for several days, Winton
      passed the station fly rolling away from the drive-gate with the
      light-hearted disillusionment peculiar to quite empty vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of a fur coat and broad-brimmed hat in the hall warned him of
      what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fiorsen, sir; gone up to Mrs. Fiorsen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Natural, but a d&mdash;d bore! And bad, perhaps, for Gyp. He asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he bring things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bag, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a room ready, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To dine tete-a-tete with that fellow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp had passed the strangest morning in her life, so far. Her baby
      fascinated her, also the tug of its lips, giving her the queerest
      sensation, almost sensual; a sort of meltedness, an infinite warmth, a
      desire to grip the little creature right into her&mdash;which, of course,
      one must not do. And yet, neither her sense of humour nor her sense of
      beauty were deceived. It was a queer little affair with a tuft of black
      hair, in grace greatly inferior to a kitten. Its tiny, pink, crisped
      fingers with their infinitesimal nails, its microscopic curly toes, and
      solemn black eyes&mdash;when they showed, its inimitable stillness when it
      slept, its incredible vigour when it fed, were all, as it were,
      miraculous. Withal, she had a feeling of gratitude to one that had not
      killed nor even hurt her so very desperately&mdash;gratitude because she
      had succeeded, performed her part of mother perfectly&mdash;the nurse had
      said so&mdash;she, so distrustful of herself! Instinctively she knew, too,
      that this was HER baby, not his, going &ldquo;to take after her,&rdquo; as they called
      it. How it succeeded in giving that impression she could not tell, unless
      it were the passivity, and dark eyes of the little creature. Then from one
      till three they had slept together with perfect soundness and unanimity.
      She awoke to find the nurse standing by the bed, looking as if she wanted
      to tell her something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone to see you, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gyp thought: 'He! I can't think quickly; I ought to think quickly&mdash;I
      want to, but I can't.' Her face expressed this, for the nurse said at
      once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you're quite up to it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Only, not for five minutes, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her spirit had been very far away, she wanted time to get it back before
      she saw him&mdash;time to know in some sort what she felt now; what this
      mite lying beside her had done for her and him. The thought that it was
      his, too&mdash;this tiny, helpless being&mdash;seemed unreal. No, it was
      not his! He had not wanted it, and now that she had been through the
      torture it was hers, not his&mdash;never his. The memory of the night when
      she first yielded to the certainty that the child was coming, and he had
      come home drunk, swooped on her, and made her shrink and shudder and put
      her arm round her baby. It had not made any difference. Only&mdash;Back
      came the old accusing thought, from which these last days she had been
      free: 'But I married him&mdash;I chose to marry him. I can't get out of
      that!' And she felt as if she must cry out to the nurse: &ldquo;Keep him away; I
      don't want to see him. Oh, please, I'm tired.&rdquo; She bit the words back. And
      presently, with a very faint smile, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I'm ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She noticed first what clothes he had on&mdash;his newest suit, dark grey,
      with little lighter lines&mdash;she had chosen it herself; that his tie
      was in a bow, not a sailor's knot, and his hair brighter than usual&mdash;as
      always just after being cut; and surely the hair was growing down again in
      front of his ears. Then, gratefully, almost with emotion, she realized
      that his lips were quivering, his whole face quivering. He came in on
      tiptoe, stood looking at her a minute, then crossed very swiftly to the
      bed, very swiftly knelt down, and, taking her hand, turned it over and put
      his face to it. The bristles of his moustache tickled her palm; his nose
      flattened itself against her fingers, and his lips kept murmuring words
      into the hand, with the moist warm touch of his lips. Gyp knew he was
      burying there all his remorse, perhaps the excesses he had committed while
      she had been away from him, burying the fears he had felt, and the emotion
      at seeing her so white and still. She felt that in a minute he would raise
      a quite different face. And it flashed through her: &ldquo;If I loved him I
      wouldn't mind what he did&mdash;ever! Why don't I love him? There's
      something loveable. Why don't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did raise his face; his eyes lighted on the baby, and he grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at this!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is it possible? Oh, my Gyp, what a funny one!
      Oh, oh, oh!&rdquo; He went off into an ecstasy of smothered laughter; then his
      face grew grave, and slowly puckered into a sort of comic disgust. Gyp too
      had seen the humours of her baby, of its queer little reddish pudge of a
      face, of its twenty-seven black hairs, and the dribble at its almost
      invisible mouth; but she had also seen it as a miracle; she had felt it,
      and there surged up from her all the old revolt and more against his lack
      of consideration. It was not a funny one&mdash;her baby! It was not ugly!
      Or, if it were, she was not fit to be told of it. Her arm tightened round
      the warm bundled thing against her. Fiorsen put his finger out and touched
      its cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It IS real&mdash;so it is. Mademoiselle Fiorsen. Tk, tk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baby stirred. And Gyp thought: 'If I loved I wouldn't even mind his
      laughing at my baby. It would be different.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't wake her!&rdquo; she whispered. She felt his eyes on her, knew that his
      interest in the baby had ceased as suddenly as it came, that he was
      thinking, &ldquo;How long before I have you in my arms again?&rdquo; He touched her
      hair. And, suddenly, she had a fainting, sinking sensation that she had
      never yet known. When she opened her eyes again, the economic agent was
      holding something beneath her nose and making sounds that seemed to be the
      words: &ldquo;Well, I am a d&mdash;d fool!&rdquo; repeatedly expressed. Fiorsen was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing Gyp's eyes once more open, the nurse withdrew the ammonia, replaced
      the baby, and saying: &ldquo;Now go to sleep!&rdquo; withdrew behind the screen. Like
      all robust personalities, she visited on others her vexations with
      herself. But Gyp did not go to sleep; she gazed now at her sleeping baby,
      now at the pattern of the wall-paper, trying mechanically to find the bird
      caught at intervals amongst its brown-and-green foliage&mdash;one bird in
      each alternate square of the pattern, so that there was always a bird in
      the centre of four other birds. And the bird was of green and yellow with
      a red beak.
    </p>
    <p>
      On being turned out of the nursery with the assurance that it was &ldquo;all
      right&mdash;only a little faint,&rdquo; Fiorsen went down-stairs disconsolate.
      The atmosphere of this dark house where he was a stranger, an unwelcome
      stranger, was insupportable. He wanted nothing in it but Gyp, and Gyp had
      fainted at his touch. No wonder he felt miserable. He opened a door. What
      room was this? A piano! The drawing-room. Ugh! No fire&mdash;what misery!
      He recoiled to the doorway and stood listening. Not a sound. Grey light in
      the cheerless room; almost dark already in the hall behind him. What a
      life these English lived&mdash;worse than the winter in his old country
      home in Sweden, where, at all events, they kept good fires. And, suddenly,
      all his being revolted. Stay here and face that father&mdash;and that
      image of a servant! Stay here for a night of this! Gyp was not his Gyp,
      lying there with that baby beside her, in this hostile house. Smothering
      his footsteps, he made for the outer hall. There were his coat and hat. He
      put them on. His bag? He could not see it. No matter! They could send it
      after him. He would write to her&mdash;say that her fainting had upset him&mdash;that
      he could not risk making her faint again&mdash;could not stay in the house
      so near her, yet so far. She would understand. And there came over him a
      sudden wave of longing. Gyp! He wanted her. To be with her! To look at her
      and kiss her, and feel her his own again! And, opening the door, he passed
      out on to the drive and strode away, miserable and sick at heart. All the
      way to the station through the darkening lanes, and in the railway
      carriage going up, he felt that aching wretchedness. Only in the lighted
      street, driving back to Rosek's, did he shake it off a little. At dinner
      and after, drinking that special brandy he nearly lost it; but it came
      back when he went to bed, till sleep relieved him with its darkness and
      dreams.

    <p>
      Gyp's recovery proceeded at first with a sure rapidity which delighted
      Winton. As the economic agent pointed out, she was beautifully made, and
      that had a lot to do with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Christmas Day, she was already out, and on Christmas morning the
      old doctor, by way of present, pronounced her fit and ready to go home
      when she liked. That afternoon, she was not so well, and next day back
      again upstairs. Nothing seemed definitely wrong, only a sort of desperate
      lassitude; as if the knowledge that to go back was within her power, only
      needing her decision, had been too much for her. And since no one knew her
      inward feelings, all were puzzled except Winton. The nursing of her child
      was promptly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till the middle of January that she said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go home, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word &ldquo;home&rdquo; hurt him, and he only answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Gyp; when?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house is quite ready. I think I had better go to-morrow. He's still
      at Rosek's. I won't let him know. Two or three days there by myself first
      would be better for settling baby in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I'll take you up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no effort to ascertain her feelings toward Fiorsen. He knew too
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      They travelled next day, reaching London at half-past two. Betty had gone
      up in the early morning to prepare the way. The dogs had been with Aunt
      Rosamund all this time. Gyp missed their greeting; but the installation of
      Betty and the baby in the spare room that was now to be the nursery,
      absorbed all her first energies. Light was just beginning to fail when,
      still in her fur, she took a key of the music-room and crossed the garden,
      to see how all had fared during her ten weeks' absence. What a wintry
      garden! How different from that languorous, warm, moonlit night when
      Daphne Wing had come dancing out of the shadow of the dark trees. How bare
      and sharp the boughs against the grey, darkening sky&mdash;and not a song
      of any bird, not a flower! She glanced back at the house. Cold and white
      it looked, but there were lights in her room and in the nursery, and
      someone just drawing the curtains. Now that the leaves were off, one could
      see the other houses of the road, each different in shape and colour, as
      is the habit of London houses. It was cold, frosty; Gyp hurried down the
      path. Four little icicles had formed beneath the window of the music-room.
      They caught her eye, and, passing round to the side, she broke one off.
      There must be a fire in there, for she could see the flicker through the
      curtains not quite drawn. Thoughtful Ellen had been airing it! But,
      suddenly, she stood still. There was more than a fire in there! Through
      the chink in the drawn curtains she had seen two figures seated on the
      divan. Something seemed to spin round in her head. She turned to rush
      away. Then a kind of superhuman coolness came to her, and she deliberately
      looked in. He and Daphne Wing! His arm was round her neck. The girl's face
      riveted her eyes. It was turned a little back and up, gazing at him, the
      lips parted, the eyes hypnotized, adoring; and her arm round him seemed to
      shiver&mdash;with cold, with ecstasy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that something went spinning through Gyp's head. She raised her
      hand. For a second it hovered close to the glass. Then, with a sick
      feeling, she dropped it and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never! Never would she show him or that girl that they could hurt her!
      Never! They were safe from any scene she would make&mdash;safe in their
      nest! And blindly, across the frosty grass, through the unlighted
      drawing-room, she went upstairs to her room, locked the door, and sat down
      before the fire. Pride raged within her. She stuffed her handkerchief
      between her teeth and lips; she did it unconsciously. Her eyes felt
      scorched from the fire-flames, but she did not trouble to hold her hand
      before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she thought: 'Suppose I HAD loved him?' and laughed. The
      handkerchief dropped to her lap, and she looked at it with wonder&mdash;it
      was blood-stained. She drew back in the chair, away from the scorching of
      the fire, and sat quite still, a smile on her lips. That girl's eyes, like
      a little adoring dog's&mdash;that girl, who had fawned on her so! She had
      got her &ldquo;distinguished man&rdquo;! She sprang up and looked at herself in the
      glass; shuddered, turned her back on herself, and sat down again. In her
      own house! Why not here&mdash;in this room? Why not before her eyes? Not
      yet a year married! It was almost funny&mdash;almost funny! And she had
      her first calm thought: 'I am free.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But it did not seem to mean anything, had no value to a spirit so bitterly
      stricken in its pride. She moved her chair closer to the fire again. Why
      had she not tapped on the window? To have seen that girl's face ashy with
      fright! To have seen him&mdash;caught&mdash;caught in the room she had
      made beautiful for him, the room where she had played for him so many
      hours, the room that was part of the house that she paid for! How long had
      they used it for their meetings&mdash;sneaking in by that door from the
      back lane? Perhaps even before she went away&mdash;to bear his child! And
      there began in her a struggle between mother instinct and her sense of
      outrage&mdash;a spiritual tug-of-war so deep that it was dumb, unconscious&mdash;to
      decide whether her baby would be all hers, or would have slipped away from
      her heart, and be a thing almost abhorrent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She huddled nearer the fire, feeling cold and physically sick. And
      suddenly the thought came to her: 'If I don't let the servants know I'm
      here, they might go out and see what I saw!' Had she shut the drawing-room
      window when she returned so blindly? Perhaps already&mdash;! In a fever,
      she rang the bell, and unlocked the door. The maid came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please shut the drawing-room, window, Ellen; and tell Betty I'm afraid I
      got a little chill travelling. I'm going to bed. Ask her if she can manage
      with baby.&rdquo; And she looked straight into the girl's face. It wore an
      expression of concern, even of commiseration, but not that fluttered look
      which must have been there if she had known.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, m'm; I'll get you a hot-water bottle, m'm. Would you like a hot bath
      and a cup of hot tea at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp nodded. Anything&mdash;anything! And when the maid was gone, she
      thought mechanically: 'A cup of hot tea! How quaint! What should it be but
      hot?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid came back with the tea; she was an affectionate girl, full of
      that admiring love servants and dogs always felt for Gyp, imbued, too,
      with the instinctive partisanship which stores itself one way or the other
      in the hearts of those who live in houses where the atmosphere lacks
      unity. To her mind, the mistress was much too good for him&mdash;a
      foreigner&mdash;and such 'abits! Manners&mdash;he hadn't any! And no good
      would come of it. Not if you took her opinion!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've turned the water in, m'm. Will you have a little mustard in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Gyp nodded. And the girl, going downstairs for the mustard, told
      cook there was &ldquo;that about the mistress that makes you quite pathetic.&rdquo;
       The cook, who was fingering her concertina, for which she had a passion,
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She 'ides up her feelin's, same as they all does. Thank 'eaven she
      haven't got that drawl, though, that 'er old aunt 'as&mdash;always makes
      me feel to want to say, 'Buck up, old dear, you ain't 'alf so precious as
      all that!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the maid Ellen had taken the mustard and gone, she drew out her
      concertina to its full length and, with cautionary softness, began to
      practise &ldquo;Home, Sweet Home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Gyp, lying in her hot bath, those muffled strains just mounted, not
      quite as a tune, rather as some far-away humming of large flies. The heat
      of the water, the pungent smell of the mustard, and that droning hum
      slowly soothed and drowsed away the vehemence of feeling. She looked at
      her body, silver-white in the yellowish water, with a dreamy sensation.
      Some day she, too, would love! Strange feeling she had never had before!
      Strange, indeed, that it should come at such a moment, breaking through
      the old instinctive shrinking. Yes; some day love would come to her. There
      floated before her brain the adoring look on Daphne Wing's face, the
      shiver that had passed along her arm, and pitifulness crept into her heart&mdash;a
      half-bitter, half-admiring pitifulness. Why should she grudge&mdash;she
      who did not love? The sounds, like the humming of large flies, grew
      deeper, more vibrating. It was the cook, in her passion swelling out her
      music on the phrase,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Be it ne-e-ver so humble,
      There's no-o place like home!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      XIII
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, Gyp slept peacefully, as though nothing had happened, as
      though there were no future at all before her. She woke into misery. Her
      pride would never let her show the world what she had discovered, would
      force her to keep an unmoved face and live an unmoved life. But the
      struggle between mother-instinct and revolt was still going on within her.
      She was really afraid to see her baby, and she sent word to Betty that she
      thought it would be safer if she kept quite quiet till the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up at noon and stole downstairs. She had not realized how violent
      was her struggle over HIS child till she was passing the door of the room
      where it was lying. If she had not been ordered to give up nursing, that
      struggle would never have come. Her heart ached, but a demon pressed her
      on and past the door. Downstairs she just pottered round, dusting her
      china, putting in order the books which, after house-cleaning, the maid
      had arranged almost too carefully, so that the first volumes of Dickens
      and Thackeray followed each other on the top shell, and the second volumes
      followed each other on the bottom shelf. And all the time she thought
      dully: 'Why am I doing this? What do I care how the place looks? It is not
      my home. It can never be my home!'
    </p>
    <p>
      For lunch she drank some beef tea, keeping up the fiction of her
      indisposition. After that, she sat down at her bureau to write. Something
      must be decided! There she sat, her forehead on her hand, and nothing came&mdash;not
      one word&mdash;not even the way to address him; just the date, and that
      was all. At a ring of the bell she started up. She could not see anybody!
      But the maid only brought a note from Aunt Rosamund, and the dogs, who
      fell frantically on their mistress and instantly began to fight for her
      possession. She went on her knees to separate them, and enjoin peace and
      good-will, and their little avid tongues furiously licked her cheeks.
      Under the eager touch of those wet tongues the band round her brain and
      heart gave way; she was overwhelmed with longing for her baby. Nearly a
      day since she had seen her&mdash;was it possible? Nearly a day without
      sight of those solemn eyes and crinkled toes and fingers! And followed by
      the dogs, she went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was invisible from the music-room; and, spurred on by thought
      that, until Fiorsen knew she was back, those two might be there in each
      other's arms any moment of the day or night, Gyp wrote that evening:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR GUSTAV,&mdash;We are back.&mdash;GYP.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What else in the world could she say? He would not get it till he woke
      about eleven. With the instinct to take all the respite she could, and
      knowing no more than before how she would receive his return, she went out
      in the forenoon and wandered about all day shopping and trying not to
      think. Returning at tea-time, she went straight up to her baby, and there
      heard from Betty that he had come, and gone out with his violin to the
      music-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bent over the child, Gyp needed all her self-control&mdash;but her
      self-control was becoming great. Soon, the girl would come fluttering down
      that dark, narrow lane; perhaps at this very minute her fingers were
      tapping at the door, and he was opening it to murmur, &ldquo;No; she's back!&rdquo;
       Ah, then the girl would shrink! The rapid whispering&mdash;some other
      meeting-place! Lips to lips, and that look on the girl's face; till she
      hurried away from the shut door, in the darkness, disappointed! And he, on
      that silver-and-gold divan, gnawing his moustache, his eyes&mdash;catlike&mdash;-staring
      at the fire! And then, perhaps, from his violin would come one of those
      swaying bursts of sound, with tears in them, and the wind in them, that
      had of old bewitched her! She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the window just a little, Betty dear&mdash;it's hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There it was, rising, falling! Music! Why did it so move one even when, as
      now, it was the voice of insult! And suddenly she thought: &ldquo;He will expect
      me to go out there again and play for him. But I will not, never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her baby down, went into her bedroom, and changed hastily into a
      teagown for the evening, ready to go downstairs. A little shepherdess in
      china on the mantel-shelf attracted her attention, and she took it in her
      hand. She had bought it three and more years ago, when she first came to
      London, at the beginning of that time of girl-gaiety when all life seemed
      a long cotillion, and she its leader. Its cool daintiness made it seem the
      symbol of another world, a world without depths or shadows, a world that
      did not feel&mdash;a happy world!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not long to wait before he tapped on the drawing-room window. She
      got up from the tea-table to let him in. Why do faces gazing in through
      glass from darkness always look hungry&mdash;searching, appealing for what
      you have and they have not? And while she was undoing the latch she
      thought: 'What am I going to say? I feel nothing!' The ardour of his gaze,
      voice, hands seemed to her so false as to be almost comic; even more
      comically false his look of disappointment when she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please take care; I'm still brittle!&rdquo; Then she sat down again and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have some tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tea! I have you back, and you ask me if I will have tea Gyp! Do you know
      what I have felt like all this time? No; you don't know. You know nothing
      of me&mdash;do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile of sheer irony formed on her lips&mdash;without her knowing it was
      there. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had a good time at Count Rosek's?&rdquo; And, without her will,
      against her will, the words slipped out: &ldquo;I'm afraid you've missed the
      music-room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His stare wavered; he began to walk up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missed! Missed everything! I have been very miserable, Gyp. You've no
      idea how miserable. Yes, miserable, miserable, miserable!&rdquo; With each
      repetition of that word, his voice grew gayer. And kneeling down in front
      of her, he stretched his long arms round her till they met behind her
      waist: &ldquo;Ah, my Gyp! I shall be a different being, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gyp went on smiling. Between that, and stabbing these false raptures
      to the heart, there seemed to be nothing she could do. The moment his
      hands relaxed, she got up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know there's a baby in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the baby! I'd forgotten. Let's go up and see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could feel him thinking: 'Perhaps it will make her nice to me!' He
      turned suddenly and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood with her eyes shut, seeing the divan in the music-room and the
      girl's arm shivering. Then, going to the piano, she began with all her
      might to play a Chopin polonaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening they dined out, and went to &ldquo;The Tales of Hoffmann.&rdquo; By such
      devices it was possible to put off a little longer what she was going to
      do. During the drive home in the dark cab, she shrank away into her
      corner, pretending that his arm would hurt her dress; her exasperated
      nerves were already overstrung. Twice she was on the very point of crying
      out: &ldquo;I am not Daphne Wing!&rdquo; But each time pride strangled the words in
      her throat. And yet they would have to come. What other reason could she
      find to keep him from her room?
    </p>
    <p>
      But when in her mirror she saw him standing behind her&mdash;he had crept
      into the bedroom like a cat&mdash;fierceness came into her. She could see
      the blood rush up in her own white face, and, turning round she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Gustav, go out to the music-room if you want a companion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He recoiled against the foot of the bed and stared at her haggardly, and
      Gyp, turning back to her mirror, went on quietly taking the pins out of
      her hair. For fully a minute she could see him leaning there, moving his
      head and hands as though in pain. Then, to her surprise, he went. And a
      vague feeling of compunction mingled with her sense of deliverance. She
      lay awake a long time, watching the fire-glow brighten and darken on the
      ceiling, tunes from &ldquo;The Tales of Hoffmann&rdquo; running in her head; thoughts
      and fancies crisscrossing in her excited brain. Falling asleep at last,
      she dreamed she was feeding doves out of her hand, and one of them was
      Daphne Wing. She woke with a start. The fire still burned, and by its
      light she saw him crouching at the foot of the bed, just as he had on
      their wedding-night&mdash;the same hungry yearning in his face, and an arm
      outstretched. Before she could speak, he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gyp, you don't understand! All that is nothing&mdash;it is only you I
      want&mdash;always. I am a fool who cannot control himself. Think! It's a
      long time since you went away from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said, in a hard voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't want to have a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but now you have it you are glad. Don't be unmerciful, my Gyp! It is
      like you to be merciful. That girl&mdash;it is all over&mdash;I swear&mdash;I
      promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand touched her foot through the soft eiderdown. Gyp thought: 'Why
      does he come and whine to me like this? He has no dignity&mdash;none!' And
      she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you promise? You have made the girl love you. I saw her face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew his hand back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, staring at her. Presently he began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a little fool. I do not care for the whole of her as much as I
      care for your one finger. What does it matter what one does in that way if
      one does not care? The soul, not the body, is faithful. A man satisfies
      appetite&mdash;it is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not; but it is something when it makes others miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it made you miserable, my Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice had a ring of hope. She answered, startled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? No&mdash;her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her? Ho! It is an experience for her&mdash;it is life. It will do her no
      harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nothing will do anybody harm if it gives you pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that bitter retort, he kept silence a long time, now and then heaving a
      long sigh. His words kept sounding in her heart: &ldquo;The soul, not the body,
      is faithful.&rdquo; Was he, after all, more faithful to her than she had ever
      been, could ever be&mdash;who did not love, had never loved him? What
      right had she to talk, who had married him out of vanity, out of&mdash;what?
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp! Forgive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a sigh, and turned away her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down against the eider-down. She could hear him drawing long,
      sobbing breaths, and, in the midst of her lassitude and hopelessness, a
      sort of pity stirred her. What did it matter? She said, in a choked voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      XIV
    </p>
    <p>
      The human creature has wonderful power of putting up with things. Gyp
      never really believed that Daphne Wing was of the past. Her sceptical
      instinct told her that what Fiorsen might honestly mean to do was very
      different from what he would do under stress of opportunity carefully put
      within his reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since her return, Rosek had begun to come again, very careful not to
      repeat his mistake, but not deceiving her at all. Though his self-control
      was as great as Fiorsen's was small, she felt he had not given up his
      pursuit of her, and would take very good care that Daphne Wing was
      afforded every chance of being with her husband. But pride never let her
      allude to the girl. Besides, what good to speak of her? They would both
      lie&mdash;Rosek, because he obviously saw the mistaken line of his first
      attack; Fiorsen, because his temperament did not permit him to suffer by
      speaking the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having set herself to endure, she found she must live in the moment, never
      think of the future, never think much of anything. Fortunately, nothing so
      conduces to vacuity as a baby. She gave herself up to it with desperation.
      It was a good baby, silent, somewhat understanding. In watching its face,
      and feeling it warm against her, Gyp succeeded daily in getting away into
      the hypnotic state of mothers, and cows that chew the cud. But the baby
      slept a great deal, and much of its time was claimed by Betty. Those
      hours, and they were many, Gyp found difficult. She had lost interest in
      dress and household elegance, keeping just enough to satisfy her
      fastidiousness; money, too, was scarce, under the drain of Fiorsen's
      irregular requirements. If she read, she began almost at once to brood.
      She was cut off from the music-room, had not crossed its threshold since
      her discovery. Aunt Rosamund's efforts to take her into society were
      fruitless&mdash;all the effervescence was out of that, and, though her
      father came, he never stayed long for fear of meeting Fiorsen. In this
      condition of affairs, she turned more and more to her own music, and one
      morning, after she had come across some compositions of her girlhood, she
      made a resolution. That afternoon she dressed herself with pleasure, for
      the first time for months, and sallied forth into the February frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Edouard Harmost inhabited the ground floor of a house in the
      Marylebone Road. He received his pupils in a large back room overlooking a
      little sooty garden. A Walloon by extraction, and of great vitality, he
      grew old with difficulty, having a soft corner in his heart for women, and
      a passion for novelty, even for new music, that was unappeasable. Any
      fresh discovery would bring a tear rolling down his mahogany cheeks into
      his clipped grey beard, the while he played, singing wheezily to elucidate
      the wondrous novelty; or moved his head up and down, as if pumping.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gyp was shown into this well-remembered room he was seated, his
      yellow fingers buried in his stiff grey hair, grieving over a pupil who
      had just gone out. He did not immediately rise, but stared hard at Gyp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;my little old friend! She has come back! Now that
      is good!&rdquo; And, patting her hand he looked into her face, which had a
      warmth and brilliance rare to her in these days. Then, making for the
      mantelpiece, he took therefrom a bunch of Parma violets, evidently brought
      by his last pupil, and thrust them under her nose. &ldquo;Take them, take them&mdash;they
      were meant for me. Now&mdash;how much have you forgotten? Come!&rdquo; And,
      seizing her by the elbow, he almost forced her to the piano. &ldquo;Take off
      your furs. Sit down!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while Gyp was taking off her coat, he fixed on her his prominent brown
      eyes that rolled easily in their slightly blood-shot whites, under squared
      eyelids and cliffs of brow. She had on what Fiorsen called her
      &ldquo;humming-bird&rdquo; blouse&mdash;dark blue, shot with peacock and old rose, and
      looked very warm and soft under her fur cap. Monsieur Harmost's stare
      seemed to drink her in; yet that stare was not unpleasant, having in it
      only the rather sad yearning of old men who love beauty and know that
      their time for seeing it is getting short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play me the 'Carnival,'&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We shall soon see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp played. Twice he nodded; once he tapped his fingers on his teeth, and
      showed her the whites of his eyes&mdash;which meant: &ldquo;That will have to be
      very different!&rdquo; And once he grunted. When she had finished, he sat down
      beside her, took her hand in his, and, examining the fingers, began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, soon again! Spoiling yourself, playing for that fiddler! Trop
      sympathique! The back-bone, the back-bone&mdash;we shall improve that.
      Now, four hours a day for six weeks&mdash;and we shall have something
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a baby, Monsieur Harmost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Harmost bounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! That is a tragedy!&rdquo; Gyp shook her head. &ldquo;You like it? A baby! Does
      it not squall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu! Well, well, you are still as beautiful as ever. That is
      something. Now, what can you do with this baby? Could you get rid of it a
      little? This is serious. This is a talent in danger. A fiddler, and a
      baby! C'est beaucoup! C'est trop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp smiled. And Monsieur Harmost, whose exterior covered much sensibility,
      stroked her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have grown up, my little friend,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;Never mind;
      nothing is wasted. But a baby!&rdquo; And he chirruped his lips. &ldquo;Well; courage!
      We shall do things yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp turned her head away to hide the quiver of her lips. The scent of
      latakia tobacco that had soaked into things, and of old books and music, a
      dark smell, like Monsieur Harmost's complexion; the old brown curtains,
      the sooty little back garden beyond, with its cat-runs, and its one
      stunted sumach tree; the dark-brown stare of Monsieur Harmost's rolling
      eyes brought back that time of happiness, when she used to come week after
      week, full of gaiety and importance, and chatter away, basking in his
      brusque admiration and in music, all with the glamourous feeling that she
      was making him happy, and herself happy, and going to play very finely
      some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Monsieur Harmost, softly gruff, as if he knew what she was
      feeling, increased her emotion; her breast heaved under the humming-bird
      blouse, water came into her eyes, and more than ever her lips quivered. He
      was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come! The only thing we cannot cure is age. You were right to come,
      my child. Music is your proper air. If things are not all what they ought
      to be, you shall soon forget. In music&mdash;in music, we can get away.
      After all, my little friend, they cannot take our dreams from us&mdash;not
      even a wife, not even a husband can do that. Come, we shall have good
      times yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gyp, with a violent effort, threw off that sudden weakness. From those
      who serve art devotedly there radiates a kind of glamour. She left
      Monsieur Harmost that afternoon, infected by his passion for music. Poetic
      justice&mdash;on which all homeopathy is founded&mdash;was at work to try
      and cure her life by a dose of what had spoiled it. To music, she now gave
      all the hours she could spare. She went to him twice a week, determining
      to get on, but uneasy at the expense, for monetary conditions were ever
      more embarrassed. At home, she practised steadily and worked hard at
      composition. She finished several songs and studies during the spring and
      summer, and left still more unfinished. Monsieur Harmost was tolerant of
      these efforts, seeming to know that harsh criticism or disapproval would
      cut her impulse down, as frost cuts the life of flowers. Besides, there
      was always something fresh and individual in her things. He asked her one
      day:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your husband think of these?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp was silent a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't show them to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She never had; she instinctively kept back the knowledge that she
      composed, dreading his ruthlessness when anything grated on his nerves,
      and knowing that a breath of mockery would wither her belief in herself,
      frail enough plant already. The only person, besides her master, to whom
      she confided her efforts was&mdash;strangely enough&mdash;Rosek. But he
      had surprised her one day copying out some music, and said at once: &ldquo;I
      knew. I was certain you composed. Ah, do play it to me! I am sure you have
      talent.&rdquo; The warmth with which he praised that little &ldquo;caprice&rdquo; was surely
      genuine; and she felt so grateful that she even played him others, and
      then a song for him to sing. From that day, he no longer seemed to her
      odious; she even began to have for him a certain friendliness, to be a
      little sorry, watching him, pale, trim, and sphinx-like, in her
      drawing-room or garden, getting no nearer to the fulfilment of his desire.
      He had never again made love to her, but she knew that at the least sign
      he would. His face and his invincible patience made him pathetic to her.
      Women such as Gyp cannot actively dislike those who admire them greatly.
      She consulted him about Fiorsen's debts. There were hundreds of pounds
      owing, it seemed, and, in addition, much to Rosek himself. The thought of
      these debts weighed unbearably on her. Why did he, HOW did he get into
      debt like this? What became of the money he earned? His fees, this summer,
      were good enough. There was such a feeling of degradation about debt. It
      was, somehow, so underbred to owe money to all sorts of people. Was it on
      that girl, on other women, that he spent it all? Or was it simply that his
      nature had holes in every pocket?
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching Fiorsen closely, that spring and early summer, she was conscious
      of a change, a sort of loosening, something in him had given way&mdash;as
      when, in winding a watch, the key turns on and on, the ratchet being
      broken. Yet he was certainly working hard&mdash;perhaps harder than ever.
      She would hear him, across the garden, going over and over a passage, as
      if he never would be satisfied. But his playing seemed to her to have lost
      its fire and sweep; to be stale, and as if disillusioned. It was all as
      though he had said to himself: &ldquo;What's the use?&rdquo; In his face, too, there
      was a change. She knew&mdash;she was certain that he was drinking
      secretly. Was it his failure with her? Was it the girl? Was it simply
      heredity from a hard-drinking ancestry?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp never faced these questions. To face them would mean useless
      discussion, useless admission that she could not love him, useless
      asseveration from him about the girl, which she would not believe, useless
      denials of all sorts. Hopeless!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very irritable, and seemed especially to resent her music lessons,
      alluding to them with a sort of sneering impatience. She felt that he
      despised them as amateurish, and secretly resented it. He was often
      impatient, too, of the time she gave to the baby. His own conduct with the
      little creature was like all the rest of him. He would go to the nursery,
      much to Betty's alarm, and take up the baby; be charming with it for about
      ten minutes, then suddenly dump it back into its cradle, stare at it
      gloomily or utter a laugh, and go out. Sometimes, he would come up when
      Gyp was there, and after watching her a little in silence, almost drag her
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suffering always from the guilty consciousness of having no love for him,
      and ever more and more from her sense that, instead of saving him she was,
      as it were, pushing him down-hill&mdash;ironical nemesis for vanity!&mdash;Gyp
      was ever more and more compliant to his whims, trying to make up. But this
      compliance, when all the time she felt further and further away, was
      straining her to breaking-point. Hers was a nature that goes on passively
      enduring till something snaps; after that&mdash;no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those months of spring and summer were like a long spell of drought, when
      moisture gathers far away, coming nearer, nearer, till, at last, the
      deluge bursts and sweeps the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      XV
    </p>
    <p>
      The tenth of July that year was as the first day of summer. There had been
      much fine weather, but always easterly or northerly; now, after a broken,
      rainy fortnight, the sun had come in full summer warmth with a gentle
      breeze, drifting here and there scent of the opening lime blossom. In the
      garden, under the trees at the far end, Betty sewed at a garment, and the
      baby in her perambulator had her seventh morning sleep. Gyp stood before a
      bed of pansies and sweet peas. How monkeyish the pansies' faces! The sweet
      peas, too, were like tiny bright birds fastened to green perches swaying
      with the wind. And their little green tridents, growing out from the
      queer, flat stems, resembled the antennae of insects. Each of these bright
      frail, growing things had life and individuality like herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of footsteps on the gravel made her turn. Rosek was coming from
      the drawing-room window. Rather startled, Gyp looked at him over her
      shoulder. What had brought him at eleven o'clock in the morning? He came
      up to her, bowed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to see Gustav. He's not up yet, it seems. I thought I would speak
      to you first. Can we talk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hesitating just a second, Gyp drew off her gardening-gloves:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! Here? Or in the drawing-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosek answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the drawing-room, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint tremor passed through her, but she led the way, and seated herself
      where she could see Betty and the baby. Rosek stood looking down at her;
      his stillness, the sweetish gravity of his well-cut lips, his spotless
      dandyism stirred in Gyp a kind of unwilling admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad business, I'm afraid. Something must be done at once. I have been
      trying to arrange things, but they will not wait. They are even
      threatening to sell up this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sense of outrage, Gyp cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly everything here is mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosek shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lease is in his name&mdash;you are his wife. They can do it, I assure
      you.&rdquo; A sort of shadow passed over his face, and he added: &ldquo;I cannot help
      him any more&mdash;just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp shook her head quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;of course! You ought not to have helped him at all. I can't bear&mdash;&rdquo;
       He bowed, and she stopped, ashamed. &ldquo;How much does he owe altogether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About thirteen hundred pounds. It isn't much, of course. But there is
      something else&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosek nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid to tell you; you will think again perhaps that I am trying to
      make capital out of it. I can read your thoughts, you see. I cannot afford
      that you should think that, this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp made a little movement as though putting away his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; tell me, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosek shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a man called Wagge, an undertaker&mdash;the father of someone
      you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daphne Wing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. A child is coming. They have made her tell. It means the cancelling
      of her engagements, of course&mdash;and other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp uttered a little laugh; then she said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me, please, what this Mr.&mdash;Wagge can do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Rosek shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is rabid&mdash;a rabid man of his class is dangerous. A lot of money
      will be wanted, I should think&mdash;some blood, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved swiftly to her, and said very low:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp, it is a year since I told you of this. You did not believe me then.
      I told you, too, that I loved you. I love you more, now, a hundred times!
      Don't move! I am going up to Gustav.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and Gyp thought he was really going; but he stopped and came
      back past the line of the window. The expression of his face was quite
      changed, so hungry that, for a moment, she felt sorry for him. And that
      must have shown in her face, for he suddenly caught at her, and tried to
      kiss her lips; she wrenched back, and he could only reach her throat, but
      that he kissed furiously. Letting her go as suddenly, he bent his head and
      went out without a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp stood wiping his kisses off her throat with the back of her hand,
      dumbly, mechanically thinking: &ldquo;What have I done to be treated like this?
      What HAVE I done?&rdquo; No answer came. And such rage against men flared up
      that she just stood there, twisting her garden-gloves in her hands, and
      biting the lips he would have kissed. Then, going to her bureau, she took
      up her address book and looked for the name: Wing, 88, Frankland Street,
      Fulham. Unhooking her little bag from off the back of the chair, she put
      her cheque-book into it. Then, taking care to make no sound, she passed
      into the hall, caught up her sunshade, and went out, closing the door
      without noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked quickly toward Baker Street. Her gardening-hat was right
      enough, but she had come out without gloves, and must go into the first
      shop and buy a pair. In the choosing of them, she forgot her emotions for
      a minute. Out in the street again, they came back as bitterly as ever. And
      the day was so beautiful&mdash;the sun bright, the sky blue, the clouds
      dazzling white; from the top of her 'bus she could see all its brilliance.
      There rose up before her the memory of the man who had kissed her arm at
      the first ball. And now&mdash;this! But, mixed with her rage, a sort of
      unwilling compassion and fellow feeling kept rising for that girl, that
      silly, sugar-plum girl, brought to such a pass by&mdash;her husband. These
      feelings sustained her through that voyage to Fulham. She got down at the
      nearest corner, walked up a widish street of narrow grey houses till she
      came to number eighty-eight. On that newly scrubbed step, waiting for the
      door to open, she very nearly turned and fled. What exactly had she come
      to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened by a servant in an untidy frock. Mutton! The smell of
      mutton&mdash;there it was, just as the girl had said!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Miss&mdash;Miss Daphne Wing at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that peculiar &ldquo;I've given it up&rdquo; voice of domestics in small
      households, the servant answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Miss Disey's in. D'you want to see 'er? What nyme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp produced her card. The maid looked at it, at Gyp, and at two
      brown-painted doors, as much as to say, &ldquo;Where will you have it?&rdquo; Then,
      opening the first of them, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tyke a seat, please; I'll fetch her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp went in. In the middle of what was clearly the dining-room, she tried
      to subdue the tremor of her limbs and a sense of nausea. The table against
      which her hand rested was covered with red baize, no doubt to keep the
      stains of mutton from penetrating to the wood. On the mahogany sideboard
      reposed a cruet-stand and a green dish of very red apples. A bamboo-framed
      talc screen painted with white and yellow marguerites stood before a
      fireplace filled with pampas-grass dyed red. The chairs were of red
      morocco, the curtains a brownish-red, the walls green, and on them hung a
      set of Landseer prints. The peculiar sensation which red and green in
      juxtaposition produce on the sensitive was added to Gyp's distress. And,
      suddenly, her eyes lighted on a little deep-blue china bowl. It stood on a
      black stand on the mantel-piece, with nothing in it. To Gyp, in this room
      of red and green, with the smell of mutton creeping in, that bowl was like
      the crystallized whiff of another world. Daphne Wing&mdash;not Daisy Wagge&mdash;had
      surely put it there! And, somehow, it touched her&mdash;emblem of stifled
      beauty, emblem of all that the girl had tried to pour out to her that
      August afternoon in her garden nearly a year ago. Thin Eastern china, good
      and really beautiful! A wonder they allowed it to pollute this room!
    </p>
    <p>
      A sigh made her turn round. With her back against the door and a white,
      scared face, the girl was standing. Gyp thought: 'She has suffered
      horribly.' And, going impulsively up to her, she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing sighed out: &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen!&rdquo; and, bending over that hand,
      kissed it. Gyp saw that her new glove was wet. Then the girl relapsed, her
      feet a little forward, her head a little forward, her back against the
      door. Gyp, who knew why she stood thus, was swept again by those two
      emotions&mdash;rage against men, and fellow feeling for one about to go
      through what she herself had just endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; she said, gently; &ldquo;only, what's to be done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing put her hands up over her white face and sobbed. She sobbed so
      quietly but so terribly deeply that Gyp herself had the utmost difficulty
      not to cry. It was the sobbing of real despair by a creature bereft of
      hope and strength, above all, of love&mdash;the sort of weeping which is
      drawn from desolate, suffering souls only by the touch of fellow feeling.
      And, instead of making Gyp glad or satisfying her sense of justice, it
      filled her with more rage against her husband&mdash;that he had taken this
      girl's infatuation for his pleasure and then thrown her away. She seemed
      to see him discarding that clinging, dove-fair girl, for cloying his
      senses and getting on his nerves, discarding her with caustic words, to
      abide alone the consequences of her infatuation. She put her hand timidly
      on that shaking shoulder, and stroked it. For a moment the sobbing
      stopped, and the girl said brokenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I do love him so!&rdquo; At those naive words, a painful wish
      to laugh seized on Gyp, making her shiver from head to foot. Daphne Wing
      saw it, and went on: &ldquo;I know&mdash;I know&mdash;it's awful; but I do&mdash;and
      now he&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo; Her quiet but really dreadful sobbing broke out
      again. And again Gyp began stroking and stroking her shoulder. &ldquo;And I have
      been so awful to you! Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, do forgive me, please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All Gyp could find to answer, was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes; that's nothing! Don't cry&mdash;don't cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very slowly the sobbing died away, till it was just a long shivering, but
      still the girl held her hands over her face and her face down. Gyp felt
      paralyzed. The unhappy girl, the red and green room, the smell of mutton&mdash;creeping!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, a little of that white face showed; the lips, no longer craving
      for sugar-plums, murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's you he&mdash;he&mdash;really loves all the time. And you don't love
      him&mdash;that's what's so funny&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I can't
      understand it. Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, if I could see him&mdash;just see him! He
      told me never to come again; and I haven't dared. I haven't seen him for
      three weeks&mdash;not since I told him about IT. What shall I do? What
      shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His being her own husband seemed as nothing to Gyp at that moment. She
      felt such pity and yet such violent revolt that any girl should want to
      crawl back to a man who had spurned her. Unconsciously, she had drawn
      herself up and pressed her lips together. The girl, who followed every
      movement, said piteously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't seem to have any pride. I don't mind what he does to me, or what
      he says, if only I can see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp's revolt yielded to her pity. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three months&mdash;and in this state of misery!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall do something desperate. Now that I can't dance, and THEY
      know, it's too awful! If I could see him, I wouldn't mind anything. But I
      know&mdash;I know he'll never want me again. Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I wish I
      was dead! I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A heavy sigh escaped Gyp, and, bending suddenly, she kissed the girl's
      forehead. Still that scent of orange blossom about her skin or hair, as
      when she asked whether she ought to love or not; as when she came,
      moth-like, from the tree-shade into the moonlight, spun, and fluttered,
      with her shadow spinning and fluttering before her. Gyp turned away,
      feeling that she must relieve the strain, and pointing to the bowl, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU put that there, I'm sure. It's beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl answered, with piteous eagerness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, would you like it? Do take it. Count Rosek gave it me.&rdquo; She started
      away from the door. &ldquo;Oh, that's papa. He'll be coming in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp heard a man clear his throat, and the rattle of an umbrella falling
      into a stand; the sight of the girl wilting and shrinking against the
      sideboard steadied her. Then the door opened, and Mr. Wagge entered. Short
      and thick, in black frock coat and trousers, and a greyish beard, he
      stared from one to the other. He looked what he was, an Englishman and a
      chapelgoer, nourished on sherry and mutton, who could and did make his own
      way in the world. His features, coloured, as from a deep liverishness,
      were thick, like his body, and not ill-natured, except for a sort of anger
      in his small, rather piggy grey eyes. He said in a voice permanently
      gruff, but impregnated with a species of professional ingratiation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es? Whom 'ave I&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Fiorsen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; The sound of his breathing could be heard distinctly; he twisted a
      chair round and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a seat, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Mr. Wagge's face a kind of deference seemed to struggle with some more
      primitive emotion. Taking out a large, black-edged handkerchief, he blew
      his nose, passed it freely over his visage, and turning to his daughter,
      muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned quickly, and the last glimpse of her white face whipped up
      Gyp's rage against men. When the door was shut, Mr. Wagge cleared his
      throat; the grating sound carried with it the suggestion of enormously
      thick linings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said more gruffly than ever:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask what 'as given us the honour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to see your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His little piggy eyes travelled from her face to her feet, to the walls of
      the room, to his own watch-chain, to his hands that had begun to rub
      themselves together, back to her breast, higher than which they dared not
      mount. Their infinite embarrassment struck Gyp. She could almost hear him
      thinking: 'Now, how can I discuss it with this attractive young female,
      wife of the scoundrel who's ruined my daughter? Delicate-that's what it
      is!' Then the words burst hoarsely from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is an unpleasant business, ma'am. I don't know what to say. Reelly I
      don't. It's awkward; it's very awkward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your daughter is desperately unhappy; and that can't be good for her just
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge's thick figure seemed to writhe. &ldquo;Pardon me, ma'am,&rdquo; he
      spluttered, &ldquo;but I must call your husband a scoundrel. I'm sorry to be
      impolite, but I must do it. If I had 'im 'ere, I don't know that I should
      be able to control myself&mdash;I don't indeed.&rdquo; Gyp made a movement of
      her gloved hands, which he seemed to interpret as sympathy, for he went on
      in a stream of husky utterance: &ldquo;It's a delicate thing before a lady, and
      she the injured party; but one has feelings. From the first I said this
      dancin' was in the face of Providence; but women have no more sense than
      an egg. Her mother she would have it; and now she's got it! Career,
      indeed! Pretty career! Daughter of mine! I tell you, ma'am, I'm angry;
      there's no other word for it&mdash;I'm angry. If that scoundrel comes
      within reach of me, I shall mark 'im&mdash;I'm not a young man, but I
      shall mark 'im. An' what to say to you, I'm sure I don't know. That my
      daughter should be'ave like that! Well, it's made a difference to me. An'
      now I suppose her name'll be dragged in the mud. I tell you frankly I
      'oped you wouldn't hear of it, because after all the girl's got her
      punishment. And this divorce-court&mdash;it's not nice&mdash;it's a
      horrible thing for respectable people. And, mind you, I won't see my girl
      married to that scoundrel, not if you do divorce 'im. No; she'll have her
      disgrace for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp, who had listened with her head a little bent, raised it suddenly, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'll be no public disgrace, Mr. Wagge, unless you make it yourself.
      If you send Daphne&mdash;Daisy&mdash;quietly away somewhere till her
      trouble's over, no one need know anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge, whose mouth had opened slightly, and whose breathing could
      certainly have been heard in the street, took a step forward and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand you to say that you're not goin' to take proceedings,
      ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp shuddered, and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge stood silent, slightly moving his face up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;it's more than she deserves; but I don't
      disguise it's a relief to me. And I must say, in a young lady like you,
      and&mdash;and handsome, it shows a Christian spirit.&rdquo; Again Gyp shivered,
      and shook her head. &ldquo;It does. You'll allow me to say so, as a man old
      enough to be your father&mdash;and a regular attendant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand. Gyp put her gloved hand into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very, very sorry. Please be nice to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge recoiled a little, and for some seconds stood ruefully rubbing
      his hands together and looking from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a domestic man,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;A domestic man in a serious line
      of life; and I never thought to have anything like this in my family&mdash;never!
      It's been&mdash;well, I can't tell you what it's been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp took up her sunshade. She felt that she must get away; at any moment
      he might say something she could not bear&mdash;and the smell of mutton
      rising fast!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said again; &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo;; and moved past him to the door.
      She heard him breathing hard as he followed her to open it, and thought:
      'If only&mdash;oh! please let him be silent till I get outside!' Mr. Wagge
      passed her and put his hand on the latch of the front door. His little
      piggy eyes scanned her almost timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'm very glad to have the privilege of your
      acquaintance; and, if I may say so, you 'ave&mdash;you 'ave my 'earty
      sympathy. Good-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door once shut behind her, Gyp took a long breath and walked swiftly
      away. Her cheeks were burning; and, with a craving for protection, she put
      up her sunshade. But the girl's white face came up again before her, and
      the sound of her words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I wish I was dead! I DO!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      XVI
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp walked on beneath her sunshade, making unconsciously for the peace of
      trees. Her mind was a whirl of impressions&mdash;Daphne Wing's figure
      against the door, Mr. Wagge's puggy grey-bearded countenance, the red
      pampas-grass, the blue bowl, Rosek's face swooping at her, her last
      glimpse of her baby asleep under the trees!
    </p>
    <p>
      She reached Kensington Gardens, turned into that walk renowned for the
      beauty of its flowers and the plainness of the people who frequent it, and
      sat down on a bench. It was near the luncheon-hour; nursemaids, dogs,
      perambulators, old gentlemen&mdash;all were hurrying a little toward their
      food. They glanced with critical surprise at this pretty young woman,
      leisured and lonely at such an hour, trying to find out what was wrong
      with her, as one naturally does with beauty&mdash;bow legs or something,
      for sure, to balance a face like that! But Gyp noticed none of them,
      except now and again a dog which sniffed her knees in passing. For months
      she had resolutely cultivated insensibility, resolutely refused to face
      reality; the barrier was forced now, and the flood had swept her away.
      &ldquo;Proceedings!&rdquo; Mr. Wagge had said. To those who shrink from letting their
      secret affairs be known even by their nearest friends, the notion of a
      public exhibition of troubles simply never comes, and it had certainly
      never come to Gyp. With a bitter smile she thought: 'I'm better off than
      she is, after all! Suppose I loved him, too? No, I never&mdash;never&mdash;want
      to love. Women who love suffer too much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat on that bench a long time before it came into her mind that she
      was due at Monsieur Harmost's for a music lesson at three o'clock. It was
      well past two already; and she set out across the grass. The summer day
      was full of murmurings of bees and flies, cooings of blissful pigeons, the
      soft swish and stir of leaves, and the scent of lime blossom under a sky
      so blue, with few white clouds slow, and calm, and full. Why be unhappy?
      And one of those spotty spaniel dogs, that have broad heads, with frizzy
      topknots, and are always rascals, smelt at her frock and moved round and
      round her, hoping that she would throw her sunshade on the water for him
      to fetch, this being in his view the only reason why anything was carried
      in the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found Monsieur Harmost fidgeting up and down the room, whose opened
      windows could not rid it of the smell of latakia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought you were not coming! You look pale; are you not
      well? Is it the heat? Or&rdquo;&mdash;he looked hard into her face&mdash;&ldquo;has
      someone hurt you, my little friend?&rdquo; Gyp shook her head. &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he
      went on irritably; &ldquo;you tell me nothing; you tell nobody nothing! You
      close up your pretty face like a flower at night. At your age, my child,
      one should make confidences; a secret grief is to music as the east wind
      to the stomach. Put off your mask for once.&rdquo; He came close to her. &ldquo;Tell
      me your troubles. It is a long time since I have been meaning to ask.
      Come! We are only once young; I want to see you happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gyp stood looking down. Would it be relief to pour her soul out? Would
      it? His brown eyes questioned her like an old dog's. She did not want to
      hurt one so kind. And yet&mdash;impossible!
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Harmost suddenly sat down at the piano. Resting his hands on the
      keys, he looked round at her, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in love with you, you know. Old men can be very much in love, but
      they know it is no good&mdash;that makes them endurable. Still, we like to
      feel of use to youth and beauty; it gives us a little warmth. Come; tell
      me your grief!&rdquo; He waited a moment, then said irritably: &ldquo;Well, well, we
      go to music then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was his habit to sit by her at the piano corner, but to-day he stood as
      if prepared to be exceptionally severe. And Gyp played, whether from
      overexcited nerves or from not having had any lunch, better than she had
      ever played. The Chopin polonaise in A flat, that song of revolution,
      which had always seemed so unattainable, went as if her fingers were being
      worked for her. When she had finished, Monsieur Harmost, bending forward,
      lifted one of her hands and put his lips to it. She felt the scrub of his
      little bristly beard, and raised her face with a deep sigh of
      satisfaction. A voice behind them said mockingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There, by the door, stood Fiorsen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Congratulations, madame! I have long wanted to see you under the
      inspiration of your&mdash;master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp's heart began to beat desperately. Monsieur Harmost had not moved. A
      faint grin slowly settled in his beard, but his eyes were startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen kissed the back of his own hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To this old Pantaloon you come to give your heart. Ho&mdash;what a
      lover!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp saw the old man quiver; she sprang up and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You brute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen ran forward, stretching out his arms toward Monsieur Harmost, as
      if to take him by the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man drew himself up. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are certainly
      drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp slipped between, right up to those outstretched hands till she could
      feel their knuckles against her. Had he gone mad? Would he strangle her?
      But her eyes never moved from his, and his began to waver; his hands
      dropped, and, with a kind of moan, he made for the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Harmost's voice behind her said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before you go, monsieur, give me some explanation of this imbecility!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen spun round, shook his fist, and went out muttering. They heard the
      front door slam. Gyp turned abruptly to the window, and there, in her
      agitation, she noticed little outside things as one does in moments of
      bewildered anger. Even into that back yard, summer had crept. The leaves
      of the sumach-tree were glistening; in a three-cornered little patch of
      sunlight, a black cat with a blue ribbon round its neck was basking. The
      voice of one hawking strawberries drifted melancholy from a side street.
      She was conscious that Monsieur Harmost was standing very still, with a
      hand pressed to his mouth, and she felt a perfect passion of compunction
      and anger. That kind and harmless old man&mdash;to be so insulted! This
      was indeed the culmination of all Gustav's outrages! She would never
      forgive him this! For he had insulted her as well, beyond what pride or
      meekness could put up with. She turned, and, running up to the old man,
      put both her hands into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so awfully sorry. Good-bye, dear, dear Monsieur Harmost; I shall come
      on Friday!&rdquo; And, before he could stop her, she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dived into the traffic; but, just as she reached the pavement on the
      other side, felt her dress plucked and saw Fiorsen just behind her. She
      shook herself free and walked swiftly on. Was he going to make a scene in
      the street? Again he caught her arm. She stopped dead, faced round on him,
      and said, in an icy voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't make scenes in the street, and don't follow me like this. If
      you want to talk to me, you can&mdash;at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, very calmly, she turned and walked on. But he was still following
      her, some paces off. She did not quicken her steps, and to the first
      taxicab driver that passed she made a sign, and saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bury Street&mdash;quick!&rdquo; got in. She saw Fiorsen rush forward, too late
      to stop her. He threw up his hand and stood still, his face deadly white
      under his broad-brimmed hat. She was far too angry and upset to care.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment she turned to the window at Monsieur Harmost's, she had
      determined to go to her father's. She would not go back to Fiorsen; and
      the one thought that filled her mind was how to get Betty and her baby.
      Nearly four! Dad was almost sure to be at his club. And leaning out, she
      said: &ldquo;No; Hyde Park Corner, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hall porter, who knew her, after calling to a page-boy: &ldquo;Major Winton&mdash;sharp,
      now!&rdquo; came specially out of his box to offer her a seat and The Times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp sat with it on her knee, vaguely taking in her surroundings&mdash;a
      thin old gentleman anxiously weighing himself in a corner, a white-calved
      footman crossing with a tea-tray; a number of hats on pegs; the
      green-baize board with its white rows of tapelike paper, and three members
      standing before it. One of them, a tall, stout, good-humoured-looking man
      in pince-nez and a white waistcoat, becoming conscious, removed his straw
      hat and took up a position whence, without staring, he could gaze at her;
      and Gyp knew, without ever seeming to glance at him, that he found her to
      his liking. She saw her father's unhurried figure passing that little
      group, all of whom were conscious now, and eager to get away out of this
      sanctum of masculinity, she met him at the top of the low steps, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk to you, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a quick look, selected his hat, and followed to the door. In
      the cab, he put his hand on hers and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But all she could get out was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to come back to you. I can't go on there. It's&mdash;it's&mdash;I've
      come to an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand pressed hers tightly, as if he were trying to save her the need
      for saying more. Gyp went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must get baby; I'm terrified that he'll try to keep her, to get me
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he at home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I haven't told him that I'm going to leave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton looked at his watch and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the baby ever go out as late as this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; after tea. It's cooler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take this cab on, then. You stay and get the room ready for her.
      Don't worry, and don't go out till I return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Gyp thought: 'How wonderful of him not to have asked a single
      question.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab stopped at the Bury Street door. She took his hand, put it to her
      cheek, and got out. He said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want the dogs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh, yes! He doesn't care for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. There'll be time to get you in some things for the night after
      I come back. I shan't run any risks to-day. Make Mrs. Markey give you
      tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp watched the cab gather way again, saw him wave his hand; then, with a
      deep sigh, half anxiety, half relief, she rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      XVII
    </p>
    <p>
      When the cab debouched again into St. James' Street, Winton gave the
      order: &ldquo;Quick as you can!&rdquo; One could think better going fast! A little red
      had come into his brown cheeks; his eyes under their half-drawn lids had a
      keener light; his lips were tightly closed; he looked as he did when a fox
      was breaking cover. Gyp could do no wrong, or, if she could, he would
      stand by her in it as a matter of course. But he was going to take no
      risks&mdash;make no frontal attack. Time for that later, if necessary. He
      had better nerves than most people, and that kind of steely determination
      and resource which makes many Englishmen of his class formidable in small
      operations. He kept his cab at the door, rang, and asked for Gyp, with a
      kind of pleasure in his ruse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's not in yet, sir. Mr. Fiorsen's in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! And baby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come in and see her. In the garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dogs there, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. And will you have tea, please, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo; How to effect this withdrawal without causing gossip, and
      yet avoid suspicion of collusion with Gyp? And he added: &ldquo;Unless Mrs.
      Fiorsen comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Passing out into the garden, he became aware that Fiorsen was at the
      dining-room window watching him, and decided to make no sign that he knew
      this. The baby was under the trees at the far end, and the dogs came
      rushing thence with a fury which lasted till they came within scent of
      him. Winton went leisurely up to the perambulator, and, saluting Betty,
      looked down at his grandchild. She lay under an awning of muslin, for fear
      of flies, and was awake. Her solemn, large brown eyes, already like Gyp's,
      regarded him with gravity. Clucking to her once or twice, as is the
      custom, he moved so as to face the house. In this position, he had Betty
      with her back to it. And he said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm here with a message from your mistress, Betty. Keep your head; don't
      look round, but listen to me. She's at Bury Street and going to stay
      there; she wants you and baby and the dogs.&rdquo; The stout woman's eyes grew
      round and her mouth opened. Winton put his hand on the perambulator.
      &ldquo;Steady, now! Go out as usual with this thing. It's about your time; and
      wait for me at the turning to Regent's Park. I'll come on in my cab and
      pick you all up. Don't get flurried; don't take anything; do exactly as
      you usually would. Understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is not in the nature of stout women with babies in their charge to
      receive such an order without question. Her colour, and the heaving of
      that billowy bosom made Winton add quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Betty, pull yourself together; Gyp wants you. I'll tell you all
      about it in the cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman, still heaving vaguely, could only stammer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. Poor little thing! What about its night-things? And Miss
      Gyp's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Conscious of that figure still at the window, Winton made some passes with
      his fingers at the baby, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind them. As soon as you see me at the drawing-room window, get
      ready and go. Eyes front, Betty; don't look round; I'll cover your
      retreat! Don't fail Gyp now. Pull yourself together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh that could have been heard in Kensington, Betty murmured:
      &ldquo;Very well, sir; oh dear!&rdquo; and began to adjust the strings of her bonnet.
      With nods, as if he had been the recipient of some sage remarks about the
      baby, Winton saluted, and began his march again towards the house. He
      carefully kept his eyes to this side and to that, as if examining the
      flowers, but noted all the same that Fiorsen had receded from the window.
      Rapid thought told him that the fellow would come back there to see if he
      were gone, and he placed himself before a rose-bush, where, at that
      reappearance, he could make a sign of recognition. Sure enough, he came;
      and Winton quietly raising his hand to the salute passed on through the
      drawing-room window. He went quickly into the hall, listened a second, and
      opened the dining-room door. Fiorsen was pacing up and down, pale and
      restless. He came to a standstill and stared haggardly at Winton, who
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you? Gyp not in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in the sound of that &ldquo;No&rdquo; touched Winton with a vague&mdash;a
      very vague&mdash;compunction. To be left by Gyp! Then his heart hardened
      again. The fellow was a rotter&mdash;he was sure of it, had always been
      sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baby looks well,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen turned and began to pace up and down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Gyp? I want her to come in. I want her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton took out his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not late.&rdquo; And suddenly he felt a great aversion for the part he was
      playing. To get the baby; to make Gyp safe&mdash;yes! But, somehow, not
      this pretence that he knew nothing about it. He turned on his heel and
      walked out. It imperilled everything; but he couldn't help it. He could
      not stay and go on prevaricating like this. Had that woman got clear? He
      went back into the drawing-room. There they were&mdash;just passing the
      side of the house. Five minutes, and they would be down at the turning. He
      stood at the window, waiting. If only that fellow did not come in! Through
      the partition wall he could hear him still tramping up and down the
      dining-room. What a long time a minute was! Three had gone when he heard
      the dining-room door opened, and Fiorsen crossing the hall to the front
      door. What was he after, standing there as if listening? And suddenly he
      heard him sigh. It was just such a sound as many times, in the long-past
      days, had escaped himself, waiting, listening for footsteps, in parched
      and sickening anxiety. Did this fellow then really love&mdash;almost as he
      had loved? And in revolt at spying on him like this, he advanced and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I won't wait any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen started; he had evidently supposed himself alone. And Winton
      thought: 'By Jove! he does look bad!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; he said; but the words: &ldquo;Give my love to Gyp,&rdquo; perished on
      their way up to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; Fiorsen echoed. And Winton went out under the trellis,
      conscious of that forlorn figure still standing at the half-opened door.
      Betty was nowhere in sight; she must have reached the turning. His mission
      had succeeded, but he felt no elation. Round the corner, he picked up his
      convoy, and, with the perambulator hoisted on to the taxi, journeyed on at
      speed. He had said he would explain in the cab, but the only remark he
      made was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll all go down to Mildenham to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Betty, who had feared him ever since their encounter so many years
      ago, eyed his profile, without daring to ask questions. Before he reached
      home, Winton stopped at a post-office, and sent this telegram:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp and the baby are with me letter follows.&mdash;WINTON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It salved a conscience on which that fellow's figure in the doorway
      weighed; besides, it was necessary, lest Fiorsen should go to the police.
      The rest must wait till he had talked with Gyp.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much to do, and it was late before they dined, and not till
      Markey had withdrawn could they begin their talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close to the open windows where Markey had placed two hydrangea plants&mdash;just
      bought on his own responsibility, in token of silent satisfaction&mdash;Gyp
      began. She kept nothing back, recounting the whole miserable fiasco of her
      marriage. When she came to Daphne Wing and her discovery in the
      music-room, she could see the glowing end of her father's cigar move
      convulsively. That insult to his adored one seemed to Winton so
      inconceivable that, for a moment, he stopped her recital by getting up to
      pace the room. In her own house&mdash;her own house! And&mdash;after that,
      she had gone on with him! He came back to his chair and did not interrupt
      again, but his stillness almost frightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming to the incidents of the day itself, she hesitated. Must she tell
      him, too, of Rosek&mdash;was it wise, or necessary? The all-or-nothing
      candour that was part of her nature prevailed, and she went straight on,
      and, save for the feverish jerking of his evening shoe, Winton made no
      sign. When she had finished, he got up and slowly extinguished the end of
      his cigar against the window-sill; then looking at her lying back in her
      chair as if exhausted, he said: &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; and turned his face away to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that hour before the theatres rose, a lull brooded in the London
      streets; in this quiet narrow one, the town's hum was only broken by the
      clack of a half-drunken woman bickering at her man as they lurched along
      for home, and the strains of a street musician's fiddle, trying to make up
      for a blank day. The sound vaguely irritated Winton, reminding him of
      those two damnable foreigners by whom she had been so treated. To have
      them at the point of a sword or pistol&mdash;to teach them a lesson! He
      heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, I should like to pay his debts. Then things would be as they were
      when I married him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He emitted an exasperated sound. He did not believe in heaping coals of
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to make sure, too, that the girl is all right till she's over her
      trouble. Perhaps I could use some of that&mdash;that other money, if mine
      is all tied up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was sheer anger, not disapproval of her impulse, that made him
      hesitate; money and revenge would never be associated in his mind. Gyp
      went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to feel as if I'd never let him marry me. Perhaps his debts are
      all part of that&mdash;who knows? Please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton looked at her. How like&mdash;when she said that &ldquo;Please!&rdquo; How like&mdash;her
      figure sunk back in the old chair, and the face lifted in shadow! A sort
      of exultation came to him. He had got her back&mdash;had got her back!
    </p>
    <p>
      XVIII
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen's bedroom was&mdash;as the maid would remark&mdash;&ldquo;a proper
      pigsty&rdquo;&mdash;until he was out of it and it could be renovated each day.
      He had a talent for disorder, so that the room looked as if three men
      instead of one had gone to bed in it. Clothes and shoes, brushes, water,
      tumblers, breakfast-tray, newspapers, French novels, and cigarette-ends&mdash;none
      were ever where they should have been; and the stale fumes from the many
      cigarettes he smoked before getting up incommoded anyone whose duty it was
      to take him tea and shaving-water. When, on that first real summer day,
      the maid had brought Rosek up to him, he had been lying a long time on his
      back, dreamily watching the smoke from his cigarette and four flies
      waltzing in the sunlight that filtered through the green sun-blinds. This
      hour, before he rose, was his creative moment, when he could best see the
      form of music and feel inspiration for its rendering. Of late, he had been
      stale and wretched, all that side of him dull; but this morning he felt
      again the delicious stir of fancy, that vibrating, half-dreamy state when
      emotion seems so easily to find shape and the mind pierces through to new
      expression. Hearing the maid's knock, and her murmured: &ldquo;Count Rosek to
      see you, sir,&rdquo; he thought: 'What the devil does he want?' A larger nature,
      drifting without control, in contact with a smaller one, who knows his own
      mind exactly, will instinctively be irritable, though he may fail to grasp
      what his friend is after.
    </p>
    <p>
      And pushing the cigarette-box toward Rosek, he turned away his head. It
      would be money he had come about, or&mdash;that girl! That girl&mdash;he
      wished she was dead! Soft, clinging creature! A baby! God! What a fool he
      had been&mdash;ah, what a fool! Such absurdity! Unheard of! First Gyp&mdash;then
      her! He had tried to shake the girl off. As well try to shake off a burr!
      How she clung! He had been patient&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;patient and kind,
      but how go on when one was tired&mdash;tired of her&mdash;and wanting only
      Gyp, only his own wife? That was a funny thing! And now, when, for an hour
      or two, he had shaken free of worry, had been feeling happy&mdash;yes,
      happy&mdash;this fellow must come, and stand there with his face of a
      sphinx! And he said pettishly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Paul! sit down. What troubles have you brought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosek lit a cigarette but did not sit down. He struck even Fiorsen by his
      unsmiling pallor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better look out for Mr. Wagge, Gustav; he came to me yesterday.
      He has no music in his soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satan take Mr. Wagge! What can he do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a lawyer, but I imagine he can be unpleasant&mdash;the girl is
      young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen glared at him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you throw me that cursed girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosek answered, a little too steadily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You did. What was your game? You never do anything without a game.
      You know you did. Come; what was your game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like pleasure, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen said violently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here: I have done with your friendship&mdash;you are no friend to
      me. I have never really known you, and I should not wish to. It is
      finished. Leave me in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosek smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, that is all very well, but friendships are not finished like
      that. Moreover, you owe me a thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will pay it.&rdquo; Rosek's eyebrows mounted. &ldquo;I will. Gyp will lend it
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Is Gyp so fond of you as that? I thought she only loved her
      music-lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crouching forward with his knees drawn up, Fiorsen hissed out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk of Gyp! Get out of this! I will pay you your thousand pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosek, still smiling, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gustav, don't be a fool! With a violin to your shoulder, you are a man.
      Without&mdash;you are a child. Lie quiet, my friend, and think of Mr.
      Wagge. But you had better come and talk it over with me. Good-bye for the
      moment. Calm yourself.&rdquo; And, flipping the ash off his cigarette on to the
      tray by Fiorsen's elbow, he nodded and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen, who had leaped out of bed, put his hand to his head. The cursed
      fellow! Cursed be every one of them&mdash;the father and the girl, Rosek
      and all the other sharks! He went out on to the landing. The house was
      quite still below. Rosek had gone&mdash;good riddance! He called, &ldquo;Gyp!&rdquo;
       No answer. He went into her room. Its superlative daintiness struck his
      fancy. A scent of cyclamen! He looked out into the garden. There was the
      baby at the end, and that fat woman. No Gyp! Never in when she was wanted.
      Wagge! He shivered; and, going back into his bedroom, took a brandy-bottle
      from a locked cupboard and drank some. It steadied him; he locked up the
      cupboard again, and dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going out to the music-room, he stopped under the trees to make passes
      with his fingers at the baby. Sometimes he felt that it was an adorable
      little creature, with its big, dark eyes so like Gyp's. Sometimes it
      excited his disgust&mdash;a discoloured brat. This morning, while looking
      at it, he thought suddenly of the other that was coming&mdash;and
      grimaced. Catching Betty's stare of horrified amazement at the face he was
      making at her darling, he burst into a laugh and turned away into the
      music-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was keying up his violin, Gyp's conduct in never having come
      there for so long struck him as bitterly unjust. The girl&mdash;who cared
      about the wretched girl? As if she made any real difference! It was all so
      much deeper than that. Gyp had never loved him, never given him what he
      wanted, never quenched his thirst of her! That was the heart of it. No
      other woman he had ever had to do with had been like that&mdash;kept his
      thirst unquenched. No; he had always tired of them before they tired of
      him. She gave him nothing really&mdash;nothing! Had she no heart or did
      she give it elsewhere? What was that Paul had said about her
      music-lessons? And suddenly it struck him that he knew nothing, absolutely
      nothing, of where she went or what she did. She never told him anything.
      Music-lessons? Every day, nearly, she went out, was away for hours. The
      thought that she might go to the arms of another man made him put down his
      violin with a feeling of actual sickness. Why not? That deep and fearful
      whipping of the sexual instinct which makes the ache of jealousy so truly
      terrible was at its full in such a nature as Fiorsen's. He drew a long
      breath and shuddered. The remembrance of her fastidious pride, her
      candour, above all her passivity cut in across his fear. No, not Gyp!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to a little table whereon stood a tantalus, tumblers, and a
      syphon, and pouring out some brandy, drank. It steadied him. And he began
      to practise. He took a passage from Brahms' violin concerto and began to
      play it over and over. Suddenly, he found he was repeating the same flaws
      each time; he was not attending. The fingering of that thing was ghastly!
      Music-lessons! Why did she take them? Waste of time and money&mdash;she
      would never be anything but an amateur! Ugh! Unconsciously, he had stopped
      playing. Had she gone there to-day? It was past lunch-time. Perhaps she
      had come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put down his violin and went back to the house. No sign of her! The
      maid came to ask if he would lunch. No! Was the mistress to be in? She had
      not said. He went into the dining-room, ate a biscuit, and drank a brandy
      and soda. It steadied him. Lighting a cigarette, he came back to the
      drawing-room and sat down at Gyp's bureau. How tidy! On the little
      calendar, a pencil-cross was set against to-day&mdash;Wednesday, another
      against Friday. What for? Music-lessons! He reached to a pigeon-hole, and
      took out her address-book. &ldquo;H&mdash;Harmost, 305A, Marylebone Road,&rdquo; and
      against it the words in pencil, &ldquo;3 P.M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three o'clock. So that was her hour! His eyes rested idly on a little old
      coloured print of a Bacchante, with flowing green scarf, shaking a
      tambourine at a naked Cupid, who with a baby bow and arrow in his hands,
      was gazing up at her. He turned it over; on the back was written in a
      pointed, scriggly hand, &ldquo;To my little friend.&mdash;E. H.&rdquo; Fiorsen drew
      smoke deep down into his lungs, expelled it slowly, and went to the piano.
      He opened it and began to play, staring vacantly before him, the cigarette
      burned nearly to his lips. He went on, scarcely knowing what he played. At
      last he stopped, and sat dejected. A great artist? Often, nowadays, he did
      not care if he never touched a violin again. Tired of standing up before a
      sea of dull faces, seeing the blockheads knock their silly hands one
      against the other! Sick of the sameness of it all! Besides&mdash;besides,
      were his powers beginning to fail? What was happening to him of late?
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up, went into the dining-room, and drank some brandy. Gyp could not
      bear his drinking. Well, she shouldn't be out so much&mdash;taking
      music-lessons. Music-lessons! Nearly three o'clock. If he went for once
      and saw what she really did&mdash;Went, and offered her his escort home!
      An attention. It might please her. Better, anyway, than waiting here until
      she chose to come in with her face all closed up. He drank a little more
      brandy&mdash;ever so little&mdash;took his hat and went. Not far to walk,
      but the sun was hot, and he reached the house feeling rather dizzy. A
      maid-servant opened the door to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Mr. Fiorsen. Mrs. Fiorsen here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; will you wait?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why did she look at him like that? Ugly girl! How hateful ugly people
      were! When she was gone, he reopened the door of the waiting-room, and
      listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chopin! The polonaise in A flat. Good! Could that be Gyp? Very good! He
      moved out, down the passage, drawn on by her playing, and softly turned
      the handle. The music stopped. He went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Winton had left him, an hour and a half later that afternoon, Fiorsen
      continued to stand at the front door, swaying his body to and fro. The
      brandy-nurtured burst of jealousy which had made him insult his wife and
      old Monsieur Harmost had died suddenly when Gyp turned on him in the
      street and spoke in that icy voice; since then he had felt fear,
      increasing every minute. Would she forgive? To one who always acted on the
      impulse of the moment, so that he rarely knew afterward exactly what he
      had done, or whom hurt, Gyp's self-control had ever been mysterious and a
      little frightening. Where had she gone? Why did she not come in? Anxiety
      is like a ball that rolls down-hill, gathering momentum. Suppose she did
      not come back! But she must&mdash;there was the baby&mdash;their baby!
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, the thought of it gave him unalloyed satisfaction. He
      left the door, and, after drinking a glass to steady him, flung himself
      down on the sofa in the drawing-room. And while he lay there, the brandy
      warm within him, he thought: 'I will turn over a new leaf; give up drink,
      give up everything, send the baby into the country, take Gyp to Paris,
      Berlin, Vienna, Rome&mdash;anywhere out of this England, anywhere, away
      from that father of hers and all these stiff, dull folk! She will like
      that&mdash;she loves travelling!' Yes, they would be happy! Delicious
      nights&mdash;delicious days&mdash;air that did not weigh you down and make
      you feel that you must drink&mdash;real inspiration&mdash;real music! The
      acrid wood-smoke scent of Paris streets, the glistening cleanness of the
      Thiergarten, a serenading song in a Florence back street, fireflies in the
      summer dusk at Sorrento&mdash;he had intoxicating memories of them all!
      Slowly the warmth of the brandy died away, and, despite the heat, he felt
      chill and shuddery. He shut his eyes, thinking to sleep till she came in.
      But very soon he opened them, because&mdash;a thing usual with him of late&mdash;he
      saw such ugly things&mdash;faces, vivid, changing as he looked, growing
      ugly and uglier, becoming all holes&mdash;holes&mdash;horrible holes&mdash;Corruption&mdash;matted,
      twisted, dark human-tree-roots of faces! Horrible! He opened his eyes, for
      when he did that, they always went. It was very silent. No sound from
      above. No sound of the dogs. He would go up and see the baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was crossing the hall, there came a ring. He opened the door
      himself. A telegram! He tore the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp and the baby are with me letter follows.&mdash;WINTON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave a short laugh, shut the door in the boy's face, and ran up-stairs;
      why&mdash;heaven knew! There was nobody there now! Nobody! Did it mean
      that she had really left him&mdash;was not coming back? He stopped by the
      side of Gyp's bed, and flinging himself forward, lay across it, burying
      his face. And he sobbed, as men will, unmanned by drink. Had he lost her?
      Never to see her eyes closing and press his lips against them! Never to
      soak his senses in her loveliness! He leaped up, with the tears still wet
      on his face. Lost her? Absurd! That calm, prim, devilish Englishman, her
      father&mdash;he was to blame&mdash;he had worked it all&mdash;stealing the
      baby!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down-stairs and drank some brandy. It steadied him a little. What
      should he do? &ldquo;Letter follows.&rdquo; Drink, and wait? Go to Bury Street? No.
      Drink! Enjoy himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, and, catching up his hat, went out, walking furiously at
      first, then slower and slower, for his head began to whirl, and, taking a
      cab, was driven to a restaurant in Soho. He had eaten nothing but a
      biscuit since his breakfast, always a small matter, and ordered soup and a
      flask of their best Chianti&mdash;solids he could not face. More than two
      hours he sat, white and silent, perspiration on his forehead, now and then
      grinning and flourishing his fingers, to the amusement and sometimes the
      alarm of those sitting near. But for being known there, he would have been
      regarded with suspicion. About half-past nine, there being no more wine,
      he got up, put a piece of gold on the table, and went out without waiting
      for his change.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the streets, the lamps were lighted, but daylight was not quite gone.
      He walked unsteadily, toward Piccadilly. A girl of the town passed and
      looked up at him. Staring hard, he hooked his arm in hers without a word;
      it steadied him, and they walked on thus together. Suddenly he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, girl, are you happy?&rdquo; The girl stopped and tried to disengage her
      arm; a rather frightened look had come into her dark-eyed powdered face.
      Fiorsen laughed, and held it firm. &ldquo;When the unhappy meet, they walk
      together. Come on! You are just a little like my wife. Will you have a
      drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head, and, with a sudden movement, slipped her arm out
      of this madman's and dived away like a swallow through the pavement
      traffic. Fiorsen stood still and laughed with his head thrown back. The
      second time to-day. SHE had slipped from his grasp. Passers looked at him,
      amazed. The ugly devils! And with a grimace, he turned out of Piccadilly,
      past St. James's Church, making for Bury Street. They wouldn't let him in,
      of course&mdash;not they! But he would look at the windows; they had
      flower-boxes&mdash;flower-boxes! And, suddenly, he groaned aloud&mdash;he
      had thought of Gyp's figure busy among the flowers at home. Missing the
      right turning, he came in at the bottom of the street. A fiddler in the
      gutter was scraping away on an old violin. Fiorsen stopped to listen. Poor
      devil! &ldquo;Pagliacci!&rdquo; Going up to the man&mdash;dark, lame, very shabby, he
      took out some silver, and put his other hand on the man's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;lend me your fiddle. Here's money for you. Come; lend
      it to me. I am a great violinist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vraiment, monsieur!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Vraiment! Voyons! Donnez&mdash;un instant&mdash;vous verrez.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fiddler, doubting but hypnotized, handed him the fiddle; his dark face
      changed when he saw this stranger fling it up to his shoulder and the ways
      of his fingers with bow and strings. Fiorsen had begun to walk up the
      street, his eyes searching for the flower-boxes. He saw them, stopped, and
      began playing &ldquo;Che faro?&rdquo; He played it wonderfully on that poor fiddle;
      and the fiddler, who had followed at his elbow, stood watching him,
      uneasy, envious, but a little entranced. Sapristi! This tall, pale
      monsieur with the strange face and the eyes that looked drunk and the
      hollow chest, played like an angel! Ah, but it was not so easy as all that
      to make money in the streets of this sacred town! You might play like
      forty angels and not a copper! He had begun another tune&mdash;like little
      pluckings at your heart&mdash;tres joli&mdash;tout a fait ecoeurant! Ah,
      there it was&mdash;a monsieur as usual closing the window, drawing the
      curtains! Always same thing! The violin and the bow were thrust back into
      his hands; and the tall strange monsieur was off as if devils were after
      him&mdash;not badly drunk, that one! And not a sou thrown down! With an
      uneasy feeling that he had been involved in something that he did not
      understand, the lame, dark fiddler limped his way round the nearest
      corner, and for two streets at least did not stop. Then, counting the
      silver Fiorsen had put into his hand and carefully examining his fiddle,
      he used the word, &ldquo;Bigre!&rdquo; and started for home.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIX
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp hardly slept at all. Three times she got up, and, stealing to the
      door, looked in at her sleeping baby, whose face in its new bed she could
      just see by the night-light's glow. The afternoon had shaken her nerves.
      Nor was Betty's method of breathing while asleep conducive to the slumber
      of anything but babies. It was so hot, too, and the sound of the violin
      still in her ears. By that little air of Poise, she had known for certain
      it was Fiorsen; and her father's abrupt drawing of the curtains had
      clinched that certainty. If she had gone to the window and seen him, she
      would not have been half so deeply disturbed as she was by that echo of an
      old emotion. The link which yesterday she thought broken for good was
      reforged in some mysterious way. The sobbing of that old fiddle had been
      his way of saying, &ldquo;Forgive me; forgive!&rdquo; To leave him would have been so
      much easier if she had really hated him; but she did not. However
      difficult it may be to live with an artist, to hate him is quite as
      difficult. An artist is so flexible&mdash;only the rigid can be hated. She
      hated the things he did, and him when he was doing them; but afterward
      again could hate him no more than she could love him, and that was&mdash;not
      at all. Resolution and a sense of the practical began to come back with
      daylight. When things were hopeless, it was far better to recognize it and
      harden one's heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton, whose night had been almost as sleepless&mdash;to play like a
      beggar in the street, under his windows, had seemed to him the limit!&mdash;announced
      at breakfast that he must see his lawyer, make arrangements for the
      payment of Fiorsen's debts, and find out what could be done to secure Gyp
      against persecution. Some deed was probably necessary; he was vague on all
      such matters. In the meantime, neither Gyp nor the baby must go out. Gyp
      spent the morning writing and rewriting to Monsieur Harmost, trying to
      express her chagrin, but not saying that she had left Fiorsen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father came back from Westminster quiet and angry. He had with
      difficulty been made to understand that the baby was Fiorsen's property,
      so that, if the fellow claimed it, legally they would be unable to resist.
      The point opened the old wound, forced him to remember that his own
      daughter had once belonged to another&mdash;father. He had told the lawyer
      in a measured voice that he would see the fellow damned first, and had
      directed a deed of separation to be prepared, which should provide for the
      complete payment of Fiorsen's existing debts on condition that he left Gyp
      and the baby in peace. After telling Gyp this, he took an opportunity of
      going to the extempore nursery and standing by the baby's cradle. Until
      then, the little creature had only been of interest as part of Gyp; now it
      had for him an existence of its own&mdash;this tiny, dark-eyed creature,
      lying there, watching him so gravely, clutching his finger. Suddenly the
      baby smiled&mdash;not a beautiful smile, but it made on Winton an
      indelible impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wishing first to settle this matter of the deed, he put off going down to
      Mildenham; but &ldquo;not trusting those two scoundrels a yard&rdquo;&mdash;for he
      never failed to bracket Rosek and Fiorsen&mdash;he insisted that the baby
      should not go out without two attendants, and that Gyp should not go out
      alone. He carried precaution to the point of accompanying her to Monsieur
      Harmost's on the Friday afternoon, and expressed a wish to go in and shake
      hands with the old fellow. It was a queer meeting. Those two had as great
      difficulty in finding anything to say as though they were denizens of
      different planets. And indeed, there ARE two planets on this earth! When,
      after a minute or so of the friendliest embarrassment, he had retired to
      wait for her, Gyp sat down to her lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Harmost said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your letter was very kind, my little friend&mdash;and your father is very
      kind. But, after all, it was a compliment your husband paid me.&rdquo; His smile
      smote Gyp; it seemed to sum up so many resignations. &ldquo;So you stay again
      with your father!&rdquo; And, looking at her very hard with his melancholy brown
      eyes, &ldquo;When will you find your fate, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Harmost's eyebrows rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you think! No, that is impossible!&rdquo; He walked twice very
      quickly up and down the room; then spinning round on his heel, said
      sharply: &ldquo;Well, we must not waste your father's time. To work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton's simple comment in the cab on the way home was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice old chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Bury Street, they found Gyp's agitated parlour-maid. Going to do the
      music-room that morning, she had &ldquo;found the master sitting on the sofa,
      holding his head, and groaning awful. He's not been at home, ma'am, since
      you&mdash;you went on your visit, so I didn't know what to do. I ran for
      cook and we got him up to bed, and not knowing where you'd be, ma'am, I
      telephoned to Count Rosek, and he came&mdash;I hope I didn't do wrong&mdash;and
      he sent me down to see you. The doctor says his brain's on the touch and
      go, and he keeps askin' for you, ma'am. So I didn't know what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp, pale to the lips, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait here a minute, Ellen,&rdquo; and went into the dining-room. Winton
      followed. She turned to him at once, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dad, what am I to do? His brain! It would be too awful to feel I'd
      brought that about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton grunted. Gyp went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go and see. If it's really that, I couldn't bear it. I'm afraid I
      must go, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll come too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The girl can go back in the cab and say
      we're on the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking a parting look at her baby, Gyp thought bitterly: 'My fate? THIS is
      my fate, and no getting out of it!' On the journey, she and Winton were
      quite silent&mdash;but she held his hand tight. While the cook was taking
      up to Rosek the news of their arrival, Gyp stood looking out at her
      garden. Two days and six hours only since she had stood there above her
      pansies; since, at this very spot, Rosek had kissed her throat! Slipping
      her hand through Winton's arm, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, please don't make anything of that kiss. He couldn't help himself, I
      suppose. What does it matter, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Rosek entered. Before she could speak, Winton was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for letting us know, sir. But now that my daughter is here,
      there will be no further need for your kind services. Good-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the cruel curtness of those words, Gyp gave the tiniest start forward.
      She had seen them go through Rosek's armour as a sword through brown
      paper. He recovered himself with a sickly smile, bowed, and went out.
      Winton followed&mdash;precisely as if he did not trust him with the hats
      in the hall. When the outer door was shut, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think he'll trouble you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp's gratitude was qualified by a queer compassion. After all, his
      offence had only been that of loving her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen had been taken to her room, which was larger and cooler than his
      own; and the maid was standing by the side of the bed with a scared face.
      Gyp signed to her to go. He opened his eyes presently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp! Oh! Gyp! Is it you? The devilish, awful things I see&mdash;don't go
      away again! Oh, Gyp!&rdquo; With a sob he raised himself and rested his forehead
      against her. And Gyp felt&mdash;as on the first night he came home drunk&mdash;a
      merging of all other emotions in the desire to protect and heal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, all right,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I'm going to stay. Don't worry
      about anything. Keep quite quiet, and you'll soon be well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour, he was asleep. His wasted look went to her heart,
      and that expression of terror which had been coming and going until he
      fell asleep! Anything to do with the brain was so horrible! Only too clear
      that she must stay&mdash;that his recovery depended on her. She was still
      sitting there, motionless, when the doctor came, and, seeing him asleep,
      beckoned her out. He looked a kindly man, with two waistcoats, the top one
      unbuttoned; and while he talked, he winked at Gyp involuntarily, and, with
      each wink, Gyp felt that he ripped the veil off one more domestic secret.
      Sleep was the ticket&mdash;the very ticket for him! Had something on his
      mind&mdash;yes! And&mdash;er&mdash;a little given to&mdash;brandy? Ah! all
      that must stop! Stomach as well as nerves affected. Seeing things&mdash;nasty
      things&mdash;sure sign. Perhaps not a very careful life before marriage.
      And married&mdash;how long? His kindly appreciative eyes swept Gyp from
      top to toe. Year and a half! Quite so! Hard worker at his violin, too? No
      doubt! Musicians always a little inclined to be immoderate&mdash;too much
      sense of beauty&mdash;burn the candle at both ends! She must see to that.
      She had been away, had she not&mdash;staying with her father? Yes. But&mdash;no
      one like a wife for nursing. As to treatment? Well! One would shove in a
      dash of what he would prescribe, night and morning. Perfect quiet. No
      stimulant. A little cup of strong coffee without milk, if he seemed low.
      Keep him in bed at present. No worry; no excitement. Young man still.
      Plenty of vitality. As to herself, no undue anxiety. To-morrow they would
      see whether a night nurse would be necessary. Above all, no violin for a
      month, no alcohol&mdash;in every way the strictest moderation! And with a
      last and friendliest wink, leaning heavily on that word &ldquo;moderation,&rdquo; he
      took out a stylographic pen, scratched on a leaf of his note-book, shook
      Gyp's hand, smiled whimsically, buttoned his upper waistcoat, and
      departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp went back to her seat by the bed. Irony! She whose only desire was to
      be let go free, was mainly responsible for his breakdown! But for her,
      there would be nothing on his mind, for he would not be married! Brooding
      morbidly, she asked herself&mdash;his drinking, debts, even the girl&mdash;had
      she caused them, too? And when she tried to free him and herself&mdash;this
      was the result! Was there something fatal about her that must destroy the
      men she had to do with? She had made her father unhappy, Monsieur Harmost&mdash;Rosek,
      and her husband! Even before she married, how many had tried for her love,
      and gone away unhappy! And, getting up, she went to a mirror and looked at
      herself long and sadly.
    </p>

      XX
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days after her abortive attempt to break away, Gyp, with much
      heart-searching, wrote to Daphne Wing, telling her of Fiorsen's illness,
      and mentioning a cottage near Mildenham, where&mdash;if she liked to go&mdash;she
      would be quite comfortable and safe from all curiosity, and finally
      begging to be allowed to make good the losses from any broken
      dance-contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, she found Mr. Wagge with a tall, crape-banded hat in his
      black-gloved hands, standing in the very centre of her drawing-room. He
      was staring into the garden, as if he had been vouchsafed a vision of that
      warm night when the moonlight shed its ghostly glamour on the sunflowers,
      and his daughter had danced out there. She had a perfect view of his thick
      red neck in its turndown collar, crossed by a black bow over a shiny white
      shirt. And, holding out her hand, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Wagge? It was kind of you to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge turned. His pug face wore a downcast expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I see you well, ma'am. Pretty place you 'ave 'ere. I'm fond of
      flowers myself. They've always been my 'obby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're a great comfort in London, aren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es; I should think you might grow the dahlia here.&rdquo; And having thus
      obeyed the obscure instincts of savoir faire, satisfied some obscurer
      desire to flatter, he went on: &ldquo;My girl showed me your letter. I didn't
      like to write; in such a delicate matter I'd rather be vivey vocey. Very
      kind, in your position; I'm sure I appreciate it. I always try to do the
      Christian thing myself. Flesh passes; you never know when you may have to
      take your turn. I said to my girl I'd come and see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad. I hoped perhaps you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge cleared his throat, and went on, in a hoarser voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to say anything harsh about a certain party in your
      presence, especially as I read he's indisposed, but really I hardly know
      how to bear the situation. I can't bring myself to think of money in
      relation to that matter; all the same, it's a serious loss to my daughter,
      very serious loss. I've got my family pride to think of. My daughter's
      name, well&mdash;it's my own; and, though I say it, I'm respected&mdash;a
      regular attendant&mdash;I think I told you. Sometimes, I assure you, I
      feel I can't control myself, and it's only that&mdash;and you, if I may
      say so, that keeps me in check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During this speech, his black-gloved hands were clenching and unclenching,
      and he shifted his broad, shining boots. Gyp gazed at them, not daring to
      look up at his eyes thus turning and turning from Christianity to shekels,
      from his honour to the world, from his anger to herself. And she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please let me do what I ask, Mr. Wagge. I should be so unhappy if I
      mightn't do that little something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge blew his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a delicate matter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't know where my duty lays. I
      don't, reelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp looked up then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great thing is to save Daisy suffering, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge's face wore for a moment an expression of affront, as if from
      the thought: 'Sufferin'! You must leave that to her father!' Then it
      wavered; the curious, furtive warmth of the attracted male came for a
      moment into his little eyes; he averted them, and coughed. Gyp said
      softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge's readjusted glance stopped in confusion at her waist. He
      answered, in a voice that he strove to make bland:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you put it in that way, I don't reelly know 'ow to refuse; but it must
      be quite between you and me&mdash;I can't withdraw my attitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course. Thank you so much; and you'll let me know about everything
      later. I mustn't take up your time now.&rdquo; And she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge took it in a lingering manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I HAVE an appointment,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;a gentleman at Campden Hill. He
      starts at twelve. I'm never late. GOOD-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had watched his square, black figure pass through the outer gate,
      busily rebuttoning those shining black gloves, she went upstairs and
      washed her face and hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several days, Fiorsen wavered; but his collapse had come just in time,
      and with every hour the danger lessened. At the end of a fortnight of a
      perfectly white life, there remained nothing to do in the words of the
      doctor but &ldquo;to avoid all recurrence of the predisposing causes, and shove
      in sea air!&rdquo; Gyp had locked up all brandy&mdash;and violins; she could
      control him so long as he was tamed by his own weakness. But she passed
      some very bitter hours before she sent for her baby, Betty, and the dogs,
      and definitely took up life in her little house again. His debts had been
      paid, including the thousand pounds to Rosek, and the losses of Daphne
      Wing. The girl had gone down to that cottage where no one had ever heard
      of her, to pass her time in lonely grief and terror, with the aid of a
      black dress and a gold band on her third finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      August and the first half of September were spent near Bude. Fiorsen's
      passion for the sea, a passion Gyp could share, kept him singularly
      moderate and free from restiveness. He had been thoroughly frightened, and
      such terror is not easily forgotten. They stayed in a farmhouse, where he
      was at his best with the simple folk, and his best could be charming. He
      was always trying to get his &ldquo;mermaid,&rdquo; as he took to calling Gyp, away
      from the baby, getting her away to himself, along the grassy cliffs and
      among the rocks and yellow sands of that free coast. His delight was to
      find every day some new nook where they could bathe, and dry themselves by
      sitting in the sun. And very like a mermaid she was, on a seaweedy rock,
      with her feet close together in a little pool, her fingers combing her
      drowned hair, and the sun silvering her wet body. If she had loved him, it
      would have been perfect. But though, close to nature like this&mdash;there
      are men to whom towns are poison&mdash;he was so much more easy to bear,
      even to like, her heart never opened to him, never fluttered at his voice,
      or beat more quickly under his kisses. One cannot regulate these things.
      The warmth in her eyes when they looked at her baby, and the coolness when
      they looked at him, was such that not even a man, and he an egoist, could
      help seeing; and secretly he began to hate that tiny rival, and she began
      to notice that he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the weather broke, he grew restless, craving his violin, and
      they went back to town, in robust health&mdash;all three. During those
      weeks, Gyp had never been free of the feeling that it was just a lull, of
      forces held up in suspense, and the moment they were back in their house,
      this feeling gathered density and darkness, as rain gathers in the sky
      after a fine spell. She had often thought of Daphne Wing, and had written
      twice, getting in return one naive and pathetic answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      'DEAR MRS. FIORSEN,
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, it is kind of you to write, because I know what you must be feeling
      about me; and it was so kind of you to let me come here. I try not to
      think about things, but of course I can't help it; and I don't seem to
      care what happens now. Mother is coming down here later on. Sometimes I
      lie awake all night, listening to the wind. Don't you think the wind is
      the most melancholy thing in the world? I wonder if I shall die? I hope I
      shall. Oh, I do, really! Good-bye, dear Mrs. Fiorsen. I shall never
      forgive myself about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your grateful,
    </p>
    <p>
      'DAPHNE WING.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had never once been mentioned between her and Fiorsen since the
      night when he sat by her bed, begging forgiveness; she did not know
      whether he ever gave the little dancer and her trouble a thought, or even
      knew what had become of her. But now that the time was getting near, Gyp
      felt more and more every day as if she must go down and see her. She wrote
      to her father, who, after a dose of Harrogate with Aunt Rosamund, was back
      at Mildenham. Winton answered that the nurse was there, and that there
      seemed to be a woman, presumably the mother, staying with her, but that he
      had not of course made direct inquiry. Could not Gyp come down? He was
      alone, and cubbing had begun. It was like him to veil his longings under
      such dry statements. But the thought of giving him pleasure, and of a
      gallop with hounds fortified intensely her feeling that she ought to go.
      Now that baby was so well, and Fiorsen still not drinking, she might
      surely snatch this little holiday and satisfy her conscience about the
      girl. Since the return from Cornwall, she had played for him in the
      music-room just as of old, and she chose the finish of a morning practice
      to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gustav, I want to go to Mildenham this afternoon for a week. Father's
      lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was putting away his violin, but she saw his neck grow red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To him? No. He will steal you as he stole the baby. Let him have the baby
      if he likes. Not you. No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp, who was standing by the piano, kept silence at this unexpected
      outburst, but revolt blazed up in her. She never asked him anything; he
      should not refuse this. He came up behind and put his arms round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Gyp, I want you here&mdash;I am lonely, too. Don't go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to force his arms apart, but could not, and her anger grew. She
      said coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another reason why I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! No good reason&mdash;to take you from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is! The girl who is just going to have your child is staying near
      Mildenham, and I want to see how she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He let go of her then, and recoiling against the divan, sat down. And Gyp
      thought: 'I'm sorry. I didn't mean to&mdash;but it serves him right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He muttered, in a dull voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hoped she was dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! For all you care, she might be. I'm going, but you needn't be afraid
      that I shan't come back. I shall be back to-day week; I promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You don't break your promises; you will not break it.&rdquo; But,
      suddenly, he said again: &ldquo;Gyp, don't go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and caught her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you love me, then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she could not. It was one thing to put up with embraces, quite another
      to pretend that. When at last he was gone, she sat smoothing her hair,
      staring before her with hard eyes, thinking: &ldquo;Here&mdash;where I saw him
      with that girl! What animals men are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Late that afternoon, she reached Mildenham. Winton met her at the station.
      And on the drive up, they passed the cottage where Daphne Wing was
      staying. It stood in front of a small coppice, a creepered, plain-fronted,
      little brick house, with a garden still full of sunflowers, tenanted by
      the old jockey, Pettance, his widowed daughter, and her three small
      children. &ldquo;That talkative old scoundrel,&rdquo; as Winton always called him, was
      still employed in the Mildenham stables, and his daughter was laundress to
      the establishment. Gyp had secured for Daphne Wing the same free,
      independent, economic agent who had watched over her own event; the same
      old doctor, too, was to be the presiding deity. There were no signs of
      life about the cottage, and she would not stop, too eager to be at home
      again, to see the old rooms, and smell the old savour of the house, to get
      to her old mare, and feel its nose nuzzling her for sugar. It was so good
      to be back once more, feeling strong and well and able to ride. The smile
      of the inscrutable Markey at the front door was a joy to her, even the
      darkness of the hall, where a gleam of last sunlight fell across the skin
      of Winton's first tiger, on which she had so often sunk down dead tired
      after hunting. Ah, it was nice to be at home!
    </p>
    <p>
      In her mare's box, old Pettance was putting a last touch to cleanliness.
      His shaven, skin-tight, wicked old face, smiled deeply. He said in honeyed
      tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evenin', miss; beautiful evenin', ma'am!&rdquo; And his little burning
      brown eyes, just touched by age, regarded her lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pettance, how are you? And how's Annie, and how are the children?
      And how's this old darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful, miss; artful as a kitten. Carry you like a bird to-morrow, if
      you're goin' out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are her legs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while Gyp passed her hand down those iron legs, the old mare examined
      her down the back of her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They 'aven't filled not once since she come in&mdash;she was out all July
      and August; but I've kept 'er well at it since, in 'opes you might be
      comin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They feel splendid.&rdquo; And, still bending down, Gyp asked: &ldquo;And how is your
      lodger&mdash;the young lady I sent you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ma'am, she's very young, and these very young ladies they get a bit
      excited, you know, at such times; I should say she've never been&mdash;&rdquo;
       With obvious difficulty he checked the words, &ldquo;to an 'orse before!&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,
      you must expect it. And her mother, she's a dreadful funny one, miss. She
      does needle me! Oh, she puts my back up properly! No class, of course&mdash;that's
      where it is. But this 'ere nurse&mdash;well, you know, miss, she won't
      'ave no nonsense; so there we are. And, of course, you're bound to 'ave
      'ighsteria, a bit&mdash;losin' her 'usband as young as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp could feel his wicked old smile even before she raised herself. But
      what did it matter if he did guess? She knew he would keep a stable
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we've 'ad some pretty flirts&mdash;up and cryin', dear me! I sleeps
      in the next room&mdash;oh, yes, at night-time&mdash;when you're a widder
      at that age, you can't expect nothin' else. I remember when I was ridin'
      in Ireland for Captain O'Neill, there was a young woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp thought: 'I mustn't let him get off&mdash;or I shall be late for
      dinner,' and she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pettance, who bought the young brown horse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bryn Summer'ay, ma'am, over at Widrington, for an 'unter, and 'ack in
      town, miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Summerhay? Ah!&rdquo; With a touch of the whip to her memory, Gyp recalled the
      young man with the clear eyes and teasing smile, on the chestnut mare, the
      bold young man who reminded her of somebody, and she added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll be a good home for him, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, miss; good 'ome&mdash;nice gentleman, too. He come over here to
      see it, and asked after you. I told 'im you was a married lady now, miss.
      'Ah,' he said; 'she rode beautiful!' And he remembered the 'orse well. The
      major, he wasn't 'ere just then, so I let him try the young un; he popped
      'im over a fence or two, and when he come back he says, 'Well, I'm goin'
      to have 'im.' Speaks very pleasant, an' don't waste no time&mdash;'orse
      was away before the end of the week. Carry 'im well; 'e's a strong rider,
      too, and a good plucked one, but bad 'ands, I should say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Pettance; I must go in now. Will you tell Annie I shall be round
      to-morrow, to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, miss. 'Ounds meets at Filly Cross, seven-thirty. You'll be
      goin' out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flying back across the yard, Gyp thought: &ldquo;'She rode beautiful!' How
      jolly! I'm glad he's got my horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      XXI
    </p>
    <p>
      Still glowing from her morning in the saddle, Gyp started out next day at
      noon on her visit to the &ldquo;old scoundrel's&rdquo; cottage. It was one of those
      lingering mellow mornings of late September, when the air, just warmed
      through, lifts off the stubbles, and the hedgerows are not yet dried of
      dew. The short cut led across two fields, a narrow strip of village
      common, where linen was drying on gorse bushes coming into bloom, and one
      field beyond; she met no one. Crossing the road, she passed into the
      cottage-garden, where sunflowers and Michaelmas daisies in great profusion
      were tangled along the low red-brick garden-walls, under some poplar trees
      yellow-flecked already. A single empty chair, with a book turned face
      downward, stood outside an open window. Smoke wreathing from one chimney
      was the only sign of life. But, standing undecided before the half-open
      door, Gyp was conscious, as it were, of too much stillness, of something
      unnatural about the silence. She was just raising her hand to knock when
      she heard the sound of smothered sobbing. Peeping through the window, she
      could just see a woman dressed in green, evidently Mrs. Wagge, seated at a
      table, crying into her handkerchief. At that very moment, too, a low
      moaning came from the room above. Gyp recoiled; then, making up her mind,
      she went in and knocked at the room where the woman in green was sitting.
      After fully half a minute, it was opened, and Mrs. Wagge stood there. The
      nose and eyes and cheeks of that thinnish, acid face were red, and in her
      green dress, and with her greenish hair (for it was going grey and she put
      on it a yellow lotion smelling of cantharides), she seemed to Gyp just
      like one of those green apples that turn reddish so unnaturally in the
      sun. She had rubbed over her face, which shone in streaks, and her
      handkerchief was still crumpled in her hand. It was horrible to come, so
      fresh and glowing, into the presence of this poor woman, evidently in
      bitter sorrow. And a desperate desire came over Gyp to fly. It seemed
      dreadful for anyone connected with him who had caused this trouble to be
      coming here at all. But she said as softly as she could:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Wagge? Please forgive me&mdash;but is there any news? I am&mdash;It
      was I who got Daphne down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman before her was evidently being torn this way and that, but at
      last she answered, with a sniff:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;it&mdash;was born this morning&mdash;dead.&rdquo; Gyp gasped. To have
      gone through it all for that! Every bit of mother-feeling in her rebelled
      and sorrowed; but her reason said: Better so! Much better! And she
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wagge answered, with profound dejection:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad&mdash;very bad. I don't know I'm sure what to say&mdash;my feelings
      are all anyhow, and that's the truth. It's so dreadfully upsetting
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my nurse with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she's there. She's a very headstrong woman, but capable, I don't
      deny. Daisy's very weak. Oh, it IS upsetting! And now I suppose there'll
      have to be a burial. There really seems no end to it. And all because of&mdash;of
      that man.&rdquo; And Mrs. Wagge turned away again to cry into her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling she could never say or do the right thing to the poor lady, Gyp
      stole out. At the bottom of the stairs, she hesitated whether to go up or
      no. At last, she mounted softly. It must be in the front room that the
      bereaved girl was lying&mdash;the girl who, but a year ago, had debated
      with such naive self-importance whether or not it was her duty to take a
      lover. Gyp summoned courage to tap gently. The economic agent opened the
      door an inch, but, seeing who it was, slipped her robust and handsome
      person through into the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, my dear!&rdquo; she said in a whisper. &ldquo;That's nice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly well&mdash;considering. You know about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; can I see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly think so. I can't make her out. She's got no spirit, not an
      ounce. She doesn't want to get well, I believe. It's the man, I expect.&rdquo;
       And, looking at Gyp with her fine blue eyes, she asked: &ldquo;Is that it? Is he
      tired of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp met her gaze better than she had believed possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The economic agent swept her up and down. &ldquo;It's a pleasure to look at you.
      You've got quite a colour, for you. After all, I believe it MIGHT do her
      good to see you. Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp passed in behind her, and stood gazing, not daring to step forward.
      What a white face, with eyes closed, with fair hair still damp on the
      forehead, with one white hand lying on the sheet above her heart! What a
      frail madonna of the sugar-plums! On the whole of that bed the only colour
      seemed the gold hoop round the wedding-finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The economic agent said very quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, my dear; I've brought you a nice visitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing's eyes and lips opened and closed again. And the awful thought
      went through Gyp: 'Poor thing! She thought it was going to be him, and
      it's only me!' Then the white lips said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, it's you&mdash;it is kind of you!&rdquo; And the eyes opened
      again, but very little, and differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The economic agent slipped away. Gyp sat down by the bed and timidly
      touched the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing looked at her, and two tears slowly ran down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's over,&rdquo; she said just audibly, &ldquo;and there's nothing now&mdash;it was
      dead, you know. I don't want to live. Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, why can't they let
      me die, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp bent over and kissed the hand, unable to bear the sight of those two
      slowly rolling tears. Daphne Wing went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ARE good to me. I wish my poor little baby hadn't&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp, knowing her own tears were wetting that hand, raised herself and
      managed to get out the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear up! Think of your work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dancing! Ho!&rdquo; She gave the least laugh ever heard. &ldquo;It seems so long
      ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but now it'll all come back to you again, better than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing answered by a feeble sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. Gyp thought: 'She's falling asleep.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With eyes and mouth closed like that, and all alabaster white, the face
      was perfect, purged of its little commonnesses. Strange freak that this
      white flower of a face could ever have been produced by Mr. and Mrs.
      Wagge!
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing opened her eyes and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Mrs. Fiorsen, I feel so weak. And I feel much more lonely now.
      There's nothing anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp got up; she felt herself being carried into the mood of the girl's
      heart, and was afraid it would be seen. Daphne Wing went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, when nurse said she'd brought a visitor, I thought it was
      him; but I'm glad now. If he had looked at me like he did&mdash;I couldn't
      have borne it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp bent down and put her lips to the damp forehead. Faint, very faint,
      there was still the scent of orange-blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was once more in the garden, she hurried away; but instead of
      crossing the fields again, turned past the side of the cottage into the
      coppice behind. And, sitting down on a log, her hands pressed to her
      cheeks and her elbows to her breast, she stared at the sunlit bracken and
      the flies chasing each other over it. Love! Was it always something
      hateful and tragic that spoiled lives? Criss-cross! One darting on
      another, taking her almost before she knew she was seized, then darting
      away and leaving her wanting to be seized again. Or darting on her, who,
      when seized, was fatal to the darter, yet had never wanted to be seized.
      Or darting one on the other for a moment, then both breaking away too
      soon. Did never two dart at each other, seize, and cling, and ever after
      be one? Love! It had spoiled her father's life, and Daphne Wing's; never
      came when it was wanted; always came when it was not. Malevolent wanderer,
      alighting here, there; tiring of the spirit before it tired of the body;
      or of the body before it tired of the spirit. Better to have nothing to do
      with it&mdash;far better! If one never loved, one would never feel lonely&mdash;like
      that poor girl. And yet! No&mdash;there was no &ldquo;and yet.&rdquo; Who that was
      free would wish to become a slave? A slave&mdash;like Daphne Wing! A slave&mdash;like
      her own husband to his want of a wife who did not love him. A slave like
      her father had been&mdash;still was, to a memory. And watching the
      sunlight on the bracken, Gyp thought: 'Love! Keep far from me. I don't
      want you. I shall never want you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning that week she made her way to the cottage, and every morning
      had to pass through the hands of Mrs. Wagge. The good lady had got over
      the upsetting fact that Gyp was the wife of that villain, and had taken a
      fancy to her, confiding to the economic agent, who confided it to Gyp,
      that she was &ldquo;very distangey&mdash;and such pretty eyes, quite Italian.&rdquo;
       She was one of those numberless persons whose passion for distinction was
      just a little too much for their passionate propriety. It was that worship
      of distinction which had caused her to have her young daughter's talent
      for dancing fostered. Who knew to what it might lead in these days? At
      great length she explained to Gyp the infinite care with which she had
      always &ldquo;brought Daisy up like a lady&mdash;and now this is the result.&rdquo;
       And she would look piercingly at Gyp's hair or ears, at her hands or her
      instep, to see how it was done. The burial worried her dreadfully. &ldquo;I'm
      using the name of Daisy Wing; she was christened 'Daisy' and the Wing's
      professional, so that takes them both in, and it's quite the truth. But I
      don't think anyone would connect it, would they? About the father's name,
      do you think I might say the late Mr. Joseph Wing, this once? You see, it
      never was alive, and I must put something if they're not to guess the
      truth, and that I couldn't bear; Mr. Wagge would be so distressed. It's in
      his own line, you see. Oh, it is upsetting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp murmured desperately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though the girl was so deathly white and spiritless, it soon became clear
      that she was going to pull through. With each day, a little more colour
      and a little more commonness came back to her. And Gyp felt instinctively
      that she would, in the end, return to Fulham purged of her infatuation, a
      little harder, perhaps a little deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one afternoon toward the end of her week at Mildenham, Gyp wandered
      again into the coppice, and sat down on that same log. An hour before
      sunset, the light shone level on the yellowing leaves all round her; a
      startled rabbit pelted out of the bracken and pelted back again, and, from
      the far edge of the little wood, a jay cackled harshly, shifting its perch
      from tree to tree. Gyp thought of her baby, and of that which would have
      been its half-brother; and now that she was so near having to go back to
      Fiorsen, she knew that she had not been wise to come here. To have been in
      contact with the girl, to have touched, as it were, that trouble, had made
      the thought of life with him less tolerable even than it was before. Only
      the longing to see her baby made return seem possible. Ah, well&mdash;she
      would get used to it all again! But the anticipation of his eyes fixed on
      her, then sliding away from the meeting with her eyes, of all&mdash;of all
      that would begin again, suddenly made her shiver. She was very near to
      loathing at that moment. He, the father of her baby! The thought seemed
      ridiculous and strange. That little creature seemed to bind him to her no
      more than if it were the offspring of some chance encounter, some pursuit
      of nymph by faun. No! It was hers alone. And a sudden feverish longing to
      get back to it overpowered all other thought. This longing grew in her so
      all night that at breakfast she told her father. Swallowing down whatever
      his feeling may have been, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, my child; I'll come up with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Putting her into the cab in London, he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you still got your key of Bury Street? Good! Remember, Gyp&mdash;any
      time day or night&mdash;there it is for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had wired to Fiorsen from Mildenham that she was coming, and she
      reached home soon after three. He was not in, and what was evidently her
      telegram lay unopened in the hall. Tremulous with expectation, she ran up
      to the nursery. The pathetic sound of some small creature that cannot tell
      what is hurting it, or why, met her ears. She went in, disturbed, yet with
      the half-triumphant thought: 'Perhaps that's for me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, very flushed, was rocking the cradle, and examining the baby's face
      with a perplexed frown. Seeing Gyp, she put her hand to her side, and
      gasped:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, be joyful! Oh, my dear! I AM glad. I can't do anything with baby
      since the morning. Whenever she wakes up, she cries like that. And till
      to-day she's been a little model. Hasn't she! There, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp took up the baby, whose black eyes fixed themselves on her mother in a
      momentary contentment; but, at the first movement, she began again her
      fretful plaint. Betty went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's been like that ever since this morning. Mr. Fiorsen's been in more
      than once, ma'am, and the fact is, baby don't like it. He stares at her
      so. But this morning I thought&mdash;well&mdash;I thought: 'You're her
      father. It's time she was getting used to you.' So I let them be a minute;
      and when I came back&mdash;I was only just across to the bathroom&mdash;he
      was comin' out lookin' quite fierce and white, and baby&mdash;oh,
      screamin'! And except for sleepin', she's hardly stopped cryin' since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the baby to her breast, Gyp sat very still, and queer thoughts
      went through her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How has he been, Betty?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty plaited her apron; her moon-face was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I think he's been drinkin'. Oh, I'm sure he has&mdash;I've
      smelt it about him. The third day it began. And night before last he came
      in dreadfully late&mdash;I could hear him staggerin' about, abusing the
      stairs as he was comin' up. Oh dear&mdash;it IS a pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baby, who had been still enough since she lay in her mother's lap,
      suddenly raised her little voice again. Gyp said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty, I believe something hurts her arm. She cries the moment she's
      touched there. Is there a pin or anything? Just see. Take her things off.
      Oh&mdash;look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both the tiny arms above the elbow were circled with dark marks, as if
      they had been squeezed by ruthless fingers. The two women looked at each
      other in horror; and under her breath Gyp said: &ldquo;He!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had flushed crimson; her eyes filled but dried again almost at once.
      And, looking at her face, now gone very pale, and those lips tightened to
      a line, Betty stopped in her outburst of ejaculation. When they had
      wrapped the baby's arm in remedies and cotton-wool, Gyp went into her
      bedroom, and, throwing herself down on her bed, burst into a passion of
      weeping, smothering it deep in her pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the crying of sheer rage. The brute! Not to have control enough to
      stop short of digging his claws into that precious mite! Just because the
      poor little thing cried at that cat's stare of his! The brute! The devil!
      And he would come to her and whine about it, and say: &ldquo;My Gyp, I never
      meant&mdash;how should I know I was hurting? Her crying was so&mdash;Why
      should she cry at me? I was upset! I wasn't thinking!&rdquo; She could hear him
      pleading and sighing to her to forgive him. But she would not&mdash;not
      this time! He had hurt a helpless thing once too often. Her fit of crying
      ceased, and she lay listening to the tick of the clock, and marshalling in
      her mind a hundred little evidences of his malevolence toward her baby&mdash;his
      own baby. How was it possible? Was he really going mad? And a fit of such
      chilly shuddering seized her that she crept under the eider down to regain
      warmth. In her rage, she retained enough sense of proportion to understand
      that he had done this, just as he had insulted Monsieur Harmost and her
      father&mdash;and others&mdash;in an ungovernable access of
      nerve-irritation; just as, perhaps, one day he would kill someone. But to
      understand this did not lessen her feeling. Her baby! Such a tiny thing!
      She hated him at last; and she lay thinking out the coldest, the
      cruellest, the most cutting things to say. She had been too
      long-suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not come in that evening; and, too upset to eat or do anything,
      she went up to bed at ten o'clock. When she had undressed, she stole
      across to the nursery; she had a longing to have the baby with her&mdash;a
      feeling that to leave her was not safe. She carried her off, still
      sleeping, and, locking her doors, got into bed. Having warmed a nest with
      her body for the little creature, she laid it there; and then for a long
      time lay awake, expecting every minute to hear him return. She fell asleep
      at last, and woke with a start. There were vague noises down below or on
      the stairs. It must be he! She had left the light on in her room, and she
      leaned over to look at the baby's face. It was still sleeping, drawing its
      tiny breaths peacefully, little dog-shivers passing every now and then
      over its face. Gyp, shaking back her dark plaits of hair, sat up by its
      side, straining her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; he WAS coming up, and, by the sounds, he was not sober. She heard a
      loud creak, and then a thud, as if he had clutched at the banisters and
      fallen; she heard muttering, too, and the noise of boots dropped. Swiftly
      the thought went through her: 'If he were quite drunk, he would not have
      taken them off at all;&mdash;nor if he were quite sober. Does he know I'm
      back?' Then came another creak, as if he were raising himself by support
      of the banisters, and then&mdash;or was it fancy?&mdash;she could hear him
      creeping and breathing behind the door. Then&mdash;no fancy this time&mdash;he
      fumbled at the door and turned the handle. In spite of his state, he must
      know that she was back, had noticed her travelling-coat or seen the
      telegram. The handle was tried again, then, after a pause, the handle of
      the door between his room and hers was fiercely shaken. She could hear his
      voice, too, as she knew it when he was flown with drink, thick, a little
      drawling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp&mdash;let me in&mdash;Gyp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood burned up in her cheeks, and she thought: 'No, my friend; you're
      not coming in!'
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, sounds were more confused, as if he were now at one door, now
      at the other; then creakings, as if on the stairs again, and after that,
      no sound at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      For fully half an hour, Gyp continued to sit up, straining her ears. Where
      was he? What doing? On her over-excited nerves, all sorts of possibilities
      came crowding. He must have gone downstairs again. In that half-drunken
      state, where would his baffled frenzies lead him? And, suddenly, she
      thought that she smelled burning. It went, and came again; she got up,
      crept to the door, noiselessly turned the key, and, pulling it open a few
      inches, sniffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was dark on the landing. There was no smell of burning out there.
      Suddenly, a hand clutched her ankle. All the blood rushed from her heart;
      she stifled a scream, and tried to pull the door to. But his arm and her
      leg were caught between, and she saw the black mass of his figure lying
      full-length on its face. Like a vice, his hand held her; he drew himself
      up on to his knees, on to his feet, and forced his way through. Panting,
      but in utter silence, Gyp struggled to drive him out. His drunken strength
      seemed to come and go in gusts, but hers was continuous, greater than she
      had ever thought she had, and she panted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go! go out of my room&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;wretch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then her heart stood still with horror, for he had slued round to the bed
      and was stretching his hands out above the baby. She heard him mutter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah-h-h!&mdash;YOU&mdash;in my place&mdash;YOU!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp flung herself on him from behind, dragging his arms down, and,
      clasping her hands together, held him fast. He twisted round in her arms
      and sat down on the bed. In that moment of his collapse, Gyp snatched up
      her baby and fled out, down the dark stairs, hearing him stumbling,
      groping in pursuit. She fled into the dining-room and locked the door. She
      heard him run against it and fall down. Snuggling her baby, who was crying
      now, inside her nightgown, next to her skin for warmth, she stood rocking
      and hushing it, trying to listen. There was no more sound. By the hearth,
      whence a little heat still came forth from the ashes, she cowered down.
      With cushions and the thick white felt from the dining-table, she made the
      baby snug, and wrapping her shivering self in the table-cloth, sat staring
      wide-eyed before her&mdash;and always listening. There were sounds at
      first, then none. A long, long time she stayed like that, before she stole
      to the door. She did not mean to make a second mistake. She could hear the
      sound of heavy breathing. And she listened to it, till she was quite
      certain that it was really the breathing of sleep. Then stealthily she
      opened, and looked. He was over there, lying against the bottom chair, in
      a heavy, drunken slumber. She knew that sleep so well; he would not wake
      from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gave her a sort of evil pleasure that they would find him like that in
      the morning when she was gone. She went back to her baby and, with
      infinite precaution, lifted it, still sleeping, cushion and all, and stole
      past him up the stairs that, under her bare feet, made no sound. Once more
      in her locked room, she went to the window and looked out. It was just
      before dawn; her garden was grey and ghostly, and she thought: 'The last
      time I shall see you. Good-bye!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with the utmost speed, she did her hair and dressed. She was very
      cold and shivery, and put on her fur coat and cap. She hunted out two
      jerseys for the baby, and a certain old camel's-hair shawl. She took a few
      little things she was fondest of and slipped them into her wrist-bag with
      her purse, put on her hat and a pair of gloves. She did everything very
      swiftly, wondering, all the time, at her own power of knowing what to
      take. When she was quite ready, she scribbled a note to Betty to follow
      with the dogs to Bury Street, and pushed it under the nursery door. Then,
      wrapping the baby in the jerseys and shawl, she went downstairs. The dawn
      had broken, and, from the long narrow window above the door with spikes of
      iron across it, grey light was striking into the hall. Gyp passed
      Fiorsen's sleeping figure safely, and, for one moment, stopped for breath.
      He was lying with his back against the wall, his head in the hollow of an
      arm raised against a stair, and his face turned a little upward. That face
      which, hundreds of times, had been so close to her own, and something
      about this crumpled body, about his tumbled hair, those cheek-bones, and
      the hollows beneath the pale lips just parted under the dirt-gold of his
      moustache&mdash;something of lost divinity in all that inert figure&mdash;clutched
      for a second at Gyp's heart. Only for a second. It was over, this time! No
      more&mdash;never again! And, turning very stealthily, she slipped her
      shoes on, undid the chain, opened the front door, took up her burden,
      closed the door softly behind her, and walked away.

    <h2>
      Part III
    </h2>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp was going up to town. She sat in the corner of a first-class carriage,
      alone. Her father had gone up by an earlier train, for the annual June
      dinner of his old regiment, and she had stayed to consult the doctor
      concerning &ldquo;little Gyp,&rdquo; aged nearly nineteen months, to whom teeth were
      making life a burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes wandered from window to window, obeying the faint excitement
      within her. All the winter and spring, she had been at Mildenham, very
      quiet, riding much, and pursuing her music as best she could, seeing
      hardly anyone except her father; and this departure for a spell of London
      brought her the feeling that comes on an April day, when the sky is blue,
      with snow-white clouds, when in the fields the lambs are leaping, and the
      grass is warm for the first time, so that one would like to roll in it. At
      Widrington, a porter entered, carrying a kit-bag, an overcoat, and some
      golf-clubs; and round the door a little group, such as may be seen at any
      English wayside station, clustered, filling the air with their clean,
      slightly drawling voices. Gyp noted a tall woman whose blonde hair was
      going grey, a young girl with a fox-terrier on a lead, a young man with a
      Scotch terrier under his arm and his back to the carriage. The girl was
      kissing the Scotch terrier's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, old Ossy! Was he nice! Tumbo, keep DOWN! YOU'RE not going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, dear boy! Don't work too hard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man's answer was not audible, but it was followed by
      irrepressible gurgles and a smothered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bryan, you ARE&mdash;Good-bye, dear Ossy!&rdquo; &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo;
       The young man who had got in, made another unintelligible joke in a rather
      high-pitched voice, which was somehow familiar, and again the gurgles
      broke forth. Then the train moved. Gyp caught a side view of him, waving
      his hat from the carriage window. It was her acquaintance of the
      hunting-field&mdash;the &ldquo;Mr. Bryn Summer'ay,&rdquo; as old Pettance called him,
      who had bought her horse last year. Seeing him pull down his overcoat, to
      bank up the old Scotch terrier against the jolting of the journey, she
      thought: 'I like men who think first of their dogs.' His round head, with
      curly hair, broad brow, and those clean-cut lips, gave her again the
      wonder: 'Where HAVE I seen someone like him?' He raised the window, and
      turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like&mdash;Oh, how d'you do! We met out hunting. You don't
      remember me, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; perfectly. And you bought my horse last summer. How is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In great form. I forgot to ask what you called him; I've named him
      Hotspur&mdash;he'll never be steady at his fences. I remember how he
      pulled with you that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent, smiling, as people will in remembrance of a good run.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, looking at the dog, Gyp said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HE looks rather a darling. How old?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve. Beastly when dogs get old!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another little silence while he contemplated her steadily with
      his clear eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came over to call once&mdash;with my mother; November the year before
      last. Somebody was ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Badly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you were married&mdash;&rdquo; The little drawl in his voice had
      increased, as though covering the abruptness of that remark. Gyp looked
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but my little daughter and I live with my father again.&rdquo; What &ldquo;came
      over&rdquo; her&mdash;as they say&mdash;to be so frank, she could not have told.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I've often thought it queer I've never seen you since. What a run
      that was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfect! Was that your mother on the platform?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and my sister Edith. Extraordinary dead-alive place,
      Widrington; I expect Mildenham isn't much better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very quiet, but I like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, I don't know your name now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiorsen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! The violinist. Life's a bit of a gamble, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp did not answer that odd remark, did not quite know what to make of
      this audacious young man, whose hazel eyes and lazy smile were queerly
      lovable, but whose face in repose had such a broad gravity. He took from
      his pocket a little red book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know these? I always take them travelling. Finest things ever
      written, aren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The book&mdash;Shakespeare's Sonnets&mdash;was open at that which begins:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Let me not to the marriage of true minds
        Admit impediments.  Love is not love
      Which alters when it alteration finds,
        Or bends with the remover to remove&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Gyp read on as far as the lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
        Within his bending sickle's compass come.
      Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom&mdash;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      and looked out of the window. The train was passing through a country of
      fields and dykes, where the sun, far down in the west, shone almost level
      over wide, whitish-green space, and the spotted cattle browsed or stood by
      the ditches, lazily flicking their tufted tails. A shaft of sunlight
      flowed into the carriage, filled with dust motes; and, handing the little
      book back through that streak of radiance, she said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that's wonderful. Do you read much poetry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More law, I'm afraid. But it is about the finest thing in the world,
      isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I think music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a musician?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as if you might be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? A little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I should think you had it badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. And you haven't it at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hybrid form&mdash;and the lowest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why it suits me. Don't you like it, though?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that's why I'm going up to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Are you a subscriber?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I. Jolly&mdash;I shall see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp smiled. It was so long since she had talked to a man of her own age,
      so long since she had seen a face that roused her curiosity and
      admiration, so long since she had been admired. The sun-shaft, shifted by
      a westward trend of the train, bathed her from the knees up; and its
      warmth increased her light-hearted sense of being in luck&mdash;above her
      fate, instead of under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astounding how much can be talked of in two or three hours of a railway
      journey! And what a friendly after-warmth clings round those hours! Does
      the difficulty of making oneself heard provoke confidential utterance? Or
      is it the isolation or the continual vibration that carries friendship
      faster and further than will a spasmodic acquaintanceship of weeks? But in
      that long talk he was far the more voluble. There was, too, much of which
      she could not speak. Besides, she liked to listen. His slightly drawling
      voice fascinated her&mdash;his audacious, often witty way of putting
      things, and the irrepressible bubble of laughter that would keep breaking
      from him. He disclosed his past, such as it was, freely&mdash;public-school
      and college life, efforts at the bar, ambitions, tastes, even his scrapes.
      And in this spontaneous unfolding there was perpetual flattery; Gyp felt
      through it all, as pretty women will, a sort of subtle admiration.
      Presently he asked her if she played piquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I play with my father nearly every evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we have a game, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew he only wanted to play because he could sit nearer, joined by the
      evening paper over their knees, hand her the cards after dealing, touch
      her hand by accident, look in her face. And this was not unpleasant; for
      she, in turn, liked looking at his face, which had what is called &ldquo;charm&rdquo;&mdash;that
      something light and unepiscopal, entirely lacking to so many solid,
      handsome, admirable faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even railway journeys come to an end; and when he gripped her hand to
      say good-bye, she gave his an involuntary little squeeze. Standing at her
      cab window, with his hat raised, the old dog under his arm, and a look of
      frank, rather wistful, admiration on his face, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see you at the opera, then, and in the Row perhaps; and I may
      come along to Bury Street, some time, mayn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nodding to those friendly words, Gyp drove off through the sultry London
      evening. Her father was not back from the dinner, and she went straight to
      her room. After so long in the country, it seemed very close in Bury
      Street; she put on a wrapper and sat down to brush the train-smoke out of
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      For months after leaving Fiorsen, she had felt nothing but relief. Only of
      late had she begun to see her new position, as it was&mdash;that of a
      woman married yet not married, whose awakened senses have never been
      gratified, whose spirit is still waiting for unfoldment in love, who,
      however disillusioned, is&mdash;even if in secret from herself&mdash;more
      and more surely seeking a real mate, with every hour that ripens her heart
      and beauty. To-night&mdash;gazing at her face, reflected, intent and
      mournful, in the mirror&mdash;she saw that position more clearly, in all
      its aridity, than she had ever seen it. What was the use of being pretty?
      No longer use to anyone! Not yet twenty-six, and in a nunnery! With a
      shiver, but not of cold, she drew her wrapper close. This time last year
      she had at least been in the main current of life, not a mere derelict.
      And yet&mdash;better far be like this than go back to him whom memory
      painted always standing over her sleeping baby, with his arms stretched
      out and his fingers crooked like claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that early-morning escape, Fiorsen had lurked after her for weeks,
      in town, at Mildenham, followed them even to Scotland, where Winton had
      carried her off. But she had not weakened in her resolution a second time,
      and suddenly he had given up pursuit, and gone abroad. Since then&mdash;nothing
      had come from him, save a few wild or maudlin letters, written evidently
      during drinking-bouts. Even they had ceased, and for four months she had
      heard no word. He had &ldquo;got over&rdquo; her, it seemed, wherever he was&mdash;Russia,
      Sweden&mdash;who knew&mdash;who cared?
    </p>
    <p>
      She let the brush rest on her knee, thinking again of that walk with her
      baby through empty, silent streets, in the early misty morning last
      October, of waiting dead-tired outside here, on the pavement, ringing till
      they let her in. Often, since, she had wondered how fear could have worked
      her up to that weird departure. She only knew that it had not been
      unnatural at the time. Her father and Aunt Rosamund had wanted her to try
      for a divorce, and no doubt they had been right. But her instincts had
      refused, still refused to let everyone know her secrets and sufferings&mdash;still
      refused the hollow pretence involved, that she had loved him when she
      never had. No, it had been her fault for marrying him without love&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Love is not love
      Which alters when it alteration finds!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      What irony&mdash;giving her that to read&mdash;if her fellow traveller had
      only known!
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up from before the mirror, and stood looking round her room, the
      room she had always slept in as a girl. So he had remembered her all this
      time! It had not seemed like meeting a stranger. They were not strangers
      now, anyway. And, suddenly, on the wall before her, she saw his face; or,
      if not, what was so like that she gave a little gasp. Of course! How
      stupid of her not to have known at once! There, in a brown frame, hung a
      photograph of the celebrated Botticelli or Masaccio &ldquo;Head of a Young Man&rdquo;
       in the National Gallery. She had fallen in love with it years ago, and on
      the wall of her room it had been ever since. That broad face, the clear
      eyes, the bold, clean-cut mouth, the audacity&mdash;only, the live face
      was English, not Italian, had more humour, more &ldquo;breeding,&rdquo; less poetry&mdash;something
      &ldquo;old Georgian&rdquo; about it. How he would laugh if she told him he was like
      that peasant acolyte with fluffed-out hair, and a little ruching round his
      neck! And, smiling, Gyp plaited her own hair and got into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she could not sleep; she heard her father come in and go up to his
      room, heard the clocks strike midnight, and one, and two, and always the
      dull roar of Piccadilly. She had nothing over her but a sheet, and still
      it was too hot. There was a scent in the room, as of honeysuckle. Where
      could it come from? She got up at last, and went to the window. There, on
      the window-sill, behind the curtains, was a bowl of jessamine. Her father
      must have brought it up for her&mdash;just like him to think of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, burying her nose in those white blossoms, she was visited by a memory
      of her first ball&mdash;that evening of such delight and disillusionment.
      Perhaps Bryan Summerhay had been there&mdash;all that time ago! If he had
      been introduced to her then, if she had happened to dance with him instead
      of with that man who had kissed her arm, might she not have felt different
      toward all men? And if he had admired her&mdash;and had not everyone, that
      night&mdash;might she not have liked, perhaps more than liked, him in
      return? Or would she have looked on him as on all her swains before she
      met Fiorsen, so many moths fluttering round a candle, foolish to singe
      themselves, not to be taken seriously? Perhaps she had been bound to have
      her lesson, to be humbled and brought low!
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a sprig of jessamine and holding it to her nose, she went up to
      that picture. In the dim light, she could just see the outline of the face
      and the eyes gazing at her. The scent of the blossom penetrated her
      nerves; in her heart, something faintly stirred, as a leaf turns over, as
      a wing flutters. And, blossom and all, she clasped her hands over her
      breast, where again her heart quivered with that faint, shy tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late, no&mdash;early, when she fell asleep and had a strange dream.
      She was riding her old mare through a field of flowers. She had on a black
      dress, and round her head a crown of bright, pointed crystals; she sat
      without saddle, her knee curled up, perched so lightly that she hardly
      felt the mare's back, and the reins she held were long twisted stems of
      honeysuckle. Singing as she rode, her eyes flying here and there, over the
      field, up to the sky, she felt happier, lighter than thistledown. While
      they raced along, the old mare kept turning her head and biting at the
      honeysuckle flowers; and suddenly that chestnut face became the face of
      Summerhay, looking back at her with his smile. She awoke. Sunlight,
      through the curtains where she had opened them to find the flowers, was
      shining on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Very late that same night, Summerhay came out of the little Chelsea house,
      which he inhabited, and walked toward the river. In certain moods men turn
      insensibly toward any space where nature rules a little&mdash;downs,
      woods, waters&mdash;where the sky is free to the eye and one feels the
      broad comradeship of primitive forces. A man is alone when he loves, alone
      when he dies; nobody cares for one so absorbed, and he cares for nobody,
      no&mdash;not he! Summerhay stood by the river-wall and looked up at the
      stars through the plane-tree branches. Every now and then he drew a long
      breath of the warm, unstirring air, and smiled, without knowing that he
      smiled. And he thought of little, of nothing; but a sweetish sensation
      beset his heart, a kind of quivering lightness his limbs. He sat down on a
      bench and shut his eyes. He saw a face&mdash;only a face. The lights went
      out one by one in the houses opposite; no cabs passed now, and scarce a
      passenger was afoot, but Summerhay sat like a man in a trance, the smile
      coming and going on his lips; and behind him the air that ever stirs above
      the river faintly moved with the tide flowing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly three, just coming dawn, when he went in, and, instead of
      going to bed, sat down to a case in which he was junior on the morrow, and
      worked right on till it was time to ride before his bath and breakfast. He
      had one of those constitutions, not uncommon among barristers&mdash;fostered
      perhaps by ozone in the Courts of Law&mdash;that can do this sort of thing
      and take no harm. Indeed, he worked best in such long spurts of vigorous
      concentration. With real capacity and a liking for his work, this young
      man was certainly on his way to make a name; though, in the intervals of
      energy, no one gave a more complete impression of imperturbable drifting
      on the tides of the moment. Altogether, he was rather a paradox. He chose
      to live in that little Chelsea house which had a scrap of garden rather
      than in the Temple or St. James's, because he often preferred solitude;
      and yet he was an excellent companion, with many friends, who felt for him
      the affectionate distrust inspired by those who are prone to fits and
      starts of work and play, conviviality and loneliness. To women, he was
      almost universally attractive. But if he had scorched his wings a little
      once or twice, he had kept heart-free on the whole. He was, it must be
      confessed, a bit of a gambler, the sort of gambler who gets in deep, and
      then, by a plucky, lucky plunge, gets out again, until some day perhaps&mdash;he
      stays there. His father, a diplomatist, had been dead fifteen years; his
      mother was well known in the semi-intellectual circles of society. He had
      no brothers, two sisters, and an income of his own. Such was Bryan
      Summerhay at the age of twenty-six, his wisdom-teeth to cut, his depths
      unplumbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he started that morning for the Temple, he had still a feeling of
      extraordinary lightness in his limbs, and he still saw that face&mdash;its
      perfect regularity, its warm pallor, and dark smiling eyes rather wide
      apart, its fine, small, close-set ears, and the sweep of the black-brown
      hair across the low brow. Or was it something much less definite he saw&mdash;an
      emanation or expression, a trick, a turn, an indwelling grace, a something
      that appealed, that turned, and touched him? Whatever it was, it would not
      let him be, and he did not desire that it should. For this was in his
      character; if he saw a horse that he liked, he put his money on whatever
      it ran; if charmed by an opera, he went over and over again; if by a poem,
      he almost learned it by heart. And while he walked along the river&mdash;his
      usual route&mdash;he had queer and unaccustomed sensations, now melting,
      now pugnacious. And he felt happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rather late, and went at once into court. In wig and gown, that
      something &ldquo;old Georgian&rdquo; about him was very visible. A beauty-spot or two,
      a full-skirted velvet coat, a sword and snuff-box, with that grey wig or
      its equivalent, and there would have been a perfect eighteenth-century
      specimen of the less bucolic stamp&mdash;the same strong, light build,
      breadth of face, brown pallor, clean and unpinched cut of lips, the same
      slight insolence and devil-may-caredom, the same clear glance, and bubble
      of vitality. It was almost a pity to have been born so late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except that once or twice he drew a face on blotting-paper and smeared it
      over, he remained normally attentive to his &ldquo;lud&rdquo; and the matters in hand
      all day, conducted without error the examination of two witnesses and with
      terror the cross-examination of one; lunched at the Courts in perfect
      amity with the sucking barrister on the other side of the case, for they
      had neither, as yet, reached that maturity which enables an advocate to
      call his enemy his &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; and treat him with considerable asperity.
      Though among his acquaintances Summerhay always provoked badinage, in
      which he was scarcely ever defeated, yet in chambers and court, on
      circuit, at his club, in society or the hunting-field, he had an
      unfavourable effect on the grosser sort of stories. There are men&mdash;by
      no means strikingly moral&mdash;who exercise this blighting influence.
      They are generally what the French call &ldquo;spirituel,&rdquo; and often have rather
      desperate love-affairs which they keep very closely to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last in chambers, he had washed off that special reek of clothes,
      and parchment, far-away herrings, and distemper, which clings about the
      law, dipping his whole curly head in water, and towelling vigorously, he
      set forth alone along the Embankment, his hat tilted up, smoking a cigar.
      It was nearly seven. Just this time yesterday he had got into the train,
      just this time yesterday turned and seen the face which had refused to
      leave him since. Fever recurs at certain hours, just so did the desire to
      see her mount within him, becoming an obsession, because it was impossible
      to gratify it. One could not call at seven o'clock! The idea of his club,
      where at this time of day he usually went, seemed flat and stale, until he
      remembered that he might pass up Bury Street to get to it. But, near
      Charing Cross, a hand smote him on the shoulder, and the voice of one of
      his intimates said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halo, Bryan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Odd, that he had never noticed before how vacuous this fellow was&mdash;with
      his talk of politics, and racing, of this ass and that ass&mdash;subjects
      hitherto of primary importance! And, stopping suddenly, he drawled out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, old chap, you go on; see you at the club&mdash;presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What's up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his lazy smile, Summerhay answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,'&rdquo; and turned on his
      heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his friend had disappeared, he resumed his journey toward Bury
      Street. He passed his boot shop, where, for some time, he had been meaning
      to order two pairs, and went by thinking: 'I wonder where SHE goes for
      things.' Her figure came to him so vividly&mdash;sitting back in that
      corner, or standing by the cab, her hand in his. The blood rushed up in
      his cheeks. She had been scented like flowers, and&mdash;and a rainy wind!
      He stood still before a plate-glass window, in confusion, and suddenly
      muttered aloud: &ldquo;Damn it! I believe I am!&rdquo; An old gentleman, passing,
      turned so suddenly, to see what he was, that he ricked his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Summerhay still stood, not taking in at all the reflected image of his
      frowning, rueful face, and of the cigar extinct between his lips. Then he
      shook his head vigorously and walked on. He walked faster, his mind blank,
      as it is sometimes for a short space after a piece of sell-revelation that
      has come too soon for adjustment or even quite for understanding. And when
      he began to think, it was irritably and at random. He had come to Bury
      Street, and, while he passed up it, felt a queer, weak sensation down the
      back of his legs. No flower-boxes this year broke the plain front of
      Winton's house, and nothing whatever but its number and the quickened
      beating of his heart marked it out for Summerhay from any other dwelling.
      The moment he turned into Jermyn Street, that beating of the heart
      subsided, and he felt suddenly morose. He entered his club at the top of
      St. James' Street and passed at once into the least used room. This was
      the library; and going to the French section, he took down &ldquo;The Three
      Musketeers&rdquo; and seated himself in a window, with his back to anyone who
      might come in. He had taken this&mdash;his favourite romance, feeling in
      want of warmth and companionship; but he did not read. From where he sat
      he could throw a stone to where she was sitting perhaps; except for walls
      he could almost reach her with his voice, could certainly see her. This
      was imbecile! A woman he had only met twice. Imbecile! He opened the book&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh, no; it is an ever-fixed mark
       That looks on tempests and is never shaken.
     It is the star to every wandering bark,
       Whose worth's unknown altho' its height be taken.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Point of five! Three queens&mdash;three knaves! Do you know that thing of
      Dowson's: 'I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my fashion'? Better
      than any Verlaine, except 'Les sanglots longs.' What have you got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only quart to the queen. Do you like the name 'Cynara'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynara! Cynara! Ye-es&mdash;an autumn, rose-petal, whirling, dead-leaf
      sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Pipped. Shut up, Ossy&mdash;don't snore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, poor old dog! Let him. Shuffle for me, please. Oh! there goes another
      card!&rdquo; Her knee was touching his&mdash;!...
    </p>
    <p>
      The book had dropped&mdash;Summerhay started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dash it! Hopeless! And, turning round in that huge armchair, he snoozed
      down into its depths. In a few minutes, he was asleep. He slept without a
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two hours later when the same friend, seeking distraction, came on
      him, and stood grinning down at that curly head and face which just then
      had the sleepy abandonment of a small boy's. Maliciously he gave the chair
      a little kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay stirred, and thought: 'What! Where am I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the grinning face, above him, floated another, filmy,
      charming. He shook himself, and sat up. &ldquo;Oh, damn you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, old chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay uttered an unintelligible sound, and, turning over on the other
      arm, pretended to snooze down again. But he slept no more. Instead, he saw
      her face, heard her voice, and felt again the touch of her warm, gloved
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      At the opera, that Friday evening, they were playing &ldquo;Cavalleria&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Pagliacci&rdquo;&mdash;works of which Gyp tolerated the first and loved the
      second, while Winton found them, with &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; and &ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; about the only
      operas he could not sleep through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women's eyes, which must not stare, cover more space than the eyes of men,
      which must not stare, but do; women's eyes have less method, too, seeing
      all things at once, instead of one thing at a time. Gyp had seen Summerhay
      long before he saw her; seen him come in and fold his opera hat against
      his white waistcoat, looking round, as if for&mdash;someone. Her eyes
      criticized him in this new garb&mdash;his broad head, and its crisp, dark,
      shining hair, his air of sturdy, lazy, lovable audacity. He looked well in
      evening clothes. When he sat down, she could still see just a little of
      his profile; and, vaguely watching the stout Santuzza and the stouter
      Turiddu, she wondered whether, by fixing her eyes on him, she could make
      him turn and see her. Just then he did see her, and his face lighted up.
      She smiled back. Why not? She had not so many friends nowadays. But it was
      rather startling to find, after that exchange of looks, that she at once
      began to want another. Would he like her dress? Was her hair nice? She
      wished she had not had it washed that morning. But when the interval came,
      she did not look round, until his voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d'you do, Major Winton? Oh, how d'you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton had been told of the meeting in the train. He was pining for a
      cigarette, but had not liked to desert his daughter. After a few remarks,
      he got up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my pew a minute, Summerhay, I'm going to have a smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out, thinking, not for the first time by a thousand: 'Poor child,
      she never sees a soul! Twenty-five, pretty as paint, and clean out of the
      running. What the devil am I to do about her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay sat down. Gyp had a queer feeling, then, as if the house and
      people vanished, and they two were back again in the railway-carriage&mdash;alone
      together. Ten minutes to make the most of! To smile and talk, and enjoy
      the look in his eyes, the sound of his voice and laugh. To laugh, too, and
      be warm and nice to him. Why not? They were friends. And, presently, she
      said, smiling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the way, there's a picture in the National Gallery, I want you to
      look at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? Which? Will you take me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow's Saturday; may I meet you there? What time? Three?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp nodded. She knew she was flushing, and, at that moment, with the
      warmth in her cheeks and the smile in her eyes, she had the sensation, so
      rare and pleasant, of feeling beautiful. Then he was gone! Her father was
      slipping back into his stall; and, afraid of her own face, she touched his
      arm, and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, do look at that head-dress in the next row but one; did you ever see
      anything so delicious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while Winton was star-gazing, the orchestra struck up the overture to
      &ldquo;Pagliacci.&rdquo; Watching that heart-breaking little plot unfold, Gyp had
      something more than the old thrill, as if for the first time she
      understood it with other than her aesthetic sense. Poor Nedda! and poor
      Canio! Poor Silvio! Her breast heaved, and her eyes filled with tears.
      Within those doubled figures of the tragi-comedy she seemed to see, to
      feel that passionate love&mdash;too swift, too strong, too violent, sweet
      and fearful within them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &ldquo;Thou hast my heart, and I am thine for ever&mdash;
  To-night and for ever I am thine!
  What is there left to me?  What have I but a heart that is broken?&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And the clear, heart-aching music mocking it all, down to those last
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      La commedia e finita!
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was putting on her cloak, her eyes caught Summerhay's. She tried
      to smile&mdash;could not, gave a shake of her head, slowly forced her gaze
      away from his, and turned to follow Winton.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the National Gallery, next day, she was not late by coquetry, but
      because she had changed her dress at the last minute, and because she was
      afraid of letting him think her eager. She saw him at once standing under
      the colonnade, looking by no means imperturbable, and marked the change in
      his face when he caught sight of her, with a little thrill. She led him
      straight up into the first Italian room to contemplate his counterfeit. A
      top hat and modern collar did not improve the likeness, but it was there
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Do you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What are you smiling at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a photograph of that, ever since I was fifteen; so you see I've
      known you a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott! Am I like that? All right; I shall try and find YOU now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Gyp shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Come and look at my very favourite picture 'The Death of Procris.'
      What is it makes one love it so? Procris is out of drawing, and not
      beautiful; the faun's queer and ugly. What is it&mdash;can you tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay looked not at the picture, but at her. In aesthetic sense, he
      was not her equal. She said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wonder in the faun's face, Procris's closed eyes; the dog, and the
      swans, and the pity for what might have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, for what might have been! Did you enjoy 'Pagliacci'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I felt it too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you did. I watched you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Destruction by&mdash;love&mdash;seems such a terrible thing! Now show me
      your favourites. I believe I can tell you what they are, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 'Admiral,' for one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two Bellini's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, you ARE uncanny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want decision, clarity, colour, and fine texture. Is that right?
      Here's another of MY favourites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On a screen was a tiny &ldquo;Crucifixion&rdquo; by da Messina&mdash;the thinnest of
      high crosses, the thinnest of simple, humble, suffering Christs, lonely,
      and actual in the clear, darkened landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that touches one more than the big, idealized sort. One feels it
      WAS like that. Oh! And look&mdash;the Francesca's! Aren't they lovely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He repeated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; lovely!&rdquo; But his eyes said: &ldquo;And so are you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They spent two hours among those endless pictures, talking a little of art
      and of much besides, almost as alone as in the railway carriage. But, when
      she had refused to let him walk back with her, Summerhay stood stock-still
      beneath the colonnade. The sun streamed in under; the pigeons preened
      their feathers; people passed behind him and down there in the square,
      black and tiny against the lions and the great column. He took in nothing
      of all that. What was it in her? She was like no one he had ever known&mdash;not
      one! Different from girls and women in society as&mdash;Simile failed.
      Still more different from anything in the half-world he had met! Not the
      new sort&mdash;college, suffrage! Like no one! And he knew so little of
      her! Not even whether she had ever really been in love. Her husband&mdash;where
      was he; what was he to her? &ldquo;The rare, the mute, the inexpressive She!&rdquo;
       When she smiled; when her eyes&mdash;but her eyes were so quick, would
      drop before he could see right into them! How beautiful she had looked,
      gazing at that picture&mdash;her favourite, so softly, her lips just
      smiling! If he could kiss them, would he not go nearly mad? With a deep
      sigh, he moved down the wide, grey steps into the sunlight. And London,
      throbbing, overflowing with the season's life, seemed to him empty.
      To-morrow&mdash;yes, to-morrow he could call!
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      After that Sunday call, Gyp sat in the window at Bury Street close to a
      bowl of heliotrope on the window-sill. She was thinking over a passage of
      their conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Fiorsen, tell me about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What do you want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made a fearful mistake&mdash;against my father's wish. I haven't seen
      my husband for months; I shall never see him again if I can help it. Is
      that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be like having your head in chancery. Can't you get it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divorce-court! Ugh! I couldn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;it's hellish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was he, who gripped her hand so hard and said that, really the same
      nonchalant young man who had leaned out of the carriage window, gurgling
      with laughter? And what had made the difference? She buried her face in
      the heliotrope, whose perfume seemed the memory of his visit; then, going
      to the piano, began to play. She played Debussy, McDowell, Ravel; the
      chords of modern music suited her feelings just then. And she was still
      playing when her father came in. During these last nine months of his
      daughter's society, he had regained a distinct measure of youthfulness, an
      extra twist in his little moustache, an extra touch of dandyism in his
      clothes, and the gloss of his short hair. Gyp stopped playing at once, and
      shut the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Summerhay's been here, Dad. He was sorry to miss you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an appreciable pause before Winton answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there passed through Gyp the thought that she could never again be
      friends with a man without giving that pause. Then, conscious that her
      father was gazing at her, she turned and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, was it nice in the Park?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty years ago they were all nobs and snobs; now God himself doesn't
      know what they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But weren't the flowers nice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;and the trees, and the birds&mdash;but, by Jove, the humans do
      their best to dress the balance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a misanthrope you're getting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to run a stud for two-leggers; they want proper breeding. What
      sort of a fellow is young Summerhay? Not a bad face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered impassively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it's so alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his self-control, she could always read her father's thoughts
      quicker than he could read hers, and knew that he was struggling between
      the wish that she should have a good time and the desire to convey some
      kind of warning. He said, with a sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does a young man's fancy turn to in summer, Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Women who have subtle instincts and some experience are able to impose
      their own restraint on those who, at the lifting of a hand, would become
      their lovers. From that afternoon on, Gyp knew that a word from her would
      change everything; but she was far from speaking it. And yet, except at
      week-ends, when she went back to her baby at Mildenham, she saw Summerhay
      most days&mdash;in the Row, at the opera, or at Bury Street. She had a
      habit of going to St. James's Park in the late afternoon and sitting there
      by the water. Was it by chance that he passed one day on his way home from
      chambers, and that, after this, they sat there together constantly? Why
      make her father uneasy&mdash;when there was nothing to be uneasy about&mdash;by
      letting him come too often to Bury Street? It was so pleasant, too, out
      there, talking calmly of many things, while in front of them the small
      ragged children fished and put the fishes into clear glass bottles, to
      eat, or watch on rainy days, as is the custom of man with the minor works
      of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in nature, when the seasons are about to change, the days pass,
      tranquil, waiting for the wind that brings in the new. And was it not
      natural to sit under the trees, by the flowers and the water, the pigeons
      and the ducks, that wonderful July? For all was peaceful in Gyp's mind,
      except, now and then, when a sort of remorse possessed her, a sort of
      terror, and a sort of troubling sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay did not wear his heart on his sleeve, and when, on the
      closing-day of term, he left his chambers to walk to that last meeting,
      his face was much as usual under his grey top hat. But, in truth, he had
      come to a pretty pass. He had his own code of what was befitting to a
      gentleman. It was perhaps a trifle &ldquo;old Georgian,&rdquo; but it included doing
      nothing to distress a woman. All these weeks he had kept himself in hand;
      but to do so had cost him more than he liked to reflect on. The only
      witness of his struggles was his old Scotch terrier, whose dreams he had
      disturbed night after night, tramping up and down the long back-to-front
      sitting-room of his little house. She knew&mdash;must know&mdash;what he
      was feeling. If she wanted his love, she had but to raise her finger; and
      she had not raised it. When he touched her, when her dress disengaged its
      perfume or his eyes traced the slow, soft movement of her breathing, his
      head would go round, and to keep calm and friendly had been torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he could see her almost every day, this control had been just
      possible; but now that he was about to lose her&mdash;for weeks&mdash;his
      heart felt sick within him. He had been hard put to it before the world. A
      man passionately in love craves solitude, in which to alternate between
      fierce exercise and that trance-like stillness when a lover simply aches
      or is busy conjuring her face up out of darkness or the sunlight. He had
      managed to do his work, had been grateful for having it to do; but to his
      friends he had not given attention enough to prevent them saying: &ldquo;What's
      up with old Bryan?&rdquo; Always rather elusive in his movements, he was now too
      elusive altogether for those who had been accustomed to lunch, dine,
      dance, and sport with him. And yet he shunned his own company&mdash;going
      wherever strange faces, life, anything distracted him a little, without
      demanding real attention. It must be confessed that he had come
      unwillingly to discovery of the depth of his passion, aware that it meant
      giving up too much. But there are women who inspire feeling so direct and
      simple that reason does not come into play; and he had never asked himself
      whether Gyp was worth loving, whether she had this or that quality, such
      or such virtue. He wanted her exactly as she was; and did not weigh her in
      any sort of balance. It is possible for men to love passionately, yet know
      that their passion is but desire, possible for men to love for sheer
      spiritual worth, feeling that the loved one lacks this or that charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay's love had no such divided consciousness. About her past, too,
      he dismissed speculation. He remembered having heard in the hunting-field
      that she was Winton's natural daughter; even then it had made him long to
      punch the head of that covertside scandal-monger. The more there might be
      against the desirability of loving her, the more he would love her; even
      her wretched marriage only affected him in so far as it affected her
      happiness. It did not matter&mdash;nothing mattered except to see her and
      be with her as much as she would let him. And now she was going to the sea
      for a month, and he himself&mdash;curse it!&mdash;was due in Perthshire to
      shoot grouse. A month!
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly along the river. Dared he speak? At times, her face was
      like a child's when it expects some harsh or frightening word. One could
      not hurt her&mdash;impossible! But, at times, he had almost thought she
      would like him to speak. Once or twice he had caught a slow soft glance&mdash;gone
      the moment he had sight of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was before his time, and, leaning on the river parapet, watched the
      tide run down. The sun shone on the water, brightening its yellowish
      swirl, and little black eddies&mdash;the same water that had flowed along
      under the willows past Eynsham, past Oxford, under the church at Clifton,
      past Moulsford, past Sonning. And he thought: 'My God! To have her to
      myself one day on the river&mdash;one whole long day!' Why had he been so
      pusillanimous all this time? He passed his hand over his face. Broad faces
      do not easily grow thin, but his felt thin to him, and this gave him a
      kind of morbid satisfaction. If she knew how he was longing, how he
      suffered! He turned away, toward Whitehall. Two men he knew stopped to
      bandy a jest. One of them was just married. They, too, were off to
      Scotland for the twelfth. Pah! How stale and flat seemed that which till
      then had been the acme of the whole year to him! Ah, but if he had been
      going to Scotland WITH HER! He drew his breath in with a sigh that nearly
      removed the Home Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oblivious of the gorgeous sentries at the Horse Guards, oblivious of all
      beauty, he passed irresolute along the water, making for their usual seat;
      already, in fancy, he was sitting there, prodding at the gravel, a nervous
      twittering in his heart, and that eternal question: Dare I speak? asking
      itself within him. And suddenly he saw that she was before him, sitting
      there already. His heart gave a jump. No more craning&mdash;he WOULD
      speak!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wearing a maize-coloured muslin to which the sunlight gave a sort
      of transparency, and sat, leaning back, her knees crossed, one hand
      resting on the knob of her furled sunshade, her face half hidden by her
      shady hat. Summerhay clenched his teeth, and went straight up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp! No, I won't call you anything else. This can't go on! You know it
      can't. You know I worship you! If you can't love me, I've got to break
      away. All day, all night, I think and dream of nothing but you. Gyp, do
      you want me to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suppose she said: &ldquo;Yes, go!&rdquo; She made a little movement, as if in protest,
      and without looking at him, answered very low:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don't want you to go. How could I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you DO love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, please. Wait a little longer. When we come back I'll tell you: I
      promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A month. Is that long? Please! It's not easy for me.&rdquo; She smiled faintly,
      lifted her eyes to him just for a second. &ldquo;Please not any more now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening at his club, through the bluish smoke of cigarette after
      cigarette, he saw her face as she had lifted it for that one second; and
      now he was in heaven, now in hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      The verandahed bungalow on the South Coast, built and inhabited by an
      artist friend of Aunt Rosamund's, had a garden of which the chief feature
      was one pine-tree which had strayed in advance of the wood behind. The
      little house stood in solitude, just above a low bank of cliff whence the
      beach sank in sandy ridges. The verandah and thick pine wood gave ample
      shade, and the beach all the sun and sea air needful to tan little Gyp, a
      fat, tumbling soul, as her mother had been at the same age, incurably fond
      and fearless of dogs or any kind of beast, and speaking words already that
      required a glossary.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, Gyp, looking from her bedroom through the flat branches of the
      pine, would get a feeling of being the only creature in the world. The
      crinkled, silvery sea, that lonely pine-tree, the cold moon, the sky dark
      corn-flower blue, the hiss and sucking rustle of the surf over the beach
      pebbles, even the salt, chill air, seemed lonely. By day, too&mdash;in the
      hazy heat when the clouds merged, scarce drifting, into the blue, and the
      coarse sea-grass tufts hardly quivered, and sea-birds passed close above
      the water with chuckle and cry&mdash;it all often seemed part of a dream.
      She bathed, and grew as tanned as her little daughter, a regular Gypsy, in
      her broad hat and linen frocks; and yet she hardly seemed to be living
      down here at all, for she was never free of the memory of that last
      meeting with Summerhay. Why had he spoken and put an end to their quiet
      friendship, and left her to such heart-searchings all by herself? But she
      did not want his words unsaid. Only, how to know whether to recoil and
      fly, or to pass beyond the dread of letting herself go, of plunging deep
      into the unknown depths of love&mdash;of that passion, whose nature for
      the first time she had tremulously felt, watching &ldquo;Pagliacci&rdquo;&mdash;and
      had ever since been feeling and trembling at! Must it really be neck or
      nothing? Did she care enough to break through all barriers, fling herself
      into midstream? When they could see each other every day, it was so easy
      to live for the next meeting&mdash;not think of what was coming after. But
      now, with all else cut away, there was only the future to think about&mdash;hers
      and his. But need she trouble about his? Would he not just love her as
      long as he liked?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she thought of her father&mdash;still faithful to a memory&mdash;and
      felt ashamed. Some men loved on&mdash;yes&mdash;even beyond death! But,
      sometimes, she would think: 'Am I a candle-flame again? Is he just going
      to burn himself? What real good can I be to him&mdash;I, without freedom,
      and with my baby, who will grow up?' Yet all these thoughts were, in a
      way, unreal. The struggle was in herself, so deep that she could hardly
      understand it; as might be an effort to subdue the instinctive dread of a
      precipice. And she would feel a kind of resentment against all the happy
      life round her these summer days&mdash;the sea-birds, the sunlight, and
      the waves; the white sails far out; the calm sun-steeped pine-trees; her
      baby, tumbling and smiling and softly twittering; and Betty and the other
      servants&mdash;all this life that seemed so simple and untortured.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the one post each day she looked forward terribly. And yet his letters,
      which began like hers: &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; might have been read by anyone&mdash;almost.
      She spent a long time over her answers. She was not sleeping well; and,
      lying awake, she could see his face very distinct before her closed eyes&mdash;its
      teasing, lazy smile, its sudden intent gravity. Once she had a dream of
      him, rushing past her down into the sea. She called, but, without turning
      his head, he swam out further, further, till she lost sight of him, and
      woke up suddenly with a pain in her heart. &ldquo;If you can't love me, I've got
      to break away!&rdquo; His face, his flung-back head reminded her too sharply of
      those words. Now that he was away from her, would he not feel that it was
      best to break, and forget her? Up there, he would meet girls untouched by
      life&mdash;not like herself. He had everything before him; could he
      possibly go on wanting one who had nothing before her? Some blue-eyed girl
      with auburn hair&mdash;that type so superior to her own&mdash;would sweep,
      perhaps had already swept him, away from her! What then? No worse than it
      used to be? Ah, so much worse that she dared not think of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for five days, no letter came. And, with each blank morning, the
      ache in her grew&mdash;a sharp, definite ache of longing and jealousy,
      utterly unlike the mere feeling of outraged pride when she had surprised
      Fiorsen and Daphne Wing in the music-room&mdash;a hundred years ago, it
      seemed. When on the fifth day the postman left nothing but a bill for
      little Gyp's shoes, and a note from Aunt Rosamund at Harrogate, where she
      had gone with Winton for the annual cure, Gyp's heart sank to the depths.
      Was this the end? And, with a blind, numb feeling, she wandered out into
      the wood, where the fall of the pine-needles, season after season, had
      made of the ground one soft, dark, dust-coloured bed, on which the
      sunlight traced the pattern of the pine boughs, and ants rummaged about
      their great heaped dwellings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp went along till she could see no outer world for the grey-brown
      tree-stems streaked with gum-resin; and, throwing herself down on her
      face, dug her elbows deep into the pine dust. Tears, so rare with her,
      forced their way up, and trickled slowly to the hands whereon her chin
      rested. No good&mdash;crying! Crying only made her ill; crying was no
      relief. She turned over on her back and lay motionless, the sunbeams warm
      on her cheeks. Silent here, even at noon! The sough of the calm sea could
      not reach so far; the flies were few; no bird sang. The tall bare pine
      stems rose up all round like columns in a temple roofed with the dark
      boughs and sky. Cloud-fleeces drifted slowly over the blue. There should
      be peace&mdash;but in her heart there was none!
    </p>
    <p>
      A dusky shape came padding through the trees a little way off, another&mdash;two
      donkeys loose from somewhere, who stood licking each other's necks and
      noses. Those two humble beasts, so friendly, made her feel ashamed. Why
      should she be sorry for herself, she who had everything in life she wanted&mdash;except
      love&mdash;the love she had thought she would never want? Ah, but she
      wanted it now, wanted it at last with all her being!
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shudder, she sprang up; the ants had got to her, and she had to
      pick them off her neck and dress. She wandered back towards the beach. If
      he had truly found someone to fill his thoughts, and drive her out, all
      the better for him; she would never, by word or sign, show him that she
      missed, and wanted him&mdash;never! She would sooner die!
    </p>
    <p>
      She came out into the sunshine. The tide was low; and the wet foreshore
      gleamed with opal tints; there were wandering tracks on the sea, as of
      great serpents winding their way beneath the surface; and away to the west
      the archwayed, tawny rock that cut off the line of coast was like a
      dream-shape. All was dreamy. And, suddenly her heart began beating to
      suffocation and the colour flooded up in her cheeks. On the edge of the
      low cliff bank, by the side of the path, Summerhay was sitting!
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and came toward her. Putting her hands up to her glowing face,
      she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it's me. Did you ever see such a gipsified object? I thought you
      were still in Scotland. How's dear Ossy?&rdquo; Then her self-possession failed,
      and she looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no good, Gyp. I must know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Gyp that her heart had given up beating; she said quietly:
      &ldquo;Let's sit down a minute&rdquo;; and moved under the cliff bank where they could
      not be seen from the house. There, drawing the coarse grass blades through
      her fingers, she said, with a shiver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't try to make you, did I? I never tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who cares? No one could care who loves as I do. Oh, Gyp, can't you love
      me? I know I'm nothing much.&rdquo; How quaint and boyish! &ldquo;But it's eleven
      weeks to-day since we met in the train. I don't think I've had one
      minute's let-up since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you tried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I, when I love you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp sighed; relief, delight, pain&mdash;she did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is to be done? Look over there&mdash;that bit of blue in the
      grass is my baby daughter. There's her&mdash;and my father&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid&mdash;afraid of love, Bryan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that first use of his name, Summerhay turned pale and seized her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid&mdash;how&mdash;afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said very low:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might love too much. Don't say any more now. No; don't! Let's go in and
      have lunch.&rdquo; And she got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed till tea-time, and not a word more of love did he speak. But
      when he was gone, she sat under the pine-tree with little Gyp on her lap.
      Love! If her mother had checked love, she herself would never have been
      born. The midges were biting before she went in. After watching Betty give
      little Gyp her bath, she crossed the passage to her bedroom and leaned out
      of the window. Could it have been to-day she had lain on the ground with
      tears of despair running down on to her hands? Away to the left of the
      pine-tree, the moon had floated up, soft, barely visible in the paling
      sky. A new world, an enchanted garden! And between her and it&mdash;what
      was there?
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening she sat with a book on her lap, not reading; and in her went
      on the strange revolution which comes in the souls of all women who are
      not half-men when first they love&mdash;the sinking of 'I' into 'Thou,'
      the passionate, spiritual subjection, the intense, unconscious giving-up
      of will, in preparation for completer union.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slept without dreaming, awoke heavy and oppressed. Too languid to
      bathe, she sat listless on the beach with little Gyp all the morning. Had
      she energy or spirit to meet him in the afternoon by the rock archway, as
      she had promised? For the first time since she was a small and naughty
      child, she avoided the eyes of Betty. One could not be afraid of that
      stout, devoted soul, but one could feel that she knew too much. When the
      time came, after early tea, she started out; for if she did not go, he
      would come, and she did not want the servants to see him two days running.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last day of August was warm and still, and had a kind of beneficence&mdash;the
      corn all gathered in, the apples mellowing, robins singing already, a few
      slumberous, soft clouds, a pale blue sky, a smiling sea. She went inland,
      across the stream, and took a footpath back to the shore. No pines grew on
      that side, where the soil was richer&mdash;of a ruddy brown. The second
      crops of clover were already high; in them humblebees were hard at work;
      and, above, the white-throated swallows dipped and soared. Gyp gathered a
      bunch of chicory flowers. She was close above the shore before she saw him
      standing in the rock archway, looking for her across the beach. After the
      hum of the bees and flies, it was very quiet here&mdash;only the faintest
      hiss of tiny waves. He had not yet heard her coming, and the thought
      flashed through her: 'If I take another step, it is for ever! She stood
      there scarcely breathing, the chicory flowers held before her lips. Then
      she heard him sigh, and, moving quickly forward, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned round, seized her hand, and, without a word, they passed through
      the archway. They walked on the hard sand, side by side, till he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go up into the fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They scrambled up the low cliff and went along the grassy top to a gate
      into a stubble field. He held it open for her, but, as she passed, caught
      her in his arms and kissed her lips as if he would never stop. To her, who
      had been kissed a thousand times, it was the first kiss. Deadly pale, she
      fell back from him against the gate; then, her lips still quivering, her
      eyes very dark, she looked at him distraught with passion, drunk on that
      kiss. And, suddenly turning round to the gate, she laid her arms on the
      top bar and buried her face on them. A sob came up in her throat that
      seemed to tear her to bits, and she cried as if her heart would break. His
      timid despairing touches, his voice close to her ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp, Gyp! My darling! My love! Oh, don't, Gyp!&rdquo; were not of the least
      avail; she could not stop. That kiss had broken down something in her
      soul, swept away her life up to that moment, done something terrible and
      wonderful. At last, she struggled out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry&mdash;so sorry! Don't&mdash;don't look at me! Go away a little,
      and I'll&mdash;I'll be all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed without a word, and, passing through the gate, sat down on the
      edge of the cliff with his back to her, looking out over the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gripping the wood of the old grey gate till it hurt her hands, Gyp gazed
      at the chicory flowers and poppies that had grown up again in the stubble
      field, at the butterflies chasing in the sunlight over the hedge toward
      the crinkly foam edging the quiet sea till they were but fluttering white
      specks in the blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she had rubbed her cheeks and smoothed her face, she was no
      nearer to feeling that she could trust herself. What had happened in her
      was too violent, too sweet, too terrifying. And going up to him she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go home now by myself. Please, let me go, dear. To-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever you wish, Gyp&mdash;always!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand against his cheek, then let it go, and, folding his
      arms tight, resumed his meaningless stare at the sea. Gyp turned away. She
      crossed back to the other side of the stream, but did not go in for a long
      time, sitting in the pine wood till the evening gathered and the stars
      crept out in a sky of that mauve-blue which the psychic say is the
      soul-garment colour of the good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night, when she had finished brushing her hair, she opened her
      window and stepped out on to the verandah. How warm! How still! Not a
      sound from the sleeping house&mdash;not a breath of wind! Her face, framed
      in her hair, her hands, and all her body, felt as if on fire. The moon
      behind the pine-tree branches was filling every cranny of her brain with
      wakefulness. The soft shiver of the wellnigh surfless sea on a rising
      tide, rose, fell, rose, fell. The sand cliff shone like a bank of snow.
      And all was inhabited, as a moonlit night is wont to be, by a magical
      Presence. A big moth went past her face, so close that she felt the
      flutter of its wings. A little night beast somewhere was scruttling in
      bushes or the sand. Suddenly, across the wan grass the shadow of the
      pine-trunk moved. It moved&mdash;ever so little&mdash;moved! And,
      petrified&mdash;Gyp stared. There, joined to the trunk, Summerhay was
      standing, his face just visible against the stem, the moonlight on one
      cheek, a hand shading his eyes. He moved that hand, held it out in
      supplication. For long&mdash;how long&mdash;Gyp did not stir, looking
      straight at that beseeching figure. Then, with a feeling she had never
      known, she saw him coming. He came up to the verandah and stood looking up
      at her. She could see all the workings of his face&mdash;passion,
      reverence, above all amazement; and she heard his awed whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Gyp? Really you? You look so young&mdash;so young!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      VII
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment of surrender, Gyp passed straight into a state the more
      enchanted because she had never believed in it, had never thought that she
      could love as she now loved. Days and nights went by in a sort of dream,
      and when Summerhay was not with her, she was simply waiting with a smile
      on her lips for the next hour of meeting. Just as she had never felt it
      possible to admit the world into the secrets of her married life, so, now
      she did not consider the world at all. Only the thought of her father
      weighed on her conscience. He was back in town. And she felt that she must
      tell him. When Summerhay heard this he only said: &ldquo;All right, Gyp,
      whatever you think best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And two days before her month at the bungalow was up, she went, leaving
      Betty and little Gyp to follow on the last day. Winton, pale and somewhat
      languid, as men are when they have been cured, found her when he came in
      from the club. She had put on evening dress, and above the pallor of her
      shoulders, her sunwarmed face and throat had almost the colour of a
      nectarine. He had never seen her look like that, never seen her eyes so
      full of light. And he uttered a quiet grunt of satisfaction. It was as if
      a flower, which he had last seen in close and elegant shape, had bloomed
      in full perfection. She did not meet his gaze quite steadily and all that
      evening kept putting her confession off and off. It was not easy&mdash;far
      from easy. At last, when he was smoking his &ldquo;go-to-bed&rdquo; cigarette, she
      took a cushion and sank down on it beside his chair, leaning against his
      knee, where her face was hidden from him, as on that day after her first
      ball, when she had listened to HIS confession. And she began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, do you remember my saying once that I didn't understand what you and
      my mother felt for each other?&rdquo; Winton did not speak; misgiving had taken
      possession of him. Gyp went on: &ldquo;I know now how one would rather die than
      give someone up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton drew his breath in sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Summerhay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I used to think I should never be in love, but you knew better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Better!
    </p>
    <p>
      In disconsolate silence, he thought rapidly: 'What's to be done? What can
      I do? Get her a divorce?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps because of the ring in her voice, or the sheer seriousness of the
      position, he did not feel resentment as when he lost her to Fiorsen. Love!
      A passion such as had overtaken her mother and himself! And this young
      man? A decent fellow, a good rider&mdash;comprehensible! Ah, if the course
      had only been clear! He put his hand on her shoulder and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gyp, we must go for the divorce, then, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too late. Let HIM divorce me, if he only will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton needed all his self-control at that moment. Too late? Already!
      Sudden recollection that he had not the right to say a word alone kept him
      silent. Gyp went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love him, with every bit of me. I don't care what comes&mdash;whether
      it's open or secret. I don't care what anybody thinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had turned round now, and if Winton had doubt of her feeling, he lost
      it. This was a Gyp he had never seen! A glowing, soft, quick-breathing
      creature, with just that lithe watchful look of the mother cat or lioness
      whose whelps are threatened. There flashed through him a recollection of
      how, as a child, with face very tense, she would ride at fences that were
      too big. At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry you didn't tell me sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't. I didn't know. Oh, Dad, I'm always hurting you! Forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was pressing his hand to her cheek that felt burning hot. And he
      thought: &ldquo;Forgive! Of course I forgive. That's not the point; the point is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a vision of his loved one talked about, besmirched, bandied from mouth
      to mouth, or else&mdash;for her what there had been for him, a
      hole-and-corner life, an underground existence of stealthy meetings kept
      dark, above all from her own little daughter. Ah, not that! And yet&mdash;was
      not even that better than the other, which revolted to the soul his
      fastidious pride in her, roused in advance his fury against tongues that
      would wag, and eyes that would wink or be uplifted in righteousness?
      Summerhay's world was more or less his world; scandal, which&mdash;like
      all parasitic growths&mdash;flourishes in enclosed spaces, would have
      every chance. And, at once, his brain began to search, steely and quick,
      for some way out; and the expression as when a fox broke covert, came on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody knows, Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was something! With an irritation that rose from his very soul, he
      muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't stand it that you should suffer, and that fellow Fiorsen go
      scot-free. Can you give up seeing Summerhay while we get you a divorce? We
      might do it, if no one knows. I think you owe it to me, Gyp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp got up and stood by the window a long time without answering. Winton
      watched her face. At last she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't. We might stop seeing each other; it isn't that. It's what I
      should feel. I shouldn't respect myself after; I should feel so mean. Oh,
      Dad, don't you see? He really loved me in his way. And to pretend! To make
      out a case for myself, tell about Daphne Wing, about his drinking, and
      baby; pretend that I wanted him to love me, when I got to hate it and
      didn't care really whether he was faithful or not&mdash;and knowing all
      the while that I've been everything to someone else! I couldn't. I'd much
      rather let him know, and ask him to divorce me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose he won't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my mind would be clear, anyway; and we would take what we could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And little Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Staring before her as if trying to see into the future, she said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day, she'll understand, as I do. Or perhaps it will be all over
      before she knows. Does happiness ever last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, going up to him, she bent over, kissed his forehead, and went out.
      The warmth from her lips, and the scent of her remained with Winton like a
      sensation wafted from the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there then nothing to be done&mdash;nothing? Men of his stamp do not,
      as a general thing, see very deep even into those who are nearest to them;
      but to-night he saw his daughter's nature more fully perhaps than ever
      before. No use to importune her to act against her instincts&mdash;not a
      bit of use! And yet&mdash;how to sit and watch it all&mdash;watch his own
      passion with its ecstasy and its heart-burnings re-enacted with her&mdash;perhaps
      for many years? And the old vulgar saying passed through his mind: &ldquo;What's
      bred in the bone will come out in the meat.&rdquo; Now she had given, she would
      give with both hands&mdash;beyond measure&mdash;beyond!&mdash;as he
      himself, as her mother had given! Ah, well, she was better off than his
      own loved one had been. One must not go ahead of trouble, or cry over
      spilled milk!
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp had a wakeful night. The question she herself had raised, of telling
      Fiorsen, kept her thoughts in turmoil. Was he likely to divorce her if she
      did? His contempt for what he called 'these bourgeois morals,' his
      instability, the very unpleasantness, and offence to his vanity&mdash;all
      this would prevent him. No; he would not divorce her, she was sure, unless
      by any chance he wanted legal freedom, and that was quite unlikely. What
      then would be gained? Ease for her conscience? But had she any right to
      ease her conscience if it brought harm to her lover? And was it not
      ridiculous to think of conscience in regard to one who, within a year of
      marriage, had taken to himself a mistress, and not even spared the home
      paid for and supported by his wife? No; if she told Fiorsen, it would only
      be to salve her pride, wounded by doing what she did not avow. Besides,
      where was he? At the other end of the world for all she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came down to breakfast, dark under the eyes and no whit advanced
      toward decision. Neither of them mentioned their last night's talk, and
      Gyp went back to her room to busy herself with dress, after those weeks
      away. It was past noon when, at a muffled knock, she found Markey outside
      her door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Fiorsen, m'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp beckoned him in, and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the hall, m'm&mdash;slipped in when I answered the bell; short of
      shoving, I couldn't keep him out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp stood full half a minute before she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my father in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, m'm; the major's gone to the fencin'-club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said I would see. So far as I was aware, nobody was in. Shall I have a
      try to shift him, m'm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a faint smile Gyp shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no one can see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Markey's woodcock eyes, under their thin, dark, twisting brows, fastened
      on her dolefully; he opened the door to go. Fiorsen was standing there,
      and, with a quick movement, came in. She saw Markey raise his arms as if
      to catch him round the waist, and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Markey&mdash;wait outside, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the door was shut, she retreated against her dressing-table and stood
      gazing at her husband, while her heart throbbed as if it would leap
      through its coverings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had grown a short beard, his cheeks seemed a little fatter, and his
      eyes surely more green; otherwise, he looked much as she remembered him.
      And the first thought that passed through her was: 'Why did I ever pity
      him? He'll never fret or drink himself to death&mdash;he's got enough
      vitality for twenty men.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His face, which had worn a fixed, nervous smile, grew suddenly grave as
      her own, and his eyes roved round the room in the old half-fierce,
      half-furtive way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gyp,&rdquo; he said, and his voice shook a little: &ldquo;At last! Won't you
      kiss me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question seemed to Gyp idiotic; and suddenly she felt quite cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to speak to my father, you must come later; he's out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen gave one of his fierce shrugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it likely? Look, Gyp! I returned from Russia yesterday. I was a great
      success, made a lot of money out there. Come back to me! I will be good&mdash;I
      swear it! Now I have seen you again, I can't be without you. Ah, Gyp, come
      back to me! And see how good I will be. I will take you abroad, you and
      the bambina. We will go to Rome&mdash;anywhere you like&mdash;live how you
      like. Only come back to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp answered stonily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are talking nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp, I swear to you I have not seen a woman&mdash;not one fit to put
      beside you. Oh, Gyp, be good to me once more. This time I will not fail.
      Try me! Try me, my Gyp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only at this moment of his pleading, whose tragic tones seemed to her both
      false and childish, did Gyp realize the strength of the new feeling in her
      heart. And the more that feeling throbbed within her, the harder her face
      and her voice grew. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is all you came to say&mdash;please go. I will never come back to
      you. Once for all, understand, PLEASE.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silence in which he received her words, and his expression, impressed
      her far more than his appeal; with one of his stealthy movements he came
      quite close, and, putting his face forward till it almost touched her,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my wife. I want you back. I must have you back. If you do not
      come, I will kill either you or myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she felt his arms knotted behind her back, crushing her to
      him. She stilled a scream; then, very swiftly, took a resolve, and, rigid
      in his arms, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go; you hurt me. Sit down quietly. I will tell you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of her voice made him loosen his grasp and crane back to see her
      face. Gyp detached his arms from her completely, sat down on an old oak
      chest, and motioned him to the window-seat. Her heart thumped pitifully;
      cold waves of almost physical sickness passed through and through her. She
      had smelt brandy in his breath when he was close to her. It was like being
      in the cage of a wild beast; it was like being with a madman! The
      remembrance of him with his fingers stretched out like claws above her
      baby was so vivid at that moment that she could scarcely see him as he
      was, sitting there quietly, waiting for what she was going to say. And
      fixing her eyes on him, she said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you love me, Gustav. I tried to love you, too, but I never could&mdash;never
      from the first. I tried very hard. Surely you care what a woman feels,
      even if she happens to be your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could see his face quiver; and she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I found I couldn't love you, I felt I had no right over you. I
      didn't stand on my rights. Did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again his face quivered, and again she hurried on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you wouldn't expect me to go all through my life without ever feeling
      love&mdash;you who've felt it so many times?&rdquo; Then, clasping her hands
      tight, with a sort of wonder at herself, she murmured: &ldquo;I AM in love. I've
      given myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a queer, whining sound, covering his face. And the beggar's tag:
      &ldquo;'Ave a feelin' 'eart, gentleman&mdash;'ave a feelin' 'eart!&rdquo; passed
      idiotically through Gyp's mind. Would he get up and strangle her? Should
      she dash to the door&mdash;escape? For a long, miserable moment, she
      watched him swaying on the window-seat, with his face covered. Then,
      without looking at her, he crammed a clenched hand up against his mouth,
      and rushed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open door, Gyp had a glimpse of Markey's motionless figure,
      coming to life as Fiorsen passed. She drew a long breath, locked the door,
      and lay down on her bed. Her heart beat dreadfully. For a moment,
      something had checked his jealous rage. But if on this shock he began to
      drink, what might not happen? He had said something wild. And she
      shuddered. But what right had he to feel jealousy and rage against her?
      What right? She got up and went to the glass, trembling, mechanically
      tidying her hair. Miraculous that she had come through unscathed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thoughts flew to Summerhay. They were to meet at three o'clock by the
      seat in St. James's Park. But all was different, now; difficult and
      dangerous! She must wait, take counsel with her father. And yet if she did
      not keep that tryst, how anxious he would be&mdash;thinking that all sorts
      of things had happened to her; thinking perhaps&mdash;oh, foolish!&mdash;that
      she had forgotten, or even repented of her love. What would she herself
      think, if he were to fail her at their first tryst after those days of
      bliss? Certainly that he had changed his mind, seen she was not worth it,
      seen that a woman who could give herself so soon, so easily, was one to
      whom he could not sacrifice his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this cruel uncertainty, she spent the next two hours, till it was
      nearly three. If she did not go out, he would come on to Bury Street, and
      that would be still more dangerous. She put on her hat and walked swiftly
      towards St. James's Palace. Once sure that she was not being followed, her
      courage rose, and she passed rapidly down toward the water. She was ten
      minutes late, and seeing him there, walking up and down, turning his head
      every few seconds so as not to lose sight of the bench, she felt almost
      lightheaded from joy. When they had greeted with that pathetic casualness
      of lovers which deceives so few, they walked on together past Buckingham
      Palace, up into the Green Park, beneath the trees. During this progress,
      she told him about her father; but only when they were seated in that
      comparative refuge, and his hand was holding hers under cover of the
      sunshade that lay across her knee, did she speak of Fiorsen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tightened his grasp of her hand; then, suddenly dropping it, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he touch you, Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp heard that question with a shock. Touch her! Yes! But what did it
      matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a little shuddering sound; and, wondering, mournful, she looked at
      him. His hands and teeth were clenched. She said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bryan! Don't! I wouldn't let him kiss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have to force his eyes to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; he said, and, staring before him, bit his nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp sat motionless, cut to the heart. She was soiled, and spoiled for him!
      Of course! And yet a sense of injustice burned in her. Her heart had never
      been touched; it was his utterly. But that was not enough for a man&mdash;he
      wanted an untouched body, too. That she could not give; he should have
      thought of that sooner, instead of only now. And, miserably, she, too,
      stared before her, and her face hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little boy came and stood still in front of them, regarding her with
      round, unmoving eyes. She was conscious of a slice of bread and jam in his
      hand, and that his mouth and cheeks were smeared with red. A woman called
      out: &ldquo;Jacky! Come on, now!&rdquo; and he was hauled away, still looking back,
      and holding out his bread and jam as though offering her a bite. She felt
      Summerhay's arm slipping round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's over, darling. Never again&mdash;I promise you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, he might promise&mdash;might even keep that promise. But he would
      suffer, always suffer, thinking of that other. And she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can only have me as I am, Bryan. I can't make myself new for you; I
      wish I could&mdash;oh, I wish I could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have cut my tongue out first! Don't think of it! Come home to
      me and have tea&mdash;there's no one there. Ah, do, Gyp&mdash;come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hands and pulled her up. And all else left Gyp but the joy of
      being close to him, going to happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      IX
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen, passing Markey like a blind man, made his way out into the
      street, but had not gone a hundred yards before he was hurrying back. He
      had left his hat. The servant, still standing there, handed him that
      wide-brimmed object and closed the door in his face. Once more he moved
      away, going towards Piccadilly. If it had not been for the expression on
      Gyp's face, what might he not have done? And, mixed with sickening
      jealousy, he felt a sort of relief, as if he had been saved from something
      horrible. So she had never loved him! Never at all? Impossible! Impossible
      that a woman on whom he had lavished such passion should never have felt
      passion for him&mdash;never any! Innumerable images of her passed before
      him&mdash;surrendering, always surrendering. It could not all have been
      pretence! He was not a common man&mdash;she herself had said so; he had
      charm&mdash;or, other women thought so! She had lied; she must have lied,
      to excuse herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into a cafe and asked for a fine champagne. They brought him a
      carafe, with the measures marked. He sat there a long time. When he rose,
      he had drunk nine, and he felt better, with a kind of ferocity that was
      pleasant in his veins and a kind of nobility that was pleasant in his
      soul. Let her love, and be happy with her lover! But let him get his
      fingers on that fellow's throat! Let her be happy, if she could keep her
      lover from him! And suddenly, he stopped in his tracks, for there on a
      sandwich-board just in front of him were the words: &ldquo;Daphne Wing.
      Pantheon. Daphne Wing. Plastic Danseuse. Poetry of Motion. To-day at three
      o'clock. Pantheon. Daphne Wing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah, SHE had loved him&mdash;little Daphne! It was past three. Going in, he
      took his place in the stalls, close to the stage, and stared before him,
      with a sort of bitter amusement. This was irony indeed! Ah&mdash;and here
      she came! A Pierrette&mdash;in short, diaphanous muslin, her face whitened
      to match it; a Pierrette who stood slowly spinning on her toes, with arms
      raised and hands joined in an arch above her glistening hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Idiotic pose! Idiotic! But there was the old expression on her face,
      limpid, dovelike. And that something of the divine about her dancing smote
      Fiorsen through all the sheer imbecility of her posturings. Across and
      across she flitted, pirouetting, caught up at intervals by a Pierrot in
      black tights with a face as whitened as her own, held upside down, or
      right end up with one knee bent sideways, and the toe of a foot pressed
      against the ankle of the other, and arms arched above her. Then, with
      Pierrot's hands grasping her waist, she would stand upon one toe and
      slowly twiddle, lifting her other leg toward the roof, while the trembling
      of her form manifested cunningly to all how hard it was; then, off the
      toe, she capered out to the wings, and capered back, wearing on her face
      that divine, lost, dovelike look, while her perfect legs gleamed white up
      to the very thigh-joint. Yes; on the stage she was adorable! And raising
      his hands high, Fiorsen clapped and called out: &ldquo;Brava!&rdquo; He marked the
      sudden roundness of her eyes, a tiny start&mdash;no more. She had seen
      him. 'Ah! Some don't forget me!' he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she came on for her second dance, assisted this time only by her
      own image reflected in a little weedy pool about the middle of the stage.
      From the programme Fiorsen read, &ldquo;Ophelia's last dance,&rdquo; and again he
      grinned. In a clinging sea-green gown, cut here and there to show her
      inevitable legs, with marguerites and corn-flowers in her unbound hair,
      she circled her own reflection, languid, pale, desolate; then slowly
      gaining the abandon needful to a full display, danced with frenzy till, in
      a gleam of limelight, she sank into the apparent water and floated among
      paper water-lilies on her back. Lovely she looked there, with her eyes
      still open, her lips parted, her hair trailing behind. And again Fiorsen
      raised his hands high to clap, and again called out: 'Brava!' But the
      curtain fell, and Ophelia did not reappear. Was it the sight of him, or
      was she preserving the illusion that she was drowned? That &ldquo;arty&rdquo; touch
      would be just like her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Averting his eyes from two comedians in calico, beating each other about
      the body, he rose with an audible &ldquo;Pish!&rdquo; and made his way out. He stopped
      in the street to scribble on his card, &ldquo;Will you see me?&mdash;G. F.&rdquo; and
      took it round to the stage-door. The answer came back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Wing will see you m a minute, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And leaning against the distempered wall of the draughty corridor, a queer
      smile on his face, Fiorsen wondered why the devil he was there, and what
      the devil she would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was admitted, she was standing with her hat on, while her
      &ldquo;dresser&rdquo; buttoned her patent-leather shoes. Holding out her hand above
      the woman's back, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Fiorsen, how do you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen took the little moist hand; and his eyes passed over her, avoiding
      a direct meeting with her eyes. He received an impression of something
      harder, more self-possessed, than he remembered. Her face was the same,
      yet not the same; only her perfect, supple little body was as it had been.
      The dresser rose, murmured: &ldquo;Good-afternoon, miss,&rdquo; and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen you for a long time, have I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I've been abroad. You dance as beautifully as ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; it hasn't hurt my dancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an effort, he looked her in the face. Was this really the same girl
      who had clung to him, cloyed him with her kisses, her tears, her appeals
      for love&mdash;just a little love? Ah, but she was more desirable, much
      more desirable than he had remembered! And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a kiss, little Daphne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing did not stir; her white teeth rested on her lower lip; she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, thank you! How is Mrs. Fiorsen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen turned abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, has she divorced you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Stop talking of her; stop talking, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing, still motionless in the centre of her little crowded
      dressing-room said, in a matter-of-fact voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are polite, aren't you? It's funny; I can't tell whether I'm glad to
      see you. I had a bad time, you know; and Mrs. Fiorsen was an angel. Why do
      you come to see me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Exactly! Why had he come? The thought flashed through him: 'She'll help me
      to forget.' And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a great brute to you, Daphne. I came to make up, if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; you can't make up&mdash;thank you!&rdquo; A shudder ran through her,
      and she began drawing on her gloves. &ldquo;You taught me a lot, you know. I
      ought to be quite grateful. Oh, you've grown a little beard! D'you think
      that improves you? It makes you look rather like Mephistopheles, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen stared fixedly at that perfectly shaped face, where a faint,
      underdone pink mingled with the fairness of the skin. Was she mocking him?
      Impossible! She looked too matter of fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you live now?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm on my own, in a studio. You can come and see it, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only, you'd better understand. I've had enough of love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even for another?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing answered calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would treat me like a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen bit his lip, and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have the pleasure of giving you some tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you; I'm very hungry. I don't eat lunch on matinee-days; I
      find it better not. Do you like my Ophelia dance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's artificial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it IS artificial&mdash;it's done with mirrors and wire netting, you
      know. But do I give you the illusion of being mad?&rdquo; Fiorsen nodded. &ldquo;I'm
      so glad. Shall we go? I do want my tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned round, scrutinized herself in the glass, touched her hat with
      both hands, revealing, for a second, all the poised beauty of her figure,
      took a little bag from the back of a chair, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, if you don't mind going on, it's less conspicuous. I'll meet you
      at Ruffel's&mdash;they have lovely things there. Au revoir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a state of bewilderment, irritation, and queer meekness, Fiorsen passed
      down Coventry Street, and entering the empty Ruffel's, took a table near
      the window. There he sat staring before him, for the sudden vision of Gyp
      sitting on that oaken chest, at the foot of her bed, had blotted the girl
      clean out. The attendant coming to take his order, gazed at his pale,
      furious face, and said mechanically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I get you, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking up, Fiorsen saw Daphne Wing outside, gazing at the cakes in the
      window. She came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here you are! I should like iced coffee and walnut cake, and some of
      those marzipan sweets&mdash;oh, and some whipped cream with my cake. Do
      you mind?&rdquo; And, sitting down, she fixed her eyes on his face and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been abroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stockholm, Budapest, Moscow, other places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How perfect! Do you think I should make a success in Budapest or Moscow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might; you are English enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Do you think I'm very English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Utterly. Your kind of&mdash;&rdquo; But even he was not quite capable of
      finishing that sentence&mdash;&ldquo;your kind of vulgarity could not be
      produced anywhere else.&rdquo; Daphne Wing finished it for him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My kind of beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen grinned and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think that's the nicest thing you ever said to me! Only, of course,
      I should like to think I'm more of the Greek type&mdash;pagan, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell silent, casting her eyes down. Her profile at that moment,
      against the light, was very pure and soft in line. And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you hate me, little Daphne? You ought to hate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing looked up; her round, blue-grey eyes passed over him much as
      they had been passing over the marzipan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don't hate you&mdash;now. Of course, if I had any love left for
      you, I should. Oh, isn't that Irish? But one can think anybody a rotter
      without hating them, can't one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen bit his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think me a 'rotter'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing's eyes grew rounder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren't you? You couldn't be anything else&mdash;could you?&mdash;with
      the sort of things you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you don't mind having tea with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing, who had begun to eat and drink, said with her mouth full:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I'm independent now, and I know life. That makes you harmless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen stretched out his hand and seized hers just where her little warm
      pulse was beating very steadily. She looked at it, changed her fork over,
      and went on eating with the other hand. Fiorsen drew his hand away as if
      he had been stung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you HAVE changed&mdash;that is certain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; you wouldn't expect anything else, would you? You see, one doesn't
      go through that for nothing. I think I was a dreadful little fool&mdash;&rdquo;
       She stopped, with her spoon on its way to her mouth&mdash;&ldquo;and yet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you still, little Daphne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slowly turned her head toward him, and a faint sigh escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once I would have given a lot to hear that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And turning her head away again, she picked a large walnut out of her cake
      and put it in her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming to see my studio? I've got it rather nice and new. I'm
      making twenty-five a week; my next engagement, I'm going to get thirty. I
      should like Mrs. Fiorsen to know&mdash;Oh, I forgot; you don't like me to
      speak of her! Why not? I wish you'd tell me!&rdquo; Gazing, as the attendant
      had, at his furious face, she went on: &ldquo;I don't know how it is, but I'm
      not a bit afraid of you now. I used to be. Oh, how is Count Rosek? Is he
      as pale as ever? Aren't you going to have anything more? You've had hardly
      anything. D'you know what I should like&mdash;a chocolate eclair and a
      raspberry ice-cream soda with a slice of tangerine in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had slowly sucked up that beverage, prodding the slice of
      tangerine with her straws, they went out and took a cab. On that journey
      to her studio, Fiorsen tried to possess himself of her hand, but, folding
      her arms across her chest, she said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very bad manners to take advantage of cabs.&rdquo; And, withdrawing
      sullenly into his corner, he watched her askance. Was she playing with
      him? Or had she really ceased to care the snap of a finger? It seemed
      incredible. The cab, which had been threading the maze of the Soho
      streets, stopped. Daphne Wing alighted, proceeded down a narrow passage to
      a green door on the right, and, opening it with a latch-key, paused to
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it's being in a little sordid street&mdash;it takes away all
      amateurishness. It wasn't a studio, of course; it was the back part of a
      paper-maker's. Any space conquered for art is something, isn't it?&rdquo; She
      led the way up a few green-carpeted stairs, into a large room with a
      skylight, whose walls were covered in Japanese silk the colour of yellow
      azaleas. Here she stood for a minute without speaking, as though lost in
      the beauty of her home: then, pointing to the walls, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It took me ages, I did it all myself. And look at my little Japanese
      trees; aren't they dickies?&rdquo; Six little dark abortions of trees were
      arranged scrupulously on a lofty window-sill, whence the skylight sloped.
      She added suddenly: &ldquo;I think Count Rosek would like this room. There's
      something bizarre about it, isn't there? I wanted to surround myself with
      that, you know&mdash;to get the bizarre note into my work. It's so
      important nowadays. But through there I've got a bedroom and a bathroom
      and a little kitchen with everything to hand, all quite domestic; and hot
      water always on. My people are SO funny about this room. They come
      sometimes, and stand about. But they can't get used to the neighbourhood;
      of course it IS sordid, but I think an artist ought to be superior to
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly touched, Fiorsen answered gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, little Daphne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, and another tiny sigh escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you treat me like you did?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's such a pity, because
      now I can't feel anything at all.&rdquo; And turning, she suddenly passed the
      back of her hand across her eyes. Really moved by that, Fiorsen went
      towards her, but she had turned round again, and putting out her hand to
      keep him off, stood shaking her head, with half a tear glistening on her
      eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please sit down on the divan,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will you smoke? These are
      Russians.&rdquo; And she took a white box of pink-coloured cigarettes from a
      little golden birchwood table. &ldquo;I have everything Russian and Japanese so
      far as I can; I think they help more than anything with atmosphere. I've
      got a balalaika; you can't play on it, can you? What a pity! If only I had
      a violin! I SHOULD have liked to hear you play again.&rdquo; She clasped her
      hands: &ldquo;Do you remember when I danced to you before the fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen remembered only too well. The pink cigarette trembled in his
      fingers, and he said rather hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dance to me now, Daphne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't trust you a yard. Nobody would&mdash;would they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you ask me here? What are you playing at, you little&mdash;&rdquo;
       At sight of her round, unmoving eyes, he stopped. She said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you'd like to see that I'd mastered my fate&mdash;that's all.
      But, of course, if you don't, you needn't stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen sank back on the divan. A conviction that everything she said was
      literal had begun slowly to sink into him. And taking a long pull at that
      pink cigarette he puffed the smoke out with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking, little Daphne, that you are as great an egoist as I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be. It's the only thing, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't worry. You always were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had seated herself on an Indian stool covered with a bit of Turkish
      embroidery, and, joining her hands on her lap, answered gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I think I wasn't, while I loved you. But it didn't pay, did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has made a woman of you, Daphne. Your face is different. Your mouth is
      prettier for my kisses&mdash;or the want of them. All over, you are
      prettier.&rdquo; Pink came up in Daphne Wing's cheeks. And, encouraged by that
      flush, he went on warmly: &ldquo;If you loved me now, I should not tire of you.
      Oh, you can believe me! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't talk about love, will we? Did you have a big triumph in Moscow
      and St. Petersburg? It must be wonderful to have really great triumphs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen answered gloomily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Triumphs? I made a lot of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing purred:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I expect you're very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did she mean to be ironic?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and went towards her. She looked up in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry if you're miserable. I know what it feels like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can help me not to be. Little Daphne, you can help me to forget.&rdquo; He
      had stopped, and put his hands on her shoulders. Without moving Daphne
      Wing answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's Mrs. Fiorsen you want to forget, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if she were dead. Ah, let it all be as it was, Daphne! You have grown
      up; you are a woman, an artist, and you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing had turned her head toward the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the bell,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Suppose it's my people? It's just their
      time! Oh, isn't that awkward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen dropped his grasp of her and recoiled against the wall. There with
      his head touching one of the little Japanese trees, he stood biting his
      fingers. She was already moving toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother's got a key, and it's no good putting you anywhere, because she
      always has a good look round. But perhaps it isn't them. Besides, I'm not
      afraid now; it makes a wonderful difference being on one's own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared. Fiorsen could hear a woman's acid voice, a man's, rather
      hoarse and greasy, the sound of a smacking kiss. And, with a vicious
      shrug, he stood at bay. Trapped! The little devil! The little dovelike
      devil! He saw a lady in a silk dress, green shot with beetroot colour, a
      short, thick gentleman with a round, greyish beard, in a grey suit, having
      a small dahlia in his buttonhole, and, behind them, Daphne Wing, flushed,
      and very round-eyed. He took a step, intending to escape without more ado.
      The gentleman said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Introduce us, Daisy. I didn't quite catch&mdash;Mr. Dawson? How do you
      do, sir? One of my daughter's impresarios, I think. 'Appy to meet you, I'm
      sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen took a long breath, and bowed. Mr. Wagge's small piggy eyes had
      fixed themselves on the little trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's got a nice little place here for her work&mdash;quiet and
      unconventional. I hope you think well of her talent, sir? You might go
      further and fare worse, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Fiorsen bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be proud of her,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she is the rising star.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ow,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;ye'es! From a little thing, we thought she had stuff in
      her. I've come to take a great interest in her work. It's not in my line,
      but I think she's a sticker; I like to see perseverance. Where you've got
      that, you've got half the battle of success. So many of these young people
      seem to think life's all play. You must see a lot of that in your
      profession, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shiver ran down Fiorsen's spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name was not DAWson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There followed a long moment. On the one side was that vinegary woman
      poking her head forward like an angry hen, on the other, Daphne Wing, her
      eyes rounder and rounder, her cheeks redder and redder, her lips opening,
      her hands clasped to her perfect breast, and, in the centre, that broad,
      grey-bearded figure, with reddening face and angry eyes and hoarsening
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scoundrel! You infernal scoundrel!&rdquo; It lurched forward, raising a
      pudgy fist. Fiorsen sprang down the stairs and wrenched open the door. He
      walked away in a whirl of mortification. Should he go back and take that
      pug-faced vulgarian by the throat? As for that minx! But his feelings
      about HER were too complicated for expression. And then&mdash;so dark and
      random are the ways of the mind&mdash;his thoughts darted back to Gyp,
      sitting on the oaken chest, making her confession; and the whips and
      stings of it scored him worse than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      X
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening, standing at the corner of Bury Street, Summerhay
      watched Gyp going swiftly to her father's house. He could not bring
      himself to move while there was still a chance to catch a glimpse of her
      face, a sign from her hand. Gone! He walked away with his head down. The
      more blissful the hours just spent, the greater the desolation when they
      are over. Of such is the nature of love, as he was now discerning. The
      longing to have her always with him was growing fast. Since her husband
      knew&mdash;why wait? There would be no rest for either of them in an
      existence of meetings and partings like this, with the menace of that
      fellow. She must come away with him at once&mdash;abroad&mdash;until
      things had declared themselves; and then he must find a place where they
      could live and she feel safe and happy. He must show he was in dead
      earnest, set his affairs in order. And he thought: 'No good doing things
      by halves. Mother must know. The sooner the better. Get it over&mdash;at
      once!' And, with a grimace of discomfort, he set out for his aunt's house
      in Cadogan Gardens, where his mother always stayed when she was in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay was in the boudoir, waiting for dinner and reading a book
      on dreams. A red-shaded lamp cast a mellow tinge over the grey frock, over
      one reddish cheek and one white shoulder. She was a striking person, tall
      and well built, her very blonde hair only just turning grey, for she had
      married young and been a widow fifteen years&mdash;one of those women
      whose naturally free spirits have been netted by association with people
      of public position. Bubbles were still rising from her submerged soul, but
      it was obvious that it would not again set eyes on the horizon. With views
      neither narrow nor illiberal, as views in society go, she judged
      everything now as people of public position must&mdash;discussion, of
      course, but no alteration in one's way of living. Speculation and ideas
      did not affect social usage. The countless movements in which she and her
      friends were interested for the emancipation and benefit of others were,
      in fact, only channels for letting off her superfluous goodwill,
      conduit-pipes, for the directing spirit bred in her. She thought and acted
      in terms of the public good, regulated by what people of position said at
      luncheon and dinner. And it was surely not her fault that such people must
      lunch and dine. When her son had bent and kissed her, she held up the book
      to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Bryan, I think this man's book disgraceful; he simply runs his
      sex-idea to death. Really, we aren't all quite so obsessed as that. I do
      think he ought to be put in his own lunatic asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay, looking down at her gloomily, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got bad news for you, Mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay closed the book and searched his face with apprehension.
      She knew that expression. She knew that poise of his head, as if butting
      at something. He looked like that when he came to her in gambling scrapes.
      Was this another? Bryan had always been a pickle. His next words took her
      breath away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people at Mildenham, Major Winton and his daughter&mdash;you know.
      Well, I'm in love with her&mdash;I'm&mdash;I'm her lover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay uttered a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;Bryan&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow she married drinks. He's impossible. She had to leave him a
      year ago, with her baby&mdash;other reasons, too. Look here, Mother: This
      is hateful, but you'd got to know. I can't talk of her. There's no chance
      of a divorce.&rdquo; His voice grew higher. &ldquo;Don't try to persuade me out of it.
      It's no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay, from whose comely face a frock, as it were, had slipped,
      clasped her hands together on the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a swift descent of &ldquo;life&rdquo; on one to whom it had for so long been a
      series of &ldquo;cases&rdquo; was cruel, and her son felt this without quite realizing
      why. In the grip of his new emotions, he still retained enough balance to
      appreciate what an abominably desolate piece of news this must be to her,
      what a disturbance and disappointment. And, taking her hand, he put it to
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, Mother! It's all right. She's happy, and so am I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay could only press her hand against his kiss, and murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that's not everything, Bryan. Is there&mdash;is there going to be a
      scandal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I hope not; but, anyway, HE knows about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Society doesn't forgive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awfully sorry for YOU, Mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bryan!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This repetition of her plaint jarred his nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't run ahead of things. You needn't tell Edith or Flo. You needn't
      tell anybody. We don't know what'll happen yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in Lady Summerhay all was too sore and blank. This woman she had never
      seen, whose origin was doubtful, whose marriage must have soiled her, who
      was some kind of a siren, no doubt. It really was too hard! She believed
      in her son, had dreamed of public position for him, or, rather, felt he
      would attain it as a matter of course. And she said feebly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Major Winton is a man of breeding, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo; And, stopping before her, as if he read her thoughts, he added:
      &ldquo;You think she's not good enough for me? She's good enough for anyone on
      earth. And she's the proudest woman I've ever met. If you're bothering as
      to what to do about her&mdash;don't! She won't want anything of anybody&mdash;I
      can tell you that. She won't accept any crumbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's lucky!&rdquo; hovered on Lady Summerhay's lips; but, gazing at her son,
      she became aware that she stood on the brink of a downfall in his heart.
      Then the bitterness of her disappointment rising up again, she said
      coldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to live together openly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; if she will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall&mdash;soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay got up, and the book on dreams slipped off her lap with a
      thump. She went to the fireplace, and stood there looking at her son. He
      had altered. His merry look was gone; his face was strange to her. She
      remembered it like that, once in the park at Widrington, when he lost his
      temper with a pony and came galloping past her, sitting back, his curly
      hair stivered up like a little demon's. And she said sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can hardly expect me to like it for you, Bryan, even if she is what
      you say. And isn't there some story about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear mother, the more there is against her, the more I shall love her&mdash;that's
      obvious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this man going to do? I heard him play once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Nothing, I dare say. Morally and legally, he's out of
      court. I only wish to God he WOULD bring a case, and I could marry her;
      but Gyp says he won't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp? Is that her name?&rdquo; And a sudden wish, almost a longing, not a
      friendly one, to see this woman seized her. &ldquo;Will you bring her to see me?
      I'm alone here till Wednesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll ask her, but I don't think she'll come.&rdquo; He turned his head away.
      &ldquo;Mother, she's wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An unhappy smile twisted Lady Summerhay's lips. No doubt! Aphrodite
      herself had visited her boy. Aphrodite! And&mdash;afterward? She asked
      desolately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Major Winton know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he say to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say? What can anyone say? From your point of view, or his, it's rotten,
      of course. But in her position, anything's rotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that encouraging word, the flood-gates gave way in Lady Summerhay, and
      she poured forth a stream of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, can't you pull up? I've seen so many of these affairs go
      wrong. It really is not for nothing that law and conventions are what they
      are&mdash;believe me! Really, Bryan, experience does show that the
      pressure's too great. It's only once in a way&mdash;very exceptional
      people, very exceptional circumstances. You mayn't think now it'll hamper
      you, but you'll find it will&mdash;most fearfully. It's not as if you were
      a writer or an artist, who can take his work where he likes and live in a
      desert if he wants. You've got to do yours in London, your whole career is
      bound up with society. Do think, before you go butting up against it! It's
      all very well to say it's no affair of anyone's, but you'll find it is,
      Bryan. And then, can you&mdash;can you possibly make her happy in the
      long-run?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped at the expression on his face. It was as if he were saying: &ldquo;I
      have left your world. Talk to your fellows; all this is nothing to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Mother: you don't seem to understand. I'm devoted&mdash;devoted
      so that there's nothing else for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long will that last, Bryan? You mean bewitched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay said, with passion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't. I mean what I said. Good-night!&rdquo; And he went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you stay to dinner, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was gone, and the full of vexation, anxiety, and wretchedness came
      on Lady Summerhay. It was too hard! She went down to her lonely dinner,
      desolate and sore. And to the book on dreams, opened beside her plate, she
      turned eyes that took in nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay went straight home. The lamps were brightening in the
      early-autumn dusk, and a draughty, ruffling wind flicked a yellow leaf
      here and there from off the plane trees. It was just the moment when
      evening blue comes into the colouring of the town&mdash;that hour of
      fusion when day's hard and staring shapes are softening, growing dark,
      mysterious, and all that broods behind the lives of men and trees and
      houses comes down on the wings of illusion to repossess the world&mdash;the
      hour when any poetry in a man wells up. But Summerhay still heard his
      mother's, &ldquo;Oh, Bryan!&rdquo; and, for the first time, knew the feeling that his
      hand was against everyone's. There was a difference already, or so it
      seemed to him, in the expression of each passer-by. Nothing any more would
      be a matter of course; and he was of a class to whom everything has always
      been a matter of course. Perhaps he did not realize this clearly yet; but
      he had begun to take what the nurses call &ldquo;notice,&rdquo; as do those only who
      are forced on to the defensive against society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting his latch-key into the lock, he recalled the sensation with which,
      that afternoon, he had opened to Gyp for the first time&mdash;half
      furtive, half defiant. It would be all defiance now. This was the end of
      the old order! And, lighting a fire in his sitting-room, he began pulling
      out drawers, sorting and destroying. He worked for hours, burning, making
      lists, packing papers and photographs. Finishing at last, he drank a stiff
      whisky and soda, and sat down to smoke. Now that the room was quiet, Gyp
      seemed to fill it again with her presence. Closing his eyes, he could see
      her there by the hearth, just as she stood before they left, turning her
      face up to him, murmuring: &ldquo;You won't stop loving me, now you're so sure I
      love you?&rdquo; Stop loving her! The more she loved him, the more he would love
      her. And he said aloud: &ldquo;By God! I won't!&rdquo; At that remark, so vehement for
      the time of night, the old Scotch terrier, Ossian, came from his corner
      and shoved his long black nose into his master's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along up, Ossy! Good dog, Oss!&rdquo; And, comforted by the warmth of that
      black body beside him in the chair, Summerhay fell asleep in front of the
      fire smouldering with blackened fragments of his past.
    </p>
    <p>
      XI
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Gyp had never seemed to look round she had been quite conscious of
      Summerhay still standing where they had parted, watching her into the
      house in Bury Street. The strength of her own feeling surprised her, as a
      bather in the sea is surprised, finding her feet will not touch bottom,
      that she is carried away helpless&mdash;only, these were the waters of
      ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second night running, she hardly slept, hearing the clocks of St.
      James's strike, and Big Ben boom, hour after hour. At breakfast, she told
      her father of Fiorsen's reappearance. He received the news with a frown
      and a shrewd glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His feelings, at that moment, were perhaps as mixed as they had ever been&mdash;curiosity,
      parental disapproval, to which he knew he was not entitled, admiration of
      her pluck in letting that fellow know, fears for the consequences of this
      confession, and, more than all, his profound disturbance at knowing her at
      last launched into the deep waters of love. It was the least of these
      feelings that found expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rushed away. The only thing I feel sure of is that he won't divorce me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, by George; I don't suppose even he would have that impudence!&rdquo; And
      Winton was silent, trying to penetrate the future. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said
      suddenly, &ldquo;it's on the knees of the gods then. But be careful, Gyp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About noon, Betty returned from the sea, with a solemn, dark-eyed, cooing
      little Gyp, brown as a roasted coffee-berry. When she had been given all
      that she could wisely eat after the journey, Gyp carried her off to her
      own room, undressed her for sheer delight of kissing her from head to
      foot, and admiring her plump brown legs, then cuddled her up in a shawl
      and lay down with her on the bed. A few sleepy coos and strokings, and
      little Gyp had left for the land of Nod, while her mother lay gazing at
      her black lashes with a kind of passion. She was not a child-lover by
      nature; but this child of her own, with her dark softness, plump delicacy,
      giving disposition, her cooing voice, and constant adjurations to &ldquo;dear
      mum,&rdquo; was adorable. There was something about her insidiously seductive.
      She had developed so quickly, with the graceful roundness of a little
      animal, the perfection of a flower. The Italian blood of her
      great-great-grandmother was evidently prepotent in her as yet; and, though
      she was not yet two years old, her hair, which had lost its baby darkness,
      was already curving round her neck and waving on her forehead. One of her
      tiny brown hands had escaped the shawl and grasped its edge with
      determined softness. And while Gyp gazed at the pinkish nails and their
      absurdly wee half-moons, at the sleeping tranquillity stirred by breathing
      no more than a rose-leaf on a windless day, her lips grew fuller,
      trembled, reached toward the dark lashes, till she had to rein her neck
      back with a jerk to stop such self-indulgence. Soothed, hypnotized, almost
      in a dream, she lay there beside her baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, at dinner, Winton said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've been to see Fiorsen, and warned him off. Found him at that
      fellow Rosek's.&rdquo; Gyp received the news with a vague sensation of alarm.
      &ldquo;And I met that girl, the dancer, coming out of the house as I was going
      in&mdash;made it plain I'd seen her, so I don't think he'll trouble you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An irresistible impulse made her ask:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was she looking, Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton smiled grimly. How to convey his impression of the figure he had
      seen coming down the steps&mdash;of those eyes growing rounder and rounder
      at sight of him, of that mouth opening in an: &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much the same. Rather flabbergasted at seeing me, I think. A white hat&mdash;very
      smart. Attractive in her way, but common, of course. Those two were
      playing the piano and fiddle when I went up. They tried not to let me in,
      but I wasn't to be put off. Queer place, that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp smiled. She could see it all so well. The black walls, the silver
      statuettes, Rops drawings, scent of dead rose-leaves and pastilles and
      cigarettes&mdash;and those two by the piano&mdash;and her father so cool
      and dry!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can't stand on ceremony with fellows like that. I hadn't forgotten
      that Polish chap's behaviour to you, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through Gyp passed a quiver of dread, a vague return of the feelings once
      inspired by Rosek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm almost sorry you went, Dad. Did you say anything very&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? Let's see! No; I think I was quite polite.&rdquo; He added, with a grim,
      little smile: &ldquo;I won't swear I didn't call one of them a ruffian. I know
      they said something about my presuming on being a cripple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it was that Polish chap&mdash;and so he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd almost rather it had been&mdash;the other.&rdquo; Rosek's pale, suave face,
      with the eyes behind which there were such hidden things, and the lips
      sweetish and restrained and sensual&mdash;he would never forgive! But
      Winton only smiled again, patting her arm. He was pleased with an
      encounter which had relieved his feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp spent all that evening writing her first real love-letter. But when,
      next afternoon at six, in fulfilment of its wording, she came to
      Summerhay's little house, her heart sank; for the blinds were down and it
      had a deserted look. If he had been there, he would have been at the
      window, waiting. Had he, then, not got her letter, not been home since
      yesterday? And that chill fear which besets lovers' hearts at failure of a
      tryst smote her for the first time. In the three-cornered garden stood a
      decayed statue of a naked boy with a broken bow&mdash;a sparrow was
      perching on his greenish shoulder; sooty, heart-shaped lilac leaves hung
      round his head, and at his legs the old Scotch terrier was sniffing. Gyp
      called: &ldquo;Ossian! Ossy!&rdquo; and the old dog came, wagging his tail feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master! Where is your master, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ossian poked his long nose into her calf, and that gave her a little
      comfort. She passed, perforce, away from the deserted house and returned
      home; but all manner of frightened thoughts beset her. Where had he gone?
      Why had he gone? Why had he not let her know? Doubts&mdash;those hasty
      attendants on passion&mdash;came thronging, and scepticism ran riot. What
      did she know of his life, of his interests, of him, except that he said he
      loved her? Where had he gone? To Widrington, to some smart house-party, or
      even back to Scotland? The jealous feelings that had so besieged her at
      the bungalow when his letters ceased came again now with redoubled force.
      There must be some woman who, before their love began, had claim on him,
      or some girl that he admired. He never told her of any such&mdash;of
      course, he would not! She was amazed and hurt by her capacity for
      jealousy. She had always thought she would be too proud to feel jealousy&mdash;a
      sensation so dark and wretched and undignified, but&mdash;alas!&mdash;so
      horribly real and clinging.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had said she was not dining at home; so Winton had gone to his club,
      and she was obliged to partake of a little trumped-up lonely meal. She
      went up to her room after it, but there came on her such restlessness that
      presently she put on her things and slipped out. She went past St. James's
      Church into Piccadilly, to the further, crowded side, and began to walk
      toward the park. This was foolish; but to do a foolish thing was some
      relief, and she went along with a faint smile, mocking her own
      recklessness. Several women of the town&mdash;ships of night with sails
      set&mdash;came rounding out of side streets or down the main stream, with
      their skilled, rapid-seeming slowness. And at the discomfited,
      half-hostile stares on their rouged and powdered faces, Gyp felt a wicked
      glee. She was disturbing, hurting them&mdash;and she wanted to hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, a man, in evening dress, with overcoat thrown open, gazed
      pointblank into her face, and, raising his hat, ranged up beside her. She
      walked straight on, still with that half-smile, knowing him puzzled and
      fearfully attracted. Then an insensate wish to stab him to the heart made
      her turn her head and look at him. At the expression on her face, he
      wilted away from her, and again she felt that wicked glee at having hurt
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed out into the traffic, to the park side, and turned back toward
      St. James's; and now she was possessed by profound, black sadness. If only
      her lover were beside her that beautiful evening, among the lights and
      shadows of the trees, in the warm air! Why was he not among these
      passers-by? She who could bring any casual man to her side by a smile
      could not conjure up the only one she wanted from this great desert of a
      town! She hurried along, to get in and hide her longing. But at the corner
      of St. James's Street, she stopped. That was his club, nearly opposite.
      Perhaps he was there, playing cards or billiards, a few yards away, and
      yet as in another world. Presently he would come out, go to some
      music-hall, or stroll home thinking of her&mdash;perhaps not even thinking
      of her! Another woman passed, giving her a furtive glance. But Gyp felt no
      glee now. And, crossing over, close under the windows of the club, she
      hurried home. When she reached her room, she broke into a storm of tears.
      How could she have liked hurting those poor women, hurting that man&mdash;who
      was only paying her a man's compliment, after all? And with these tears,
      her jealous, wild feelings passed, leaving only her longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning brought a letter. Summerhay wrote from an inn on the river,
      asking her to come down by the eleven o'clock train, and he would meet her
      at the station. He wanted to show her a house that he had seen; and they
      could have the afternoon on the river! Gyp received this letter, which
      began: &ldquo;My darling!&rdquo; with an ecstasy that she could not quite conceal. And
      Winton, who had watched her face, said presently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall go to Newmarket, Gyp. Home to-morrow evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the train on the way down, she sat with closed eyes, in a sort of
      trance. If her lover had been there holding her in his arms, he could not
      have seemed nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw him as the train ran in; but they met without a hand-clasp,
      without a word, simply looking at each other and breaking into smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little victoria &ldquo;dug up&rdquo;&mdash;as Summerhay said&mdash;&ldquo;horse, driver
      and all,&rdquo; carried them slowly upward. Under cover of the light rugs their
      hands were clasped, and they never ceased to look into each other's faces,
      except for those formal glances of propriety which deceive no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was beautiful, as only early September days can be&mdash;when the
      sun is hot, yet not too hot, and its light falls in a silken radiance on
      trees just losing the opulent monotony of summer, on silvery-gold reaped
      fields, silvery-green uplands, golden mustard; when shots ring out in the
      distance, and, as one gazes, a leaf falls, without reason, as it would
      seem. Presently they branched off the main road by a lane past a clump of
      beeches and drew up at the gate of a lonely house, built of very old red
      brick, and covered by Virginia creeper just turning&mdash;a house with an
      ingle-nook and low, broad chimneys. Before it was a walled, neglected
      lawn, with poplars and one large walnut-tree. The sunlight seemed to have
      collected in that garden, and there was a tremendous hum of bees. Above
      the trees, the downs could be seen where racehorses, they said, were
      trained. Summerhay had the keys of the house, and they went in. To Gyp, it
      was like a child's &ldquo;pretending&rdquo;&mdash;to imagine they were going to live
      there together, to sort out the rooms and consecrate each. She would not
      spoil this perfect day by argument or admission of the need for a
      decision. And when he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, darling, what do you think of it?&rdquo; she only answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, lovely, in a way; but let's go back to the river and make the most of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They took boat at 'The Bowl of Cream,' the river inn where Summerhay was
      staying. To him, who had been a rowing man at Oxford, the river was known
      from Lechlade to Richmond; but Gyp had never in her life been on it, and
      its placid magic, unlike that of any other river in the world, almost
      overwhelmed her. On this glistening, windless day, to drift along past the
      bright, flat water-lily leaves over the greenish depths, to listen to the
      pigeons, watch the dragon-flies flitting past, and the fish leaping
      lazily, not even steering, letting her hand dabble in the water, then
      cooling her sun-warmed cheek with it, and all the time gazing at
      Summerhay, who, dipping his sculls gently, gazed at her&mdash;all this was
      like a voyage down some river of dreams, the very fulfilment of felicity.
      There is a degree of happiness known to the human heart which seems to
      belong to some enchanted world&mdash;a bright maze into which, for a
      moment now and then, we escape and wander. To-day, he was more than ever
      like her Botticelli &ldquo;Young Man,&rdquo; with his neck bare, and his face so
      clear-eyed and broad and brown. Had she really had a life with another
      man? And only a year ago? It seemed inconceivable!
    </p>
    <p>
      But when, in the last backwater, he tied the boat up and came to sit with
      her once more, it was already getting late, and the vague melancholy of
      the now shadowy river was stealing into her. And, with a sort of sinking
      in her heart, she heard him begin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp, we MUST go away together. We can never stand it going on apart,
      snatching hours here and there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pressing his hand to her cheeks, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, darling? Hasn't this been perfect? What could we ever have more
      perfect? It's been paradise itself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but to be thrown out every day! To be whole days and nights without
      you! Gyp, you must&mdash;you must! What is there against it? Don't you
      love me enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, and then away into the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too much, I think. It's tempting Providence to change. Let's go on as we
      are, Bryan. No; don't look like that&mdash;don't be angry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you afraid? Are you sorry for our love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but let it be like this. Don't let's risk anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risk? Is it people&mdash;society&mdash;you're afraid of? I thought YOU
      wouldn't care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Society? No; I'm not afraid of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then? Of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Men soon get tired. I'm a doubter, Bryan, I can't help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if anyone could get tired of you! Are you afraid of yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Gyp smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not of loving too little, I told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can one love too much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew his head down to her. But when that kiss was over, she only said
      again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Bryan; let's go on as we are. I'll make up to you when I'm with you.
      If you were to tire of me, I couldn't bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a long time more he pleaded&mdash;now with anger, now with kisses, now
      with reasonings; but, to all, she opposed that same tender, half-mournful
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and, at last, he gave it up, and, in dogged silence, rowed her to
      the village, whence she was to take train back. It was dusk when they left
      the boat, and dew was falling. Just before they reached the station, she
      caught his hand and pressed it to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, don't be angry with me! Perhaps I will&mdash;some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, in the train, she tried to think herself once more in the boat, among
      the shadows and the whispering reeds and all the quiet wonder of the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      XII
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching home she let herself in stealthily, and, though she had not
      had dinner, went up at once to her room. She was just taking off her
      blouse when Betty entered, her round face splotched with red, and tears
      rolling down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty! What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, where HAVE you been? Such a dreadful piece of news! They've
      stolen her! That wicked man&mdash;your husband&mdash;he took her right out
      of her pram&mdash;and went off with her in a great car&mdash;he and that
      other one! I've been half out of my mind!&rdquo; Gyp stared aghast. &ldquo;I hollered
      to a policeman. 'He's stolen her&mdash;her father! Catch them!' I said.
      'However shall I face my mistress?'&rdquo; She stopped for breath, then burst
      out again. &ldquo;'He's a bad one,' I said. 'A foreigner! They're both
      foreigners!' 'Her father?' he said. 'Well, why shouldn't he? He's only
      givin' her a joy ride. He'll bring her back, never you fear.' And I ran
      home&mdash;I didn't know where you were. Oh dear! The major away and all&mdash;what
      was I to do? I'd just turned round to shut the gate of the square gardens,
      and I never saw him till he'd put his great long arm over the pram and
      snatched her out.&rdquo; And, sitting on the bed, she gave way utterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp stood still. Nemesis for her happiness? That vengeful wretch, Rosek!
      This was his doing. And she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Betty, she must be crying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fresh outburst of moans was the only answer. Gyp remembered suddenly
      what the lawyer had said over a year ago&mdash;it had struck her with
      terror at the time. In law, Fiorsen owned and could claim her child. She
      could have got her back, then, by bringing a horrible case against him,
      but now, perhaps, she had no chance. Was it her return to Fiorsen that
      they aimed at&mdash;or the giving up of her lover? She went over to her
      mirror, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll go at once, Betty, and get her back somehow. Wash your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she made ready, she fought down those two horrible fears&mdash;of
      losing her child, of losing her lover; the less she feared, the better she
      could act, the more subtly, the swifter. She remembered that she had
      somewhere a little stiletto, given her a long time ago. She hunted it out,
      slipped off its red-leather sheath, and, stabbing the point into a tiny
      cork, slipped it beneath her blouse. If they could steal her baby, they
      were capable of anything. She wrote a note to her father, telling him what
      had happened, and saying where she had gone. Then, in a taxi, they set
      forth. Cold water and the calmness of her mistress had removed from Betty
      the main traces of emotion; but she clasped Gyp's hand hard and gave vent
      to heavy sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp would not think. If she thought of her little one crying, she knew she
      would cry, too. But her hatred for those who had dealt this cowardly blow
      grew within her. She took a resolution and said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Summerhay, Betty. That's why they've stolen our darling. I suppose
      you know he and I care for each other. They've stolen her so as to make me
      do anything they like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A profound sigh answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind that moon-face with the troubled eyes, what conflict was in
      progress&mdash;between unquestioning morality and unquestioning belief in
      Gyp, between fears for her and wishes for her happiness, between the loyal
      retainer's habit of accepting and the old nurse's feeling of being in
      charge? She said faintly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! He's a nice gentleman, too!&rdquo; And suddenly, wheezing it out with
      unexpected force: &ldquo;To say truth, I never did hold you was rightly married
      to that foreigner in that horrible registry place&mdash;no music, no
      flowers, no blessin' asked, nor nothing. I cried me eyes out at the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Betty, I never was. I only thought I was in love.&rdquo; A convulsive
      squeeze and creaking, whiffling sounds heralded a fresh outburst. &ldquo;Don't
      cry; we're just there. Think of our darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cab stopped. Feeling for her little weapon, she got out, and with her
      hand slipped firmly under Betty's arm, led the way upstairs. Chilly
      shudders ran down her spine&mdash;memories of Daphne Wing and Rosek, of
      that large woman&mdash;what was her name?&mdash;of many other faces, of
      unholy hours spent up there, in a queer state, never quite present, never
      comfortable in soul; memories of late returnings down these wide stairs
      out to their cab, of Fiorsen beside her in the darkness, his dim,
      broad-cheekboned face moody in the corner or pressed close to hers. Once
      they had walked a long way homeward in the dawn, Rosek with them, Fiorsen
      playing on his muted violin, to the scandal of the policemen and the cats.
      Dim, unreal memories! Grasping Betty's arm more firmly, she rang the bell.
      When the man servant, whom she remembered well, opened the door, her lips
      were so dry that they could hardly form the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Fiorsen in, Ford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am; Mr. Fiorsen and Count Rosek went into the country this
      afternoon. I haven't their address at present.&rdquo; She must have turned
      white, for she could hear the man saying: &ldquo;Anything I can get you, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did they start, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One o'clock, ma'am&mdash;by car. Count Rosek was driving himself. I
      should say they won't be away long&mdash;they just had their bags with
      them.&rdquo; Gyp put out her hand helplessly; she heard the servant say in a
      concerned voice: &ldquo;I could let you know the moment they return, ma'am, if
      you'd kindly leave me your address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giving her card, and murmuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Ford; thank you very much,&rdquo; she grasped Betty's arm again and
      leaned heavily on her going down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was real, black fear now. To lose helpless things&mdash;children&mdash;dogs&mdash;and
      know for certain that one cannot get to them, no matter what they may be
      suffering! To be pinned down to ignorance and have in her ears the crying
      of her child&mdash;this horror, Gyp suffered now. And nothing to be done!
      Nothing but to go to bed and wait&mdash;hardest of all tasks! Mercifully&mdash;thanks
      to her long day in the open&mdash;she fell at last into a dreamless sleep,
      and when she was called, there was a letter from Fiorsen on the tray with
      her tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a baby-stealer like your father. The law gives me the right to
      my own child. But swear to give up your lover, and the baby shall come
      back to you at once. If you do not give him up, I will take her away out
      of England. Send me an answer to this post-office, and do not let your
      father try any tricks upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GUSTAV FIORSEN.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beneath was written the address of a West End post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gyp had finished reading, she went through some moments of such
      mental anguish as she had never known, but&mdash;just as when Betty first
      told her of the stealing&mdash;her wits and wariness came quickly back.
      Had he been drinking when he wrote that letter? She could almost fancy
      that she smelled brandy, but it was so easy to fancy what one wanted to.
      She read it through again&mdash;this time, she felt almost sure that it
      had been dictated to him. If he had composed the wording himself, he would
      never have resisted a gibe at the law, or a gibe at himself for thus
      safeguarding her virtue. It was Rosek's doing. Her anger flamed up anew.
      Since they used such mean, cruel ways, why need she herself be scrupulous?
      She sprang out of bed and wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How COULD you do such a brutal thing? At all events, let the darling have
      her nurse. It's not like you to let a little child suffer. Betty will be
      ready to come the minute you send for her. As for myself, you must give me
      time to decide. I will let you know within two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GYP.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had sent this off, and a telegram to her father at Newmarket, she
      read Fiorsen's letter once more, and was more than ever certain that it
      was Rosek's wording. And, suddenly, she thought of Daphne Wing, whom her
      father had seen coming out of Rosek's house. Through her there might be a
      way of getting news. She seemed to see again the girl lying so white and
      void of hope when robbed by death of her own just-born babe. Yes; surely
      it was worth trying.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, her cab stopped before the Wagges' door in Frankland
      Street. But just as she was about to ring the bell, a voice from behind
      her said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me; I have a key. What may I&mdash;Oh, it's you!&rdquo; She turned. Mr.
      Wagge, in professional habiliments, was standing there. &ldquo;Come in; come
      in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was wondering whether perhaps we shouldn't be seeing you
      after what's transpired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hanging his tall black hat, craped nearly to the crown, on a knob of the
      mahogany stand, he said huskily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I DID think we'd seen the last of that,&rdquo; and opened the dining-room door.
      &ldquo;Come in, ma'am. We can put our heads together better in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that too well remembered room, the table was laid with a stained white
      cloth, a cruet-stand, and bottle of Worcestershire sauce. The little blue
      bowl was gone, so that nothing now marred the harmony of red and green.
      Gyp said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't Daph&mdash;Daisy live at home, then, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression on Mr. Wagge's face was singular; suspicion, relief, and a
      sort of craftiness were blended with that furtive admiration which Gyp
      seemed always to excite in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I understand that you&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to ask if Daisy would do something for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge blew his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't know&mdash;&rdquo; he began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I dare say she sees my husband, if that's what you mean; and I don't
      mind&mdash;he's nothing to me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge's face became further complicated by the sensations of a
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it's not to be wondered at, perhaps, in the
      circumstances. I'm sure I always thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp interrupted swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, Mr. Wagge&mdash;please! Will you give me Daisy's address?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge remained a moment in deep thought; then he said, in a gruff,
      jerky voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-three Comrade Street, So'o. Up to seeing him there on Tuesday, I
      must say I cherished every hope. Now I'm sorry I didn't strike him&mdash;he
      was too quick for me&mdash;&rdquo; He had raised one of his gloved hands and was
      sawing it up and down. The sight of that black object cleaving the air
      nearly made Gyp scream, her nerves were so on edge. &ldquo;It's her blasted
      independence&mdash;I beg pardon&mdash;but who wouldn't?&rdquo; he ended
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wouldn't?&rdquo; she heard his voice behind her. &ldquo;I did think she'd have
      run straight this time&mdash;&rdquo; And while she was fumbling at the outer
      door, his red, pudgy face, with its round grey beard, protruded almost
      over her shoulder. &ldquo;If you're going to see her, I hope you'll&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp was gone. In her cab she shivered. Once she had lunched with her
      father at a restaurant in the Strand. It had been full of Mr. Wagges. But,
      suddenly, she thought: 'It's hard on him, poor man!'
    </p>
    <p>
      XIII
    </p>
    <p>
      Seventy-three Comrade Street, Soho, was difficult to find; but, with the
      aid of a milk-boy, Gyp discovered the alley at last, and the right door.
      There her pride took sudden alarm, and but for the milk-boy's eyes fixed
      on her while he let out his professional howl, she might have fled. A
      plump white hand and wrist emerging took the can, and Daphne Wing's voice
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, where's the cream?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't got none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I told you always&mdash;two pennyworth at twelve o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two penn'orth.&rdquo; The boy's eyes goggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you want to speak to her, miss?&rdquo; He beat the closing door. &ldquo;Lidy
      wants to speak to you! Good-mornin', miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The figure of Daphne Wing in a blue kimono was revealed. Her eyes peered
      round at Gyp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Oh, do! I've been practising. Oh, I am glad to see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the studio, a little table was laid for two. Daphne Wing
      went up to it, holding in one hand the milk-can and in the other a short
      knife, with which she had evidently been opening oysters. Placing the
      knife on the table, she turned round to Gyp. Her face was deep pink, and
      so was her neck, which ran V-shaped down into the folds of her kimono. Her
      eyes, round as saucers, met Gyp's, fell, met them again. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I am glad! I really am. I wanted you so much to see my
      room&mdash;do you like it? How DID you know where I was?&rdquo; She looked down
      and added: &ldquo;I think I'd better tell you. Mr. Fiorsen came here, and, since
      then, I've seen him at Count Rosek's&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but don't trouble to tell me, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I'm quite mistress of myself now.&rdquo; Then, all at once, the
      uneasy woman-of-the-world mask dropped from her face and she seized Gyp's
      hand. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, I shall never be like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a little shiver, Gyp said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not.&rdquo; Her pride rushed up in her. How could she ask this girl
      anything? She choked back that feeling, and said stonily: &ldquo;Do you remember
      my baby? No, of course; you never saw her. HE and Count Rosek have just
      taken her away from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing convulsively squeezed the hand of which she had possessed
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a wicked thing! When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I AM glad I haven't seen him since! Oh, I DO think that was wicked!
      Aren't you dreadfully distressed?&rdquo; The least of smiles played on Gyp's
      mouth. Daphne Wing burst forth: &ldquo;D'you know&mdash;I think&mdash;I think
      your self-control is something awful. It frightens me. If my baby had
      lived and been stolen like that, I should have been half dead by now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp answered stonily as ever:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I want her back, and I wondered&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing clasped her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I expect I can make him&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, confused, then added
      hastily: &ldquo;Are you sure you don't mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't mind if he had fifty loves. Perhaps he has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing uttered a little gasp; then her teeth came down rather
      viciously on her lower lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean him to do what I want now, not what he wants me. That's the only
      way when you love. Oh, don't smile like that, please; you do make me feel
      so&mdash;uncertain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going to see him next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daphne Wing grew very pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. He might be coming in to lunch. You see, it's not as if he
      were a stranger, is it?&rdquo; Casting up her eyes a little, she added: &ldquo;He
      won't even let me speak your name; it makes him mad. That's why I'm sure
      he still loves you; only, his love is so funny.&rdquo; And, seizing Gyp's hand:
      &ldquo;I shall never forget how good you were to me. I do hope you&mdash;you
      love somebody else.&rdquo; Gyp pressed those damp, clinging fingers, and Daphne
      Wing hurried on: &ldquo;I'm sure your baby's a darling. How you must be
      suffering! You look quite pale. But it isn't any good suffering. I learned
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes lighted on the table, and a faint ruefulness came into them, as
      if she were going to ask Gyp to eat the oysters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp bent forward and put her lips to the girl's forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye. My baby would thank you if she knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she turned to go. She heard a sob. Daphne Wing was crying; then,
      before Gyp could speak, she struck herself on the throat, and said, in a
      strangled voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha&mdash;that's idiotic! I&mdash;I haven't cried since&mdash;since, you
      know. I&mdash;I'm perfect mistress of myself; only, I&mdash;only&mdash;I
      suppose you reminded me&mdash;I NEVER cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those words and the sound of a hiccough accompanied Gyp down the alley to
      her cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she got back to Bury Street, she found Betty sitting in the hall with
      her bonnet on. She had not been sent for, nor had any reply come from
      Newmarket. Gyp could not eat, could settle to nothing. She went up to her
      bedroom to get away from the servants' eyes, and went on mechanically with
      a frock of little Gyp's she had begun on the fatal morning Fiorsen had
      come back. Every other minute she stopped to listen to sounds that never
      meant anything, went a hundred times to the window to look at nothing.
      Betty, too, had come upstairs, and was in the nursery opposite; Gyp could
      hear her moving about restlessly among her household gods. Presently,
      those sounds ceased, and, peering into the room, she saw the stout woman
      still in her bonnet, sitting on a trunk, with her back turned, uttering
      heavy sighs. Gyp stole back into her own room with a sick, trembling
      sensation. If&mdash;if her baby really could not be recovered except by
      that sacrifice! If that cruel letter were the last word, and she forced to
      decide between them! Which would she give up? Which follow&mdash;her lover
      or her child?
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the window for air&mdash;the pain about her heart was
      dreadful. And, leaning there against the shutter, she felt quite dizzy
      from the violence of a struggle that refused coherent thought or feeling,
      and was just a dumb pull of instincts, both so terribly strong&mdash;how
      terribly strong she had not till then perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fell on the picture that reminded her of Bryan; it seemed now to
      have no resemblance&mdash;none. He was much too real, and loved, and
      wanted. Less than twenty-four hours ago, she had turned a deaf ear to his
      pleading that she should go to him for ever. How funny! Would she not rush
      to him now&mdash;go when and where he liked? Ah, if only she were back in
      his arms! Never could she give him up&mdash;never! But then in her ears
      sounded the cooing words, &ldquo;Dear mum!&rdquo; Her baby&mdash;that tiny thing&mdash;how
      could she give her up, and never again hold close and kiss that round,
      perfect little body, that grave little dark-eyed face?
    </p>
    <p>
      The roar of London came in through the open window. So much life, so many
      people&mdash;and not a soul could help! She left the window and went to
      the cottage-piano she had there, out of Winton's way. But she only sat
      with arms folded, looking at the keys. The song that girl had sung at
      Fiorsen's concert&mdash;song of the broken heart&mdash;came back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no; she couldn't&mdash;couldn't! It was to her lover she would cling.
      And tears ran down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cab had stopped below, but not till Betty came rushing in did she look
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIV
    </p>
    <p>
      When, trembling all over, she entered the dining-room, Fiorsen was
      standing by the sideboard, holding the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came straight up and put her into Gyp's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and do what you will. Be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hugging her baby, close to the door as she could get, Gyp answered
      nothing. Her heart was in such a tumult that she could not have spoken a
      word to save her life; relieved, as one dying of thirst by unexpected
      water; grateful, bewildered, abashed, yet instinctively aware of something
      evanescent and unreal in his altruism. Daphne Wing! What bargain did this
      represent?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen must have felt the chill of this instinctive vision, for he cried
      out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! You never believed in me; you never thought me capable of good! Why
      didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp bent her face over her baby to hide the quivering of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry&mdash;very, very sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen came closer and looked into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, I am afraid I shall never forget you&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears had come into his eyes, and Gyp watched them, moved, troubled, but
      still deeply mistrusting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brushed his hand across his face; and the thought flashed through her:
      'He means me to see them! Ah, what a cynical wretch I am!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiorsen saw that thought pass, and muttering suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Gyp! I am not all bad. I AM NOT!&rdquo; He tore the door open and was
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      That passionate &ldquo;I am not!&rdquo; saved Gyp from a breakdown. No; even at his
      highest pitch of abnegation, he could not forget himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relief, if overwhelming, is slowly realized; but when, at last, what she
      had escaped and what lay before her were staring full in each other's
      face, it seemed to her that she must cry out, and tell the whole world of
      her intoxicating happiness. And the moment little Gyp was in Betty's arms,
      she sat down and wrote to Summerhay:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DARLING,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a fearful time. My baby was stolen by him while I was with you.
      He wrote me a letter saying that he would give her back to me if I gave
      you up. But I found I couldn't give you up, not even for my baby. And
      then, a few minutes ago, he brought her&mdash;none the worse. Tomorrow we
      shall all go down to Mildenham; but very soon, if you still want me, I'll
      come with you wherever you like. My father and Betty will take care of my
      treasure till we come back; and then, perhaps, the old red house we saw&mdash;after
      all. Only&mdash;now is the time for you to draw back. Look into the future&mdash;look
      far! Don't let any foolish pity&mdash;or honour&mdash;weigh with you; be
      utterly sure, I do beseech you. I can just bear it now if I know it's for
      your good. But afterward it'll be too late. It would be the worst misery
      of all if I made you unhappy. Oh, make sure&mdash;make sure! I shall
      understand. I mean this with every bit of me. And now, good-night, and
      perhaps&mdash;good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;GYP.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read it over and shivered. Did she really mean that she could bear it
      if he drew back&mdash;if he did look far, far into the future, and decided
      that she was not worth the candle? Ah, but better now&mdash;than later.
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed and sealed the letter, and sat down to wait for her father. And
      she thought: 'Why does one have a heart? Why is there in one something so
      much too soft?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten days later, at Mildenham station, holding her father's hand, Gyp could
      scarcely see him for the mist before her eyes. How good he had been to her
      all those last days, since she told him that she was going to take the
      plunge! Not a word of remonstrance or complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, my love! Take care of yourself; wire from London, and again
      from Paris.&rdquo; And, smiling up at her, he added: &ldquo;He has luck; I had none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mist became tears, rolled down, fell on his glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too long out there, Gyp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her wet cheek passionately to his. The train moved, but, so
      long as she could see, she watched him standing on the platform, waving
      his grey hat, then, in her corner, sat down, blinded with tears behind her
      veil. She had not cried when she left him the day of her fatal marriage;
      she cried now that she was leaving him to go to her incredible happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange! But her heart had grown since then.

    <h2>
      Part IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Gyp, aged nearly four and a half that first of May, stood at the
      edge of the tulip border, bowing to two hen turkeys who were poking their
      heads elegantly here and there among the flowers. She was absurdly like
      her mother, the same oval-shaped face, dark arched brows, large and clear
      brown eyes; but she had the modern child's open-air look; her hair, that
      curled over at the ends, was not allowed to be long, and her polished
      brown legs were bare to the knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turkeys! You aren't good, are you? Come ON!&rdquo; And, stretching out her
      hands with the palms held up, she backed away from the tulip-bed. The
      turkeys, trailing delicately their long-toed feet and uttering soft,
      liquid interrogations, moved after her in hopes of what she was not
      holding in her little brown hands. The sun, down in the west, for it was
      past tea-time, slanted from over the roof of the red house, and painted up
      that small procession&mdash;the deep blue frock of little Gyp, the glint
      of gold in the chestnut of her hair; the daisy-starred grass; the dark
      birds with translucent red dewlaps, and checkered tails and the tulip
      background, puce and red and yellow. When she had lured them to the open
      gate, little Gyp raised herself, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you duffies, dears? Shoo!&rdquo; And on the tails of the turkeys she
      shut the gate. Then she went to where, under the walnut-tree&mdash;the one
      large tree of that walled garden&mdash;a very old Scotch terrier was
      lying, and sitting down beside him, began stroking his white muzzle,
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ossy, Ossy, do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently, seeing her mother in the porch, she jumped up, and crying out:
      &ldquo;Ossy&mdash;Ossy! Walk!&rdquo; rushed to Gyp and embraced her legs, while the
      old Scotch terrier slowly followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus held prisoner, Gyp watched the dog's approach. Nearly three years had
      changed her a little. Her face was softer, and rather more grave, her form
      a little fuller, her hair, if anything, darker, and done differently&mdash;instead
      of waving in wings and being coiled up behind, it was smoothly gathered
      round in a soft and lustrous helmet, by which fashion the shape of her
      head was better revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, go and ask Pettance to put a fresh piece of sulphur in Ossy's
      water-bowl, and to cut up his meat finer. You can give Hotspur and Brownie
      two lumps of sugar each; and then we'll go out.&rdquo; Going down on her knees
      in the porch, she parted the old dog's hair, and examined his eczema,
      thinking: &ldquo;I must rub some more of that stuff in to-night. Oh, ducky,
      you're not smelling your best! Yes; only&mdash;not my face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A telegraph-boy was coming from the gate. Gyp opened the missive with the
      faint tremor she always felt when Summerhay was not with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Detained; shall be down by last train; need not come up to-morrow.&mdash;BRYAN.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the boy was gone, she stooped down and stroked the old dog's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master home all day to-morrow, Ossy&mdash;master home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice from the path said, &ldquo;Beautiful evenin', ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;old scoundrel,&rdquo; Pettance, stiffer in the ankle-joints, with more
      lines in his gargoyle's face, fewer stumps in his gargoyle's mouth, more
      film over his dark, burning little eyes, was standing before her, and,
      behind him, little Gyp, one foot rather before the other, as Gyp had been
      wont to stand, waited gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pettance, Mr. Summerhay will be at home all to-morrow, and we'll go a
      long ride: and when you exercise, will you call at the inn, in case I
      don't go that way, and tell Major Winton I expect him to dinner to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am; and I've seen the pony for little Miss Gyp this morning,
      ma'am. It's a mouse pony, five year old, sound, good temper, pretty little
      paces. I says to the man: 'Don't you come it over me,' I says; 'I was born
      on an 'orse. Talk of twenty pounds, for that pony! Ten, and lucky to get
      it!' 'Well,' he says, 'Pettance, it's no good to talk round an' round with
      you. Fifteen!' he says. 'I'll throw you one in,' I says, 'Eleven! Take it
      or leave it.' 'Ah!' he says, 'Pettance, YOU know 'ow to buy an 'orse. All
      right,' he says; 'twelve!' She's worth all of fifteen, ma'am, and the
      major's passed her. So if you likes to have 'er, there she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp looked at her little daughter, who had given one excited hop, but now
      stood still, her eyes flying up at her mother and her lips parted; and she
      thought: &ldquo;The darling! She never begs for anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Pettance; buy her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;old scoundrel&rdquo; touched his forelock:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am&mdash;very good, ma'am. Beautiful evenin', ma'am.&rdquo; And,
      withdrawing at his gait of one whose feet are at permanent right angles to
      the legs, he mused: 'And that'll be two in my pocket.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later Gyp, little Gyp, and Ossian emerged from the garden gate
      for their evening walk. They went, not as usual, up to the downs, but
      toward the river, making for what they called &ldquo;the wild.&rdquo; This was an
      outlying plot of neglected ground belonging to their farm, two sedgy
      meadows, hedged by banks on which grew oaks and ashes. An old stone
      linhay, covered to its broken thatch by a huge ivy bush, stood at the
      angle where the meadows met. The spot had a strange life to itself in that
      smooth, kempt countryside of cornfields, grass, and beech-clumps; it was
      favoured by beasts and birds, and little Gyp had recently seen two baby
      hares there. From an oak-tree, where the crinkled leaves were not yet
      large enough to hide him, a cuckoo was calling and they stopped to look at
      the grey bird till he flew off. The singing and serenity, the green and
      golden oaks and ashes, the flowers&mdash;marsh-orchis, ladies' smocks, and
      cuckoo-buds, starring the rushy grass&mdash;all brought to Gyp that
      feeling of the uncapturable spirit which lies behind the forms of nature,
      the shadowy, hovering smile of life that is ever vanishing and ever
      springing again out of death. While they stood there close to the old
      linhay a bird came flying round them in wide circles, uttering shrill
      cries. It had a long beak and long, pointed wings, and seemed distressed
      by their presence. Little Gyp squeezed her mother's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor bird! Isn't it a poor bird, mum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, it's a curlew&mdash;I wonder what's the matter with it.
      Perhaps its mate is hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is its mate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bird it lives with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's afraid of us. It's not like other birds. Is it a real bird, mum? Or
      one out of the sky?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's real. Shall we go on and see if we can find out what's the
      matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went on into the sedgy grass and the curlew continued to circle,
      vanishing and reappearing from behind the trees, always uttering those
      shrill cries. Little Gyp said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mum, could we speak to it? Because we're not going to hurt nothing, are
      we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, darling! But I'm afraid the poor bird's too wild. Try, if
      you like. Call to it: 'Courlie! Courlie!&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Gyp's piping joined the curlew's cries and other bird-songs in the
      bright shadowy quiet of the evening till Gyp said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look; it's dipping close to the ground, over there in that corner&mdash;it's
      got a nest! We won't go near, will we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Gyp echoed in a hushed voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's got a nest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stole back out of the gate close to the linhay, the curlew still
      fighting and crying behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't we glad the mate isn't hurt, mum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp answered with a shiver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, darling, fearfully glad. Now then, shall we go down and ask Grandy
      to come up to dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Gyp hopped. And they went toward the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      At &ldquo;The Bowl of Cream,&rdquo; Winton had for two years had rooms, which he
      occupied as often as his pursuits permitted. He had refused to make his
      home with Gyp, desiring to be on hand only when she wanted him; and a
      simple life of it he led in those simple quarters, riding with her when
      Summerhay was in town, visiting the cottagers, smoking cigars, laying
      plans for the defence of his daughter's position, and devoting himself to
      the whims of little Gyp. This moment, when his grandchild was to begin to
      ride, was in a manner sacred to one for whom life had scant meaning apart
      from horses. Looking at them, hand in hand, Gyp thought: 'Dad loves her as
      much as he loves me now&mdash;more, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lonely dinner at the inn was an infliction which he studiously concealed
      from Gyp, so he accepted their invitation without alacrity, and they
      walked on up the hill, with little Gyp in the middle, supported by a hand
      on each side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Red House contained nothing that had been in Gyp's married home except
      the piano. It had white walls, furniture of old oak, and for pictures
      reproductions of her favourites. &ldquo;The Death of Procris&rdquo; hung in the
      dining-room. Winton never failed to scrutinize it when he came in to a
      meal&mdash;that &ldquo;deuced rum affair&rdquo; appeared to have a fascination for
      him. He approved of the dining-room altogether; its narrow oak &ldquo;last
      supper&rdquo; table made gay by a strip of blue linen, old brick hearth,
      casement windows hung with flowered curtains&mdash;all had a pleasing
      austerity, uncannily redeemed to softness. He got on well enough with
      Summerhay, but he enjoyed himself much more when he was there alone with
      his daughter. And this evening he was especially glad to have her to
      himself, for she had seemed of late rather grave and absent-minded. When
      dinner was over and they were undisturbed, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be pretty dull for you, my dear, sometimes. I wish you saw more
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Watching her smile, he thought: 'That's not sour grapes&rdquo;&mdash;What is the
      trouble, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you've not heard anything of that fellow Fiorsen lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word. But he's playing again in London this season, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he? Ah, that'll cheer them.&rdquo; And he thought: 'It's not that, then. But
      there's something&mdash;I'll swear!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear that Bryan's going ahead. I met a man in town last week who spoke
      of him as about the most promising junior at the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he's doing awfully well.&rdquo; And a sound like a faint sigh caught his
      ears. &ldquo;Would you say he's changed much since you knew him, Dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;perhaps a little less jokey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he's lost his laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was very evenly and softly said, yet it affected Winton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't expect him to keep that,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;turning people inside out,
      day after day&mdash;and most of them rotten. By George, what a life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when he had left her, strolling back in the bright moonlight, he
      reverted to his suspicions and wished he had said more directly: &ldquo;Look
      here, Gyp, are you worrying about Bryan&mdash;or have people been making
      themselves unpleasant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had, in these last three years, become unconsciously inimical to his
      own class and their imitators, and more than ever friendly to the poor&mdash;visiting
      the labourers, small farmers, and small tradesmen, doing them little turns
      when he could, giving their children sixpences, and so forth. The fact
      that they could not afford to put on airs of virtue escaped him; he
      perceived only that they were respectful and friendly to Gyp and this
      warmed his heart toward them in proportion as he grew exasperated with the
      two or three landed families, and that parvenu lot in the riverside
      villas.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he first came down, the chief landowner&mdash;a man he had known for
      years&mdash;had invited him to lunch. He had accepted with the deliberate
      intention of finding out where he was, and had taken the first natural
      opportunity of mentioning his daughter. She was, he said, devoted to her
      flowers; the Red House had quite a good garden. His friend's wife,
      slightly lifting her brows, had answered with a nervous smile: &ldquo;Oh! yes;
      of course&mdash;yes.&rdquo; A silence had, not unnaturally, fallen. Since then,
      Winton had saluted his friend and his friend's wife with such frigid
      politeness as froze the very marrow in their bones. He had not gone there
      fishing for Gyp to be called on, but to show these people that his
      daughter could not be slighted with impunity. Foolish of him, for, man of
      the world to his fingertips, he knew perfectly well that a woman living
      with a man to whom she was not married could not be recognized by people
      with any pretensions to orthodoxy; Gyp was beyond even the debatable
      ground on which stood those who have been divorced and are married again.
      But even a man of the world is not proof against the warping of devotion,
      and Winton was ready to charge any windmill at any moment on her behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the inn door, exhaling the last puffs of his good-night cigarette,
      he thought: 'What wouldn't I give for the old days, and a chance to wing
      some of these moral upstarts!'
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      The last train was not due till eleven-thirty, and having seen that the
      evening tray had sandwiches, Gyp went to Summerhay's study, the room at
      right angles to the body of the house, over which was their bedroom. Here,
      if she had nothing to do, she always came when he was away, feeling nearer
      to him. She would have been horrified if she had known of her father's
      sentiments on her behalf. Her instant denial of the wish to see more
      people had been quite genuine. The conditions of her life, in that
      respect, often seemed to her ideal. It was such a joy to be free of people
      one did not care two straws about, and of all empty social functions.
      Everything she had now was real&mdash;love, and nature, riding, music,
      animals, and poor people. What else was worth having? She would not have
      changed for anything. It often seemed to her that books and plays about
      the unhappiness of women in her position were all false. If one loved,
      what could one want better? Such women, if unhappy, could have no pride;
      or else could not really love! She had recently been reading &ldquo;Anna
      Karenina,&rdquo; and had often said to herself: &ldquo;There's something not true
      about it&mdash;as if Tolstoy wanted to make us believe that Anna was
      secretly feeling remorse. If one loves, one doesn't feel remorse. Even if
      my baby had been taken away, I shouldn't have felt remorse. One gives
      oneself to love&mdash;or one does not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She even derived a positive joy from the feeling that her love imposed a
      sort of isolation; she liked to be apart&mdash;for him. Besides, by her
      very birth she was outside the fold of society, her love beyond the love
      of those within it&mdash;just as her father's love had been. And her pride
      was greater than theirs, too. How could women mope and moan because they
      were cast out, and try to scratch their way back where they were not
      welcome? How could any woman do that? Sometimes, she wondered whether, if
      Fiorsen died, she would marry her lover. What difference would it make?
      She could not love him more. It would only make him feel, perhaps, too
      sure of her, make it all a matter of course. For herself, she would rather
      go on as she was. But for him, she was not certain, of late had been less
      and less certain. He was not bound now, could leave her when he tired! And
      yet&mdash;did he perhaps feel himself more bound than if they were married&mdash;unfairly
      bound? It was this thought&mdash;barely more than the shadow of a thought&mdash;which
      had given her, of late, the extra gravity noticed by her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that unlighted room with the moonbeams drifting in, she sat down at
      Summerhay's bureau, where he often worked too late at his cases, depriving
      her of himself. She sat there resting her elbows on the bare wood,
      crossing her finger-tips, gazing out into the moonlight, her mind drifting
      on a stream of memories that seemed to have beginning only from the year
      when he came into her life. A smile crept out on her face, and now and
      then she uttered a little sigh of contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many memories, nearly all happy! Surely, the most adroit work of the
      jeweller who put the human soul together was his provision of its power to
      forget the dark and remember sunshine. The year and a half of her life
      with Fiorsen, the empty months that followed it were gone, dispersed like
      mist by the radiance of the last three years in whose sky had hung just
      one cloud, no bigger than a hand, of doubt whether Summerhay really loved
      her as much as she loved him, whether from her company he got as much as
      the all she got from his. She would not have been her distrustful self if
      she could have settled down in complacent security; and her mind was ever
      at stretch on that point, comparing past days and nights with the days and
      nights of the present. Her prevision that, when she loved, it would be
      desperately, had been fulfilled. He had become her life. When this befalls
      one whose besetting strength and weakness alike is pride&mdash;no wonder
      that she doubts.

      For their Odyssey they had gone to Spain&mdash;that brown un-European land
      of &ldquo;lyrio&rdquo; flowers, and cries of &ldquo;Agua!&rdquo; in the streets, where the men
      seem cleft to the waist when they are astride of horses, under their wide
      black hats, and the black-clothed women with wonderful eyes still look as
      if they missed their Eastern veils. It had been a month of gaiety and
      glamour, last days of September and early days of October, a revel of
      enchanted wanderings in the streets of Seville, of embraces and laughter,
      of strange scents and stranger sounds, of orange light and velvety
      shadows, and all the warmth and deep gravity of Spain. The Alcazar, the
      cigarette-girls, the Gipsy dancers of Triana, the old brown ruins to which
      they rode, the streets, and the square with its grave talkers sitting on
      benches in the sun, the water-sellers and the melons; the mules, and the
      dark ragged man out of a dream, picking up the ends of cigarettes, the
      wine of Malaga, burnt fire and honey! Seville had bewitched them&mdash;they
      got no further. They had come back across the brown uplands of Castile to
      Madrid and Goya and Velasquez, till it was time for Paris, before the
      law-term began. There, in a queer little French hotel&mdash;all bedrooms,
      and a lift, coffee and carved beds, wood fires, and a chambermaid who
      seemed all France, and down below a restaurant, to which such as knew
      about eating came, with waiters who looked like monks, both fat and lean&mdash;they
      had spent a week. Three special memories of that week started up in the
      moonlight before Gyp's eyes: The long drive in the Bois among the falling
      leaves of trees flashing with colour in the crisp air under a brilliant
      sky. A moment in the Louvre before the Leonardo &ldquo;Bacchus,&rdquo; when&mdash;his
      &ldquo;restored&rdquo; pink skin forgotten&mdash;all the world seemed to drop away
      while she listened, with the listening figure before her, to some
      mysterious music of growing flowers and secret life. And that last most
      disconcerting memory, of the night before they returned. They were having
      supper after the theatre in their restaurant, when, in a mirror she saw
      three people come in and take seats at a table a little way behind&mdash;Fiorsen,
      Rosek, and Daphne Wing! How she managed to show no sign she never knew!
      While they were ordering, she was safe, for Rosek was a gourmet, and the
      girl would certainly be hungry; but after that, she knew that nothing
      could save her being seen&mdash;Rosek would mark down every woman in the
      room! Should she pretend to feel faint and slip out into the hotel? Or let
      Bryan know? Or sit there laughing and talking, eating and drinking, as if
      nothing were behind her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own face in the mirror had a flush, and her eyes were bright. When
      they saw her, they would see that she was happy, safe in her love. Her
      foot sought Summerhay's beneath the table. How splendid and brown and fit
      he looked, compared with those two pale, towny creatures! And he was
      gazing at her as though just discovering her beauty. How could she ever&mdash;that
      man with his little beard and his white face and those eyes&mdash;how
      could she ever! Ugh! And then, in the mirror, she saw Rosek's dark-circled
      eyes fasten on her and betray their recognition by a sudden gleam, saw his
      lips compressed, and a faint red come up in his cheeks. What would he do?
      The girl's back was turned&mdash;her perfect back&mdash;and she was
      eating. And Fiorsen was staring straight before him in that moody way she
      knew so well. All depended on that deadly little man, who had once kissed
      her throat. A sick feeling seized on Gyp. If her lover knew that within
      five yards of him were those two men! But she still smiled and talked, and
      touched his foot. Rosek had seen that she was conscious&mdash;was getting
      from it a kind of satisfaction. She saw him lean over and whisper to the
      girl, and Daphne Wing turning to look, and her mouth opening for a
      smothered &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Gyp saw her give an uneasy glance at Fiorsen, and then
      begin again to eat. Surely she would want to get away before he saw. Yes;
      very soon she rose. What little airs of the world she had now&mdash;quite
      mistress of the situation! The wrap must be placed exactly on her
      shoulders; and how she walked, giving just one startled look back from the
      door. Gone! The ordeal over! And Gyp said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go up, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt as if they had both escaped a deadly peril&mdash;not from
      anything those two could do to him or her, but from the cruel ache and
      jealousy of the past, which the sight of that man would have brought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women, for their age, are surely older than men&mdash;married women, at
      all events, than men who have not had that experience. And all through
      those first weeks of their life together, there was a kind of wise
      watchfulness in Gyp. He was only a boy in knowledge of life as she saw it,
      and though his character was so much more decided, active, and insistent
      than her own, she felt it lay with her to shape the course and avoid the
      shallows and sunken rocks. The house they had seen together near the
      river, under the Berkshire downs, was still empty; and while it was being
      got ready, they lived at a London hotel. She had insisted that he should
      tell no one of their life together. If that must come, she wanted to be
      firmly settled in, with little Gyp and Betty and the horses, so that it
      should all be for him as much like respectable married life as possible.
      But, one day, in the first week after their return, while in her room,
      just back from a long day's shopping, a card was brought up to her: &ldquo;Lady
      Summerhay.&rdquo; Her first impulse was to be &ldquo;not at home&rdquo;; her second, &ldquo;I'd
      better face it. Bryan would wish me to see her!&rdquo; When the page-boy was
      gone, she turned to the mirror and looked at herself doubtfully. She
      seemed to know exactly what that tall woman whom she had seen on the
      platform would think of her&mdash;too soft, not capable, not right for
      him!&mdash;not even if she were legally his wife. And touching her hair,
      laying a dab of scent on her eyebrows, she turned and went downstairs
      fluttering, but outwardly calm enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little low-roofed inner lounge of that old hotel, whose rooms were
      all &ldquo;entirely renovated,&rdquo; Gyp saw her visitor standing at a table, rapidly
      turning the pages of an illustrated magazine, as people will when their
      minds are set upon a coming operation. And she thought: 'I believe she's
      more frightened than I am!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay held out a gloved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope you'll forgive my coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp took the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. It was very good of you. I'm sorry Bryan isn't in yet. Will
      you have some tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had tea; but do let's sit down. How do you find the hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On a velvet lounge that had survived the renovation, they sat side by
      side, screwed round toward each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bryan's told me what a pleasant time you had abroad. He's looking very
      well, I think. I'm devoted to him, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp answered softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must be.&rdquo; And her heart felt suddenly as hard as flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay gave her a quick look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I hope you won't mind my being frank&mdash;I've been so worried.
      It's an unhappy position, isn't it?&rdquo; Gyp did not answer, and she hurried
      on. &ldquo;If there's anything I can do to help, I should be so glad&mdash;it
      must be horrid for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said very quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! no. I'm perfectly happy&mdash;couldn't be happier.&rdquo; And she thought:
      'I suppose she doesn't believe that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay was looking at her fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One doesn't realize these things at first&mdash;neither of you will, till
      you see how dreadfully Society can cold-shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp made an effort to control a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can only be cold-shouldered if one puts oneself in the way of it. I
      should never wish to see or speak to anyone who couldn't take me just for
      what I am. And I don't really see what difference it will make to Bryan;
      most men of his age have someone, somewhere.&rdquo; She felt malicious pleasure
      watching her visitor jib and frown at the cynicism of that soft speech; a
      kind of hatred had come on her of this society woman, who&mdash;disguise
      it as she would&mdash;was at heart her enemy, who regarded her, must
      regard her, as an enslaver, as a despoiler of her son's worldly chances, a
      Delilah dragging him down. She said still more quietly: &ldquo;He need tell no
      one of my existence; and you can be quite sure that if ever he feels he's
      had enough of me, he'll never be troubled by the sight of me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she got up. Lady Summerhay also rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don't think&mdash;I really am only too anxious to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's better to be quite frank. You will never like me, or forgive
      me for ensnaring Bryan. And so it had better be, please, as it would be if
      I were just his common mistress. That will be perfectly all right for both
      of us. It was very good of you to come, though. Thank you&mdash;and
      good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay literally faltered with speech and hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a malicious smile, Gyp watched her retirement among the little tables
      and elaborately modern chairs till her tall figure had disappeared behind
      a column. Then she sat down again on the lounge, pressing her hands to her
      burning ears. She had never till then known the strength of the
      pride-demon within her; at the moment, it was almost stronger than her
      love. She was still sitting there, when the page-boy brought her another
      card&mdash;her father's. She sprang up saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, here, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton came in all brisk and elated at sight of her after this long
      absence; and, throwing her arms round his neck, she hugged him tight. He
      was doubly precious to her after the encounter she had just gone though.
      When he had given her news of Mildenham and little Gyp, he looked at her
      steadily, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coast'll be clear for you both down there, and at Bury Street,
      whenever you like to come, Gyp. I shall regard this as your real marriage.
      I shall have the servants in and make that plain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A row like family prayers&mdash;and Dad standing up very straight, saying
      in his dry way: &ldquo;You will be so good in future as to remember&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;I
      shall be obliged if you will,&rdquo; and so on; Betty's round face pouting at
      being brought in with all the others; Markey's soft, inscrutable; Mrs.
      Markey's demure and goggling; the maids' rabbit-faces; old Pettance's
      carved grin the film lifting from his little burning eyes: &ldquo;Ha! Mr. Bryn
      Summer'ay; he bought her orse, and so she's gone to 'im!&rdquo; And she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, I don't know! It's awfully sweet of you. We'll see later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton patted her hand. &ldquo;We must stand up to 'em, you know, Gyp. You
      mustn't get your tail down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dad; never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That same night, across the strip of blackness between their beds, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bryan, promise me something!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends. I know you too well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it's quite reasonable, and possible. Promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; if it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to let me take the lease of the Red House&mdash;let it be
      mine, the whole thing&mdash;let me pay for everything there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reasonable! What's the point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that I shall have a proper home of my own. I can't explain, but your
      mother's coming to-day made me feel I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child, how could I possibly live on YOU there? It's absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can pay for everything else; London&mdash;travelling&mdash;clothes,
      if you like. We can make it square up. It's not a question of money, of
      course. I only want to feel that if, at any moment, you don't need me any
      more, you can simply stop coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that's brutal, Gyp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; so many women lose men's love because they seem to claim things
      of them. I don't want to lose yours that way&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's silly, darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not. Men&mdash;and women, too&mdash;always tug at chains. And when
      there is no chain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then; let me take the house, and you can go away when you're tired
      of me.&rdquo; His voice sounded smothered, resentful; she could hear him turning
      and turning, as if angry with his pillows. And she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I can't explain. But I really mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're just beginning life together, and you talk as if you want to split
      it up. It hurts, Gyp, and that's all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be angry, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! Why don't you trust me more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. Only I must make as sure as I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound came again of his turning and turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Very well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence followed, both lying quiet in the darkness, trying to get
      the better of each other by sheer listening. An hour perhaps passed before
      he sighed, and, feeling his lips on hers, she knew that she had won.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      There, in the study, the moonlight had reached her face; an owl was
      hooting not far away, and still more memories came&mdash;the happiest of
      all, perhaps&mdash;of first days in this old house together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay damaged himself out hunting that first winter. The memory of
      nursing him was strangely pleasant, now that it was two years old. For
      convalescence they had gone to the Pyrenees&mdash;Argeles in March, all
      almond-blossom and snows against the blue&mdash;a wonderful fortnight. In
      London on the way back they had their first awkward encounter. Coming out
      of a theatre one evening, Gyp heard a woman's voice, close behind, say:
      &ldquo;Why, it's Bryan! What ages!&rdquo; And his answer defensively drawled out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halo! How are you, Diana?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, awfully fit. Where are you, nowadays? Why don't you come and see us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the drawl:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down in the country. I will, some time. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tall woman or girl&mdash;red-haired, with one of those wonderful white
      skins that go therewith; and brown&mdash;yes, brown eyes; Gyp could see
      those eyes sweeping her up and down with a sort of burning-live curiosity.
      Bryan's hand was thrust under her arm at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, let's walk and get a cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were clear of the crowd, she pressed his hand to her
      breast, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind? Of course not. It's for you to mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A second cousin. Diana Leyton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know her very well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;used to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you like her very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round into her face, with laughter bubbling up behind his
      gravity. Ah, but could one tease on such a subject as their love? And to
      this day the figure of that tall girl with the burning-white skin, the
      burning-brown eyes, the burning-red hair was not quite a pleasant memory
      to Gyp. After that night, they gave up all attempt to hide their union,
      going to whatever they wished, whether they were likely to meet people or
      not. Gyp found that nothing was so easily ignored as Society when the
      heart was set on other things. Besides, they were seldom in London, and in
      the country did not wish to know anyone, in any case. But she never lost
      the feeling that what was ideal for her might not be ideal for him. He
      ought to go into the world, ought to meet people. It would not do for him
      to be cut off from social pleasures and duties, and then some day feel
      that he owed his starvation to her. To go up to London, too, every day was
      tiring, and she persuaded him to take a set of residential chambers in the
      Temple, and sleep there three nights a week. In spite of all his
      entreaties, she herself never went to those chambers, staying always at
      Bury Street when she came up. A kind of superstition prevented her; she
      would not risk making him feel that she was hanging round his neck.
      Besides, she wanted to keep herself desirable&mdash;so little a matter of
      course that he would hanker after her when he was away. And she never
      asked him where he went or whom he saw. But, sometimes, she wondered
      whether he could still be quite faithful to her in thought, love her as he
      used to; and joy would go down behind a heavy bank of clouds, till, at his
      return, the sun came out again. Love such as hers&mdash;passionate,
      adoring, protective, longing to sacrifice itself, to give all that it had
      to him, yet secretly demanding all his love in return&mdash;for how could
      a proud woman love one who did not love her?&mdash;such love as this is
      always longing for a union more complete than it is likely to get in a
      world where all things move and change. But against the grip of this love
      she never dreamed of fighting now. From the moment when she knew she must
      cling to him rather than to her baby, she had made no reservations; all
      her eggs were in one basket, as her father's had been before her&mdash;all!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moonlight was shining full on the old bureau and a vase of tulips
      standing there, giving those flowers colour that was not colour, and an
      unnamed look, as if they came from a world which no human enters. It
      glinted on a bronze bust of old Voltaire, which she had bought him for a
      Christmas present, so that the great writer seemed to be smiling from the
      hollows of his eyes. Gyp turned the bust a little, to catch the light on
      its far cheek; a letter was disclosed between it and the oak. She drew it
      out thinking: 'Bless him! He uses everything for paper-weights'; and, in
      the strange light, its first words caught her eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR BRYAN,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I say&mdash;you ARE wasting yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid it down, methodically pushing it back under the bust. Perhaps he
      had put it there on purpose! She got up and went to the window, to check
      the temptation to read the rest of that letter and see from whom it was.
      No! She did not admit that she was tempted. One did not read letters. Then
      the full import of those few words struck into her: &ldquo;Dear Bryan. But I say&mdash;you
      ARE wasting yourself.&rdquo; A letter in a chain of correspondence, then! A
      woman's hand; but not his mother's, nor his sisters'&mdash;she knew their
      writings. Who had dared to say he was wasting himself? A letter in a chain
      of letters! An intimate correspondent, whose name she did not know,
      because&mdash;he had not told her! Wasting himself&mdash;on what?&mdash;on
      his life with her down here? And was he? Had she herself not said that
      very night that he had lost his laugh? She began searching her memory.
      Yes, last Christmas vacation&mdash;that clear, cold, wonderful fortnight
      in Florence, he had been full of fun. It was May now. Was there no memory
      since&mdash;of his old infectious gaiety? She could not think of any. &ldquo;But
      I say&mdash;you ARE wasting yourself.&rdquo; A sudden hatred flared up in her
      against the unknown woman who had said that thing&mdash;and fever, running
      through her veins, made her ears burn. She longed to snatch forth and tear
      to pieces the letter, with its guardianship of which that bust seemed
      mocking her; and she turned away with the thought: 'I'll go and meet him;
      I can't wait here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing on a cloak she walked out into the moonlit garden, and went
      slowly down the whitened road toward the station. A magical, dewless
      night! The moonbeams had stolen in to the beech clump, frosting the boles
      and boughs, casting a fine ghostly grey over the shadow-patterned
      beech-mast. Gyp took the short cut through it. Not a leaf moved in there,
      no living thing stirred; so might an earth be where only trees inhabited!
      She thought: 'I'll bring him back through here.' And she waited at the far
      corner of the clump, where he must pass, some little distance from the
      station. She never gave people unnecessary food for gossip&mdash;any
      slighting of her irritated him, she was careful to spare him that. The
      train came in; a car went whizzing by, a cyclist, then the first
      foot-passenger, at a great pace, breaking into a run. She saw that it was
      he, and, calling out his name, ran back into the shadow of the trees. He
      stopped dead in his tracks, then came rushing after her. That pursuit did
      not last long, and, in his arms, Gyp said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you aren't too hungry, darling, let's stay here a little&mdash;it's so
      wonderful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat down on a great root, and leaning against him, looking up at the
      dark branches, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had a hard day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; got hung up by a late consultation; and old Leyton asked me to come
      and dine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp felt a sensation as when feet happen on ground that gives a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Leytons&mdash;that's Eaton Square, isn't it? A big dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Only the old people, and Bertie and Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diana? That's the girl we met coming out of the theatre, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When? Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;what a memory, Gyp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it's good for things that interest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Did she interest you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp turned and looked into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Is she clever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm! I suppose you might call her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in love with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it very unlikely? I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began kissing her lips and hair. And, closing her eyes, Gyp thought:
      'If only that's not because he doesn't want to answer!' Then, for some
      minutes, they were silent as the moonlit beech clump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me truly, Bryan. Do you never&mdash;never&mdash;feel as if you
      were wasting yourself on me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was certain of a quiver in his grasp; but his face was open and
      serene, his voice as usual when he was teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hardly ever! Aren't you funny, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promise me faithfully to let me know when you've had enough of me.
      Promise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! But don't look for fulfilment in this life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp put up her lips, and tried to drown for ever in a kiss the memory of
      those words: &ldquo;But I say&mdash;you ARE wasting yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay, coming down next morning, went straight to his bureau; his mind
      was not at ease. &ldquo;Wasting yourself!&rdquo; What had he done with that letter of
      Diana's? He remembered Gyp's coming in just as he finished reading it.
      Searching the pigeonholes and drawers, moving everything that lay about,
      he twitched the bust&mdash;and the letter lay disclosed. He took it up
      with a sigh of relief:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR BRYAN,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I say&mdash;you ARE wasting yourself. Why, my dear, of course! 'Il
      faut se faire valoir!' You have only one foot to put forward; the other is
      planted in I don't know what mysterious hole. One foot in the grave&mdash;at
      thirty! Really, Bryan! Pull it out. There's such a lot waiting for you.
      It's no good your being hoity-toity, and telling me to mind my business.
      I'm speaking for everyone who knows you. We all feel the blight on the
      rose. Besides, you always were my favourite cousin, ever since I was five
      and you a horrid little bully of ten; and I simply hate to think of you
      going slowly down instead of quickly up. Oh! I know 'D&mdash;n the world!'
      But&mdash;are you? I should have thought it was 'd&mdash;ning' you!
      Enough! When are you coming to see us? I've read that book. The man seems
      to think love is nothing but passion, and passion always fatal. I wonder!
      Perhaps you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be angry with me for being such a grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Au revoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your very good cousin,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DIANA LEYTON.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crammed the letter into his pocket, and sat there, appalled. It must
      have lain two days under that bust! Had Gyp seen it? He looked at the
      bronze face; and the philosopher looked back from the hollows of his eyes,
      as if to say: &ldquo;What do you know of the human heart, my boy&mdash;your own,
      your mistress's, that girl's, or anyone's? A pretty dance the heart will
      lead you yet! Put it in a packet, tie it round with string, seal it up,
      drop it in a drawer, lock the drawer! And to-morrow it will be out and
      skipping on its wrappings. Ho! Ho!&rdquo; And Summerhay thought: 'You old goat.
      You never had one!' In the room above, Gyp would still be standing as he
      had left her, putting the last touch to her hair&mdash;a man would be a
      scoundrel who, even in thought, could&mdash;&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; the eyes of the bust
      seemed to say. &ldquo;Pity! That's queer, isn't it? Why not pity that red-haired
      girl, with the skin so white that it burns you, and the eyes so brown that
      they burn you&mdash;don't they?&rdquo; Old Satan! Gyp had his heart; no one in
      the world would ever take it from her!
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the chair where she had sat last night conjuring up memories, he
      too now conjured. How he had loved her, did love her! She would always be
      what she was and had been to him. And the sage's mouth seemed to twist
      before him with the words: &ldquo;Quite so, my dear! But the heart's very funny&mdash;very&mdash;capacious!&rdquo;
       A tiny sound made him turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Gyp was standing in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Baryn!&rdquo; She came flying to him, and he caught her up so that she
      stood on his knees with the sunlight shining on her fluffed out hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Gipsy! Who's getting a tall girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm goin' to ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baryn, let's do Humpty-Dumpty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; come on!&rdquo; He rose and carried her upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp was still doing one of those hundred things which occupy women for a
      quarter of an hour after they are &ldquo;quite ready,&rdquo; and at little Gyp's shout
      of, &ldquo;Humpty!&rdquo; she suspended her needle to watch the sacred rite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay had seated himself on the foot-rail of the bed, rounding his
      arms, sinking his neck, blowing out his cheeks to simulate an egg; then,
      with an unexpectedness that even little Gyp could always see through, he
      rolled backward on to the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she, simulating &ldquo;all the king's horses,&rdquo; tried in vain to put him up
      again. This immemorial game, watched by Gyp a hundred times, had to-day a
      special preciousness. If he could be so ridiculously young, what became of
      her doubts? Looking at his face pulled this way and that, lazily
      imperturbable under the pommelings of those small fingers, she thought:
      'And that girl dared to say he was WASTING HIMSELF!' For in the night
      conviction had come to her that those words were written by the tall girl
      with the white skin, the girl of the theatre&mdash;the Diana of his last
      night's dinner. Humpty-Dumpty was up on the bed-rail again for the finale;
      all the king's horses were clasped to him, making the egg more round, and
      over they both went with shrieks and gurgles. What a boy he was! She would
      not&mdash;no, she would not brood and spoil her day with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that afternoon, at the end of a long gallop on the downs, she turned
      her head away and said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she a huntress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cousin&mdash;Diana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his laziest voice, he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean&mdash;does she hunt me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew that tone, that expression on his face, knew he was angry; but
      could not stop herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're going to become jealous, Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those cold, naked sayings that should never be spoken
      between lovers&mdash;one of those sayings at which the heart of the one
      who speaks sinks with a kind of dismay, and the heart of the one who hears
      quivers. She cantered on. And he, perforce, after her. When she reined in
      again, he glanced into her face and was afraid. It was all closed up
      against him. And he said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean that, Gyp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she only shook her head. He HAD meant it&mdash;had wanted to hurt her!
      It didn't matter&mdash;she wouldn't give him the chance again. And she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that long white cloud, and the apple-green in the sky&mdash;rain
      to-morrow. One ought to enjoy any fine day as if it were the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uneasy, ashamed, yet still a little angry, Summerhay rode on beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, she cried in her sleep; and, when he awakened her, clung to
      him and sobbed out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! such a dreadful dream! I thought you'd left off loving me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a long time he held and soothed her. Never, never! He would never
      leave off loving her!
    </p>
    <p>
      But a cloud no broader than your hand can spread and cover the whole day.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer passed, and always there was that little patch of silence in
      her heart, and in his. The tall, bright days grew taller, slowly passed
      their zenith, slowly shortened. On Saturdays and Sundays, sometimes with
      Winton and little Gyp, but more often alone, they went on the river. For
      Gyp, it had never lost the magic of their first afternoon upon it&mdash;never
      lost its glamour as of an enchanted world. All the week she looked forward
      to these hours of isolation with him, as if the surrounding water secured
      her not only against a world that would take him from her, if it could,
      but against that side of his nature, which, so long ago she had named &ldquo;old
      Georgian.&rdquo; She had once adventured to the law courts by herself, to see
      him in his wig and gown. Under that stiff grey crescent on his broad
      forehead, he seemed so hard and clever&mdash;so of a world to which she
      never could belong, so of a piece with the brilliant bullying of the whole
      proceeding. She had come away feeling that she only possessed and knew one
      side of him. On the river, she had that side utterly&mdash;her lovable,
      lazy, impudently loving boy, lying with his head in her lap, plunging in
      for a swim, splashing round her; or with his sleeves rolled up, his neck
      bare, and a smile on his face, plying his slow sculls down-stream,
      singing, &ldquo;Away, my rolling river,&rdquo; or puffing home like a demon in want of
      his dinner. It was such a blessing to lose for a few hours each week this
      growing consciousness that she could never have the whole of him. But all
      the time the patch of silence grew, for doubt in the heart of one lover
      reacts on the heart of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the long vacation came, she made an heroic resolve. He must go to
      Scotland, must have a month away from her, a good long rest. And while
      Betty was at the sea with little Gyp, she would take her father to his
      cure. She held so inflexibly to this resolve, that, after many protests,
      he said with a shrug:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will then&mdash;if you're so keen to get rid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keen to get rid!&rdquo; When she could not bear to be away from him! But she
      forced her feeling back, and said, smiling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last! There's a good boy!&rdquo; Anything! If only it would bring him back
      to her exactly as he had been. She asked no questions as to where, or to
      whom, he would go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tunbridge Wells, that charming purgatory where the retired prepare their
      souls for a more permanent retirement, was dreaming on its hills in long
      rows of adequate villas. Its commons and woods had remained unscorched, so
      that the retired had not to any extent deserted it, that August, for the
      sea. They still shopped in the Pantiles, strolled the uplands, or
      flourished their golf-clubs in the grassy parks; they still drank tea in
      each other's houses and frequented the many churches. One could see their
      faces, as it were, goldened by their coming glory, like the chins of
      children by reflection from buttercups. From every kind of life they had
      retired, and, waiting now for a more perfect day, were doing their utmost
      to postpone it. They lived very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp and her father had rooms in a hotel where he could bathe and drink the
      waters without having to climb three hills. This was the first cure she
      had attended since the long-past time at Wiesbaden. Was it possible that
      was only six years ago? She felt so utterly, so strangely different! Then
      life had been sparkling sips of every drink, and of none too much; now it
      was one long still draft, to quench a thirst that would not be quenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these weeks she held herself absolutely at her father's disposal,
      but she lived for the post, and if, by any chance, she did not get her
      daily letter, her heart sank to the depths. She wrote every day, sometimes
      twice, then tore up that second letter, remembering for what reason she
      had set herself to undergo this separation. During the first week, his
      letters had a certain equanimity; in the second week they became ardent;
      in the third, they were fitful&mdash;now beginning to look forward, now
      moody and dejected; and they were shorter. During this third week Aunt
      Rosamund joined them. The good lady had become a staunch supporter of
      Gyp's new existence, which, in her view, served Fiorsen right. Why should
      the poor child's life be loveless? She had a definitely low opinion of
      men, and a lower of the state of the marriage-laws; in her view, any woman
      who struck a blow in that direction was something of a heroine. And she
      was oblivious of the fact that Gyp was quite guiltless of the desire to
      strike a blow against the marriage-laws, or anything else. Aunt Rosamund's
      aristocratic and rebellious blood boiled with hatred of what she called
      the &ldquo;stuffy people&rdquo; who still held that women were men's property. It had
      made her specially careful never to put herself in that position.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had brought Gyp a piece of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was walking down Bond Street past that tea-and-tart shop, my dear&mdash;you
      know, where they have those special coffee-creams, and who should come out
      of it but Miss Daphne Wing and our friend Fiorsen; and pretty hangdog he
      looked. He came up to me, with his little lady watching him like a lynx.
      Really, my dear, I was rather sorry for him; he'd got that hungry look of
      his; she'd been doing all the eating, I'm sure. He asked me how you were.
      I told him, 'Very well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'When you see her,' he said, 'tell her I haven't forgotten her, and never
      shall. But she was quite right; this is the sort of lady that I'm fit
      for.' And the way he looked at that girl made me feel quite uncomfortable.
      Then he gave me one of his little bows; and off they went, she as pleased
      as Punch. I really was sorry for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you needn't have been, Auntie; he'll always be able to be sorry for
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little shocked at her niece's cynicism, Aunt Rosamund was silent. The
      poor lady had not lived with Fiorsen!
    </p>
    <p>
      That same afternoon, Gyp was sitting in a shelter on the common, a book on
      her knee&mdash;thinking her one long thought: 'To-day is Thursday&mdash;Monday
      week! Eleven days&mdash;still!'&mdash;when three figures came slowly
      toward her, a man, a woman, and what should have been a dog. English love
      of beauty and the rights of man had forced its nose back, deprived it of
      half its ears, and all but three inches or so of tail. It had asthma&mdash;and
      waddled in disillusionment. A voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This'll do, Maria. We can take the sun 'ere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for that voice, with the permanent cold hoarseness caught beside
      innumerable graves, Gyp might not have recognized Mr. Wagge, for he had
      taken off his beard, leaving nothing but side-whiskers, and Mrs. Wagge had
      filled out wonderfully. They were some time settling down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sit here, Maria; you won't get the sun in your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Robert; I'll sit here. You sit there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, YOU sit there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will. Come, Duckie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the dog, standing stockily on the pathway was gazing at Gyp, while
      what was left of its broad nose moved from side to side. Mr. Wagge
      followed the direction of its glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;oh, this is a surprise!&rdquo; And fumbling at his straw hat, he
      passed his other hand over his sleeve and held it out to Gyp. It felt
      almost dry, and fatter than it had been. While she was shaking it, the dog
      moved forward and sat down on her feet. Mrs. Wagge also extended her hand,
      clad in a shiny glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a&mdash;a&mdash;pleasure,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Who WOULD have thought
      of meeting you! Oh, don't let Duckie sit against your pretty frock! Come,
      Duckie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Duckie did not move, resting his back against Gyp's shin-bones. Mr.
      Wagge, whose tongue had been passing over a mouth which she saw to its
      full advantage for the first time, said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 'aven't come to live here, 'ave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! I'm only with my father for the baths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I thought not, never havin' seen you. We've been retired here
      ourselves a matter of twelve months. A pretty spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; lovely, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wanted nature. The air suits us, though a bit&mdash;er&mdash;too
      irony, as you might say. But it's a long-lived place. We were quite a time
      lookin' round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wagge added in her thin voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;we'd thought of Wimbledon, you see, but Mr. Wagge liked this
      better; he can get his walk, here; and it's more&mdash;select, perhaps. We
      have several friends. The church is very nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge's face assumed an uncertain expression. He said bluffly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was always a chapel man; but&mdash;I don't know how it is&mdash;there's
      something in a place like this that makes church seem more&mdash;more
      suitable; my wife always had a leaning that way. I never conceal my
      actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a question of atmosphere, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I don't hold with incense&mdash;we're not 'Igh Church. But how are
      YOU, ma'am? We often speak of you. You're looking well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face had become a dusky orange, and Mrs. Wagge's the colour of a
      doubtful beetroot. The dog on Gyp's feet stirred, snuffled, turned round,
      and fell heavily against her legs again. She said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hearing of Daisy only to-day. She's quite a star now, isn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wagge sighed. Mr. Wagge looked away and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a sore subject. There she is, making her forty and fifty pound a
      week, and run after in all the papers. She's a success&mdash;no doubt
      about it. And she works. Saving a matter of fifteen 'undred a year, I
      shouldn't be surprised. Why, at my best, the years the influenza was so
      bad, I never cleared a thousand net. No, she's a success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wagge added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen her last photograph&mdash;the one where she's standing
      between two hydrangea-tubs? It was her own idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge mumbled suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm always glad to see her when she takes a run down in a car. But I've
      come here for quiet after the life I've led, and I don't want to think
      about it, especially before you, ma'am. I don't&mdash;that's a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed, during which Mr. and Mrs. Wagge looked at their feet,
      and Gyp looked at the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;here you are!&rdquo; It was Winton, who had come up from behind the
      shelter, and stood, with eyebrows slightly raised. Gyp could not help a
      smile. Her father's weathered, narrow face, half-veiled eyes, thin nose,
      little crisp, grey moustache that did not hide his firm lips, his lean,
      erect figure, the very way he stood, his thin, dry, clipped voice were the
      absolute antithesis of Mr. Wagge's thickset, stoutly planted form,
      thick-skinned, thick-featured face, thick, rather hoarse yet oily voice.
      It was as if Providence had arranged a demonstration of the extremes of
      social type. And she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Wagge&mdash;my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton raised his hat. Gyp remained seated, the dog Duckie being still on
      her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Appy to meet you, sir. I hope you have benefit from the waters. They're
      supposed to be most powerful, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;not more deadly than most. Are you drinking them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wagge smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nao!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we live here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Do you find anything to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as a fact, I've come here for rest. But I take a Turkish bath once
      a fortnight&mdash;find it refreshing; keeps the pores of the skin acting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wagge added gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to suit my husband wonderfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Is this your dog? Bit of a philosopher, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wagge answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's a naughty dog, aren't you, Duckie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dog Duckie, feeling himself the cynosure of every eye, rose and stood
      panting into Gyp's face. She took the occasion to get up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go, I'm afraid. Good-bye. It's been very nice to meet you again.
      When you see Daisy, will you please give her my love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Wagge unexpectedly took a handkerchief from her reticule. Mr. Wagge
      cleared his throat heavily. Gyp was conscious of the dog Duckie waddling
      after them, and of Mrs. Wagge calling, &ldquo;Duckie, Duckie!&rdquo; from behind her
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So those two got that pretty filly! Well, she didn't show much quality,
      when you come to think of it. She's still with our friend, according to
      your aunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and I do hope she's happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HE isn't, apparently. Serves him right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, Dad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, one oughtn't to wish any man worse than he's likely to get. But
      when I see people daring to look down their noses at you&mdash;by Jove! I
      get&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, what does that matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton answered testily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It matters very much to me&mdash;the impudence of it!&rdquo; His mouth relaxed
      in a grim little smile: &ldquo;Ah, well&mdash;there's not much to choose between
      us so far as condemning our neighbours goes. 'Charity Stakes&mdash;also
      ran, Charles Clare Winton, the Church, and Mrs. Grundy.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They opened out to each other more in those few days at Tunbridge Wells
      than they had for years. Whether the process of bathing softened his
      crust, or the air that Mr. Wagge found &ldquo;a bit&mdash;er&mdash;too irony, as
      you might say,&rdquo; had upon Winton the opposite effect, he certainly relaxed
      that first duty of man, the concealment of his spirit, and disclosed his
      activities as he never had before&mdash;how such and such a person had
      been set on his feet, so and so sent out to Canada, this man's wife helped
      over her confinement, that man's daughter started again after a slip. And
      Gyp's child-worship of him bloomed anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last afternoon of their stay, she strolled out with him through one
      of the long woods that stretched away behind their hotel. Excited by the
      coming end of her self-inflicted penance, moved by the beauty among those
      sunlit trees, she found it difficult to talk. But Winton, about to lose
      her, was quite loquacious. Starting from the sinister change in the
      racing-world&mdash;so plutocratic now, with the American seat, the
      increase of bookmaking owners, and other tragic occurrences&mdash;he
      launched forth into a jeremiad on the condition of things in general.
      Parliament, he thought, especially now that members were paid, had lost
      its self-respect; the towns had eaten up the country; hunting was
      threatened; the power and vulgarity of the press were appalling; women had
      lost their heads; and everybody seemed afraid of having any &ldquo;breeding.&rdquo; By
      the time little Gyp was Gyp's age, they would all be under the thumb of
      Watch Committees, live in Garden Cities, and have to account for every
      half-crown they spent, and every half-hour of their time; the horse, too,
      would be an extinct animal, brought out once a year at the lord-mayor's
      show. He hoped&mdash;the deuce&mdash;he might not be alive to see it. And
      suddenly he added: &ldquo;What do you think happens after death, Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting on one of those benches that crop up suddenly in the
      heart of nature. All around them briars and bracken were just on the turn;
      and the hum of flies, the vague stir of leaves and life formed but a
      single sound. Gyp, gazing into the wood, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Dad. I think we just go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;My idea, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of them had ever known what the other thought about it before!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyp murmured:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;La vie est vaine&mdash;
        Un peu d'amour,
      Un peu de haine,
        Et puis bonjour!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Not quite a grunt or quite a laugh emerged from the depths of Winton, and,
      looking up at the sky, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what they call 'God,' after all, what is it? Just the very best you
      can get out of yourself&mdash;nothing more, so far as I can see. Dash it,
      you can't imagine anything more than you can imagine. One would like to
      die in the open, though, like Whyte-Melville. But there's one thing that's
      always puzzled me, Gyp. All one's life one's tried to have a single heart.
      Death comes, and out you go! Then why did one love, if there's to be no
      meeting after?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; except for that, who would care? But does the wanting to meet make
      it any more likely, Dad? The world couldn't go on without love; perhaps
      loving somebody or something with all your heart is all in itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton stared; the remark was a little deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I often think the religious johnnies are saving
      their money to put on a horse that'll never run after all. I remember
      those Yogi chaps in India. There they sat, and this jolly world might rot
      round them for all they cared&mdash;they thought they were going to be all
      right themselves, in Kingdom Come. But suppose it doesn't come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp murmured with a little smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they were trying to love everything at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rum way of showing it. And, hang it, there are such a lot of things one
      can't love! Look at that!&rdquo; He pointed upwards. Against the grey bole of a
      beech-tree hung a board, on which were the freshly painted words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                   PRIVATE

        TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That board is stuck up all over this life and the next. Well, WE won't
      give them the chance to warn us off, Gyp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slipping her hand through his arm, she pressed close up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dad; you and I will go off with the wind and the sun, and the trees
      and the waters, like Procris in my picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      The curious and complicated nature of man in matters of the heart is not
      sufficiently conceded by women, professors, clergymen, judges, and other
      critics of his conduct. And naturally so, since they all have vested
      interests in his simplicity. Even journalists are in the conspiracy to
      make him out less wayward than he is, and dip their pens in epithets, if
      his heart diverges inch or ell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bryan Summerhay was neither more curious nor more complicated than those
      of his own sex who would condemn him for getting into the midnight express
      from Edinburgh with two distinct emotions in his heart&mdash;a regretful
      aching for the girl, his cousin, whom he was leaving behind, and a
      rapturous anticipation of the woman whom he was going to rejoin. How was
      it possible that he could feel both at once? &ldquo;Against all the rules,&rdquo;
       women and other moralists would say. Well, the fact is, a man's heart
      knows no rules. And he found it perfectly easy, lying in his bunk, to
      dwell on memories of Diana handing him tea, or glancing up at him, while
      he turned the leaves of her songs, with that enticing mockery in her eyes
      and about her lips; and yet the next moment to be swept from head to heel
      by the longing to feel Gyp's arms around him, to hear her voice, look in
      her eyes, and press his lips on hers. If, instead of being on his way to
      rejoin a mistress, he had been going home to a wife, he would not have
      felt a particle more of spiritual satisfaction, perhaps not so much. He
      was returning to the feelings and companionship that he knew were the most
      deeply satisfying spiritually and bodily he would ever have. And yet he
      could ache a little for that red-haired girl, and this without any
      difficulty. How disconcerting! But, then, truth is.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that queer seesawing of his feelings, he fell asleep, dreamed of all
      things under the sun as men only can in a train, was awakened by the
      hollow silence in some station, slept again for hours, it seemed, and woke
      still at the same station, fell into a sound sleep at last that ended at
      Willesden in broad daylight. Dressing hurriedly, he found he had but one
      emotion now, one longing&mdash;to get to Gyp. Sitting back in his cab,
      hands deep-thrust into the pockets of his ulster, he smiled, enjoying even
      the smell of the misty London morning. Where would she be&mdash;in the
      hall of the hotel waiting, or upstairs still?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not in the hall! And asking for her room, he made his way to its door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing in the far corner motionless, deadly pale, quivering from
      head to foot; and when he flung his arms round her, she gave a long sigh,
      closing her eyes. With his lips on hers, he could feel her almost
      fainting; and he too had no consciousness of anything but that long kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, they went abroad to a little place not far from Fecamp, in that
      Normandy countryside where all things are large&mdash;the people, the
      beasts, the unhedged fields, the courtyards of the farms guarded so
      squarely by tall trees, the skies, the sea, even the blackberries large.
      And Gyp was happy. But twice there came letters, in that
      too-well-remembered handwriting, which bore a Scottish postmark. A phantom
      increases in darkness, solidifies when seen in mist. Jealousy is rooted
      not in reason, but in the nature that feels it&mdash;in her nature that
      loved desperately, felt proudly. And jealousy flourishes on scepticism.
      Even if pride would have let her ask, what good? She would not have
      believed the answers. Of course he would say&mdash;if only out of pity&mdash;that
      he never let his thoughts rest on another woman. But, after all, it was
      only a phantom. There were many hours in those three weeks when she felt
      he really loved her, and so&mdash;was happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went back to the Red House at the end of the first week in October.
      Little Gyp, home from the sea, was now an almost accomplished horsewoman.
      Under the tutelage of old Pettance, she had been riding steadily round and
      round those rough fields by the linhay which they called &ldquo;the wild,&rdquo; her
      firm brown legs astride of the mouse-coloured pony, her little brown face,
      with excited, dark eyes, very erect, her auburn crop of short curls
      flopping up and down on her little straight back. She wanted to be able to
      &ldquo;go out riding&rdquo; with Grandy and Mum and Baryn. And the first days were
      spent by them all more or less in fulfilling her new desires. Then term
      began, and Gyp sat down again to the long sharing of Summerhay with his
      other life.
    </p>
    <p>
      VII
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon at the beginning of November, the old Scotch terrier,
      Ossian, lay on the path in the pale sunshine. He had lain there all the
      morning since his master went up by the early train. Nearly sixteen years
      old, he was deaf now and disillusioned, and every time that Summerhay left
      him, his eyes seemed to say: &ldquo;You will leave me once too often!&rdquo; The
      blandishments of the other nice people about the house were becoming to
      him daily less and less a substitute for that which he felt he had not
      much time left to enjoy; nor could he any longer bear a stranger within
      the gate. From her window, Gyp saw him get up and stand with his back
      ridged, growling at the postman, and, fearing for the man's calves, she
      hastened out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the letters was one in that dreaded hand writing marked &ldquo;Immediate,&rdquo;
       and forwarded from his chambers. She took it up, and put it to her nose. A
      scent&mdash;of what? Too faint to say. Her thumb nails sought the edge of
      the flap on either side. She laid the letter down. Any other letter, but
      not that&mdash;she wanted to open it too much. Readdressing it, she took
      it out to put with the other letters. And instantly the thought went
      through her: 'What a pity! If I read it, and there was nothing!' All her
      restless, jealous misgivings of months past would then be set at rest! She
      stood, uncertain, with the letter in her hand. Ah&mdash;but if there WERE
      something! She would lose at one stroke her faith in him, and her faith in
      herself&mdash;not only his love but her own self-respect. She dropped the
      letter on the table. Could she not take it up to him herself? By the three
      o'clock slow train, she could get to him soon after five. She looked at
      her watch. She would just have time to walk down. And she ran upstairs.
      Little Gyp was sitting on the top stair&mdash;her favourite seat&mdash;looking
      at a picture-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going up to London, darling. Tell Betty I may be back to-night, or
      perhaps I may not. Give me a good kiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Gyp gave the good kiss, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see you put your hat on, Mum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Gyp was putting on hat and furs, she thought: &ldquo;I shan't take a bag;
      I can always make shift at Bury Street if&mdash;&rdquo; She did not finish the
      thought, but the blood came up in her cheeks. &ldquo;Take care of Ossy,
      darling!&rdquo; She ran down, caught up the letter, and hastened away to the
      station. In the train, her cheeks still burned. Might not this first visit
      to his chambers be like her old first visit to the little house in
      Chelsea? She took the letter out. How she hated that large, scrawly
      writing for all the thoughts and fears it had given her these past months!
      If that girl knew how much anxiety and suffering she had caused, would she
      stop writing, stop seeing him? And Gyp tried to conjure up her face, that
      face seen only for a minute, and the sound of that clipped, clear voice
      but once heard&mdash;the face and voice of one accustomed to have her own
      way. No! It would only make her go on all the more. Fair game, against a
      woman with no claim&mdash;but that of love. Thank heaven she had not taken
      him away from any woman&mdash;unless&mdash;that girl perhaps thought she
      had! Ah! Why, in all these years, had she never got to know his secrets,
      so that she might fight against what threatened her? But would she have
      fought? To fight for love was degrading, horrible! And yet&mdash;if one
      did not? She got up and stood at the window of her empty carriage. There
      was the river&mdash;and there&mdash;yes, the very backwater where he had
      begged her to come to him for good. It looked so different, bare and
      shorn, under the light grey sky; the willows were all polled, the reeds
      cut down. And a line from one of his favourite sonnets came into her mind:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Ah, well! Time enough to face things when they came. She would only think
      of seeing him! And she put the letter back to burn what hole it liked in
      the pocket of her fur coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train was late; it was past five, already growing dark, when she
      reached Paddington and took a cab to the Temple. Strange to be going there
      for the first time&mdash;not even to know exactly where Harcourt Buildings
      were. At Temple Lane, she stopped the cab and walked down that narrow,
      ill-lighted, busy channel into the heart of the Great Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up those stone steps, miss; along the railin', second doorway.&rdquo; Gyp came
      to the second doorway and in the doubtful light scrutinized the names.
      &ldquo;Summerhay&mdash;second floor.&rdquo; She began to climb the stairs. Her heart
      beat fast. What would he say? How greet her? Was it not absurd, dangerous,
      to have come? He would be having a consultation perhaps. There would be a
      clerk or someone to beard, and what name could she give? On the first
      floor she paused, took out a blank card, and pencilled on it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Can I see you a minute?&mdash;G.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then, taking a long breath to quiet her heart, she went on up. There was
      the name, and there the door. She rang&mdash;no one came; listened&mdash;could
      hear no sound. All looked so massive and bleak and dim&mdash;the iron
      railings, stone stairs, bare walls, oak door. She rang again. What should
      she do? Leave the letter? Not see him after all&mdash;her little romance
      all come to naught&mdash;just a chilly visit to Bury Street, where perhaps
      there would be no one but Mrs. Markey, for her father, she knew, was at
      Mildenham, hunting, and would not be up till Sunday! And she thought:
      'I'll leave the letter, go back to the Strand, have some tea, and try
      again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She took out the letter, with a sort of prayer pushed it through the slit
      of the door, heard it fall into its wire cage; then slowly descended the
      stairs to the outer passage into Temple Lane. It was thronged with men and
      boys, at the end of the day's work. But when she had nearly reached the
      Strand, a woman's figure caught her eye. She was walking with a man on the
      far side; their faces were turned toward each other. Gyp heard their
      voices, and, faint, dizzy, stood looking back after them. They passed
      under a lamp; the light glinted on the woman's hair, on a trick of
      Summerhay's, the lift of one shoulder, when he was denying something; she
      heard his voice, high-pitched. She watched them cross, mount the stone
      steps she had just come down, pass along the railed stone passage, enter
      the doorway, disappear. And such horror seized on her that she could
      hardly walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!&rdquo; So it went in her mind&mdash;a kind of moaning,
      like that of a cold, rainy wind through dripping trees. What did it mean?
      Oh, what did it mean? In this miserable tumult, the only thought that did
      not come to her was that of going back to his chambers. She hurried away.
      It was a wonder she was not run over, for she had no notion what she was
      doing, where going, and crossed the streets without the least attention to
      traffic. She came to Trafalgar Square, and stood leaning against its
      parapet in front of the National Gallery. Here she had her first coherent
      thought: So that was why his chambers had been empty! No clerk&mdash;no
      one! That they might be alone. Alone, where she had dreamed of being alone
      with him! And only that morning he had kissed her and said, &ldquo;Good-bye,
      treasure!&rdquo; A dreadful little laugh got caught in her throat, confused with
      a sob. Why&mdash;why had she a heart? Down there, against the plinth of
      one of the lions, a young man leaned, with his arms round a girl, pressing
      her to him. Gyp turned away from the sight and resumed her miserable
      wandering. She went up Bury Street. No light; not any sign of life! It did
      not matter; she could not have gone in, could not stay still, must walk!
      She put up her veil to get more air, feeling choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trees of the Green Park, under which she was passing now, had still a
      few leaves, and they gleamed in the lamplight copper-coloured as that
      girl's hair. All sorts of torturing visions came to her. Those empty
      chambers! She had seen one little minute of their intimacy. A hundred
      kisses might have passed between them&mdash;a thousand words of love! And
      he would lie to her. Already he had acted a lie! She had not deserved
      that. And this sense of the injustice done her was the first relief she
      felt&mdash;this definite emotion of a mind clouded by sheer misery. She
      had not deserved that he should conceal things from her. She had not had
      one thought or look for any man but him since that night down by the sea,
      when he came to her across the garden in the moonlight&mdash;not one
      thought&mdash;and never would! Poor relief enough! She was in Hyde Park
      now, wandering along a pathway which cut diagonally across the grass. And
      with more resolution, more purpose, she began searching her memory for
      signs, proofs of WHEN he had changed to her. She could not find them. He
      had not changed in his ways to her; not at all. Could one act love, then?
      Act passion, or&mdash;horrible thought!&mdash;when he kissed her nowadays,
      was he thinking of that girl?
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard the rustling of leaves behind. A youth was following her along
      the path, some ravening youth, whose ungoverned breathing had a kind of
      pathos in it. Heaven! What irony! She was too miserable to care, hardly
      even knew when, in the main path again, she was free from his pursuit.
      Love! Why had it such possession of her, that a little thing&mdash;yes, a
      little thing&mdash;only the sight of him with another, should make her
      suffer so? She came out on the other side of the park. What should she do?
      Crawl home, creep into her hole, and lie there stricken! At Paddington she
      found a train just starting and got in. There were other people in the
      carriage, business men from the city, lawyers, from that&mdash;place where
      she had been. And she was glad of their company, glad of the crackle of
      evening papers and stolid faces giving her looks of stolid interest from
      behind them, glad to have to keep her mask on, afraid of the violence of
      her emotion. But one by one they got out, to their cars or their
      constitutionals, and she was left alone to gaze at darkness and the
      deserted river just visible in the light of a moon smothered behind the
      sou'westerly sky. And for one wild moment she thought: 'Shall I open the
      door and step out&mdash;one step&mdash;peace!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried away from the station. It was raining, and she drew up her
      veil to feel its freshness on her hot face. There was just light enough
      for her to see the pathway through the beech clump. The wind in there was
      sighing, soughing, driving the dark boughs, tearing off the leaves, little
      black wet shapes that came whirling at her face. The wild melancholy in
      that swaying wood was too much for Gyp; she ran, thrusting her feet
      through the deep rustling drifts of leaves not yet quite drenched. They
      clung all wet round her thin stockings, and the rainy wind beat her
      forehead. At the edge, she paused for breath, leaning against the bole of
      a beech, peering back, where the wild whirling wind was moaning and
      tearing off the leaves. Then, bending her head to the rain, she went on in
      the open, trying to prepare herself to show nothing when she reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got in and upstairs to her room, without being seen. If she had
      possessed any sedative drug she would have taken it. Anything to secure
      oblivion from this aching misery! Huddling before the freshly lighted
      fire, she listened to the wind driving through the poplars; and once more
      there came back to her the words of that song sung by the Scottish girl at
      Fiorsen's concert:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And my heart reft of its own sun,
      Deep lies in death-torpor cold and grey.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Presently she crept into bed, and at last fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She woke next morning with the joyful thought: 'It's Saturday; he'll be
      down soon after lunch!' And then she remembered. Ah, no! It was too much!
      At the pang of that remembrance, it was as if a devil entered into her&mdash;a
      devil of stubborn pride, which grew blacker with every hour of that
      morning. After lunch, that she might not be in when he came, she ordered
      her mare, and rode up on the downs alone. The rain had ceased, but the
      wind still blew strong from the sou'west, and the sky was torn and driven
      in swathes of white and grey to north, south, east, and west, and puffs of
      what looked like smoke scurried across the cloud banks and the
      glacier-blue rifts between. The mare had not been out the day before, and
      on the springy turf stretched herself in that thoroughbred gallop which
      bears a rider up, as it were, on air, till nothing but the thud of hoofs,
      the grass flying by, the beating of the wind in her face betrayed to Gyp
      that she was moving. For full two miles they went without a pull, only
      stopped at last by the finish of the level. From there, one could see far&mdash;away
      over to Wittenham Clumps across the Valley, and to the high woods above
      the river in the east&mdash;away, in the south and west, under that
      strange, torn sky, to a whole autumn land, of whitish grass, bare fields,
      woods of grey and gold and brown, fast being pillaged. But all that sweep
      of wind, and sky, freshness of rain, and distant colour could not drive
      out of Gyp's heart the hopeless aching and the devil begotten of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII
    </p>
    <p>
      There are men who, however well-off&mdash;either in money or love&mdash;must
      gamble. Their affections may be deeply rooted, but they cannot repulse
      fate when it tantalizes them with a risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay, who loved Gyp, was not tired of her either physically or
      mentally, and even felt sure he would never tire, had yet dallied for
      months with this risk which yesterday had come to a head. And now, taking
      his seat in the train to return to her, he felt unquiet; and since he
      resented disquietude, he tried defiantly to think of other things, but he
      was very unsuccessful. Looking back, it was difficult for him to tell when
      the snapping of his defences had begun. A preference shown by one
      accustomed to exact preference is so insidious. The girl, his cousin, was
      herself a gambler. He did not respect her as he respected Gyp; she did not
      touch him as Gyp touched him, was not&mdash;no, not half&mdash;so deeply
      attractive; but she had&mdash;confound her! the power of turning his head
      at moments, a queer burning, skin-deep fascination, and, above all, that
      most dangerous quality in a woman&mdash;the lure of an imperious vitality.
      In love with life, she made him feel that he was letting things slip by.
      And since to drink deep of life was his nature, too&mdash;what chance had
      he of escape? Far-off cousinhood is a dangerous relationship. Its
      familiarity is not great enough to breed contempt, but sufficient to
      remove those outer defences to intimacy, the conquest of which, in other
      circumstances, demands the conscious effort which warns people whither
      they are going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay had not realized the extent of the danger, but he had known that
      it existed, especially since Scotland. It would be interesting&mdash;as
      the historians say&mdash;to speculate on what he would have done, if he
      could have foretold what would happen. But he had certainly not foretold
      the crisis of yesterday evening. He had received a telegram from her at
      lunch-time, suggesting the fulfilment of a jesting promise, made in
      Scotland, that she should have tea with him and see his chambers&mdash;a
      small and harmless matter. Only, why had he dismissed his clerk so early?
      That is the worst of gamblers&mdash;they will put a polish on the risks
      they run. He had not reckoned, perhaps, that she would look so pretty,
      lying back in his big Oxford chair, with furs thrown open so that her
      white throat showed, her hair gleaming, a smile coming and going on her
      lips; her white hand, with polished nails, holding that cigarette; her
      brown eyes, so unlike Gyp's, fixed on him; her slim foot with high instep
      thrust forward in transparent stocking. Not reckoned that, when he bent to
      take her cup, she would put out her hands, draw his head down, press her
      lips to his, and say: &ldquo;Now you know!&rdquo; His head had gone round, still went
      round, thinking of it! That was all. A little matter&mdash;except that, in
      an hour, he would be meeting the eyes of one he loved much more. And yet&mdash;the
      poison was in his blood; a kiss so cut short&mdash;by what&mdash;what
      counter impulse?&mdash;leaving him gazing at her without a sound, inhaling
      that scent of hers&mdash;something like a pine wood's scent, only sweeter,
      while she gathered up her gloves, fastened her furs, as if it had been he,
      not she, who had snatched that kiss. But her hand had pressed his arm
      against her as they went down the stairs. And getting into her cab at the
      Temple Station, she had looked back at him with a little half-mocking
      smile of challenge and comradeship and promise. The link would be hard to
      break&mdash;even if he wanted to. And yet nothing would come of it!
      Heavens, no! He had never thought! Marriage! Impossible! Anything else&mdash;even
      more impossible! When he got back to his chambers, he had found in the box
      the letter, which her telegram had repeated, readdressed by Gyp from the
      Red House. And a faint uneasiness at its having gone down there passed
      through him. He spent a restless evening at the club, playing cards and
      losing; sat up late in his chambers over a case; had a hard morning's
      work, and only now that he was nearing Gyp, realized how utterly he had
      lost the straightforward simplicity of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the house and found that she had gone out riding alone,
      his uneasiness increased. Why had she not waited as usual for him to ride
      with her? And he paced up and down the garden, where the wind was
      melancholy in the boughs of the walnut-tree that had lost all its leaves.
      Little Gyp was out for her walk, and only poor old Ossy kept him company.
      Had she not expected him by the usual train? He would go and try to find
      out. He changed and went to the stables. Old Pettance was sitting on a
      corn-bin, examining an aged Ruff's Guide, which contained records of his
      long-past glory, scored under by a pencil: &ldquo;June Stakes: Agility. E.
      Pettance 3rd.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tidport Selling H'Cap: Dorothea, E. Pettance, o.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Salisbury Cup: Also ran Plum Pudding, E. Pettance,&rdquo; with other triumphs.
      He got up, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-afternoon, sir; windy afternoon, sir. The mistress 'as been gone out
      over two hours, sir. She wouldn't take me with 'er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurry up, then, and saddle Hotspur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; very good, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over two hours! He went up on to the downs, by the way they generally came
      home, and for an hour he rode, keeping a sharp lookout for any sign of
      her. No use; and he turned home, hot and uneasy. On the hall table were
      her riding-whip and gloves. His heart cleared, and he ran upstairs. She
      was doing her hair and turned her head sharply as he entered. Hurrying
      across the room he had the absurd feeling that she was standing at bay.
      She drew back, bent her face away from him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Don't pretend! Anything's better than pretence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had never seen her look or speak like that&mdash;her face so hard, her
      eyes so stabbing! And he recoiled dumbfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Gyp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Only&mdash;don't pretend!&rdquo; And, turning to the glass, she went
      on twisting and coiling up her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked lovely, flushed from her ride in the wind, and he had a longing
      to seize her in his arms. But her face stopped him. With fear and a sort
      of anger, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might explain, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An evil little smile crossed her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU can do that. I am in the dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't in the least understand what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you?&rdquo; There was something deadly in her utter disregard of him,
      while her fingers moved swiftly about her dark, shining hair&mdash;something
      so appallingly sudden in this hostility that Summerhay felt a peculiar
      sensation in his head, as if he must knock it against something. He sat
      down on the side of the bed. Was it that letter? But how? It had not been
      opened. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth has happened, Gyp, since I went up yesterday? Speak out,
      and don't keep me like this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't pretend that you're upset because you can't kiss me! Don't be
      false, Bryan! You know it's been pretence for months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay's voice grew high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you've gone mad. I don't know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do. Did you get a letter yesterday marked 'Immediate'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! So it WAS that! To meet the definite, he hardened, and said
      stubbornly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; from Diana Leyton. Do you object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; only, how do you think it got back to you from here so quickly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said dully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. By post, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I put it in your letter-box myself&mdash;at half-past five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay's mind was trained to quickness, and the full significance of
      those words came home to him at once. He stared at her fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you saw us, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up, made a helpless movement, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gyp, don't! Don't be so hard! I swear by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp gave a little laugh, turned her back, and went on coiling at her hair.
      And again that horrid feeling that he must knock his head against
      something rose in Summerhay. He said helplessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only gave her tea. Why not? She's my cousin. It's nothing! Why should
      you think the worst of me? She asked to see my chambers. Why not? I
      couldn't refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your EMPTY chambers? Don't, Bryan&mdash;it's pitiful! I can't bear to
      hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that lash of the whip, Summerhay turned and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It pleases you to think the worst, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp stopped the movement of her fingers and looked round at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've always told you you were perfectly free. Do you think I haven't felt
      it going on for months? There comes a moment when pride revolts&mdash;that's
      all. Don't lie to me, PLEASE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not in the habit of lying.&rdquo; But still he did not go. That awful
      feeling of encirclement, of a net round him, through which he could not
      break&mdash;a net which he dimly perceived even in his resentment to have
      been spun by himself, by that cursed intimacy, kept from her all to no
      purpose&mdash;beset him more closely every minute. Could he not make her
      see the truth, that it was only her he REALLY loved? And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp, I swear to you there's nothing but one kiss, and that was not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shudder went through her from head to foot; she cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went up to her, put his hands on her shoulders, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only you I really love. I swear it! Why don't you believe me? You
      must believe me. You can't be so wicked as not to. It's foolish&mdash;foolish!
      Think of our life&mdash;think of our love&mdash;think of all&mdash;&rdquo; Her
      face was frozen; he loosened his grasp of her, and muttered: &ldquo;Oh, your
      pride is awful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's all I've got. Lucky for you I have it. You can go to her when
      you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to her! It's absurd&mdash;I couldn't&mdash;If you wish, I'll never see
      her again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned away to the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't! What IS the use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is harder for one whom life has always spoiled than to find his
      best and deepest feelings disbelieved in. At that moment, Summerhay meant
      absolutely what he said. The girl was nothing to him! If she was pursuing
      him, how could he help it? And he could not make Gyp believe it! How
      awful! How truly terrible! How unjust and unreasonable of her! And why?
      What had he done that she should be so unbelieving&mdash;should think him
      such a shallow scoundrel? Could he help the girl's kissing him? Help her
      being fond of him? Help having a man's nature? Unreasonable, unjust,
      ungenerous! And giving her a furious look, he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down to his study, flung himself on the sofa and turned his face
      to the wall. Devilish! But he had not been there five minutes before his
      anger seemed childish and evaporated into the chill of deadly and
      insistent fear. He was perceiving himself up against much more than a mere
      incident, up against her nature&mdash;its pride and scepticism&mdash;yes&mdash;and
      the very depth and singleness of her love. While she wanted nothing but
      him, he wanted and took so much else. He perceived this but dimly, as part
      of that feeling that he could not break through, of the irritable longing
      to put his head down and butt his way out, no matter what the obstacles.
      What was coming? How long was this state of things to last? He got up and
      began to pace the room, his hands clasped behind him, his head thrown
      back; and every now and then he shook that head, trying to free it from
      this feeling of being held in chancery. And then Diana! He had said he
      would not see her again. But was that possible? After that kiss&mdash;after
      that last look back at him! How? What could he say&mdash;do? How break so
      suddenly? Then, at memory of Gyp's face, he shivered. Ah, how wretched it
      all was! There must be some way out&mdash;some way! Surely some way out!
      For when first, in the wood of life, fatality halts, turns her dim dark
      form among the trees, shows her pale cheek and those black eyes of hers,
      shows with awful swiftness her strange reality&mdash;men would be fools
      indeed who admitted that they saw her!

      Gyp stayed in her room doing little things&mdash;as a woman will when she
      is particularly wretched&mdash;sewing pale ribbons into her garments,
      polishing her rings. And the devil that had entered into her when she woke
      that morning, having had his fling, slunk away, leaving the old bewildered
      misery. She had stabbed her lover with words and looks, felt pleasure in
      stabbing, and now was bitterly sad. What use&mdash;what satisfaction? How
      by vengeful prickings cure the deep wound, disperse the canker in her
      life? How heal herself by hurting him whom she loved so? If he came up
      again now and made but a sign, she would throw herself into his arms. But
      hours passed, and he did not come, and she did not go down&mdash;too truly
      miserable. It grew dark, but she did not draw the curtains; the sight of
      the windy moonlit garden and the leaves driving across brought a
      melancholy distraction. Little Gyp came in and prattled. There was a tree
      blown down, and she had climbed on it; they had picked up two baskets of
      acorns, and the pigs had been so greedy; and she had been blown away, so
      that Betty had had to run after her. And Baryn was walking in the study;
      he was so busy he had only given her one kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was gone, Gyp opened the window and let the wind full into her
      face. If only it would blow out of her heart this sickening sense that all
      was over, no matter how he might pretend to love her out of pity! In a
      nature like hers, so doubting and self-distrustful, confidence, once
      shaken to the roots, could never be restored. A proud nature that went all
      lengths in love could never be content with a half-love. She had been born
      too doubting, proud, and jealous, yet made to love too utterly. She&mdash;who
      had been afraid of love, and when it came had fought till it swept her
      away; who, since then, had lived for love and nothing else, who gave all,
      and wanted all&mdash;knew for certain and for ever that she could not have
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; he had said! Nothing! That for months he had been
      thinking at least a little of another woman besides herself. She believed
      what he had told her, that there had been no more than a kiss&mdash;but
      was it nothing that they had reached that kiss? This girl&mdash;this
      cousin&mdash;who held all the cards, had everything on her side&mdash;the
      world, family influence, security of life; yes, and more, so terribly much
      more&mdash;a man's longing for the young and unawakened. This girl he
      could marry! It was this thought which haunted her. A mere momentary
      outbreak of man's natural wildness she could forgive and forget&mdash;oh,
      yes! It was the feeling that it was a girl, his own cousin, besieging him,
      dragging him away, that was so dreadful. Ah, how horrible it was&mdash;how
      horrible! How, in decent pride, keep him from her, fetter him?
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard him come up to his dressing-room, and while he was still there,
      stole out and down. Life must go on, the servants be hoodwinked, and so
      forth. She went to the piano and played, turning the dagger in her heart,
      or hoping forlornly that music might work some miracle. He came in
      presently and stood by the fire, silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner, with the talk needful to blinding the household&mdash;for what is
      more revolting than giving away the sufferings of the heart?&mdash;was
      almost unendurable and directly it was over, they went, he to his study,
      she back to the piano. There she sat, ready to strike the notes if anyone
      came in; and tears fell on the hands that rested in her lap. With all her
      soul she longed to go and clasp him in her arms and cry: &ldquo;I don't care&mdash;I
      don't care! Do what you like&mdash;go to her&mdash;if only you'll love me
      a little!&rdquo; And yet to love&mdash;a LITTLE! Was it possible? Not to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      In sheer misery she went upstairs and to bed. She heard him come up and go
      into his dressing-room&mdash;and, at last, in the firelight saw him
      kneeling by her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised herself and threw her arms round him. Such an embrace a
      drowning woman might have given. Pride and all were abandoned in an effort
      to feel him close once more, to recover the irrecoverable past. For a long
      time she listened to his pleading, explanations, justifications, his
      protestations of undying love&mdash;strange to her and painful, yet so
      boyish and pathetic. She soothed him, clasping his head to her breast,
      gazing out at the flickering fire. In that hour, she rose to a height
      above herself. What happened to her own heart did not matter so long as he
      was happy, and had all that he wanted with her and away from her&mdash;if
      need be, always away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, when he had gone to sleep, a terrible time began; for in the small
      hours, when things are at their worst, she could not keep back her
      weeping, though she smothered it into the pillow. It woke him, and all
      began again; the burden of her cry: &ldquo;It's gone!&rdquo; the burden of his: &ldquo;It's
      NOT&mdash;can't you see it isn't?&rdquo; Till, at last, that awful feeling that
      he must knock his head against the wall made him leap up and tramp up and
      down like a beast in a cage&mdash;the cage of the impossible. For, as in
      all human tragedies, both were right according to their natures. She gave
      him all herself, wanted all in return, and could not have it. He wanted
      her, the rest besides, and no complaining, and could not have it. He did
      not admit impossibility; she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last came another of those pitying lulls till he went to sleep in her
      arms. Long she lay awake, staring at the darkness, admitting despair,
      trying to find how to bear it, not succeeding. Impossible to cut his other
      life away from him&mdash;impossible that, while he lived it, this girl
      should not be tugging him away from her. Impossible to watch and question
      him. Impossible to live dumb and blind, accepting the crumbs left over,
      showing nothing. Would it have been better if they had been married? But
      then it might have been the same&mdash;reversed; perhaps worse! The roots
      were so much deeper than that. He was not single-hearted and she was. In
      spite of all that he said, she knew he didn't really want to give up that
      girl. How could he? Even if the girl would let him go! And slowly there
      formed within her a gruesome little plan to test him. Then, ever so gently
      withdrawing her arms, she turned over and slept, exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning, remorselessly carrying out that plan, she forced herself to
      smile and talk as if nothing had happened, watching the relief in his
      face, his obvious delight at the change, with a fearful aching in her
      heart. She waited till he was ready to go down, and then, still smiling,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forget all about yesterday, darling. Promise me you won't let it make any
      difference. You must keep up your friendship; you mustn't lose anything. I
      shan't mind; I shall be quite happy.&rdquo; He knelt down and leaned his
      forehead against her waist. And, stroking his hair, she repeated: &ldquo;I shall
      only be happy if you take everything that comes your way. I shan't mind a
      bit.&rdquo; And she watched his face that had lost its trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really mean that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do see that it's nothing, never has been anything&mdash;compared
      with you&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had accepted her crucifixion. A black wave surged into her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be so difficult and awkward for you to give up that intimacy. It
      would hurt your cousin so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw the relief deepen in his face and suddenly laughed. He got up from
      his knees and stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Gyp, for God's sake don't begin again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she went on laughing; then, with a sob, turned away and buried her
      face in her hands. To all his prayers and kisses she answered nothing, and
      breaking away from him, she rushed toward the door. A wild thought
      possessed her. Why go on? If she were dead, it would be all right for him,
      quiet&mdash;peaceful, quiet&mdash;for them all! But he had thrown himself
      in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyp, for heaven's sake! I'll give her up&mdash;of course I'll give her
      up. Do&mdash;do&mdash;be reasonable! I don't care a finger-snap for her
      compared with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And presently there came another of those lulls that both were beginning
      to know were mere pauses of exhaustion. They were priceless all the same,
      for the heart cannot go on feeling at that rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sunday morning, the church-bells ringing, no wind, a lull in the
      sou'westerly gale&mdash;one of those calms that fall in the night and
      last, as a rule, twelve or fifteen hours, and the garden all strewn with
      leaves of every hue, from green spotted with yellow to deep copper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summerhay was afraid; he kept with her all the morning, making all sorts
      of little things to do in her company. But he gradually lost his fear, she
      seemed so calm now, and his was a nature that bore trouble badly, ever
      impatient to shake it off. And then, after lunch, the spirit-storm beat up
      again, with a swiftness that showed once more how deceptive were those
      lulls, how fearfully deep and lasting the wound. He had simply asked her
      whether he should try to match something for her when he went up,
      to-morrow. She was silent a moment, then answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, thanks; you'll have other things to do; people to see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of her voice, the expression on her face showed him, with a fresh
      force of revelation, what paralysis had fallen on his life. If he could
      not reconvince her of his love, he would be in perpetual fear&mdash;that
      he might come back and find her gone, fear that she might even do
      something terrible to herself. He looked at her with a sort of horror,
      and, without a word, went out of the room. The feeling that he must hit
      his head against something was on him once more, and once more he sought
      to get rid of it by tramping up and down. Great God! Such a little thing,
      such fearful consequences! All her balance, her sanity almost, destroyed.
      Was what he had done so very dreadful? He could not help Diana loving him!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the night, Gyp had said: &ldquo;You are cruel. Do you think there is any man
      in the world that I wouldn't hate the sight of if I knew that to see him
      gave you a moment's pain?&rdquo; It was true&mdash;he felt it was true. But one
      couldn't hate a girl simply because she loved you; at least he couldn't&mdash;not
      even to save Gyp pain. That was not reasonable, not possible. But did that
      difference between a man and a woman necessarily mean that Gyp loved him
      so much more than he loved her? Could she not see things in proportion?
      See that a man might want, did want, other friendships, even passing
      moments of passion, and yet could love her just the same? She thought him
      cruel, called him cruel&mdash;what for? Because he had kissed a girl who
      had kissed him; because he liked talking to her, and&mdash;yes, might even
      lose his head with her. But cruel! He was not! Gyp would always be first
      with him. He must MAKE her see&mdash;but how? Give up everything? Give up&mdash;Diana?
      (Truth is so funny&mdash;it will out even in a man's thoughts!) Well, and
      he could! His feeling was not deep&mdash;that was God's truth! But it
      would be difficult, awkward, brutal to give her up completely! It could be
      done, though, sooner than that Gyp should think him cruel to her. It could
      be&mdash;should be done!
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, would it be any use? Would she believe? Would she not always now be
      suspecting him when he was away from her, whatever he did? Must he then
      sit down here in inactivity? And a gust of anger with her swept him. Why
      should she treat him as if he were utterly unreliable? Or&mdash;was he? He
      stood still. When Diana had put her arms round his neck, he could no more
      have resisted answering her kiss than he could now fly through the window
      and over those poplar trees. But he was not a blackguard, not cruel, not a
      liar! How could he have helped it all? The only way would have been never
      to have answered the girl's first letter, nearly a year ago. How could he
      foresee? And, since then, all so gradual, and nothing, really, or almost
      nothing. Again the surge of anger swelled his heart. She must have read
      the letter which had been under that cursed bust of old Voltaire all those
      months ago. The poison had been working ever since! And in sudden fury at
      that miserable mischance, he drove his fist into the bronze face. The bust
      fell over, and Summerhay looked stupidly at his bruised hand. A silly
      thing to do! But it had quenched his anger. He only saw Gyp's face now&mdash;so
      pitifully unhappy. Poor darling! What could he do? If only she would
      believe! And again he had the sickening conviction that whatever he did
      would be of no avail. He could never get back, was only at the beginning,
      of a trouble that had no end. And, like a rat in a cage, his mind tried to
      rush out of this entanglement now at one end, now at the other. Ah, well!
      Why bruise your head against walls? If it was hopeless&mdash;let it go!
      And, shrugging his shoulders, he went out to the stables, and told old
      Pettance to saddle Hotspur. While he stood there waiting, he thought:
      'Shall I ask her to come?' But he could not stand another bout of misery&mdash;must
      have rest! And mounting, he rode up towards the downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotspur, the sixteen-hand brown horse, with not a speck of white, that Gyp
      had ridden hunting the day she first saw Summerhay, was nine years old
      now. His master's two faults as a horseman&mdash;a habit of thrusting, and
      not too light hands&mdash;had encouraged his rather hard mouth, and
      something had happened in the stables to-day to put him into a queer
      temper; or perhaps he felt&mdash;as horses will&mdash;the disturbance
      raging within his rider. At any rate, he gave an exhibition of his worst
      qualities, and Summerhay derived perverse pleasure from that waywardness.
      He rode a good hour up there; then, hot, with aching arms&mdash;for the
      brute was pulling like the devil!&mdash;he made his way back toward home
      and entered what little Gyp called &ldquo;the wild,&rdquo; those two rough sedgy
      fields with the linhay in the corner where they joined. There was a gap in
      the hedge-growth of the bank between them, and at this he put Hotspur at
      speed. The horse went over like a bird; and for the first time since
      Diana's kiss Summerhay felt a moment's joy. He turned him round and sent
      him at it again, and again Hotspur cleared it beautifully. But the
      animal's blood was up now. Summerhay could hardly hold him. Muttering:
      &ldquo;Oh, you BRUTE, don't pull!&rdquo; he jagged the horse's mouth. There darted
      into his mind Gyp's word: &ldquo;Cruel!&rdquo; And, viciously, in one of those queer
      nerve-crises that beset us all, he struck the pulling horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were cantering toward the corner where the fields joined, and
      suddenly he was aware that he could no more hold the beast than if a
      steam-engine had been under him. Straight at the linhay Hotspur dashed,
      and Summerhay thought: &ldquo;My God! He'll kill himself!&rdquo; Straight at the old
      stone linhay, covered by the great ivy bush. Right at it&mdash;into it!
      Summerhay ducked his head. Not low enough&mdash;the ivy concealed a beam!
      A sickening crash! Torn backward out of the saddle, he fell on his back in
      a pool of leaves and mud. And the horse, slithering round the linhay
      walls, checked in his own length, unhurt, snorting, frightened, came out,
      turning his wild eyes on his master, who never stirred, then trotted back
      into the field, throwing up his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      X
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at her words, Summerhay went out of the room, Gyp's heart sank. All
      the morning she had tried so hard to keep back her despairing jealousy,
      and now at the first reminder had broken down again. It was beyond her
      strength! To live day after day knowing that he, up in London, was either
      seeing that girl or painfully abstaining from seeing her! And then, when
      he returned, to be to him just what she had been, to show nothing&mdash;would
      it ever be possible? Hardest to bear was what seemed to her the falsity of
      his words, maintaining that he still really loved her. If he did, how
      could he hesitate one second? Would not the very thought of the girl be
      abhorrent to him? He would have shown that, not merely said it among other
      wild things. Words were no use when they contradicted action. She, who
      loved with every bit of her, could not grasp that a man can really love
      and want one woman and yet, at the same time, be attracted by another.
    </p>
    <p>
      That sudden fearful impulse of the morning to make away with herself and
      end it for them both recurred so vaguely that it hardly counted in her
      struggles; the conflict centred now round the question whether life would
      be less utterly miserable if she withdrew from him and went back to
      Mildenham. Life without him? That was impossible! Life with him? Just as
      impossible, it seemed! There comes a point of mental anguish when the
      alternatives between which one swings, equally hopeless, become each so
      monstrous that the mind does not really work at all, but rushes helplessly
      from one to the other, no longer trying to decide, waiting on fate. So in
      Gyp that Sunday afternoon, doing little things all the time&mdash;mending
      a hole in one of his gloves, brushing and applying ointment to old Ossy,
      sorting bills and letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o'clock, knowing little Gyp must soon be back from her walk, and
      feeling unable to take part in gaiety, she went up and put on her hat. She
      turned from contemplation of her face with disgust. Since it was no longer
      the only face for him, what was the use of beauty? She slipped out by the
      side gate and went down toward the river. The lull was over; the
      south-west wind had begun sighing through the trees again, and gorgeous
      clouds were piled up from the horizon into the pale blue. She stood by the
      river watching its grey stream, edged by a scum of torn-off twigs and
      floating leaves, watched the wind shivering through the spoiled
      plume-branches of the willows. And, standing there, she had a sudden
      longing for her father; he alone could help her&mdash;just a little&mdash;by
      his quietness, and his love, by his mere presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away and went up the lane again, avoiding the inn and the
      riverside houses, walking slowly, her head down. And a thought came, her
      first hopeful thought. Could they not travel&mdash;go round the world?
      Would he give up his work for that&mdash;that chance to break the spell?
      Dared she propose it? But would even that be anything more than a
      putting-off? If she was not enough for him now, would she not be still
      less, if his work were cut away? Still, it was a gleam, a gleam in the
      blackness. She came in at the far end of the fields they called &ldquo;the
      wild.&rdquo; A rose-leaf hue tinged the white cloud-banks, which towered away to
      the east beyond the river; and peeping over that mountain-top was the
      moon, fleecy and unsubstantial in the flax-blue sky. It was one of
      nature's moments of wild colour. The oak-trees above the hedgerows had not
      lost their leaves, and in the darting, rain-washed light from the setting
      sun, had a sheen of old gold with heart of ivy-green; the hail-stripped
      beeches flamed with copper; the russet tufts of the ash-trees glowed. And
      past Gyp, a single leaf blown off, went soaring, turning over and over,
      going up on the rising wind, up&mdash;up, higher&mdash;higher into the
      sky, till it was lost&mdash;away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain had drenched the long grass, and she turned back. At the gate
      beside the linhay, a horse was standing. It whinnied. Hotspur, saddled,
      bridled, with no rider! Why? Where&mdash;then? Hastily she undid the
      latch, ran through, and saw Summerhay lying in the mud&mdash;on his back,
      with eyes wide-open, his forehead and hair all blood. Some leaves had
      dropped on him. God! O God! His eyes had no sight, his lips no breath; his
      heart did not beat; the leaves had dropped even on his face&mdash;in the
      blood on his poor head. Gyp raised him&mdash;stiffened, cold as ice! She
      gave one cry, and fell, embracing his dead, stiffened body with all her
      strength, kissing his lips, his eyes, his broken forehead; clasping,
      warming him, trying to pass life into him; till, at last, she, too, lay
      still, her lips on his cold lips, her body on his cold body in the mud and
      the fallen leaves, while the wind crept and rustled in the ivy, and went
      over with the scent of rain. Close by, the horse, uneasy, put his head
      down and sniffed at her, then, backing away, neighed, and broke into a
      wild gallop round the field....
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Pettance, waiting for Summerhay's return to stable-up for the night,
      heard that distant neigh and went to the garden gate, screwing up his
      little eyes against the sunset. He could see a loose horse galloping down
      there in &ldquo;the wild,&rdquo; where no horse should be, and thinking: &ldquo;There now;
      that artful devil's broke away from the guv'nor! Now I'll 'ave to ketch
      'im!&rdquo; he went back, got some oats, and set forth at the best gait of his
      stiff-jointed feet. The old horseman characteristically did not think of
      accidents. The guv'nor had got off, no doubt, to unhitch that heavy gate&mdash;the
      one you had to lift. That 'orse&mdash;he was a masterpiece of mischief!
      His difference with the animal still rankled in a mind that did not easily
      forgive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, he entered the lighted kitchen shaking and gasping,
      tears rolling down his furrowed cheeks into the corners of his gargoyle's
      mouth, and panted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, my Gord! Fetch the farmer&mdash;fetch an 'urdle! O my Gord! Betty, you
      and cook&mdash;I can't get 'er off him. She don't speak. I felt her&mdash;all
      cold. Come on, you sluts&mdash;quick! O my Gord! The poor guv'nor! That
      'orse must 'a' galloped into the linhay and killed him. I've see'd the
      marks on the devil's shoulder where he rubbed it scrapin' round the wall.
      Come on&mdash;come on! Fetch an 'urdle or she'll die there on him in the
      mud. Put the child to bed and get the doctor, and send a wire to London,
      to the major, to come sharp. Oh, blarst you all&mdash;keep your 'eads!
      What's the good o' howlin' and blubberin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the whispering corner of those fields, light from a lantern and the
      moon fell on the old stone linhay, on the ivy and the broken gate, on the
      mud, the golden leaves, and the two quiet bodies clasped together. Gyp's
      consciousness had flown; there seemed no difference between them. And
      presently, over the rushy grass, a procession moved back in the wind and
      the moonlight&mdash;two hurdles, two men carrying one, two women and a man
      the other, and, behind, old Pettance and the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      XI
    </p>
    <p>
      When Gyp recovered a consciousness, whose flight had been mercifully
      renewed with morphia, she was in her bed, and her first drowsy movement
      was toward her mate. With eyes still closed, she turned, as she was wont,
      and put out her hand to touch him before she dozed off again. There was no
      warmth, no substance; through her mind, still away in the mists of
      morphia, the thoughts passed vague and lonely: 'Ah, yes, in London!' And
      she turned on her back. London! Something&mdash;something up there! She
      opened her eyes. So the fire had kept in all night! Someone was in a chair
      there, or&mdash;was she dreaming! And suddenly, without knowing why, she
      began breathing hurriedly in little half-sobbing gasps. The figure moved,
      turned her face in the firelight. Betty! Gyp closed her eyes. An icy sweat
      had broken out all over her. A dream! In a whisper, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The muffled answer came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my darlin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer; then a half-choked, &ldquo;Don't 'ee think&mdash;don't 'ee think!
      Your Daddy'll be here directly, my sweetie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp's eyes, wide open, passed from the firelight and that rocking figure
      to the little chink of light that was hardly light as yet, coming in at
      one corner of the curtain. She was remembering. Her tongue stole out and
      passed over her lips; beneath the bedclothes she folded both her hands
      tight across her heart. Then she was not dead with him&mdash;not dead! Not
      gone back with him into the ground&mdash;not&mdash;And suddenly there
      flickered in her a flame of maniacal hatred. They were keeping her alive!
      A writhing smile forced its way up on to her parched lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betty, I'm so thirsty&mdash;so thirsty. Get me a cup of tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stout form heaved itself from the chair and came toward the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lovey, at once. It'll do you good. That's a brave girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment the door clicked to, Gyp sprang up. Her veins throbbed; her
      whole soul was alive with cunning. She ran to the wardrobe, seized her
      long fur coat, slipped her bare feet into her slippers, wound a piece of
      lace round her head, and opened the door. All dark and quiet! Holding her
      breath, stifling the sound of her feet, she glided down the stairs,
      slipped back the chain of the front door, opened it, and fled. Like a
      shadow she passed across the grass, out of the garden gate, down the road
      under the black dripping trees. The beginning of light was mixing its grey
      hue into the darkness; she could just see her feet among the puddles on
      the road. She heard the grinding and whirring of a motor-car on its top
      gear approaching up the hill, and cowered away against the hedge. Its
      light came searching along, picking out with a mysterious momentary
      brightness the bushes and tree-trunks, making the wet road gleam. Gyp saw
      the chauffeur turn his head back at her, then the car's body passed up
      into darkness, and its tail-light was all that was left to see. Perhaps
      that car was going to the Red House with her father, the doctor, somebody,
      helping to keep her alive! The maniacal hate flared up in her again; she
      flew on. The light grew; a man with a dog came out of a gate she had
      passed, and called &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; She did not turn her head. She had lost her
      slippers, and ran with bare feet, unconscious of stones, or the torn-off
      branches strewing the road, making for the lane that ran right down to the
      river, a little to the left of the inn, the lane of yesterday, where the
      bank was free.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned into the lane; dimly, a hundred or more yards away, she could
      see the willows, the width of lighter grey that was the river. The river&mdash;&ldquo;Away,
      my rolling river!&rdquo;&mdash;the river&mdash;and the happiest hours of all her
      life! If he were anywhere, she would find him there, where he had sung,
      and lain with his head on her breast, and swum and splashed about her;
      where she had dreamed, and seen beauty, and loved him so! She reached the
      bank. Cold and grey and silent, swifter than yesterday, the stream was
      flowing by, its dim far shore brightening slowly in the first break of
      dawn. And Gyp stood motionless, drawing her breath in gasps after her long
      run; her knees trembled; gave way. She sat down on the wet grass, clasping
      her arms round her drawn-up legs, rocking herself to and fro, and her
      loosened hair fell over her face. The blood beat in her ears; her heart
      felt suffocated; all her body seemed on fire, yet numb. She sat, moving
      her head up and down&mdash;as the head of one moves that is gasping her
      last&mdash;waiting for breath&mdash;breath and strength to let go life, to
      slip down into the grey water. And that queer apartness from self, which
      is the property of fever, came on her, so that she seemed to see herself
      sitting there, waiting, and thought: 'I shall see myself dead, floating
      among the reeds. I shall see the birds wondering above me!' And, suddenly,
      she broke into a storm of dry sobbing, and all things vanished from her,
      save just the rocking of her body, the gasping of her breath, and the
      sound of it in her ears. Her boy&mdash;her boy&mdash;and his poor hair!
      &ldquo;Away, my rolling river!&rdquo; Swaying over, she lay face down, clasping at the
      wet grass and the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun rose, laid a pale bright streak along the water, and hid himself
      again. A robin twittered in the willows; a leaf fell on her bare ankle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton, who had been hunting on Saturday, had returned to town on Sunday
      by the evening tram, and gone straight to his club for some supper. There
      falling asleep over his cigar, he had to be awakened when they desired to
      close the club for the night. It was past two when he reached Bury Street
      and found a telegram.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something dreadful happened to Mr. Summerhay. Come quick.&mdash;BETTY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never had he so cursed the loss of his hand as during the time that
      followed, when Markey had to dress, help his master, pack bags, and fetch
      a taxi equipped for so long a journey. At half-past three they started.
      The whole way down, Winton, wrapped in his fur coat, sat a little forward
      on his seat, ready to put his head through the window and direct the
      driver. It was a wild night, and he would not let Markey, whose chest was
      not strong, go outside to act as guide. Twice that silent one, impelled by
      feelings too strong even for his respectful taciturnity, had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll be bad for Miss Gyp, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bad, yes&mdash;terrible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And later:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'you think it means he's dead, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton answered sombrely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows, Markey! We must hope for the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dead! Could Fate be cruel enough to deal one so soft and loving such a
      blow? And he kept saying to himself: &ldquo;Courage. Be ready for the worst. Be
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the figures of Betty and a maid at the open garden gate, in the
      breaking darkness, standing there wringing their hands, were too much for
      his stoicism. Leaping out, he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, woman? Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir! My dear's gone. I left her a moment to get her a cup of tea. And
      she's run out in the cold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton stood for two seconds as if turned to stone. Then, taking Betty by
      the shoulder, he asked quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened to HIM?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Betty could not answer, but the maid said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The horse killed him at that linhay, sir, down in 'the wild.' And the
      mistress was unconscious till quarter of an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which way did she go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out here, sir; the door and the gate was open&mdash;can't tell which
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through Winton flashed one dreadful thought: The river!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn the cab round! Stay in, Markey! Betty and you, girl, go down to 'the
      wild,' and search there at once. Yes? What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The driver was leaning out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As we came up the hill, sir, I see a lady or something in a long dark
      coat with white on her head, against the hedge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right! Drive down again sharp, and use your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At such moments, thought is impossible, and a feverish use of every sense
      takes its place. But of thought there was no need, for the gardens of
      villas and the inn blocked the river at all but one spot. Winton stopped
      the car where the narrow lane branched down to the bank, and jumping out,
      ran. By instinct he ran silently on the grass edge, and Markey, imitating,
      ran behind. When he came in sight of a black shape lying on the bank, he
      suffered a moment of intense agony, for he thought it was just a dark
      garment thrown away. Then he saw it move, and, holding up his hand for
      Markey to stand still, walked on alone, tiptoeing in the grass, his heart
      swelling with a sort of rapture. Stealthily moving round between that
      prostrate figure and the water, he knelt down and said, as best he could,
      for the husk in his throat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp raised her head and stared at him. Her white face, with eyes
      unnaturally dark and large, and hair falling all over it, was strange to
      him&mdash;the face of grief itself, stripped of the wrappings of form. And
      he knew not what to do, how to help or comfort, how to save. He could see
      so clearly in her eyes the look of a wild animal at the moment of its
      capture, and instinct made him say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lost her just as cruelly, Gyp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw the words reach her brain, and that wild look waver. Stretching out
      his arm, he drew her close to him till her cheek was against his, her
      shaking body against him, and kept murmuring:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my sake, Gyp; for my sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, with Markey's aid, he had got her to the cab, they took her, not
      back to the house, but to the inn. She was in high fever, and soon
      delirious. By noon, Aunt Rosamund and Mrs. Markey, summoned by telegram,
      had arrived; and the whole inn was taken lest there should be any noise to
      disturb her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o'clock, Winton was summoned downstairs to the little so-called
      reading-room. A tall woman was standing at the window, shading her eyes
      with the back of a gloved hand. Though they had lived so long within ten
      miles of each other he only knew Lady Summerhay by sight, and he waited
      for the poor woman to speak first. She said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to say; only, I thought I must see you. How is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delirious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood in silence a full minute, before she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor boy! Did you see him&mdash;his forehead?&rdquo; Her lips quivered. &ldquo;I
      will take him back home.&rdquo; And tears rolled, one after the other, slowly
      down her flushed face under her veil. Poor woman! Poor woman! She had
      turned to the window, passing her handkerchief up under the veil, staring
      out at the little strip of darkening lawn, and Winton, too, stared out
      into that mournful daylight. At last, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send you all his things, except&mdash;except anything that might
      help my poor girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it's ended like this! Major Winton, is there anything behind&mdash;were
      they really happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton looked straight at her and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, too happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a quiver, he met those tear-darkened, dilated eyes straining at
      his; with a heavy sigh, she once more turned away, and, brushing her
      handkerchief across her face, drew down her veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not true&mdash;he knew from the mutterings of Gyp's fever&mdash;but
      no one, not even Summerhay's mother, should hear a whisper if he could
      help it. At the door, he murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether my girl will get through, or what she will do after.
      When Fate hits, she hits too hard. And you! Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Summerhay pressed his outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; she said, in a strangled voice. &ldquo;I wish you&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;
       Then, turning abruptly, she hastened away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winton went back to his guardianship upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days that followed, when Gyp, robbed of memory, hung between life
      and death, Winton hardly left her room, that low room with creepered
      windows whence the river could be seen, gliding down under the pale
      November sunshine or black beneath the stars. He would watch it,
      fascinated, as one sometimes watches the relentless sea. He had snatched
      her as by a miracle from that snaky river.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had refused to have a nurse. Aunt Rosamund and Mrs. Markey were skilled
      in sickness, and he could not bear that a strange person should listen to
      those delirious mutterings. His own part of the nursing was just to sit
      there and keep her secrets from the others&mdash;if he could. And he
      grudged every minute away from his post. He would stay for hours, with
      eyes fixed on her face. No one could supply so well as he just that
      coherent thread of the familiar, by which the fevered, without knowing it,
      perhaps find their way a little in the dark mazes where they wander. And
      he would think of her as she used to be&mdash;well and happy&mdash;adopting
      unconsciously the methods of those mental and other scientists whom he
      looked upon as quacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was astonished by the number of inquiries, even people whom he had
      considered enemies left cards or sent their servants, forcing him to the
      conclusion that people of position are obliged to reserve their human
      kindness for those as good as dead. But the small folk touched him daily
      by their genuine concern for her whose grace and softness had won their
      hearts. One morning he received a letter forwarded from Bury Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MAJOR WINTON,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read a paragraph in the paper about poor Mr. Summerhay's death.
      And, oh, I feel so sorry for her! She was so good to me; I do feel it most
      dreadfully. If you think she would like to know how we all feel for her,
      you would tell her, wouldn't you? I do think it's cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very faithfully yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DAPHNE WING.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they knew Summerhay's name&mdash;he had not somehow expected that. He
      did not answer, not knowing what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      During those days of fever, the hardest thing to bear was the sound of her
      rapid whisperings and mutterings&mdash;incoherent phrases that said so
      little and told so much. Sometimes he would cover his ears, to avoid
      hearing of that long stress of mind at which he had now and then glimpsed.
      Of the actual tragedy, her wandering spirit did not seem conscious; her
      lips were always telling the depth of her love, always repeating the dread
      of losing his; except when they would give a whispering laugh, uncanny and
      enchanting, as at some gleam of perfect happiness. Those little laughs
      were worst of all to hear; they never failed to bring tears into his eyes.
      But he drew a certain gruesome comfort from the conclusion slowly forced
      on him, that Summerhay's tragic death had cut short a situation which
      might have had an even more tragic issue. One night in the big chair at
      the side of her bed, he woke from a doze to see her eyes fixed on him.
      They were different; they saw, were her own eyes again. Her lips moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my pet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that dreadful little saying, Winton leaned forward and put his lips to
      her hand, that lay outside the clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he buried?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Widrington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was rather a sigh than a word and, raising his head, Winton saw her
      eyes closed again. Now that the fever had gone, the white transparency of
      her cheeks and forehead against the dark lashes and hair was too
      startling. Was it a living face, or was its beauty that of death?
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over. She was breathing&mdash;asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      XII
    </p>
    <p>
      The return to Mildenham was made by easy stages nearly two months after
      Summerhay's death, on New Year's day&mdash;Mildenham, dark, smelling the
      same, full of ghosts of the days before love began. For little Gyp, more
      than five years old now, and beginning to understand life, this was the
      pleasantest home yet. In watching her becoming the spirit of the place, as
      she herself had been when a child, Gyp found rest at times, a little rest.
      She had not picked up much strength, was shadowy as yet, and if her face
      was taken unawares, it was the saddest face one could see. Her chief
      preoccupation was not being taken unawares. Alas! To Winton, her smile was
      even sadder. He was at his wits' end about her that winter and spring. She
      obviously made the utmost effort to keep up, and there was nothing to do
      but watch and wait. No use to force the pace. Time alone could heal&mdash;perhaps.
      Meanwhile, he turned to little Gyp, so that they became more or less
      inseparable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring came and passed. Physically, Gyp grew strong again, but since their
      return to Mildenham, she had never once gone outside the garden, never
      once spoken of The Red House, never once of Summerhay. Winton had hoped
      that warmth and sunlight would bring some life to her spirit, but it did
      not seem to. Not that she cherished her grief, appeared, rather, to do all
      in her power to forget and mask it. She only had what used to be called a
      broken heart. Nothing to be done. Little Gyp, who had been told that
      &ldquo;Baryn&rdquo; had gone away for ever, and that she must &ldquo;never speak of him for
      fear of making Mum sad,&rdquo; would sometimes stand and watch her mother with
      puzzled gravity. She once remarked uncannily to Winton:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mum doesn't live with us, Grandy; she lives away somewhere, I think. Is
      it with Baryn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton stared, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is, sweetheart; but don't say that to anybody but me. Don't
      ever talk of Baryn to anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know; but where is he, Grandy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could Winton answer? Some imbecility with the words &ldquo;very far&rdquo; in it;
      for he had not courage to broach the question of death, that mystery so
      hopelessly beyond the grasp of children, and of himself&mdash;and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode a great deal with the child, who, like her mother before her, was
      never so happy as in the saddle; but to Gyp he did not dare suggest it.
      She never spoke of horses, never went to the stables, passed all the days
      doing little things about the house, gardening, and sitting at her piano,
      sometimes playing a little, sometimes merely looking at the keys, her
      hands clasped in her lap. This was early in the fateful summer, before any
      as yet felt the world-tremors, or saw the Veil of the Temple rending and
      the darkness beginning to gather. Winton had no vision of the coif above
      the dark eyes of his loved one, nor of himself in a strange brown garb,
      calling out old familiar words over barrack-squares. He often thought: 'If
      only she had something to take her out of herself!'
    </p>
    <p>
      In June he took his courage in both hands and proposed a visit to London.
      To his surprise, she acquiesced without hesitation. They went up in
      Whit-week. While they were passing Widrington, he forced himself to an
      unnatural spurt of talk; and it was not till fully quarter of an hour
      later that, glancing stealthily round his paper, he saw her sitting
      motionless, her face turned to the fields and tears rolling down it. And
      he dared not speak, dared not try to comfort her. She made no sound, the
      muscles of her face no movement; only, those tears kept rolling down. And,
      behind his paper, Winton's eyes narrowed and retreated; his face hardened
      till the skin seemed tight drawn over the bones, and every inch of him
      quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual route from the station to Bury Street was &ldquo;up,&rdquo; and the cab went
      by narrow by-streets, town lanes where the misery of the world is on show,
      where ill-looking men, draggled and over-driven women, and the jaunty
      ghosts of little children in gutters and on doorsteps proclaim, by every
      feature of their clay-coloured faces and every movement of their unfed
      bodies, the post-datement of the millennium; where the lean and smutted
      houses have a look of dissolution indefinitely put off, and there is no
      more trace of beauty than in a sewer. Gyp, leaning forward, looked out, as
      one does after a long sea voyage; Winton felt her hand slip into his and
      squeeze it hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening after dinner&mdash;in the room he had furnished for her
      mother, where the satinwood chairs, the little Jacobean bureau, the old
      brass candelabra were still much as they had been just on thirty years ago&mdash;she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, I've been thinking. Would you mind if I could make a sort of home at
      Mildenham where poor children could come to stay and get good air and
      food? There are such thousands of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strangely moved by this, the first wish he had heard her express since the
      tragedy, Winton took her hand, and, looking at it as if for answer to his
      question, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, are, you strong enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. There's nothing wrong with me now except here.&rdquo; She drew his hand
      to her and pressed it against her heart. &ldquo;What's given, one can't get
      back. I can't help it; I would if I could. It's been so dreadful for you.
      I'm so sorry.&rdquo; Winton made an unintelligible sound, and she went on: &ldquo;If I
      had them to see after, I shouldn't be able to think so much; the more I
      had to do the better. Good for our gipsy-bird, too, to have them there. I
      should like to begin it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton nodded. Anything that she felt could do her good&mdash;anything!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I quite see&mdash;you could use the two old cottages
      to start with, and we can easily run up anything you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only let me do it all, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that touch of her old self, Winton smiled. She should do everything,
      pay for everything, bring a whole street of children down, if it would
      give her any comfort!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rosamund'll help you find 'em,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She's first-rate at all
      that sort of thing.&rdquo; Then, looking at her fixedly, he added: &ldquo;Courage, my
      soul; it'll all come back some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyp forced herself to smile. Watching her, he understood only too well the
      child's saying: &ldquo;Mum lives away somewhere, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, she said, very low:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I wouldn't have been without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting, her hands clasped in her lap, two red spots high in her
      cheeks, her eyes shining strangely, the faint smile still on her lips. And
      Winton, staring with narrowed eyes, thought: 'Love! Beyond measure&mdash;beyond
      death&mdash;it nearly kills. But one wouldn't have been without it. Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later, leaving Gyp with his sister, he went back to Mildenham
      to start the necessary alterations in the cottages. He had told no one he
      was coming, and walked up from the station on a perfect June day, bright
      and hot. When he turned through the drive gate, into the beech-tree
      avenue, the leaf-shadows were thick on the ground, with golden gleams of
      the invincible sunlight thrusting their way through. The grey boles, the
      vivid green leaves, those glistening sun-shafts through the shade
      entranced him, coming from the dusty road. Down in the very middle of the
      avenue, a small, white figure was standing, as if looking out for him. He
      heard a shrill shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Grandy, you've come back&mdash;you've come back! What FUN!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winton took her curls in his hand, and, looking into her face, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my gipsy-bird, will you give me one of these?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Gyp looked at him with flying eyes, and, hugging his legs, answered
      furiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; because I love you. PULL!&rdquo;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
