[<i>A street. A few wayfarers, and a CITY GUARD</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST MAN.<br/>
Ho, Sir!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CITY GUARD.<br/>
What do you want?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND MAN.<br/>
Which way should we go? We are strangers here. Please tell us which street we
should take.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CITY GUARD.<br/>
Where do you want to go?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
THIRD MAN.<br/>
To where those big festivities are going to be held, you know. Which way do we
go?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
CITY GUARD.<br/>
One street is quite as good as another here. Any street will lead you there. Go
straight ahead, and you cannot miss the place. [<i>Exit.</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST MAN.<br/>
Just hear what the fool says: &ldquo;Any street will lead you there!&rdquo;
Where, then, would be the sense of having so many streets?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND MAN.<br/>
You needn&rsquo;t be so awfully put out at that, my man. A country is free to
arrange its affairs in its own way. As for roads in our country&mdash;well,
they are as good as non-existent; narrow and crooked lanes, a labyrinth of ruts
and tracks. Our King does not believe in open thoroughfares; he thinks that
streets are just so many openings for his subjects to fly away from his
kingdom. It is quite the contrary here; nobody stands in your way, nobody
objects to your going elsewhere if you like to; and yet the people are far from
deserting this kingdom. With such streets our country would certainly have been
depopulated in no time.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST MAN.<br/>
My dear Janardan, I have always noticed that this is a great fault in your
character.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
JANARDAN.<br/>
What is?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST MAN.<br/>
That you are always having a fling at your country. How can you think that open
highways may be good for a country? Look here, Kaundilya; here is a man who
actually believes that open highways are the salvation of a country.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KAUNDILYA.<br/>
There is no need, Bhavadatta, of my pointing out afresh that Janardan is
blessed with an intelligence which is remarkably crooked, which is sure to land
him in danger some day. If the King comes to hear of our worthy friend, he will
make it a pretty hard job for him to find any one to do him his funeral rites
when he is dead.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BHAVADATTA.<br/>
One can&rsquo;t help feeling that life becomes a burden in this country; one
misses the joys of privacy in these streets&mdash;this jostling and brushing
shoulders with strange people day and night makes one long for a bath. And
nobody can tell exactly what kind of people you are meeting with in these
public roads&mdash;ugh!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KAUNDILYA.<br/>
And it is Janardan who persuaded us to come to this precious country! We never
had any second person like him in our family. You knew my father, of course; he
was a great man, a pious man if ever there was one. He spent his whole life
within a circle of a radius of 49 cubits drawn with a rigid adherence to the
injunctions of the scriptures, and never for a single day did he cross this
circle. After his death a serious difficulty arose&mdash;how cremate him within
the limits of the 49 cubits and yet outside the house? At length the priests
decided that though we could not go beyond the scriptural number, the only way
out of the difficulty was to reverse the figure and make it 94 cubits; only
thus could we cremate him outside the house without violating the sacred books.
My word, that was strict observance! Ours is indeed no common country.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BHAVADATTA.<br/>
And yet, though Janardan comes from the very same soil, he thinks it wise to
declare that open highways are best for a country.
</p>

<p>
[<i>Enter GRANDFATHER with a band of boys</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
Boys, we will have to vie with the wild breeze of the south to-day&mdash;and we
are not going to be beaten. We will sing till we have flooded all streets with
our mirth and song.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SONG.
</p>

<p>
<i>The southern gate is unbarred. Come, my spring, come!<br/>Thou wilt swing at
the swing of my heart, come, my spring, come!<br/>Come in the lisping leaves,
in the youthful surrender of flowers;<br/>Come in the flute songs and the
wistful sighs of the woodlands!<br/>Let your unfastened robe wildly flap in the
drunken wind!<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, my spring, come! </i>
</p>

<p>
[<i>Exeunt.</i>]
</p>

<p>
[<i>Enter a band of CITIZENS</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
After all, one cannot help wishing that the King had allowed himself to be seen
at least this one day. What a great pity, to live in his kingdom and yet not to
have seen him for a single day!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
If you only knew the real meaning of all this mystery! I could tell you if you
would keep a secret.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
My dear fellow, we both live in the same quarter of the town, but have you ever
known me letting out any man s secret? Of course, that matter of your
brother&rsquo;s finding a hidden fortune while digging for a well&mdash;well,
you know well enough why I had to give it out. You know all the facts.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Of course I know. And it is because I know that I ask, could you keep a secret
if I tell you? It may mean ruination to us all, you know, if you once let it
out.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>
You are a nice man, after all, Virupaksha! Why are you so anxious to bring down
a disaster which as yet only may happen? Who will be responsible for keeping
your secret all his life?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
VIRUPAKSHA.<br/>
It is only because the topic came up&mdash;well, then, I shall not say
anything. I am not the man to say things for nothing. You had yourself brought
up the question that the King never showed himself; and I only remarked that it
was not for nothing that the King shut himself up from the public gaze.

</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
Pray do tell us why, Virupaksha.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
VIRUPAKSHA.<br/>
Of course I don&rsquo;t mind telling you&mdash;for we are all good friends,
aren&rsquo;t we? There can be no harm. (With a low voice.) The
King&mdash;is&mdash;hideous to look at, so he has made up his mind never to
show himself to his subjects.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
Ha! that&rsquo;s it! It must be so. We have always wondered . . . why, the mere
sight of a King in all countries makes one&rsquo;s soul quake like an aspen
leaf with fear; but why should our King never have been seen by any mortal
soul? Even if he at least came out and consigned us all to the gibbet, we might
be sure that our King was no hoax. After all, there is much in
Virupaksha&rsquo;s explanation that sounds plausible enough.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>
Not a bit&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe in a syllable of it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
VIRUPAKSHA.<br/>
What, Vishu, do you mean to say that I am a liar?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
VISHU.<br/>
I don&rsquo;t exactly mean that&mdash;but I cannot accept your theory. Excuse
me, I cannot help if I seem a bit rude or churlish.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
VIRUPAKSHA.<br/>
Small wonder that you can&rsquo;t believe my words&mdash;you who think yourself
sage enough to reject the opinions of your parents and superiors. How long do
you think you could have stayed in this country if the King did not remain in
hiding? You are no better than a flagrant heretic.

</p>

<p class="dialog">
VISHU.<br/>
My dear pillar of orthodoxy! Do you think any other King would have hesitated
to cut off your tongue and make it food for dogs? And you have the face to say
that our King is horrid to look at!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
VIRUPAKSHA.<br/>
Look here, Vishu. will you curb your tongue?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
VISHU.<br/>
It would be superfluous to point out whose tongue needs the curbing.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
Hush, my dear friends&mdash;this looks rather bad. . . . It seems as if they
are resolved to put me in danger as well. I am not going to be a party to all
this.[<i>Exit.</i>]
</p>

<p>
[<i>Enter a number of men, dragging in GRANDFATHER, in boisterous
exuberance</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Grandpa, something strikes me to-day . . .
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
What is it?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
This year every country has sent its people to our festival, but every one
asks, &ldquo;Everything is nice and beautiful&mdash;but where is your
King?&rdquo; and we do not know what to answer. That is the one big gap which
cannot but make itself felt to every one in our country.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
&ldquo;Gap,&rdquo; do you say! Why, the whole country is all filled and crammed
and packed with the King: and you call him a &ldquo;gap&rdquo;! Why,he has made
every one of us a crowned King!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
Sings.<br/>
<i>We are all Kings in the kingdom of our King.<br/>
Were it not so, how could we hope in our heart to meet him!<br/>
We do what we like, yet we do what he likes;<br/>
We are not bound with the chain of fear at the feet of a slave-owning King.<br/>
Were it not so, how could we hope in our heart to meet him!<br/>
Our King honours each one of us, thus honours his own very self.<br/>
No littleness can keep us shut up in its walls of untruth for aye.<br/>
Were it not so, how could we have hope in our heart to meet him!<br/>
We struggle and dig our own path, thus reach his path at the end.<br/>
We can never get lost in the abyss of dark night.<br/>
Were it not so, how could we hope in our heart to meet him!</i>
</p>

<p class="dialog">
THIRD CITIZEN.<br/>
But, really, I cannot stand the absurd things people say about our King simply
because he is not seen in public.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
Just fancy! Any one libelling me can be punished, while nobody can stop the
mouth of any rascal who chooses to slander the King.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
The slander cannot touch the King. With a mere breath you can blow out the
flame which a lamp inherits from the sun, but if all the world blow upon the
sun itself its effulgence remains undimmed and unimpaired as before.
</p>

<p>
[<i>Enter VISHVAVASU and VIRUPAKSHA</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
VISHU.<br/>
Here&rsquo;s Grandfather! Look here, this man is going about telling everybody
that our King does not come out because he is ugly.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
But why does that make you angry, Vishu? His King must be ugly, because how
else could Virupaksha possess such features in his kingdom? He fashions his
King after the image of himself he sees in the mirror.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
VIRUPAKSHA.<br/>
Grandfather, I shall mention no names, but nobody would think of disbelieving
the person who gave me the news.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
Who could be a higher authority than yourself!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
VIRUPAKSHA.<br/>
But I could give you proofs . . .
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST CITIZEN.<br/>
The impudence of this fellow knows no bounds! Not content with spreading a
ghastly rumour with an unabashed face, he offers to measure his lies with
insolence!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Why not make him measure his length on the ground?

</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
Why so much heat, my friends? The poor fellow is going to have his own festive
day by singing the ugliness of his King. Go along, Virupaksha, you will find
plenty of people ready to believe you: may you be happy in their
company.[<i>Exeunt.</i>]
</p>

<p>
[<i>Re-enter the party of FOREIGNERS</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BHAVADATTA.<br/>
It strikes me, Kaundilya, that these people haven&rsquo;t got a King at all.
They have somehow managed to keep the rumour afloat.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KAUNDILYA.<br/>
You are right, I think. We all know that the supreme thing that strikes
one&rsquo;s eye in any country is the King, who of course loses no opportunity
of exhibiting himself.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
JANARDAN.<br/>
But look at the nice order and regularity prevailing all over the
place&mdash;how do you explain it without a King?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
BHAVADATTA.<br/>
So this is the wisdom you have arrived at by living so long under a ruler!
Where would be the necessity of having a King if order and harmony existed
already?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
JANARDAN.<br/>
All these people have assembled to rejoice at this festival. Do you think they
could come together like this in a country of anarchy?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
Rhavadatta.<br/>
My dear Janardan, you are evading the real issue, as usual. There can be no
question about the order and regularity, and the festive rejoicing too is plain
enough: there is no difficulty so far. But where is the King? Have you seen
him? Just tell us that.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
JANARDAN.<br/>
What I want to say is this: you know from your experience that there can be
chaos and anarchy even if a King be present: but what do we see here?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KAUNDILYA.<br/>
You are always coming back to your quibbling. Why can you not give a straight
answer to Bhavadatta&rsquo;s question&mdash;Have you, or have you not, seen the
King? Yes or no? [<i>Exeunt.</i>]

Well! do you believe us now?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
I never said I didn&rsquo;t. That fellow Kumbha started all this fuss. Did I
say a word?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
FIRST HERALD.<br/>
Perhaps, though a pot-bellied man, he is quite empty inside; an empty vessel
sounds most, you know.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND HERALD.<br/>
Who is he? Is he any kinsman of yours?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
Not at all. He is just a cousin of our village chief&rsquo;s father-in-law, and
he does not even live in the same part of our village with us.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND HERALD.<br/>
Just so: he quite looks the seventh cousin of somebody&rsquo;s father-in-law,
and his understanding appears also to bear the stamp of uncle-in-lawhood.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
Alas, my friends, many a bitter sorrow has given my poor mind a twist before it
has become like this. It is only the other day that a King came and paraded the
streets, with as many titles in front of him as the drums that made the town
hideous by their din, . . . What did I not do to serve and please him! I rained
presents on him, I hung about him like a beggar&mdash;and in the end I found
the strain on my resources too hard to bear. But what was the end of all that
pomp and majesty? When people sought grants and presents from him, he could not
somehow discover an auspicious day in the Calendar: though all days were
red-letter days when we had to pay our taxes!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SECOND HERALD.<br/>
Do you mean to insinuate that our King is a bogus King like the one you have
described?

Please, sirs, do not take any offence. I am a poor creature&mdash;my sincerest

away as far as you like.

All right, come here and form a line. The King will come just now&mdash;we
shall go and prepare the way for him. [<i>They go out.</i>]

SECOND CITIZEN.<br/>
My dear Kumbha, your tongue will be your death one day.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
Friend Madhav, it isn&rsquo;t my tongue, it is fate. When the bogus King
appeared I never said a word, though that did not prevent my striking at my own
feet with all the self-confidence of innocence. And now, when perhaps the real
King has come, I simply must blurt out treason. It is fate, my dear friend!

</p>

<p class="dialog">
MADHAV.<br/>
My faith is, to go on obeying the King&mdash;it does not matter whether he is a
real one or a pretender. What do we know of Kings that we should judge them! It
is like throwing stones in the dark&mdash;you are almost sure of hitting your
mark. I go on obeying and acknowledging&mdash;if it is a real King, well and
good: if not, what harm is there?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
I should not have minded if the stones were nothing better than stones. But
they are often precious things: here, as elsewhere, extravagance lands us in
poverty, my friend.
</p>

Look! There comes the King! Ah, a King indeed! What a figure, what a face!
Whoever saw such beauty&mdash;lily-white, creamy-soft! What now, Kumbha? What

KUMBHA.<br/>
He looks all right&mdash;yes, he may be the real King for all I know.

Do not forget me, O King! I am Vivajadatta, the grandson of Udayadatta of
Kushalivastu. I came here at the first report of thy coming&mdash;I did not
stop to hear what people were saying: all the loyalty in me went out towards
thee, O Monarch, and brought me here.

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
I tell you&mdash;he has just passed by this street.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER .<br/>
Is that a very infallible test of Kingship?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
Oh no, he did not pass unobserved: not one or two men but hundreds and
thousands on both sides of the street have seen him with their own eyes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
That is exactly what makes the whole affair suspicious. When ever has our King
set out to dazzle the eyes of the people by pomp and pageantry? He is not the
King to make such a thundering row over his progress through the country.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
But he may just have chosen to do so on this important occasion: you cannot
really tell.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
Oh yes, you can! My King cherishes no weathercock fancy, no fantastic vein.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
But, Grandfather, I wish I could only describe him! So soft, so delicate and
exquisite like a waxen doll! As I looked on him, I yearned to shelter him from
the sun, to protect him with my whole body.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
Fool, O precious ass that you are! My King a waxen doll, and you to protect
him!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
But seriously, Grandpa, he is a superb god, a miracle of beauty: I do not find
a single other figure in this vast assembly that can stand beside his peerless
loveliness.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
If my King chose to make himself shown, your eyes would not have noticed him.
He would not stand out like that amongst others&mdash;he is one of the people,
he mingles with the common populace.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
But did I not tell you I saw his banner?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
What did you see displayed on his banner?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
It had a red <i>Kimshuk</i> flower painted on it&mdash;the bright and
glittering scarlet dazzled my eyes.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
My King has a thunderbolt within a lotus painted on his flag.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
But every one is saying, the King is out in this festival: every one.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
Why, so he is, of course: but he has no heralds, no army, no retinue, no music
bands or lights to accompany him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
So none could recognise him in his incognito, it seems.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
Perhaps there are a few that can.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KUMBHA.<br/>
And those that can recognise him&mdash;does the King grant them whatever they
ask for?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
But they never ask for anything. No beggar will ever know the King. The greater
beggar appears like the King to the eyes of the lesser beggar. O fool, the man

is him whom you are trumpeting as your King! . . . Ah, there comes my mad

[<i>A DarkChamber. QUEEN SUDARSHANA. Her Maid of Honour, SURANGAMA</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Light, light! Where is light? Will the lamp never be lighted in this chamber?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
My Queen, all your other rooms are lighted&mdash;will you never long to escape
from the light into a dark room like this?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
But why should this room be kept dark?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
Because otherwise you would know neither light nor darkness.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Living in this dark room you have grown to speak darkly and strangely&mdash;I
cannot understand you, Surangama. But tell me, in what part of the palace is
this chamber situated? I cannot make out either the entrance or the way out of
this room.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
This room is placed deep down, in the very heart of the earth. The King has
built this room specially for your sake.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Why, he has no dearth of rooms&mdash;why need he have made this chamber of
darkness specially for me?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
You can meet others in the lighted rooms: but only in this dark room can you
meet your lord.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
No, no&mdash;I cannot live without light&mdash;I am restless in this stifling
dark. Surangama, if you can bring a light into this room, I shall give you this
necklace of mine.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
It is not in my power, O Queen. How can I bring light to a place which he would
have kept always dark!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Strange devotion! And yet, is it not true that the King punished your father?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
Yes, that is true. My father used to gamble. All the young men of the country
used to gather at my father&rsquo;s house-and they used to drink and gamble.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
And when the King sent away your father in exile, did it not make you feel
bitterly oppressed?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
Oh, it made me quite furious. I was on the road to ruin and destruction: when
that path was closed for me, I seemed left without any support, without any
succour or shelter. I raged and raved like a wild beast in a cage&mdash;how I
wanted to tear every one to pieces in my powerless anger!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
But how did you get this devotion towards that same King?

</p>

<p class="dialog">
Sarangama .<br/>
How can I tell? Perhaps I could rely and depend on him because he was so hard,
so pitiless!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
When did this change of feeling take place?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
I could not tell you&mdash;I do not know that myself. A day came when all the
rebel in me knew itself beaten, and then my whole nature bowed down in humble
resignation on the dust of the earth. And then I saw . . . I saw that he was as
matchless in beauty as in terror. Oh. I was saved, I was rescued.

</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Tell me, Surangama, I implore you, won&rsquo;t you tell me what is the King
like to look at? I have not seen him yet for a single day. He comes to me in
darkness, and leaves me in this dark room again. How many people have I not
asked&mdash;but they all return vague and dark answers&mdash;it seems to me
that they all keep back something.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
To tell you the truth, Queen, I could not say well what he is like. No&mdash;he
is not what men call handsome.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
You don&rsquo;t say so? Not handsome!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
No, my Queen, he is not handsome. To call him beautiful would be to say far too
little about him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
All your words are like that&mdash;dark, strange, and vague. I cannot
understand what you mean.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
No, I will not call him handsome. And it is because he is not beautiful that he
is so wonderful, so superb, so miraculous!

</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
I do not quite understand you&mdash;though I like to hear you talk about him.
But I must see him at any cost. I do not even remember the day when I was
married to him. I have heard mother say that a wise man came before my marriage
and said, &ldquo;He who will wed your daughter is without a second on this
earth.&rdquo; How often have I asked her to describe his appearance to me, but
she only answers vaguely, and says she cannot say&mdash;she saw him through a
veil, faintly and obscurely. But if he is the best among men, how can I sit
still without seeing him?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
Do you not feel a faint breeze blowing?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
A breeze? Where?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
Do you not smell a soft perfume?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
No, I don&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
The large door has opened . . . he is coming; my King is coming in.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
How can you perceive when he comes?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
I cannot say: I seem to hear his footsteps in my own heart. Being his servant
of this dark chamber, I have developed a sense-I can know and feel without
seeing.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Would that I had this sense too, Surangama!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
You will have it, O Queen . . . this sense will awaken in you one day. Your
longing to have a sight of him makes you restless, and therefore all your mind
is strained and warped in that direction. When you are past this state of
feverish restlessness, everything will become quite easy.

</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
How is it that it is easy to you, who are a servant, and so difficult to me,
the Queen?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
It is because I am a mere servant that no difficulty baulks me. On the first
day, when he left this room to my care, saying, &ldquo;Surangama, you will
always keep this chamber ready for me: this is all your task,&rdquo; then I did
not say, even in thought, &ldquo;Oh, give me the work of those who keep the
other rooms lighted.&rdquo; No, but as soon as I bent all my mind to my task, a
power woke and grew within me, and mastered every part of me unopposed. . . .
Oh, there he comes! . . . he is standing outside, before the door. Lord! O
King!

should I not be the only thing you can feel in this darkness?

But I must see you&mdash;I am longing to have a sight of you.

</p>

<p class="dialog">

You will not be able to bear the sight of me&mdash;it will only give you pain,
poignant and overpowering.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
How can you say that I shall be unable to bear your sight? Oh, I can feel even
in this dark how lovely and wonderful you are: why should I be afraid of you in
the light? But tell me, can you see me in the dark?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KING.<br/>
Yes, I can.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
What do you see?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KING.<br/>
I see that the darkness of the infinite heavens, whirled into life and being by
the power of my love, has drawn the light of a myriad stars into itself, and
incarnated itself in a form of flesh and blood. And in that form, what acons of
thought and striving, untold yearnings of limitless skies, the countless gifts
of unnumbered seasons!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Am I so wonderful, so beautiful? When I hear you speak so, my heart swells with
gladness and pride. But how can I believe the wonderful things you tell me? I
cannot find them in myself!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KING.<br/>
Your own mirror will not reflect them&mdash;it lessens you, limits you, makes
you look small and insignificant. But could you see yourself mirrored in my own
mind, how grand would you appear! In my own heart you are no longer the daily
individual which you think you are&mdash;you are verily my second self.

</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Oh, do show me for an instant how to see with your eyes! Is there nothing at
all like darkness to you? I am afraid when I think of this. This darkness which
is to me real and strong as death&mdash;is this simply nothing to you? Then how
can there be any union at all between us, in a place like this? No, no-it is
impossible: there is a barrier betwixt us two: not here, no, not in this place.
I want to find you and see you where I see trees and animals, birds and stones
and the earth
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KING.<br/>
Very well, you can try to find me&mdash;but none will point me out to you. You
will have to recognise me, if you can, yourself. And even if anybody professes
to show me to you, how can you be sure he is speaking the truth?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
I shall know you; I shall recognise you. I shall find you out among a million
men. I cannot be mistaken.

&ldquo;KING&rdquo;.<br/>
I have. Every one who sees me in the streets flocks after me. When I had a
meagre retinue at first every one regarded me with suspicion, but now with the
increasing crowd their doubts are waning and dissolving. The crowd is being
hypnotised by its own magnitude. I have not got to do anything now.

</p>

<p class="dialog">

That&rsquo;s excellent! From this moment we all promise to help and stand by
you. But you will have to do us one service in return.

Your commands and the crown you are putting on my head will be equally binding

It is a fine thing to argue whether there is a King or not when one is simply
starving for want of food! Will the King save us?

SUDARSHANA.<br/>
You may make mistakes, Rohini, but I cannot be mistaken: am I not the Queen?
That, of course, must be my King.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI.<br/>
He who has conferred such high honour upon you cannot be long in showing
himself to you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
His very form makes me restless like a caged bird. Did you try well to
ascertain who he is?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI.<br/>
Yes, I did. Every one I asked said that he was the King.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
What country is he the King of?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI.<br/>
Our country, King of this land.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Are you sure that you are speaking of him who has a sunshade made of flowers
held over his head?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI.<br/>
The same: he whose flag has the <i>Kimshuk</i> flower painted on it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
I recognised him at once, of course, but it is you who had your doubts.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI.<br/>
We are apt to make mistakes, my Queen, and we are afraid to offend you in case
we are wrong.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Would that Surangama were here! There would remain no room for doubt then.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI.<br/>
Do you think her cleverer than any of us?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Oh no, but she would recognise him instantly.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI.<br/>
I cannot believe that she would. She merely pretends to know him. There is none
to test her knowledge if she professes to know the King. If we were as
shameless as she is, it would not have been difficult for us to boast about our
acquaintance with the King.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
But no, she never boasts.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI .<br/>
It is pure affectation, the whole of it: which often goes a longer way than

like her.

SUDARSHANA.<br/>
But whatever you may say, I should have liked to ask her if she were here.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI.<br/>
Very well, Queen. I shall bring her here. She must be lucky if she is
indispensable for the Queen to know the King.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Oh no&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t for that&mdash;but I would like to hear it said by
every one.

</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
You will not have to say anything&mdash;he will know. He thought that I would
not be able to recognise him: I cannot let him off without showing that I have
found him out. [<i>ROHINI goes out with the flowers.</i>]

</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
My heart is all a-quiver and restless to-night: I have never felt like this
before. The white, silver light of the full moon is flooding the heavens and
brimming over on every side like the bubbling foam of wine, . . . It seizes on
me like a yearning, like a mantling intoxication. Here, who is here?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, living emblems of youthful spring, begin your festive

ears, I know not from where,<br/>And bells in my anklets tremble and jingle in

</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Enough, enough&mdash;I cannot bear it any more! Your song has filled my eyes
with tears. . . . A fancy comes to me&mdash;that desire can never attain its
object&mdash;it need never attain it. What sweet hermit of the woods has taught
you this song? Oh that my eyes could see him whose song my ears have heard! Oh,
how I wish&mdash;I wish I could wander rapt and lovely in the thick woodland
arbours of the heart! Dear boys of the hermitage! how shall I reward you? This
necklace is but made of jewels, hard stones&mdash;its hardness will give you
pain&mdash;I have got nothing like the garlands of flowers you have on. [<i>The

you what happened. I have just realised that no hand can really give the

SUDARSHANA.<br/>
You don&rsquo;t say so? He did not understand
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI.<br/>
No; he sat there like a doll, without uttering a single word. I think he did
not want to show that he understood nothing, so he just held his tongue.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Fie on me! My shamelessness has been justly punished. Why did you not bring
back my flowers?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
ROHINI.<br/>
How could I? The King of Kanchi, a very clever man, who was sitting by him,
took in everything at a glance, and he just smiled a bit and said,
&ldquo;Emperor, the Queen Sudarshana sends your Majesty her greetings with
these blossoms&mdash;the blossoms that belong to the God of Love, the friend of
Spring.&rdquo; The King seemed to awake with a start, and said, &ldquo;This is
the crown of all my regal glory to-night.&rdquo; I was coming back, all out of
countenance, when the King of Kanchi took off this necklace of jewels from the
King&rsquo;s person, and said to me, &ldquo;Friend, the King&rsquo;s garland
gives itself up to you, in return for the happy fortune you have
brought.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
What, Kanchi had to make the King understand all this! Woe is me,
to-night&rsquo;s festival has opened wide for me the doors of ignominy and
shame! What else could I expect? Leave me alone, Rohini; I want solitude for a
time. [<i>ROHINI goes out.</i>] A great blow has shattered my pride to atoms
to-day, and yet . . . I cannot efface from my mind that beautiful, fascinating
figure! No pride is left me-I am beaten, vanquished, utterly helpless. . . . I
cannot even turn away from him. Oh, how the wish comes back to me again and
again&mdash;to ask that garland of Rohini! But what would she think! Rohini!

ROHINI.<br/>
Nothing from you&mdash;but I had my reward from the King as it should be.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
That is no free gift, but an extortion, of reward. I do not like to see you put
on what was given in so indifferent a manner. Take it off&mdash;I give you my
bracelets if you leave it here. Take these bracelets, and go now. [<i>ROHINI

away,&mdash;but I could not! It is pricking me as if it were a garland of

But it is his gift to me: yet I could not fling this garland away! When the

the fire. But no, I could not. My mind whispered, &ldquo;Let that garland be on
you in your death.&rdquo; . . . What fire is this, O King, into which I, who
had come out to see you, leaped like a moth that cannot resist the flame? What
a pain is this, oh, what agony! The fire keeps burning as fiercely as ever, but
I go on living within its flames!

KING.<br/>
But you have seen me at last&mdash;your desire has been fulfilled.

SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Terrible,&mdash;oh, it was terrible! I am afraid even to think of it again.

on thee for one dreadful instant. The blaze of the fire fell on your
features&mdash;you looked like the awful night when a comet swings fearfully
into our ken&mdash;oh, then I closed my eyes&mdash;I could not look on you any
more. Black as the threatening storm-cloud, black as the shoreless sea with the
spectral red tint of twilight on its tumultuous waves!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KING.<br/>
Have I not told you before that one cannot bear my sight unless one is already

myself to you slowly and gradually, not all too sudden.

</p>

<p class="dialog">
KING.<br/>
Will you not even try a little?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
I have been trying since yesterday&mdash;but the more I try, the more

pursued and hounded by the thought that I am impure, that I am false and
faithless.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KING.<br/>
Well then, you can go as far from me as you like.

SUDARSHANA.<br/>

do you not hold me back, hold me by the hair, saying, &ldquo;You shall not
go&rdquo;? Why do you not strike me? Oh, punish me, strike me, beat me with
violent hands! But your unresisting silence makes me wild&mdash;oh, I cannot
bear it!

Whom are you angry with?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
I do not know; but I wish to see everything destroyed and convulsed in ruin and

time. Did I lose my all to sweep the dust, to sweat and slave in this dismal
hole? Why do the torches of mourning not flare up for me all over the world?
Why does not the earth quake and tremble? Is my fall but the unobserved
dropping of the puny bean-flower? Is it not more like the fall of a glowing

You are not alone.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Surangama, I shall not keep anything from you. When he set the palace on fire,
I could not be angry with him. A great inward joy set my heart a-flutter all
the while. What a stupendous crime! What glorious prowess! It was this courage
that made me strong and fired my own spirits. It was this terrible joy that
enabled me to leave everything behind me in a moment&rsquo;s time. But is it
all my imagination only? Why is there no sign of his coming anywhere?

yet have come to take me back? [<i>SURANGAMA remains silent.</i>] You think I
am anxious to go back? Never! Even if the King really came I should not have
returned. Not even once did he forbid me to come away, and I found all the
doors wide open to let me out! And the stony and dusty road over which I
walked&mdash;it was nothing to it that a queen was treading on it. It is hard
and has no feelings, like your King; the meanest beggar is the same to it as
the highest Empress. You are silent! Well, I tell you, your King&rsquo;s

Surangama, I never for a single moment asked him to come. You will see how I
make your King confess his defeat to me! Just go out, Surangama, and let me

acknowledge him as my King, he came all of a sudden like a terrific
tempest&mdash;God knows from where&mdash;and scattered my men and horses and
banners in one wild tumult: but now, when I am seeking the ends of the earth to
pay him my humble homage, he is nowhere to be seen.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
But however big an Emperor he may be, he has to submit to him that yields. But
why have you come out at night, Prince?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KANCHI.<br/>
I still cannot get rid of the feeling of a secret dread of being laughed at by
people when they see me meekly doing my homage to your King, acknowledging my
defeat.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
Such indeed is the people. What would move others to tears only serves to move
their empty laughter.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KANCHI.<br/>
But you too are on the road, Grandfather.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
This is my jolly pilgrimage to the land of losing everything.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
Sings.
</p>

<p>
<i>I am waiting with my all in the hope of losing everything.<br/>I am watching
at the roadside for him who turns one out into the open road,<br/>Who hides
himself and sees, who loves you unknown to you,<br/>I have given my heart in
secret love to him,<br/>I am waiting with my all in the hope of losing
everything. </i>

[<i>A Road. SUDARSHANA and SURANGAMA</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
What a relief, Surangama, what freedom! It is my defeat that has brought me
freedom. Oh, what an iron pride was mine! Nothing could move it or soften it.
My darkened mind could not in any way be brought to see the plain truth that it
was not the King who was to come, it was I who ought to have gone to him. All
through yesternight I lay alone on the dusty floor before that window&mdash;lay
there through the desolate hours and wept! All night the southern winds blew
and shrieked and moaned like the pain that was biting at my heart; and all
through it I heard the plaintive &ldquo;Speak, wife!&rdquo; of the nightbird
echoing in the tumult outside! . . . It was the helpless wail of the dark
night, Surangama!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
Last night&rsquo;s heavy and melancholy air seemed to hang on for an
eternity&mdash;oh, what a dismal and gboomy night!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
But would you believe it&mdash;I seemed to hear the soft strains of the
<i>vina</i> floating through all that wild din and tumult! Could he play such
sweet and tender tunes, he who is so cruel and terrible? The world knows only
my indignity and ignominy&mdash;but none but my own heart could hear those
strains that called me through the lone and wailing night. Did you too,
Surangama, hear the <i>vina</i>? Or was that but a dream of mine?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
But it is just to hear that same <i>vina&rsquo;s</i> music that I am always by
your side. It is for this call of music, which I knew would one day come to
dissolve all the barriers of love, that I have all along been listening with an
cager ear.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
He did at last send me on the open road&mdash;I could not withstand his will.
When I shall find him, the first words that I shall tell him will be, &ldquo;I
have come of my own will&mdash;I have not awaited your coming.&rdquo; I shall
say, &ldquo;For your sake have I trodden the hard and weary roads, and bitter
and ceaseless has been my weeping all the way.&rdquo; I shall at least have
this pride in me when I meet him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
But even that pride will not last. He came before you did&mdash;who else could
have sent you on the road?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Perhaps he did. As long as a sense of offended pride remained with me, I could
not help thinking that he had left me for good; but when I flung my dignity and
pride to the winds and came out on the common streets, then it seemed to me
that he too had come out: I have been finding him since the moment I was on the
road. I have no misgivings now. All this suffering that I have gone through for
his sake, the very bitternesss of all this is giving me his company. Ah! yes,
he has come&mdash;he has held me by the hand, just as he used to do in that
chamber of darkness, when, at his touch, all my body would start with a sudden
thrill: it is the same, the same touch again! Who says that he is not
here?&mdash;Surangama, can you not see that he has come, in silence and secret?
. . . Who is that there? Look, Surangama, there is a third traveller of this
dark road at this hour of the night.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
I see, it is the King of Kanchi, my Queen.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
King of Kanchi!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my Queen!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Afraid! Why should I be afraid? The days of fear are gone for ever for me.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KANCHI.<br/>
[<i>entering</i>] Queen-mother, I see you two on this road! I am a traveller of
the same path as yourself. Have no fear of me, O Queen!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
It is well, King of Kanchi, that we should be going together, side by
side&mdash;this is but right. I came on your way when I first left my home, and
now I meet you again on my way back. Who could have dreamed that this meeting
of ours would augur so well?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KANCHI.<br/>
But, Queen-mother, it is not meet that you should walk over this road on foot.
Will you permit me to get a chariot for you?

</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Oh, do not say so: I shall never be happy if I could not on my way back home
tread on the dust of the road that led me away from my King. I would be
deceiving myself if I were now to go in a chariot.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
King, you too are walking in the dust to-day: this road has never known anybody
driving his horse or chariot over it.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
When I was the Queen, I stepped over silver and gold&mdash;I shall have now to
atone for the evil fortune of my birth by walking over dust and bare earth. I
could not have dreamed that thus I would meet my King of common earth and dust
at every step of mine to-day.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SURANGAMA.<br/>
Look, my Queen, there on the eastern horizon comes the dawn. We have not long
to walk: I see the spires of the golden turrets of the King&rsquo;s palace.
</p>

<p>
[<i>Enter GRANDFATHER</i>]
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
My child, it is dawn&mdash;at last!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Your benedictions have given me Godspeed, and here I am, at last.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
But do you see how ill-mannered our King is? He has sent no chariot, no music
band, nothing splendid or grand.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Nothing grand, did you say? Look, the sky is rosy and crimson from end to end,
the air is full of the welcome of the scent of flowers.

</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
Yes, but however cruel our King may be, we cannot seek to emulate him: I cannot
help feeling pain at seeing you in this state, my child. How can we bear to see
you going to the King&rsquo;s palace attired in this poor and wretched attire?
Wait a little&mdash;I am running to fetch you your Queen&rsquo;s garments.

</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Oh no, no, no! He has taken away those regal robes from me for ever&mdash;he
has attired me in a servant&rsquo;s dress before the eyes of the whole world:
what a relief this has been to me! I am his servant now, no longer his Queen.
To-day I stand at the feet of all those who can claim any relationship with
him.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
But your enemies will laugh at you now: how can you bear their derision?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Let their laughter and derision be immortal&mdash;let them throw dust at me in
the streets: this dust will to-day be the powder with which I shall deck myself
before meeting my lord.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
After this, we shall say nothing. Now let us play the last game of our Spring
Festival&mdash;instead of the pollen of flowers let the south breeze blow and
scatter dust of lowliness in every direction! We shall go to the lord clad in
the common grey of the dust. And we shall find him too covered with dust all
over. For do you think the people spare him? Even he cannot escape from their
soiled and dusty hands, and he does not even care to brush the dirt off his
garments.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KANCHI.<br/>
Grandfather, do not forget me in this game of yours! I also will have to get
this royal garment of mine soiled till it is beyond all recognition.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
GRANDFATHER.<br/>
That will not take long, my brother. Now that you have come down so
far&mdash;you will change your colour in no time. Just look at our
Queen&mdash;she got into a temper with herself and thought that she could spoil
her matchless beauty by flinging away all her ornaments: but this insult to her
beauty has made it shine forth in tenfold radiance, and now it is in its
unadorned perfection. We hear that our King is all innocent of
beauty&mdash;that is why he loves all his manifold beauty of form which shines
as the very ornament of his breast. And that beauty has to-day taken off its
veil and cloak of pride and vanity! What could I not give to be allowed to hear
the wonderful music and song that has filled my King&rsquo;s palace to-day!
</p>

SURANGAMA.<br/>
Lo, there rises the sun!

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Lord, do not give me back the honour which you once did turn away from me! I am
the servant of your feet&mdash;I only seek the privilege of serving you.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KING.<br/>
Will you be able to bear me now?
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
Oh yes, yes, I shall. Your sigh repelled me because I had sought to find you in
the pleasure garden, in my Queen&rsquo;s chambers: there even your meanest
servant looks handsomer than you. That fever of longing has left my eyes for
ever. You are not beautiful, my lord&mdash;you stand beyond all comparisons!
</p>

<p class="dialog">
KING.<br/>
That which can be comparable with me lies within yourself.
</p>

<p class="dialog">
SUDARSHANA.<br/>
If this be so, then that too is beyond comparison. Your love lives in
me&mdash;you are mirrored in that love, and you see your face reflected in me:
nothing of this mine, it is all yours, O lord!
</p>

<p class="dialog">

I open the doors of this dark room to-day&mdash;the game is finished here!
Come, come with me now, come outside&mdash;into the light!

terrible, my peerless one!

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
