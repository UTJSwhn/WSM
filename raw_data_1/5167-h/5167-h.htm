    <h2>
      SCENE 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCENE&mdash;A room with lighted fire, and a door into the open air,
      through which one sees, perhaps, the trees of a wood, and these trees
      should be painted in flat colour upon a gold or diapered sky. The walls
      are of one colour. The scene should have the effect of missal Painting.
      MARY, a woman of forty years or so, is grinding a quern.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. What can have made the grey hen flutter so?
    </p>
    <p>
      (TEIG, a boy of fourteen, is coming in with turf, which he lays beside the
      hearth.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. They say that now the land is famine struck The graves are walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. There is something that the hen hears.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. And that is not the worst; at Tubber-vanach A woman met a man with
      ears spread out, And they moved up and down like a bat's wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. What can have kept your father all this while?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. Two nights ago, at Carrick-orus churchyard, A herdsman met a man who
      had no mouth, Nor eyes, nor ears; his face a wall of flesh; He saw him
      plainly by the light of the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Look out, and tell me if your father's coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      (TEIG goes to door.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. Mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. In the bush beyond, There are two birds&mdash;if you can call them
      birds&mdash; I could not see them rightly for the leaves. But they've the
      shape and colour of horned owls And I'm half certain they've a human face.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Mother of God, defend us!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. They're looking at me. What is the good of praying? father says. God
      and the Mother of God have dropped asleep. What do they care, he says,
      though the whole land Squeal like a rabbit under a weasel's tooth?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. You'll bring misfortune with your blasphemies Upon your father, or
      yourself, or me. I would to God he were home&mdash;ah, there he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      (SHEMUS comes in.)
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it kept you in the wood? You know I cannot get all sorts of
      accidents Out of my mind till you are home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. I'm in no mood to listen to your clatter. Although I tramped the
      woods for half a day, I've taken nothing, for the very rats, Badgers, and
      hedgehogs seem to have died of drought, And there was scarce a wind in the
      parched leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. Then you have brought no dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. After that I sat among the beggars at the cross-roads, And held a
      hollow hand among the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. What, did you beg?
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. I had no chance to beg, For when the beggars saw me they cried out
      They would not have another share their alms, And hunted me away with
      sticks and stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. You said that you would bring us food or money.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. What's in the house?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. A bit of mouldy bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. There's flour enough to make another loaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. And when that's gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. There is the hen in the coop.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. My curse upon the beggars, my Curse upon them!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. And the last penny gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. When the hen's gone, What can we do but live on sorrel and dock)
      And dandelion, till our mouths are green?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. God, that to this hour's found bit and sup, Will cater for us still.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. His kitchen's bare. There were five doors that I looked through
      this day And saw the dead and not a soul to wake them.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Maybe He'd have us die because He knows, When the ear is stopped and
      when the eye is stopped, That every wicked sight is hid from the eye, And
      all fool talk from the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Who's passing there? And mocking us with music?
    </p>
    <p>
      (A stringed instrument without.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. A young man plays it, There's an old woman and a lady with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. What is the trouble of the poor to her? Nothing at all or a harsh
      radishy sauce For the day's meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. God's pity on the rich, Had we been through as many doors, and seen
      The dishes standing on the polished wood In the wax candle light, we'd be
      as hard, And there's the needle's eye at the end of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. My curse upon the rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. They're coming here.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Then down upon that stool, down quick, I say, And call up a whey
      face and a whining voice, And let your head be bowed upon your knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Had I but time to put the place to rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      (CATHLEEN, OONA, and ALEEL enter.)
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. God save all here. There is a certain house, An old grey castle
      with a kitchen garden, A cider orchard and a plot for flowers, Somewhere
      among these woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. We know it, lady. A place that's set among impassable walls As
      though world's trouble could not find it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. It may be that we are that trouble, for we&mdash; Although we've
      wandered in the wood this hour&mdash; Have lost it too, yet I should know
      my way, For I lived all my childhood in that house.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Then you are Countess Cathleen?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. And this woman, Oona, my nurse, should have remembered it, For
      we were happy for a long time there.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. The paths are overgrown with thickets now, Or else some change has
      come upon my sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. And this young man, that should have known the woods&mdash;
      Because we met him on their border but now, Wandering and singing like a
      wave of the sea&mdash; Is so wrapped up in dreams of terrors to come That
      he can give no help.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. You have still some way, But I can put you on the trodden path Your
      servants take when they are marketing. But first sit down and rest
      yourself awhile, For my old fathers served your fathers, lady, Longer than
      books can tell&mdash;and it were strange If you and yours should not be
      welcome here.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. And it were stranger still were I ungrateful For such kind
      welcome but I must be gone, For the night's gathering in.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. It is a long while Since I've set eyes on bread or on what buys
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. So you are starving even in this wood, Where I had thought I
      would find nothing changed. But that's a dream, for the old worm o' the
      world Can eat its way into what place it pleases.
    </p>
    <p>
      (She gives money.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. Beautiful lady, give me something too; I fell but now, being weak
      with hunger and thirst, And lay upon the threshold like a log.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. I gave for all and that was all I had. Look, my purse is empty.
      I have passed By starving men and women all this day, And they have had
      the rest; but take the purse, The silver clasps on't may be worth a
      trifle. But if you'll come to-morrow to my house You shall have twice the
      sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ALEEL begins to play.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS (muttering). What, music, music!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Ah, do not blame the finger on the string; The doctors bid me
      fly the unlucky times And find distraction for my thoughts, or else Pine
      to my grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. I have said nothing, lady. Why should the like of us complain?
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Have done. Sorrows that she's but read of in a book Weigh on her
      mind as if they had been her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      (OONA, MARY, and CATHLEEN go Out. ALEEL looks defiantly at SHEMUS.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. (Singing) Impetuous heart, be still, be still, Your sorrowful love
      can never be told, Cover it up with a lonely tune, He that could bend all
      things to His will Has covered the door of the infinite fold With the pale
      stars and the wandering moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He takes a step towards the door and then turns again.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Shut to the door before the night has fallen, For who can say what walks,
      or in what shape Some devilish creature flies in the air, but now Two
      grey-horned owls hooted above our heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He goes out, his singing dies away. MARY comes in. SHEmus has been
      counting the money.)
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. There's no good luck in owls, but it may be That the ill luck's to
      fall upon their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. You never thanked her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Thank her, For seven halfpence and a silver bit?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. But for this empty purse?
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. What's that for thanks, Or what's the double of it that she
      promised? With bread and flesh and every sort of food Up to a price no man
      has heard the like of And rising every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. We have all she had; She emptied out the purse before our eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS (to MARY, who has gone to close the door) Leave that door open.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. When those that have read books, And seen the seven wonders of the
      world, Fear what's above or what's below the ground, It's time that
      poverty should bolt the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. I'll have no bolts, for there is not a thing That walks above the
      ground or under it I had not rather welcome to this house Than any more of
      mankind, rich or poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. So that they brought us money.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. I heard say There's something that appears like a white bird, A
      pigeon or a seagull or the like, But if you hit it with a stone or a stick
      It clangs as though it had been made of brass; And that if you dig down
      where it was scratching You'll find a crock of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. But dream of gold For three nights running, and there's always gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. You might be starved before you've dug it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. But maybe if you called, something would come, They have been seen
      of late.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Is it call devils? Call devils from the wood, call them in here?
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. So you'd stand up against me, and you'd say Who or what I am to
      welcome here.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He hits her.)
    </p>
    <p>
      That is to show who's master.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. Call them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. God help us all!
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Pray, if you have a mind to. it's little that the sleepy ears
      above Care for your words; but I'll call what I please.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. There is many a one, they say, had money from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. (at door) Whatever you are that walk the woods at night, So be it
      that you have not shouldered up Out of a grave&mdash;for I'll have nothing
      human&mdash; And have free hands, a friendly trick of speech, I welcome
      you. Come, sit beside the fire. What matter if your head's below your arms
      Or you've a horse's tail to whip your flank, Feathers instead of hair,
      that's but a straw, Come, share what bread and meat is in the house, And
      stretch your heels and warm them in the ashes. And after that, let's share
      and share alike And curse all men and women. Come in, come in. What, is
      there no one there?
    </p>
    <p>
      (Turning from door)
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet they say They are as common as the grass, and ride Even upon the
      book in the priest's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      (TEIG lifts one arm slowly and points toward the door and begins moving
      backwards. SHEMUS turns, he also sees something and begins moving
      backward. MARY does the same. A man dressed as an Eastern merchant comes
      in carrying a small carpet. He unrolls it and sits cross-legged at one end
      of it. Another man dressed in the same way follows, and sits at the other
      end. This is done slowly and deliberately. When they are seated they take
      money out of embroidered purses at their girdles and begin arranging it on
      the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. You speak to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. No, you.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. 'Twas you that called them.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. (coming nearer) I'd make so bold, if you would pardon it, To ask
      if there's a thing you'd have of us. Although we are but poor people, if
      there is, Why, if there is&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We've travelled a long road, For we are merchants that
      must tramp the world, And now we look for supper and a fire And a safe
      corner to count money in.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. I thought you were.... but that's no matter now&mdash; There had
      been words between my wife and me Because I said I would be master here,
      And ask in what I pleased or who I pleased And so.... but that is nothing
      to the point, Because it's certain that you are but merchants.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We travel for the Master of all merchants.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Yet if you were that I had thought but now I'd welcome you no
      less. Be what you please And you'll have supper at the market rate, That
      means that what was sold for but a penny Is now worth fifty.
    </p>
    <p>
      (MERCHANTS begin putting money on carpet.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Our Master bids us pay So good a price, that all who deal
      with us Shall eat, drink, and be merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. (to MARY) Bestir yourself, Go kill and draw the fowl, while Teig
      and I Lay out the plates and make a better fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. I will not cook for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Not cook! not cook! Do not be angry. She wants to pay me back
      Because I struck her in that argument. But she'll get sense again. Since
      the dearth came We rattle one on another as though we were Knives thrown
      into a basket to be cleaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. I will not cook for you, because I know In what unlucky shape you
      sat but now Outside this door.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. It's this, your honours: Because of some wild words my father said
      She thinks you are not of those who cast a shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. I said I'd make the devils of the wood Welcome, if they'd a mind
      to eat and drink; But it is certain that you are men like us.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. It's strange that she should think we cast no shadow, For
      there is nothing on the ridge of the world That's more substantial than
      the merchants are That buy and sell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. If you are not demons, And seeing what great wealth is spread out
      there, Give food or money to the starving poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. If we knew how to find deserving poor We'd do our share.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. But seek them patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We know the evils of mere charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Those scruples may befit a common time. I had thought there was a
      pushing to and fro, At times like this, that overset the scale And
      trampled measure down.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. But if already We'd thought of a more prudent way than
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. If each one brings a bit of merchandise, We'll give him
      such a price he never dreamt of.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Where shall the starving come at merchandise?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We will ask nothing but what all men have.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Their swine and cattle, fields and implements Are sold and gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. They have not sold all yet. For there's a vaporous thing&mdash;that
      may be nothing, But that's the buyer's risk&mdash;a second self, They call
      immortal for a story's sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. You come to buy our souls?
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. I'll barter mine. Why should we starve for what may be but nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Teig and Shemus&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. What can it be but nothing? What has God poured out of His bag but
      famine? Satan gives money.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. Yet no thunder stirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. There is a heap for each.
    </p>
    <p>
      (SHEMUS goes to take money.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But no, not yet, For there's a work I have to set you to.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. So then you're as deceitful as the rest, And all that talk of
      buying what's but a vapour Is fancy bred. I might have known as much,
      Because that's how the trick-o'-the-loop man talks.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. That's for the work, each has its separate price; But
      neither price is paid till the work's done.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. The same for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Oh, God, why are you still?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. You've but to cry aloud at every cross-road, At every
      house door, that we buy men's souls, And give so good a price that all may
      live In mirth and comfort till the famine's done, Because we are Christian
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Come, let's away.
    </p>
    <p>
      TREIG> I shall keep running till I've earned the price.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. (who has risen and gone towards fire) Stop, for we obey a
      generous Master, That would be served by Comfortable men. And here's your
      entertainment on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      (TRIG and SHEMUS have stopped. TEIG takes the money. They go out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. Destroyers of souls, God will destroy you quickly. You shall at last
      dry like dry leaves and hang Nailed like dead vermin to the doors of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Curse to your fill, for saints will have their dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANTm Though we're but vermin that our Master sent To overrun
      the world, he at the end Shall pull apart the pale ribs of the moon And
      quench the stars in the ancestral night.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARY. God is all powerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Pray, you shall need Him. You shall eat dock and grass,
      and dandelion, Till that low threshold there becomes a wall, And when your
      hands can scarcely drag your body We shall be near you.
    </p>
    <p>
      (MARY faints.) (The FIRST MERCHANT takes up the carPet, spreads it before
      the fire and stands in front of it warming his hands.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Our faces go unscratched, For she has fainted. Wring the
      neck o' that fowl, Scatter the flour and search the shelves for bread.
      We'll turn the fowl upon the spit and roast it, And eat the supper we were
      bidden to, Now that the house is quiet, praise our master, And stretch and
      warm our heels among the ashes.

      SCENE 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      FRONT SCENE.&mdash;A wood with perhaps distant view of turreted house at
      one side, but all in flat colour, without light and shade and against a
      diafiered or gold background.
    </p>
    <p>
      COUNTESS CATHLEEN comes in leaning Upon ALEEL's arm. OONA follows them.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. (Stopping) Surely this leafy corner, where one smells The wild
      bee's honey, has a story too?
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. There is the house at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. A man, they say, Loved Maeve the Queen of all the invisible host,
      And died of his love nine centuries ago. And now, when the moon's riding
      at the full, She leaves her dancers lonely and lies there Upon that level
      place, and for three days Stretches and sighs and wets her long pale
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. So she loves truly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. No, but wets her cheeks, Lady, because she has forgot his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. She'd sleep that trouble away&mdash;though it must be A heavy
      trouble to forget his name&mdash; If she had better sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Your own house, lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. She sleeps high up on wintry Knock-na-rea In an old cairn of
      stones; while her poor women Must lie and jog in the wave if they would
      sleep Being water born&mdash;yet if she cry their names They run up on the
      land and dance in the moon Till they are giddy and would love as men do,
      And be as patient and as pitiful. But there is nothing that will stop in
      their heads, They've such poor memories, though they weep for it. Oh, yes,
      they weep; that's when the moon is full.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. is it because they have short memories They live so long?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. What's memory but the ash That chokes our fires that have begun to
      sink? And they've a dizzy, everlasting fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. There is your own house, lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Why, that's true, And we'd have passed it without noticing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. A curse upon it for a meddlesome house! Had it but stayed away I
      would have known What Queen Maeve thinks on when the moon is pinched; And
      whether now&mdash;as in the old days&mdash;the dancers Set their brief
      love on men.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Rest on my arm. These are no thoughts for any Christian ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. I am younger, she would be too heavy for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He begins taking his lute out of the bag, CATHLEEN, Who has turned
      towards OONA, turns back to him.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This hollow box remembers every foot That danced upon the level grass of
      the world, And will tell secrets if I whisper to it. (Sings.) Lift up the
      white knee; That's what they sing, Those young dancers That in a ring
      Raved but now Of the hearts that break Long, long ago For their sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. New friends are sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. "But the dance changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lift up the gown, All that sorrow Is trodden down."
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. The empty rattle-pate! Lean on this arm, That I can tell you is a
      christened arm, And not like some, if we are to judge by speech. But as
      you please. It is time I was forgot. Maybe it is not on this arm you
      slumbered When you were as helpless as a worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Stay with me till we come to your own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN (Sitting down) When I am rested I will need no help.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. I thought to have kept her from remembering
    </p>
    <p>
      The evil of the times for full ten minutes; But now when seven are out you
      come between.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Talk on; what does it matter what you say, For you have not been
      christened?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Old woman, old woman, You robbed her of three minutes peace of
      mind, And though you live unto a hundred years, And wash the feet of
      beggars and give alms, And climb Croaghpatrick, you shall not be pardoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. How does a man who never was baptized Know what Heaven pardons?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. You are a sinful woman
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. I care no more than if a pig had grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Enter CATHLEEN's Steward.)
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. I am not to blame, for I had locked the gate, The forester's to
      blame. The men climbed in At the east corner where the elm-tree is.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. I do not understand you, who has climbed?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. Then God be thanked, I am the first to tell you. I was afraid
      some other of the servants&mdash; Though I've been on the watch&mdash;had
      been the first And mixed up truth and lies, your ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN (rising) Has some misfortune happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. Yes, indeed. The forester that let the branches lie Against the
      wall's to blame for everything, For that is how the rogues got into the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. I thought to have escaped misfortune here. Has any one been
      killed?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. Oh, no, not killed. They have stolen half a cart-load of green
      cabbage.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. But maybe they were starving.
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. That is certain. To rob or starve, that was the choice they had.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. A learned theologian has laid down That starving men may take
      what's necessary, And yet be sinless.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Sinless and a thief There should be broken bottles on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. And if it be a sin, while faith's unbroken God cannot help but
      pardon. There is no soul But it's unlike all others in the world, Nor one
      but lifts a strangeness to God's love Till that's grown infinite, and
      therefore none Whose loss were less than irremediable Although it were the
      wickedest in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Enter TEIG and SHEMUS.)
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. What are you running for? Pull off your cap, Do you not see who's
      there?
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. I cannot wait. I am running to the world with the best news That
      has been brought it for a thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. Then get your breath and speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. If you'd my news You'd run as fast and be as out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. Such news, we shall be carried on men's shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. There's something every man has carried with him And thought no
      more about than if it were A mouthful of the wind; and now it's grown A
      marketable thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. And yet it seemed As useless as the paring of one's nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. What sets me laughing when I think of it, Is that a rogue who's
      lain in lousy straw, If he but sell it, may set up his coach.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. (laughing) There are two gentlemen who buy men's souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. O God!
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. And maybe there's no soul at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. They're drunk or mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. Look at the price they give. (Showing money.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. (tossing up money) "Go cry it all about the world," they said.
      "Money for souls, good money for a soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Give twice and thrice and twenty times their money, And get your
      souls again. I will pay all.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Not we! not we! For souls&mdash;if there are souls&mdash; But keep
      the flesh out of its merriment. I shall be drunk and merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. Come, let's away.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He goes.)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 CATHLEEN. But there's a world to come.
</pre>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. And if there is, I'd rather trust myself into the hands That can
      pay money down than to the hands That have but shaken famine from the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He goes Out R.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (lilting) "There's money for a soul, sweet yellow money. There's money for
      men's souls, good money, money."
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. (to ALEEL) Go call them here again, bring them by force, Beseech
      them, bribe, do anything you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ALEEL goes.)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 And you too follow, add your prayers to his.
</pre>
    <p>
      (OONA, who has been praying, goes out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Steward, you know the secrets of my house. How much have I?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. A hundred kegs of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. How much have I in castles?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. As much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. How much have I in pasture?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. As much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. How much have I in forests?
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. As much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Keeping this house alone, sell all I have, Go barter where you
      please, but come again With herds of cattle and with ships of meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      STEWARD. God's blessing light upon your ladyship. You will have saved the
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Make no delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He goes L.)
    </p>
    <p>
      (ALEEL and OONA return)
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. They have not come; speak quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. One drew his knife And said that he would kill the man or woman
      That stopped his way; and when I would have stopped him He made this
      stroke at me; but it is nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. You shall be tended. From this day for ever I'll have no joy or
      sorrow of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Their eyes shone like the eyes of birds of prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Come, follow me, for the earth burns my feet Till I have changed
      my house to such a refuge That the old and ailing, and all weak of heart,
      May escape from beak and claw; all, all, shall come Till the walls burst
      and the roof fall on us. From this day out I have nothing of my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      (She goes.)
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA (taking ALEEL by the arm and as she speaks bandaging his wound) She
      has found something now to put her hand to, And you and I are of no more
      account Than flies upon a window-pane in the winter.

      SCENE 3
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCENE.&mdash;Hall in the house of COUNTESS CATHLEEN. At the Left an
      oratory with steps leading up to it. At the Right a tapestried wall, more
      or less repeating the form of the oratory, and a great chair with its back
      against the wall. In the Centre are two or more arches through which one
      can see dimly the trees of the garden. CATHLEEN is kneeling in front of
      the altar in the oratory; there is a hanging lighted lamp over the altar.
      ALEEL enters.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. I have come to bid you leave this castle and fly Out of these
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. What evil is there here? That is not everywhere from this to the
      sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. They who have sent me walk invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. So it is true what I have heard men say, That you have seen and
      heard what others cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. I was asleep in my bed, and while I slept My dream became a fire;
      and in the fire One walked and he had birds about his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. I have heard that one of the old gods walked so.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. It may be that he is angelical; And, lady, he bids me call you from
      these woods. And you must bring but your old foster-mother, And some few
      serving men, and live in the hills, Among the sounds of music and the
      light Of waters, till the evil days are done. For here some terrible death
      is waiting you, Some unimagined evil, some great darkness That fable has
      not dreamt of, nor sun nor moon Scattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. No, not angelical.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. This house You are to leave with some old trusty man, And bid him
      shelter all that starve or wander While there is food and house room.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. He bids me go Where none of mortal creatures but the swan
      Dabbles, and there 'you would pluck the harp, when the trees Had made a
      heavy shadow about our door, And talk among the rustling of the reeds,
      When night hunted the foolish sun away With stillness and pale tapers.
      No-no-no! I cannot. Although I weep, I do not weep Because that life would
      be most happy, and here I find no way, no end. Nor do I weep Because I had
      longed to look upon your face, But that a night of prayer has made me
      weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL (.prostrating himself before her) Let Him that made mankind, the
      angels and devils And death and plenty, mend what He has made, For when we
      labour in vain and eye still sees Heart breaks in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. How would that quiet end?
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. How but in healing?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. You have seen my tears And I can see your hand shake on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. (faltering) I thought but of healing. He was angelical.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN (turning away from him) No, not angelical, but of the old gods,
      Who wander about the world to waken the heart The passionate, proud heart&mdash;that
      all the angels, Leaving nine heavens empty, would rock to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      (She goes to chapel door; ALEEL holds his clasped hands towards her for a
      moment hesitating, and then lets them fall beside him.)
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Do not hold out to me beseeching hands. This heart shall never
      waken on earth. I have sworn, By her whose heart the seven sorrows have
      pierced, To pray before this altar until my heart Has grown to Heaven like
      a tree, and there Rustled its leaves, till Heaven has saved my people.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. (who has risen) When one so great has spoken of love to one' So
      little as I, though to deny him love, What can he but hold out beseeching
      hands, Then let them fall beside him, knowing how greatly They have
      overdared?
    </p>
    <p>
      (He goes towards the door of the hall. The COUNTESS CATHLEEN takes a few
      steps towards him.)
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. If the old tales are true, Queens have wed shepherds and kings
      beggar-maids; God's procreant waters flowing about your mind Have made you
      more than kings or queens; and not you But I am the empty pitcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Being silent, I have said all, yet let me stay beside you.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN.No, no, not while my heart is shaken. No, But you shall hear wind
      cry and water cry, And curlews cry, and have the peace I longed for.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Give me your hand to kiss.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
CATHLEEN. I kiss your forehead.
And yet I send you from me. Do not speak;
There have been women that bid men to rob
Crowns from the Country-under-Wave or apples
         Upon a dragon-guarded hill, and all
That they might sift men's hearts and wills,
And trembled as they bid it, as I tremble
That lay a hard task on you, that you go,
And silently, and do not turn your head;
Goodbye; but do not turn your head and look;
Above all else, I would not have you look.
</pre>
    <p>
      (ALEEL goes.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I never spoke to him of his wounded hand, And now he is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      (She looks out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot see him, for all is dark outside. Would my imagination and my
      heart Were as little shaken as this holy flame!
    </p>
    <p>
      (She goes slowly into the chapel. The two MERCHANTS enter.) FIRST
      MERCHANT. Although I bid you rob her treasury, I find you sitting drowsed
      and motionless, And yet you understand that while it's full She'll bid
      against us and so bribe the poor That our great Master'll lack his
      merchandise. You know that she has brought into this house The old and
      ailing that are pinched the most At such a time and so should be bought
      cheap. You've seen us sitting in the house in the wood, While the snails
      crawled about the window-pane And the mud floor, and not a soul to buy;
      Not even the wandering fool's nor one of those That when the world goes
      wrong must rave and talk, Until they are as thin as a cat's ear. But all
      that's nothing; you sit drowsing there With your back hooked, your chin
      upon your knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. How could I help it? For she prayed so hard I could not
      cross the threshold till her lover Had turned her thoughts to dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT, Well, well, to labour. There is the treasury door and time
      runs on.
    </p>
    <p>
      (SECOND MERCHANT goes Out. FIRST MERCHANT sits cross-legged against a
      pillar, yawns and stretches.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. And so I must endure the weight of the world, Far from my
      Master and the revelry, That's lasted since&mdash;shaped as a worm&mdash;he
      bore The knowledgable pippin in his mouth To the first woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      (SECOND MERCHANT returns with bags.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Where are those dancers gone? They knew they were to carry it on their
      backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. I heard them breathing but a moment since, But now they
      are gone, being unsteadfast things.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. They knew their work. It seems that they imagine We'd do
      such wrong to our great Master's name As to bear burdens on our backs as
      men do. I'll call them, and who'll dare to disobey? Come, all you
      elemental populace From Cruachan and Finbar's ancient house. Come, break
      up the long dance under the hill, Or if you lie in the hollows of the sea,
      Leave lonely the long hoarding surges, leave The cymbals of the waves to
      clash alone, And shaking the sea-tangles from your hair Gather about us.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The SPIRITS gather under the arches.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. They come. Be still a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      (SPIRITS dance and sing.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST SPIRIT. (singing) Our hearts are sore, but we come Because we have
      heard you call.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND SPIRIT. Sorrow has made me dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST SPIRIT. Her shepherds at nightfall Lay many a plate and cup Down by
      the trodden brink, That when the dance break up We may have meat and
      drink. Therefore our hearts are sore; And though we have heard and come
      Our crying filled the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND SPIRIT. Sorrow has made me dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. What lies in the waves should be indifferent To good and
      evil, and yet it seems that these, Forgetful of their pure, impartial sea,
      Take sides with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Hush, hush, and still your feet. You are not now upon
      Maeve's dancing-floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A SPIRIT. O, look what I have found, a string of pearls!
    </p>
    <p>
      (They begin taking jewels out of bag.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. You must not touch them, put them in the bag, And now
      take up the bags upon your backs And carry them to Shemus Rua's house On
      the wood's border.
    </p>
    <p>
      SPIRITS. No, no, no, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST SPIRIT. No, no, let us away; From this we shall not come Cry out to'
      us who may.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND SPIRIT. Sorrow has made me dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      (They go.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. They're gone, for little do they care for me, And if I
      called they would but turn and mock, But you they dare not disobey.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT (rising) These dancers Are always the most troublesome of
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He comes down the stage and stands facing the arches. He makes a gesture
      of command. The SPIRITS come back whimpering. They lift the bags and go
      out. Three speak as they are taking ub the bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST SPIRIT. From this day out we'll never dance again.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND SPIRIT. Never again.
    </p>
    <p>
      THIRD SPIRIT. Sorrow has made me dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT (looking into chapel door) She has heard nothing; she has
      fallen asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our lord would be well pleased if we could win her. Now that the winds are
      heavy with our kind, Might we not kill her, and bear off her spirit Before
      the mob of angels were astir?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. If we would win this turquoise for our lord It must go
      dropping down of its free will But I've a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. To take her soul to-night?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Because I am of the ninth and mightiest hell Where are all
      kings, I have a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Voices.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Too late; For somebody is stirring in the house; the
      noise That the sea creatures made as they came hither, Their singing and
      their endless chattering, Has waked the house. I hear the chairs pushed
      back, And many shuffling feet. All the old men and women She's gathered in
      the house are coming hither.
    </p>
    <p>
      A VOICE. (within) It was here.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER VOICE. No, farther away.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER VOICE. It was in the western tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER VOICE. Come quickly, we will search the western tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We still have time&mdash;they search the distant rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Brother, I heard a sound in there&mdash;a sound That
      troubles me.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Going to the door of the oratory and peering through it.) Upon the altar
      steps The Countess tosses, murmuring in her sleep A broken Paternoster.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Do not fear, For when she has awaked the prayer will
      cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. What, would you wake her?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. I will speak with her, And mix with all her thoughts a
      thought to serve.&mdash; Lady, we've news that's crying out for speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      (CATHLEEN wakes and comes to door of the chapel.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Cathleen. Who calls?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We have brought news.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. What are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We are merchants, and we know the book of the world
      Because we have walked upon its leaves; and there Have read of late
      matters that much concern you; And noticing the castle door stand open,
      Came in to find an ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. The door stands open, That no one who is famished or afraid,
      Despair of help or of a welcome with it. But you have news, you say.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We saw a man, Heavy with sickness in the bog of Allen,
      Whom you had bid buy cattle. Near Fair Head We saw your grain ships lying
      all becalmed In the dark night; and not less still than they, Burned all
      their mirrored lanthorns in the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN.. My thanks to God, to Mary and the angels, That I have money in
      my treasury, And can buy grain from those who have stored it up To prosper
      on the hunger of the poor. But you've been far and know the signs of
      things, When will this yellow vapour no more hang And creep about the
      fields, and this great heat Vanish away, and grass show its green shoots?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. There is no sign of change&mdash;day copies day, Green
      things are dead&mdash;the cattle too are dead Or dying&mdash;and on all
      the vapour hangs, And fattens with disease and glows with heat. In you is
      all the hope of all the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. And heard you of the demons who buy souls?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. There are some men who hold they have wolves' heads, And
      say their limbs&mdash;dried by the infinite flame&mdash; Have all the
      speed of storms; others, again, Say they are gross and little; while a few
      Will have it they seem much as mortals are, But tall and brown and
      travelled&mdash;like us&mdash;lady, Yet all agree a power is in their
      looks That makes men bow, and flings a casting-net About their souls, and
      that all men would go And barter those poor vapours, were it not You bribe
      them with the safety of your gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Praise be to God, to Mary, and the angels That I am wealthy!
      Wherefore do they sell?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. As we came in at the great door we saw Your porter
      sleeping in his niche&mdash;a soul Too little to be worth a hundred pence,
      And yet they buy it for a hundred crowns. But for a soul like yours, I
      heard them say, They would give five hundred thousand crowns and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. How can a heap of crowns pay for a soul? Is the green grave so
      terrible a thing?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Some sell because the money gleams, and some Because they
      are in terror of the grave, And some because their neighbours sold before,
      And some because there is a kind of joy In casting hope away, in losing
      joy, In ceasing all resistance, in at last Opening one's arms to the
      eternal flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      In casting all sails out upon the wind; To this&mdash;full of the gaiety
      of the lost&mdash; Would all folk hurry if your gold were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. There is something, Merchant, in your voice That makes me fear.
      When you were telling how A man may lose his soul and lose his God Your
      eyes were lighted up, and when you told How my poor money serves the
      people, both&mdash; Merchants forgive me&mdash;seemed to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Man's sins Move us to laughter only; we have seen So many
      lands and seen so many men. How strange that all these people should be
      swung As on a lady's shoe-string,&mdash;under them The glowing leagues of
      never-ending flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. There is a something in you that I fear; A something not of us;
      but were you not born In some most distant corner of the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      (The SECOND MERCHANT, who has been listening at the door, comes forward,
      and as he comes a sound of voices and feet is heard.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Away now&mdash;they are in the passage&mdash;hurry, For
      they will know us, and freeze up our hearts With Ave Marys, and burn all
      our skin With holy water.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Farewell; for we must ride Many a mile before the morning
      come; Our horses beat the ground impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      (They go out. A number of PEASANTs enter by other door.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST PEASANT. Forgive us, lady, but we heard a noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND PEASANT. We sat by the fireside telling vanities.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST PEASANT. We heard a noise, but though we have searched the house We
      have found nobody.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. You are too timid. For now you are safe from all the evil times.
      There is no evil that can find you here.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA (entering hurriedly) Ochone! Ochone! The treasure room is broken in,
      The door stands open, and the gold is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      (PEASANTS raise a lamentable cry.)
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The cry ceases.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you seen nobody?
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA Ochone! That my good mistress should lose all this money.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Let those among you&mdash;not too old to ride&mdash; Get horses
      and search all the country round, I'll give a farm to him who finds the
      thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      (A man with keys at his girdle has come in while she speaks. There is a
      general murmur of The Porter! the porter!")
    </p>
    <p>
      PORTER. Demons were here. I sat beside the door In my stone niche, and two
      owls passed me by, Whispering with human voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLD PEASANT. God forsakes us.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Old man, old man, He never closed a door Unless one opened. I am
      desolate, For a most sad resolve wakes in my heart But I have still my
      faith; therefore be silent For surely He does not forsake the world, But
      stands before it modelling in the clay And moulding there His image. Age
      by age The clay wars with His fingers and pleads hard For its old, heavy,
      dull and shapeless ease; But sometimes&mdash;though His hand is on it
      still&mdash; It moves awry and demon hordes are born.
    </p>
    <p>
      (PEASANTS cross themselves.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet leave me now, for I am desolate, I hear a whisper from beyond the
      thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      (She comes from the oratory door.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet stay an instant. When we meet again I may have grown forgetful. Oona,
      take These two&mdash;the larder and the dairy keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      (To the PORTER.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But take you this. It opens the small room Of herbs for medicine, of
      hellebore, Of vervain, monkshood, plantain, and self-heal. The book of
      cures is on the upper shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      PORTER. Why do you do this, lady; did you see Your coffin in a dream?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Ah, no, not that. A sad resolve wakes in me. I have heard A
      sound of wailing in unnumbered hovels, And I must go down, down&mdash;I
      know not where&mdash; Pray for all men and women mad from famine; Pray,
      you good neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The PEASANTS all kneel. COUNTESS CATHLEEN ascends the steps to the door
      of the oratory, and turning round stands there motionless for a little,
      and then cries in a loud voice:)
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, Queen of angels, And all you clouds on clouds of saints, farewell!

      SCENE 4
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCENE.&mdash;A wood near the Castle, as in Scene 2. The SPIRITS pass one
      by one carrying bags.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST SPIRIT. I'll never dance another step, not one.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND SPIRIT. Are all the thousand years of dancing done?
    </p>
    <p>
      THIRD SPIRIT. How can we dance after so great a sorrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      FOURTH SPIRIT. But how shall we remember it to-morrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIFTH SPIRIT. To think of all the things that we forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      SIXTH SPIRIT. That's why we groan and why our lids are wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The SPIRITS go out. A group Of PEASANTS Pass.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST PEASANT. I have seen silver and copper, but not gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND PEASANT. It's yellow and it shines.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST PEASANT. It's beautiful. The most beautiful thing under the sun,
      That's what I've heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      THIRD PEASANT. I have seen gold enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      FOURTH PEASANT. I would not say that it's so beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST PEASANT. But doesn't a gold piece glitter like the sun? That's what
      my father, who'd seen better days, Told me when I was but a little boy&mdash;
      So high&mdash;so high, it's shining like the sun, Round and shining, that
      is what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND PEASANT. There's nothing in the world it cannot buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST PEASANT. They've bags and bags of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      (They go out. The two MERCHANTS follow silently.)

      SCENE 5
    </h2>
    <p>
      SCENE.&mdash;The house of SHEMUS RUA. There is an alcove at the back with
      curtains; in it a bed, and on the bed is the body of MARY with candles
      round it. The two MERCHANTS while they speak put a large book upon a
      table, arrange money, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Thanks to that lie I told about her ships And that about
      the herdsman lying sick, We shall be too much thronged with souls
      to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. What has she in her coffers now but mice?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. When the night fell and I had shaped myself Into the image
      of the man-headed owl, I hurried to the cliffs of Donegal, And saw with
      all their canvas full of wind And rushing through the parti-coloured sea
      Those ships that bring the woman grain and meal. They're but three days
      from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. When the dew rose I hurried in like feathers to the east,
      And saw nine hundred oxen driven through Meath With goads of iron, They're
      but three days from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Three days for traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      (PEASANTS crowd in with TEIG and SHEMUS.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Come in, come in, you are welcome. That is my wife. She mocked at
      my great masters, And would not deal with them. Now there she is; She does
      not even know she was a fool, So great a fool she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      TEIG. She would not eat One crumb of bread bought with our master's money,
      But lived on nettles, dock, and dandelion.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. There's nobody could put into her head
    </p>
    <p>
      That Death is the worst thing can happen us. Though that sounds simple,
      for her tongue grew rank With all the lies that she had heard in chapel.
      Draw to the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      (TEIG draws it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll not play the fool While these good gentlemen are there to save you.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Since the drought came they drift about in a throng, Like
      autumn leaves blown by the dreary winds. Come, deal&mdash;come, deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Who will come deal with us?
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. They are out of spirit, Sir, with lack of food, Save four or five.
      Here, sir, is one of these; The others will gain courage in good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIDDLE-AGED-MAN. I come to deal&mdash;if you give honest price.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT (reading in a book) John Maher, a man of substance, with
      dull mind, And quiet senses and unventurous heart. The angels think him
      safe." Two hundred crowns, All for a soul, a little breath of wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MAN. I ask three hundred crowns. You have read there That no mere
      lapse of days can make me yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. There is something more writ here&mdash;"often at night He
      is wakeful from a dread of growing poor, And thereon wonders if there's
      any man That he could rob in safety."
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT. Who'd have thought it? And I was once alone with him at
      midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER PEASANT. I will not trust my mother after this.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. There is this crack in you&mdash;two hundred crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT. That's plenty for a rogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER PEASANT. I'd give him nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. You'll get no more&mdash;so take what's offered you.
    </p>
    <p>
      (A general murmur, during which the MIDDLE-AGED-MAN takes money, and slips
      into background, where he sinks on to a seat.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Has no one got a better soul than that? If only for the
      credit of your parishes, Traffic with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      A WOMAN. What will you give for mine?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT (reading in book) "Soft, handsome, and still young "&mdash;not
      much, I think." It's certain that the man she's married to Knows nothing
      of what's hidden in the jar Between the hour-glass and the pepper-pot."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WOMAN. The scandalous book.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. "Nor how when he's away At the horse fair the hand that
      wrote what's hid Will tap three times upon the window-pane."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE WOMAN. And if there is a letter, that is no reason Why I should have
      less money than the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. You're almost safe, I give you fifty crowns
    </p>
    <p>
      (She turns to go.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Woman, have sense-come, Come. Is this a time to haggle at the
      price? There, take it up. There, there. That's right.
    </p>
    <p>
      (She takes them and goes into the crowd.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Come, deal, deal, deal. It is but for charity We buy such
      souls at all; a thousand sins Made them our Master's long before we came.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ALEEL enters.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Here, take my soul, for I am tired of it. I do not ask a price.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. Not ask a price? How can you sell your soul without a price? I
      would not listen to his broken wits; His love for Countess Cathleen has so
      crazed him He hardly understands what he is saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. The trouble that has come on Countess Cathleen, The sorrow that is
      in her wasted face, The burden in her eyes, have broke my wits, And yet I
      know I'd have you take my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We cannot take your soul, for it is hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. No, but you must. Seeing it cannot help her I have grown tired of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Begone from me I may not touch it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Is your power so small? And must I bear it with me all my days? May
      you be scorned and mocked!
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Drag him away. He troubles me.
    </p>
    <p>
      (TEIG and SHEMUS lead ALEEL into the crowd.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. His gaze has filled me, brother, With shaking and a
      dreadful fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Lean forward And kiss the circlet where my Master's lips
      Were pressed upon it when he sent us hither; You shall have peace once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      (SECOND MERCHANT kisses the gold circlet that is about the head of the
      FIRST MERCHANT.) I, too, grow weary, But there is something moving in my
      heart Whereby I know that what we seek the most Is drawing near&mdash;our
      labour will soon end. Come, deal, deal, deal, deal, deal; are you all
      dumb? What, will you keep me from our ancient home And from the eternal
      revelry?
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Deal, deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHEMUS. They say you beat the woman down too low.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. I offer this great price: a-thousand crowns For an old
      woman who was always ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      (An Old PEASANT WOMAN comes forward, and he takes up a book and reads.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There is but little set down here against her. "She has stolen eggs and
      fowl when times were bad, But when the times grew better has confessed it;
      She never missed her chapel of a Sunday And when she could, paid dues."
      Take up your money.
    </p>
    <p>
      OLD WOMAN. God bless you, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      (She screams.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, sir, a pain went through me!
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. That name is like a fire to all damned souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Murmur among the PEASANTS, who shrink back from her as she goes out.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT. How she screamed out!
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND PEASANT. And maybe we shall scream so.
    </p>
    <p>
      THIRD PEASANT. I tell you there is no such place as hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Can such a trifle turn you from your profit? Come, deal;
      come, deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIDDLE-AGED MAN. Master, I am afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. I bought your soul, and there's no sense in fear Now the
      soul's gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      MIDDLE-AGED MAN. Give me my soul again.
    </p>
    <p>
      WOMAN (going on her knees and clinging to MERCHANT) And take this money
      too, and give me mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Bear bastards, drink or follow some wild fancy; For sighs
      and cries are the soul's work, And you have none.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Throws the woman off.)
    </p>
    <p>
      PEASANT. Come, let's away.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER PEASANT. Yes, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER PEASANT. Come quickly; if that woman had not screamed I would have
      lost my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER PEASANT. Come, come away.
    </p>
    <p>
      (They turn to door, but are stopped by shouts of "Countess Cathleen!
      Countess Cathleen!")
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN (entering) And so you trade once more?
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. In spite of you. What brings you here, saint with the
      sapphire eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. I come to barter a soul for a great price.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. What matter, if the soul be worth the price?
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. The people starve, therefore the people go Thronging to you. I
      hear a cry come from them And it is in my ears by night and day, And I
      would have five hundred thousand crowns That I may feed them till the
      dearth go by.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT.. It may be the soul's worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. There is more: The souls that you have bought must be set free.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We know of but one soul that's worth the price.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Being my own it seems a priceless thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. You offer us&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. I offer my own soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT. Do not, do not, for souls the like of ours Are not precious to
      God as your soul is. O! what would Heaven do without you, lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER PEASANT. Look how their claws clutch in their leathern gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Five hundred thousand crowns; we give the price. The gold
      is here; the souls even while you speak Have slipped out of our bond,
      because your face Has shed a light on them and filled their hearts. But
      you must sign, for we omit no form In buying a soul like yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Sign with this quill. It was a feather growing on the
      cock That crowed when Peter dared deny his Master, And all who use it have
      great honour in Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      (CATHLEEN leans forward to sign.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL (rushing forward and snatching the parchment from her) Leave all
      things to the builder of the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. I have no thoughts; I hear a cry&mdash;a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL (casting the parchment on the ground) I have seen a vision under a
      green hedge, A hedge of hips and haws-men yet shall hear The Archangels
      rolling Satan's empty skull Over the mountain-tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. Take him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      (TEIG and SHEMUS drag him roughly away so that he falls upon the floor
      among the PEASANTS. CATHLEEN picks up parchment and signs, then turns
      towards the PEASANTS.)
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Take up the money, and now come with me; When we are far from
      this polluted place I will give everybody money enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      (She goes out, the PEASANTS crowding round her and kissing her dress.
      ALEEL and the two MERCHANTS are left alone.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. We must away and wait until she dies, Sitting above her
      tower as two grey owls, Waiting as many years as may be, guarding Our
      precious jewel; waiting to seize her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      FIRST MERCHANT. We need but hover over her head in the air, For she has
      only minutes. When she signed Her heart began to break. Hush, hush, I hear
      The brazen door of Hell move on its hinges, And the eternal revelry float
      hither To hearten us.
    </p>
    <p>
      SECOND MERCHANT. Leap feathered on the air And meet them with her soul
      caught in your claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      (They rush Out. ALEEL crawls into the middle of the room. The twilight has
      fallen and gradually darkens as the scene goes on. There is a distant
      muttering of thunder and a sound of rising storm.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. The brazen door stands wide, and Balor comes Borne in his heavy
      car, and demons have lifted The age-weary eyelids from the eyes that of
      old Turned gods to stone; Barach, the traitor, comes And the lascivious
      race, Cailitin, That cast a druid weakness and decay Over Sualtem's and
      old Dectera's child; And that great king Hell first took hold upon When he
      killed Naisi and broke Deirdre's heart, And all their heads are twisted to
      one side, For when they lived they warred on beauty and peace With
      obstinate, crafty, sidelong bitterness. (He moves about as though the air
      was full of spirits. OONA enters.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Crouch down, old heron, out of the blind storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Where is the Countess Cathleen? All this day Her eyes were full of
      tears, and when for a moment Her hand was laid upon my hand it trembled,
      And now I do not know where she is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Cathleen has chosen other friends than us, And they are rising
      through the hollow world. Demons are out, old heron.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. God guard her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. She's bartered it away this very hour, As though we two were never
      in the world. And they are rising through the hollow world.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He Points downward.)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
First, Orchill, her pale, beautiful head alive,
Her body shadowy as vapour drifting
Under the dawn, for she who awoke desire
Has but a heart of blood when others die;
About her is a vapoury multitude
    Of women alluring devils with soft laughter
Behind her a host heat of the blood made sin,
But all the little pink-white nails have grown
To be great talons.
</pre>
    <p>
      (He seizes OONA and drags her into the middle of the room and Points
      downward with vehement gestures. The wind roars.)
    </p>
    <p>
      They begin a song And there is still some music on their tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA (casting herself face downwards on the floor) O, Maker of all,
      protect her from the demons, And if a soul must need be lost, take mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ALEEL kneels beside her, but does not seem to hear her words. The
      PEASANTS return. They carry the COUNTESS CATHLEEN and lay her upon the
      ground before OONA and ALEEL. She lies there as if dead.)
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. O, that so many pitchers of rough clay Should prosper and the
      porcelain break in two!
    </p>
    <p>
      (She kisses the hands of CATHLEEN.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT. We were under the tree where the path turns, When she grew pale
      as death and fainted away. And while we bore her hither cloudy gusts
      Blackened the world and shook us on our feet Draw the great bolt, for no
      man has beheld So black, bitter, blinding, and sudden a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      (One who is near the door draws the bolt.)
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. O, hold me, and hold me tightly, for the storm Is dragging me
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      (OONA takes her in her arms. A WOMAN begins to wail.)
    </p>
    <p>
      PEASANT. Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      PEASANTS. Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      PEASANT WOMEN Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      OTHER PEASANT WOMEN Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN (half rising) Lay all the bags of money in a heap, And when I am
      gone, old Oona, share them out To every man and woman: judge, and give
      According to their needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT WOMAN. And will she give Enough to keep my children through the
      dearth?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER PEASANT WOMAN. O, Queen of Heaven, and all you blessed saints, Let
      us and ours be lost so she be shriven.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel; I gaze upon them as the
      swallow gazes Upon the nest under the eave, before She wander the loud
      waters. Do not weep Too great a while, for there is many a candle On the
      High Altar though one fall. Aleel, Who sang about the dancers of the
      woods, That know not the hard burden of the world, Having but breath in
      their kind bodies, farewell And farewell, Oona, you who played with me,
      And bore me in your arms about the house When I was but a child and
      therefore happy, Therefore happy, even like those that dance. The storm is
      in my hair and I must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      (She dies.)
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Bring me the looking-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      (A WOMAN brings it to her out of the inner room. OONA holds it over the
      lips Of CATHLEEN. All is silent for a moment. And then she speaks in a
      half scream:)
    </p>
    <p>
      O, she is dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT. She was the great white lily of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT. She was more beautiful than the pale stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      AN OLD PEASANT WOMAN. The little plant I love is broken in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ALEEL takes looking-glass from OONA and flings it upon the floor so that
      it is broken in many pieces.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. I shatter you in fragments, for the face That brimmed you up with
      beauty is no more: And die, dull heart, for she whose mournful words Made
      you a living spirit has passed away And left you but a ball of passionate
      dust. And you, proud earth and plumy sea, fade out! For you may hear no
      more her faltering feet, But are left lonely amid the clamorous war Of
      angels upon devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He stands up; almost every one is kneeling, but it has grown so dark that
      only confused forms can be seen.)
    </p>
    <p>
      And I who weep Call curses on you, Time and Fate and Change, And have no
      excellent hope but the great hour When you shall plunge headlong through

    <p>
      A PEASANT WOMAN. Pull him upon his knees before his curses Have plucked
      thunder and lightning on our heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Angels and devils clash in the middle air, And brazen swords clang
      upon brazen helms.
    </p>
    <p>
      (A flash of lightning followed immediately by thunder.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Yonder a bright spear, cast out of a sling, Has torn through Balor's eye,
      and the dark clans Fly screaming as they fled Moytura of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Everything is lost in darkness.)
    </p>
    <p>
      AN OLD MAN. The Almighty wrath at our great weakness and sin Has blotted
      out the world and we must die.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The darkness is broken by a visionary light. The PEASANTS seem to be
      kneeling upon the rocky slope of a mountain, and vapour full of storm and
      ever-changing light is sweeping above them and behind them. Half in the
      light, haff in the shadow, stand armed angels. Their armour is old and
      worn, and their drawn swords dim and dinted. They stand as if upon the air
      in formation of battle and look downward with stern faces. The PEASANTS
      cast themselves on the ground.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Look no more on the half-closed gates of Hell, But speak to me,
      whose mind is smitten of God, That it may be no more with mortal things,
      And tell of her who lies there.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He seizes one of the angels.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Till you speak You shall not drift into eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ANGEL. The light beats down; the gates of pearl are wide. And she is
      passing to the floor of peace, And Mary of the seven times wounded heart
      Has kissed her lips, and the long blessed hair Has fallen on her face; The
      Light of Lights Looks always on the motive, not the deed, The Shadow of
      Shadows on the deed alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ALEEL releases the ANGEL and kneels.)
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Tell them who walk upon the floor of peace That I would die and go
      to her I love; The years like great black oxen tread the world, And God
      the herdsman goads them on behind, And I am broken by their passing feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      (A sound of far-off horns seems to come from the heart of the Light. The
      vision melts away, and the forms of the kneeling PEASANTS appear faintly
      in the darkness.)

                        NOTES
</pre>
    <p>
      I found the story of the Countess Cathleen in what professed to be a
      collection of Irish folk-lore in an Irish newspaper some years ago. I
      wrote to the compiler, asking about its source, but got no answer, but
      have since heard that it was translated from Les Matin`ees de Timoth`e
      Trimm a good many years ago, and has been drifting about the Irish press
      ever since. L`eo Lesp`es gives it as an Irish story, and though the editor
      of Folklore has kindly advertised for information, the only Christian
      variant I know of is a Donegal tale, given by Mr. Larminie in his West
      Irish Folk Tales and Romances, of a woman who goes to hell for ten years
      to save her husband, and stays there another ten, having been granted
      permission to carry away as many souls as could cling to her skirt. L`eo
      Lesp`es may have added a few details, but I have no doubt of the essential
      antiquity of what seems to me the most impressive form of one of the
      supreme parables of the world. The parable came to the Greeks in the
      sacrifice of Alcestis, but her sacrifice was less overwhelming, less
      apparently irremediable. L`eo Lesp`es tells the story as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ce que je vais vous dire est un r`ecit du car`eme Irlandais. Le boiteux,
      l'aveugle, le paralytique des rues de Dublin ou de Limerick, vous le
      diraient mieux que moi, cher lecteur, si vous alliez le leur demander, un
      sixpense d'argent `a la main.-Il n'est pas une jeune fille catholique `a
      laquelle on ne Fait appris pendant les jours de pr`eparation `a la
      communion sainte, pas un berger des bords de la Blackwater qui ne le
      puisse redire `a la veill`ee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Il y a bien longtemps qu'il apparut tout-`a-coup dans la vielle Irlande
      deux marchands inconnus dont personne n'avait oui parler, et qui parlaient
      n`eanmoins avec la plus grande perfection la langue du pays. Leurs cheveux
      `etaient noirs et ferr`es avec de l'or et leurs robes d'une grande
      magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tous deux semblaient avoir le m`eme age; ils paraissaient `etre des hommes
      de cinquante ans, car leur barbe grisormait un peu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, `a cette `epoque, comme aujourd'hui, l'Irlande `etait pauvre, car le
      soleil avait `et`e rare, et des r`ecoltes presque nulles. Les indigents ne
      savaient `a quel sainte se vouer, et la mis`ere devenai de plus en plus
      terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dans l'h`otellerie o`u descendirent les marchands fastueux on chercha `a
      p`en`etrer leurs desseins: mais cc fut en vain, ils demeur`erent
      silencieux et discrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Et pendant qu'ils demeur`erent dans l'h`otellerie, ils ne cess`erent de
      compter et de recompter des sacs de pi`eces d'or, dont la vive clart`e
      s'apercevait `a travers les vitres du logis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gentlemen, leur dit l'h`otesse un jour, d'o`u vient que vous `etes si
      opulents, et que, venus pour secourir la mis`ere publique, vous ne fassiez
      pas de bonnes oeuvres?
    </p>
    <p>
      -Belle h`otesse, r`epondit l'un d'eux, nous n'avons pas voulu aller
      au-devant d'infortunes honorables, dans la crainte d'`etre tromp`es par
      des mis`eres fictives: que la douleur frappe `a la porte, nous ouvrirons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Le lendemain, quand on sut qu'il existait deux opulents `etrangers pr`ets
      `a prodiguer l'or, la foule assi`egea leur logis; mais les figures des
      gens qui en sortaient `etaient bien diverses. Les uns avaient la fiert`e
      dans le regard, les autres portaient la honte au front. Les deux
      trafiquants achetaient des `ames pour le d`emon. L'`ame d'un vieillard
      valait vingt pi`eces d'or, pas un penny de plus; car Satan avait eu le
      temps d'y former hypoth`eque. L'`ame d'une `pouse en valait cinquante
      quand elle `etait jolie, ou cent quand elle `etait laide. L'`Ame d'une
      jeune fille se payait des prix fous: les fleurs les plus belles et les
      plus pures sont les plus ch`eres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pendant ce temps, il existait dans la ville un ange de beaut`e, la
      comtesse Ketty O'Connor. Elle `etait l'idole du peuple, et la providence
      des indigents. D`es qu'elle eut appris que des m`ecr`eants profitaient de
      la mis`ere publique pour d`erober des coeurs `a Dieu, elle fit appeler son
      majordome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Master Patrick, lui dit elle, combien ai-je de pi`eces d'or dans
      mon coffre?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Cent mille.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Combien de bijoux?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Pour autant d'argent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Combien de ch`ateaux, de bois et de terres?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Pour le double de ces sommes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Eh bien! Patrick, vendez tout cc qui n'est pas or et apportez-m'en
      le montant. je ne veux garder `a moi que ce castel et le champs qui
      l'entoure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deux jours apr`es, les ordres de la pieuse Ketty `etaient ex`ecues et le
      tr`esor `etait distribu`e aux pauvres au fur et `a mesure de leurs
      besoins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ceci ne faisait pas le compte, dit la tradition, des commisvoyageurs du
      malin esprit, qui ne trouvaient plus d'`ames `a acheter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aides par un valet infame, ils p`en`etr`erent dans la retraite de la noble
      dame et lui d`erob`erent le reste de son tr`esor... en vain lutta-t-elle
      de toutes ses forces pour sauver le contenu de son coffre, les larrons
      diaboliques furent les plus forts. Si Ketty avait eu les moyens de faire
      un signe de croix, ajoute la l`egende Irlandaise, elle les eut mis en
      fuite, mais ses mains `etaient captives-Le larcin fut effectu`e.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alors les pauvres sollicit`erent en vain pr`es de Ketty d`epouill`ee, elle
      ne pouvait plus secourir leur mis`ere;-elle les abandonnait `a la
      tentation. Pourtant il n'y avait plus que huit jours `a passer pour que
      les grains et les fourrages arrivassent en abondance des pays d'Orient.
      Mais, huit jours, c'`etait un si`ecle: huit jours n`ecessitaient une somme
      immense pour subvenir aux exigences de la disette, et les pauvres allaient
      ou expirer dans les angoisses de la faim, ou, reniant les saintes maximes
      de l'Evangile, vendre `a vil prix leur `ame, le plus beau pr`esent de la
      munificence du Seigneur toutpuissant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Et Ketty n'avait plus une obole, car elle avait abandonn`e son ch`ateaux
      aux malheureux.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elle passa douze heures dans les larmes et le deuil, arrachant ses cheveux
      couleur de soleil et meurtrissant son sein couleur du lis: puis elle se
      leva r`esolue, anim`ee par un vif sentiment de d`esespoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elle se rendit chez les marchands d'`ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Que voulez-vous? dirent ils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Vous achetez des `ames?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Oui, un peu malgr`e vous, n'est ce pas, sainte aux yeux de sapbir?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Aujourd'hui je viens vous proposer un march`e, reprit elle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Lequel?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;J'ai une `ame `a vendre; mais elle est ch`ere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Qu'importe si elle est pr`ecieuse? L'`ame, comme le diamant,
      s'appr`ecie `a sa blancheur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;C'est la mienne, dit Ketty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Les deux envoy`es de Satan tressaillirent, Leurs griffes s'allong`erent
      sous leurs gants de cuir; leurs yeux gris `etincel`erent:&mdash;l'`ame,
      pure, immacul`ee, virginale de Ketty c'`etait une acquisition
      inappr`eciable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Gentille dame, combien voulez-vouz?
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Cent cinquante mille `ecus d'or.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;C'est fait, dirent les marchands: et ils tendirent `a Ketty un
      parchemin cachet`e de noir, qu'elle signa en frissonnant.
    </p>
    <p>
      La somme lui fut compt`ee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Des qu'elle fut rentr`ee, elle dit au majordome:
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;Tenez, distribuez ceci. Avec la somme que je vous donne les pauvres
      attendront la huitaine n`ecessaire et pas une de leurs `ames ne sera
      livr`ee au d`emon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puis elle s'enferma et recommanda qu'on ne vint pas la d`eranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trois jours se pass`erent; elle n'appela pas; elle ne sortit pas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quand on ouvrit sa porte, on la trouva raide et froide: elle `etait morte
      de douleur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mais la vente de cette `ame si adorable dans sa charit`e fut d`eclar`ee
      nulle par le Seigneur: car elle avait sauv`e ses concitoyens de la morte
      `eternelle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apr`es la huitaine, des vaisseaux nombreux amen`erent l'Irlande affam`ee
      d'immenses provisions de grains.
    </p>
    <p>
      La famine n'`etait plus possible. Quant aux marchands, ils disparurent de
      leur h`otellerie, sans qu'on s`ut jamais ce qu'ils `etaient devenus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toutefois, les p`echeurs de la Blackwater pr`etendent qu'ils sont
      enchain`es dans une prison souterraine par ordre de Lucifer jusqu'au
      moment o`u ils pourront livrer l'`ame de Ketty qui leur a `echapp`e. je
      vous dis la l`egende telle que je la sais.
    </p>
    <p>
      -Mais les pauvres l'ont racont`e d'`age en `age et les enfants de Cork et
      de Dublin chantent encore la ballade dont voici les derniers couplets:-
    </p>
    <p>
      Pour sauver les pauvres qu'elle aime Ketty donna Son esprit, sa croyance
      m`eme Satan paya Cette `ame au d`evoument sublime, En `ecus d'or, Disons
      pour racheter son crime, Confiteor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mais l'ange qui se fit coupable Par charit`e
    </p>
    <p>
      Au s`ejour d'amour ineffable Est remont`e. Satan vaincu n'eut pas de prise
    </p>
    <p>
      Sur ce coeur d'or; Chantons sous la nef de l'`eglise, Confiteor.
    </p>
    <p>
      N'est ce pas que ce r`ecit, n`e de l'imagination des po`etes catholiques
      de la verte Erin, est une V`eritable r`ecit de car`eme?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess Cathleen was acted in Dublin in 1899, with Mr. Marcus St.
      John and Mr. Trevor Lowe as the First and Second Demon, Mr. Valentine
      Grace as Shemus Rua, Master Charles Sefton as Teig, Madame San Carola as
      Mary, Miss Florence Farr as Aleel, Miss Anna Mather as Oona, Mr. Charles
      Holmes as the Herdsman, Mr. Jack Wilcox as the Gardener, Mr. Walford as a
      Peasant, Miss Dorothy Paget as a Spirit, Miss M. Kelly as a Peasant Woman,
      Mr. T. E. Wilkinson as a Servant, and Miss May Whitty as The Countess
      Kathleen. They had to face a very vehement opposition stirred up by a
      politician and a newspaper, the one accusing me in a pamphlet, the other
      in long articles day after day, of blasphemy because of the language of
      the demons or of Shemus Rua, and because I made a woman sell her soul and
      yet escape damnation, and of a lack of patriotism because I made Irish men
      and women, who, it seems, never did such a thing, sell theirs. The
      politician or the newspaper persuaded some forty Catholic students to sign
      a protest against the play, and a Cardinal, who avowed that he had not
      read it, to make another, and both politician and newspaper made such
      obvious appeals to the audience to break the peace, that a score or so of
      police were sent to the theatre to see that they did not. I had, however,
      no reason to regret the result, for the stalls, containing almost all that
      was distinguished in Dublin, and a gallery of artisans alike insisted on
      the freedom of literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the performance in 1899 I added the love scene between Aleel and the
      Countess, and in this new form the play was revived in New York by Miss
      Wycherley as well as being played a good deal in England and America by
      amateurs. Now at last I have made a complete revision to make it suitable
      for performance at the Abbey Theatre. The first two scenes are almost
      wholly new, and throughout the play I have added or left out such passages
      as a stage experience of some years showed me encumbered the action; the
      play in its first form having been written before I knew anything of the
      theatre. I have left the old end, however, in the version printed in the
      body of this book, because the change for dramatic purposes has been made
      for no better reason than that audiences&mdash;even at the Abbey Theatre&mdash;are
      almost ignorant of Irish mythology or because a shallow stage made the
      elaborate vision of armed angels upon a mountain-side impossible. The new
      end is particularly suited to the Abbey stage, where the stage platform
      can be brought out in front of the prosceniurn and have a flight of steps
      at one side up which the Angel comes, crossing towards the back of the
      stage at the opposite side. The principal lighting is from two arc lights
      in the balcony which throw their lights into the faces of the players,
      making footlights unnecessary. The room at Shemus Rua's house is suggested
      by a great grey curtain-a colour which becomes full of rich tints under
      the stream of light from the arcs. The two or more arches in the third
      scene permit the use of a gauze. The short front scene before the last is
      just long enough when played with incidental music to allow the scene set
      behind it to be changed. The play when played without interval in this way
      lasts a little over an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The play was performed at the Abbey Theatre for the first time on December
      14, 1911, Miss Maire O'Neill taking the part of the Countess, and the last
      scene from the going out of the Merchants was as follows:-
    </p>
    <p>
      (MERCHANTS rush out. ALEEL crawls into the middle of the room; the
      twilight has fallen and gradually darkens as the scene goes on.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. They're rising up-they're rising through the earth, Fat Asmodel and
      giddy Belial, And all the fiends. Now they leap in the air. But why does
      Hell's gate creak so? Round and round, Hither and hither, to and fro
      they're running.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moves about as though the air was full of spirits. OONA enters.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Crouch down, old heron, out of the blind storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Where is the Countess Cathleen? All this day Her eyes were full of
      tears, and when for a moment Her hand was laid upon my hand, it trembled.
      And now I do not know where she is gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Cathleen has chosen other friends than us, And they are rising
      through the hollow world. Demons are out, old heron.
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. God guard her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. She's bartered it away this very hour, As though we two were never
      in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      (He kneels beside her, but does not seem to hear her words. The PEASANTS
      return. They carry the COUNTESS CATHLEEN and lay her upon the ground
      before OONA and ALEEL. She lies there as if dead.)
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. O, that so many pitchers of rough clay Should prosper and the
      porcelain break in two!
    </p>
    <p>
      (She kisses the hands Of CATHLEEN.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT. We were under the tree where the path turns When she grew pale
      as death and fainted away.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. O! hold me, and hold me tightly, for the storm is dragging me
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      (OONA takes her in her arms. A WOMAN begins to wail.)
    </p>
    <p>
      PEASANTS. Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      PEASANTS Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      PEASANT WOMEN. Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      OTHER PEASANT WOMEN. Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. (half rising) Lay all the bags of money in a heap, And when I am
      gone, old Oona, share them out To every man and woman: judge, and give
      According to their needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT WOMAN. And will she give Enough to keep my children through the
      dearth?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANOTHER PEASANT WOMAN. O, Queen of Heaven, and all you blessed saints, Let
      us and ours be lost, so she be shriven.
    </p>
    <p>
      CATHLEEN. Bend down your faces, Oona and Aleel; I gaze upon them as the
      swallow gazes Upon the nest under the eave, before She wander the loud
      waters. Do not weep Too great a while, for there is many a candle On the
      High Altar though one fall. Aleel, Who sang about the dancers of the
      woods, That know not the hard burden of the world, Having but breath in
      their kind bodies, farewell And farewell, Oona, you who played with me And
      bore me in your arms about the house When I was but a child-and therefore
      happy, Therefore happy even like those that dance. The storm is in my hair
      and I must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      (She dies.)
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Bring me the looking-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      (A WOMAN brings it to her out of inner room. OONA holds glass over the
      lips of CATHLEEN. All is Silent for a moment, then she speaks in a
      half-scream.)
    </p>
    <p>
      O, she is dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT. She was the great white lily of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT. She was more beautiful than the pale stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      AN OLD PEASANT WOMAN. The little plant I loved is broken in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ALEEL takes looking-glass from OONA and flings it upon floor, so that it
      is broken in many pieces.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. I shatter you in fragments, for the face That brimmed you up with
      beauty is no more; And die, dull heart, for you that were a mirror Are but
      a ball of passionate dust again! And level earth and plumy sea, rise up!
      And haughty sky, fall down!
    </p>
    <p>
      A PEASANT WOMAN. Pull him upon his knees, His curses will pluck lightning
      on our heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALEEL. Angels and devils clash in the middle air, And brazen swords clang
      upon brazen helms. Look, look, a spear has gone through Belial's eye!
    </p>
    <p>
      (A winged ANGEL, carrying a torch and a sword, enters from the R. with
      eyes fixed upon some distant thing. The ANGEL is about to pass out to the
      L. when ALEEL speaks. The ANGEL Stops a moment and turns.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Look no more on the half-closed gates of Hell, But speak to me whose mind
      is smitten of God, That it may be no more with mortal things: And tell of
      her who lies there.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The ANGEL turns again and is about to go, but is seized by ALEEL.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Till you speak You shall not drift into eternity. ANGEL. The light beats
      down; the gates of pearl are wide. And she is passing to the floor of
      peace, And Mary of the seven times wounded heart Has kissed her lips, and
      the long blessed hair Has fallen on her face; the Light of Lights Looks
      always on the motive, not the deed, The Shadow of Shadows on the deed
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      (ALEEL releases the ANGEL and kneels.)
    </p>
    <p>
      OONA. Tell them who walk upon the floor of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      That I would die and go to her I love, The years like great black oxen
      tread the world, And God the herdsman goads them on behind, And I am
      broken by their passing feet.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
