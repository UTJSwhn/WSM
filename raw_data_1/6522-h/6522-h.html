<h2>I</h2>

<p>
Bid me and I shall gather my fruits to bring them in full baskets into your
courtyard, though some are lost and some not ripe.
</p>

<p>
For the season grows heavy with its fulness, and there is a plaintive
shepherd's pipe in the shade.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Bid me and I shall set sail on the river.
</p>

<p>
The March wind is fretful, fretting the languid waves into murmurs.
</p>

<p>
The garden has yielded its all, and in the weary hour of evening the call comes
from your house on the shore in the sunset.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<a name="02"></a>
<h2>II</h2>

<p>
My life when young was like a flower -- a flower that loosens a petal or two from
her abundance and never feels the loss when the spring breeze comes to beg at
her door.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Now at the end of youth my life is like a fruit, having nothing to spare, and
waiting to offer herself completely with her full burden of sweetness.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<a name="03"></a>
<h2>III</h2>

<p>
Is summer's festival only for fresh blossoms and not also for withered
leaves and faded flowers?
</p>

<p>
Is the song of the sea in tune only with the rising waves?
</p>

<p>
Does it not also sing with the waves that fall?
</p>

<p>
Jewels are woven into the carpet where stands my king, but there are patient
clods waiting to be touched by his feet.
</p>

<p>
Few are the wise and the great who sit by my Master, but he has taken the
foolish in his arms and made me his servant for ever.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<a name="04"></a>
<h2>IV</h2>

<p>
I woke and found his letter with the morning.
</p>

<p>
I do not know what it says, for I cannot read.
</p>

<p>
I shall leave the wise man alone with his books, I shall not trouble him, for
who knows if he can read what the letter says.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Let me hold it to my forehead and press it to my heart.
</p>

<p>
When the night grows still and stars come out one by one I will spread it on my
lap and stay silent.
</p>

<p>
The rustling leaves will read it aloud to me, the rushing stream will chant it,
and the seven wise stars will sing it to me from the sky.
</p>

<p>
I cannot find what I seek, I cannot understand what I would learn; but this
unread letter has lightened my burdens and turned my thoughts into songs.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<a name="05"></a>
<h2>V</h2>

<p>
A handful of dust could hide your signal when I did not know its meaning.
</p>

<p>
Now that I am wiser I read it in all that hid it before.
</p>

<p class="p1">
It is painted in petals of flowers; waves flash it from their foam; hills hold
it high on their summits.
</p>

<p>
I had my face turned from you, therefore I read the letters awry and knew not
their meaning.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<a name="06"></a>
<h2>VI</h2>

<p>
Where roads are made I lose my way.
</p>

<p>
In the wide water, in the blue sky there is no line of a track.
</p>

<p>
The pathway is hidden by the birds' wings, by the star-fires, by the
flowers of the wayfaring seasons.
</p>

<p>
And I ask my heart if its blood carries the wisdom of the unseen way.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<a name="07"></a>
<h2>VII</h2>

<p>
Alas, I cannot stay in the house, and home has become no home to me, for the
eternal Stranger calls, he is going along the road.
</p>

<p>
The sound of his footfall knocks at my breast; it pains me!
</p>

<p>
The wind is up, the sea is moaning. I leave all my cares and doubts to follow
the homeless tide, for the Stranger calls me, he is going along the road.
</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>

<p>
Be ready to launch forth, my heart! and let those linger who must.
</p>

<p>
For your name has been called in the morning sky.
</p>

<p>
Wait for none!
</p>

<p class="p1">
The desire of the bud is for the night and dew, but the blown flower cries for
the freedom of light.
</p>

<p>
Burst your sheath, my heart, and come forth!
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<a name="09"></a>
<h2>IX</h2>

<p>
When I lingered among my hoarded treasure I felt like a worm that feeds in the
dark upon the fruit where it was born.
</p>

<p>
I leave this prison of decay.
</p>

<p>
I care not to haunt the mouldy stillness, for I go in search of everlasting
youth; I throw away all that is not one with my life nor as light as my
laughter.
</p>

<p>
I run through time and, O my heart, in your chariot dances the poet who sings
while he wanders.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">
<a name="10"></a>
<h2>X</h2>

<p>
You took my hand and drew me to your side, made me sit on the high seat before
all men, till I became timid, unable to stir and walk my own way; doubting and
debating at every step lest I should tread upon any thorn of their disfavour.
</p>

<p class="p1">
I am freed at last!
</p>

<p>
The blow has come, the drum of insult sounded, my seat is laid low in the dust.
</p>

<p>
My paths are open before me.
</p>

<p class="p1">
My wings are full of the desire of the sky.
</p>

<p>
I go to join the shooting stars of midnight, to plunge into the profound
shadow.
</p>

<p>
I am like the storm-driven cloud of summer that, having cast off its crown of
gold, hangs as a sword the thunderbolt upon a chain of lightning.
</p>

<p>
In desperate joy I run upon the dusty path of the despised; I draw near to your
final welcome.
</p>

<p class="p1">
The child finds its mother when it leaves her womb.
</p>

<p>
When I am parted from you, thrown out from your household, I am free to see
your face.
</p>

<h2>XI</h2>

<p>
It decks me only to mock me, this jewelled chain of mine.
</p>

<p>
It bruises me when on my neck, it strangles me when I struggle to tear it off.
</p>

<p>
It grips my throat, it chokes my singing.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Could I but offer it to your hand, my Lord, I would be saved.
</p>

<p>
Take it from me, and in exchange bind me to you with a garland, for I am
ashamed to stand before you with this jewelled chain on my neck.
</p>

<p>
Far below flowed the Jumna, swift and clear, above frowned the jutting bank.
</p>

<p>
Hills dark with the woods and scarred with the torrents were gathered around.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Govinda, the great Sikh teacher, sat on the rock reading scriptures, when
Raghunath, his disciple, proud of his wealth, came and bowed to him and said,
"I have brought my poor present unworthy of your acceptance."
</p>

<p class="p1">
Thus saying he displayed before the teacher a pair of gold bangles wrought with
costly stones.
</p>

<p>
The master took up one of them, twirling it round his finger, and the diamonds
darted shafts of light.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly it slipped from his hand and rolled down the bank into the water.
</p>

<p>
"Alas," screamed Raghunath, and jumped into the stream.
</p>

<p>
The teacher set his eyes upon his book, and the water held and hid what it
stole and went its way.
</p>

<p>
The daylight faded when Raghunath came back to the teacher tired and dripping.
</p>

<p>
He panted and said, "I can still get it back if you show me where it
fell."
</p>

<p>
The teacher took up the remaining bangle and throwing it into the water said,
"It is there."
</p>

<p>
To move is to meet you every moment,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellow-traveller!
</p>

<p>
It is to sing to the falling of your feet.
</p>

<p>
He whom your breath touches does not glide by the shelter of the bank.
</p>

<p>
He spreads a reckless sail to the wind and rides the turbulent water.
</p>

<p class="p1">
He who throws his doors open and steps onward receives your greeting.
</p>

<p>
He does not stay to count his gain or to mourn his loss; his heart beats the
drum for his march, for that is to march with you every step,
</p>

<p>
Fellow-traveller!

<p>
My portion of the best in this world will come from your hands: such was your
promise.
</p>

<p>
Therefore your light glistens in my tears.
</p>

<p>
I fear to be led by others lest I miss you waiting in some road corner to be my
guide.
</p>

<p class="p1">
I walk my own wilful way till my very folly tempts you to my door.
</p>

<p>
For I have your promise that my portion of the best in this world will come
from your hands.

<p>
Your speech is simple, my Master, but not theirs who talk of you.
</p>

<p>
I understand the voice of your stars and the silence of your trees.
</p>

<p>
I know that my heart would open like a flower; that my life has filled itself
at a hidden fountain.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Your songs, like birds from the lonely land of snow, are winging to build their
nests in my heart against the warmth of its April, and I am content to wait for
the merry season.

<p>
They knew the way and went to seek you along the narrow lane, but I wandered
abroad into the night for I was ignorant.
</p>

<p>
I was not schooled enough to be afraid of you in the dark, therefore I came
upon your doorstep unaware.
</p>

<p>
The wise rebuked me and bade me be gone, for I had not come by the lane.
</p>

<p>
I turned away in doubt, but you held me fast, and their scolding became louder
every day.

<p>
I brought out my earthen lamp from my house and cried, "Come, children, I
will light your path!"
</p>

<p class="p1">
The night was still dark when I returned, leaving the road to its silence,
crying, "Light me, O Fire! for my earthen lamp lies broken in the
dust!"

<p>
No: it is not yours to open buds into blossoms.
</p>

<p>
Shake the bud, strike it; it is beyond your power to make it blossom.
</p>

<p>
Your touch soils it, you tear its petals to pieces and strew them in the dust.
</p>

<p>
But no colours appear, and no perfume.
</p>

<p>
Ah! it is not for you to open the bud into a blossom.
</p>

<p class="p1">
He who can open the bud does it so simply.
</p>

<p>
He gives it a glance, and the life-sap stirs through its veins.
</p>

<p>
At his breath the flower spreads its wings and flutters in the wind.
</p>

<p>
Colours flush out like heart-longings, the perfume betrays a sweet secret.
</p>

<p>
He who can open the bud does it so simply.

<p>
Sud&#257;s, the gardener, plucked from his tank the last lotus left by the ravage of
winter and went to sell it to the king at the palace gate.
</p>

<p>
There he met a traveller who said to him, "Ask your price for the last
lotus, -- I shall offer it to Lord Buddha."
</p>

<p>
Sud&#257;s said, "If you pay one golden <i>m&#257;sh&#257;</i> it will
be yours."
</p>

<p>
The traveller paid it.
</p>

<p class="p1">
At that moment the king came out and he wished to buy the flower, for he was on
his way to see Lord Buddha, and he thought, "It would be a fine thing to
lay at his feet the lotus that bloomed in winter."
</p>

<p>
When the gardener said he had been offered a golden <i>m&#257;sh&#257;</i>
the king offered him ten, but the traveller doubled the price.
</p>

<p>
The gardener, being greedy, imagined a greater gain from him for whose sake
they were bidding. He bowed and said, "I cannot sell this lotus."
</p>

<p>
In the hushed shade of the mango grove beyond the city wall Sud&#257;s stood before
Lord Buddha, on whose lips sat the silence of love and whose eyes beamed peace
like the morning star of the dew-washed autumn.
</p>

<p>
Sud&#257;s looked in his face and put the lotus at his feet and bowed his head to
the dust.
</p>

<p>
Buddha smiled and asked, "What is your wish, my son?"
</p>

<p>
Sud&#257;s cried, "The least touch of your feet."

<p>
MAKE me thy poet, O Night, veiled Night!
</p>

<p>
There are some who have sat speechless for ages in thy shadow; let me utter
their songs.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Take me up on thy chariot without wheels, running noiselessly from world to
world, thou queen in the palace of time, thou darkly beautiful!
</p>

<p class="p1">
Many a questioning mind has stealthily entered thy courtyard and roamed through
thy lampless house seeking for answers.
</p>

<p>
From many a heart, pierced with the arrow of joy from the hands of the Unknown,
have burst forth glad chants, shaking the darkness to its foundation.
</p>

<p>
Those wakeful souls gaze in the starlight in wonder at the treasure they have
suddenly found.

<p>
Make me their poet, O Night, the poet of thy fathomless silence.

<p>
I will meet one day the Life within me, the joy that hides in my life, though
the days perplex my path with their idle dust.
</p>

<p>
I have known it in glimpses, and its fitful breath has come upon me, making my
thoughts fragrant for a while.
</p>

<p>
I will meet one day the Joy without me that dwells behind the screen of
light -- and will stand in the overflowing solitude where all things are seen as
by their creator.

<p>
This autumn morning is tired with excess of light, and if your songs grow
fitful and languid give me your flute awhile.
</p>

<p class="p1">
I shall but play with it as the whim takes me, -- now take it on my lap, now
touch it with my lips, now keep it by my side on the grass.
</p>

<p class="p1">
But in the solemn evening stillness I shall gather flowers, to deck it with
wreaths, I shall fill it with fragrance; I shall worship it with the lighted
lamp.
</p>

<p>
Then at night I shall come to you and give you back your flute.
</p>

<p>
You will play on it the music of midnight when the lonely crescent moon wanders
among the stars.

Now when the sun has set and the darkened sky draws upon the sea like drooping
lashes upon a weary eye it is time to take away his pen, and let his thoughts
sink into the bottom of the deep amid the eternal secret of that silence.

The night is dark and your slumber is deep in the hush of my being.
</p>

<p>
Wake, O Pain of Love, for I know not how to open the door, and I stand outside.
</p>

<p class="p1">
The hours wait, the stars watch, the wind is still, the silence is heavy in my
heart.

The bird of the morning sings.
</p>

<p>
Whence has he word of the morning before the morning breaks, and when the
dragon night still holds the sky in its cold black coils?
</p>

<p class="p1">
Tell me, bird of the morning, how, through the twofold night of the sky and the
leaves, he found his way into your dream, the messenger out of the east?
</p>

<p>
The world did not believe you when you cried, "The sun is on his way, the
night is no more."
</p>

<p>
O sleeper, awake!
</p>

<p>
Bare your forehead, waiting for the first blessing of light, and sing with the
bird of the morning in glad faith.

<p>
The beggar in me lifted his lean hands to the starless sky and cried into
night's ear with his hungry voice.
</p>

<p>
His prayers were to the blind Darkness who lay like a fallen god in a desolate
heaven of lost hopes.
</p>

<p>
The cry of desire eddied round a chasm of despair, a wailing bird circling its
empty nest.
</p>

<p class="p1">
But when morning dropped anchor at the rim of the East, the beggar in me leapt
and cried:
</p>

<p>
"Blessed am I that the deaf night denied me -- that its coffer was
empty."

He cried, "O Life, O Light, you are precious! and precious is the joy
that at last has known you!"

San&#257;tan was telling his beads by the Ganges when a Brahmin in rags came to him
and said, "Help me, I am poor!"
</p>

<p>
"My alms-bowl is all that is my own," said San&#257;tan, "I have
given away everything I had."
</p>

<p>
"But my lord Shiva came to me in my dreams," said the Brahmin,
"and counselled me to come to you."
</p>

<p>
San&#257;tan suddenly remembered he had picked up a stone without price among the
pebbles on the river-bank, and thinking that some one might need it hid it in
the sands.
</p>

<p class="p1">
He pointed out the spot to the Brahmin, who wondering dug up the stone.
</p>

<p>
The Brahmin sat on the earth and mused alone till the sun went down behind the
trees, and cowherds went home with their cattle.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Then he rose and came slowly to San&#257;tan and said, "Master, give me the
least fraction of the wealth that disdains all the wealth of the world."
</p>

<p>
And he threw the precious stone into the water.

Time after time I came to your gate with raised hands, asking for more and yet

<p>
You gave and gave, now in slow measure, now in sudden excess.
</p>

<p>
I took some, and some things I let drop; some lay heavy on my hands; some I
made into playthings and broke them when tired; till the wrecks and the hoard
of your gifts grew immense, hiding you, and the ceaseless expectation wore my
heart out.
</p>

<p>
Take, oh take -- has now become my cry.
</p>

<p>
Shatter all from this beggar's bowl: put out this lamp of the importunate
watcher: hold my hands, raise me from the still-gathering heap of your gifts

A smile of mirth spread over the sky when you dressed my heart in rags and sent
her forth into the road to beg.

<p>
She went from door to door, and many a time when her bowl was nearly full she
was robbed.

"Who among you will take up the duty of feeding the hungry?" Lord
Buddha asked his followers when famine raged at Shravasti.

Ratn&#257;kar, the banker, hung his head and said, "Much more is needed than
all my wealth to feed the hungry."

Jaysen, the chief of the King's army, said, "I would gladly give my

My king was unknown to me, therefore when he claimed his tribute I was bold to

I fled and fled behind my day's work and my night's dreams.

Thus I came to know that I am known to him and no place left which is mine.

"Sire," announced the servant to the King, "the saint
Narottam has never deigned to enter your royal temple.
</p>

<p>
"He is singing God's praise under the trees by the open road. The
temple is empty of worshippers.
</p>

<p>
"They flock round him like bees round the white lotus, leaving the golden
jar of honey unheeded."
</p>

<p class="p1">
The King, vexed at heart, went to the spot where Narottam sat on the grass.
</p>

<p>
He asked him, "Father, why leave my temple of the golden dome and sit on
the dust outside to preach God's love?"
</p>

<p>
"Because God is not there in your temple," said Narottam.
</p>

<p>
The King frowned and said, "Do you know, twenty millions of gold went to
the making of that marvel of art, and it was consecrated to God with costly
rites?"
</p>

<p class="p1">
"Yes, I know it," answered Narottam. "It was in that year
when thousands of your people whose houses had been burned stood vainly asking
for help at your door.
</p>

<p>
"And God said, 'The poor creature who can give no shelter to his
brothers would build my house!'
</p>

<p>
"And he took his place with the shelterless under the trees by the road.
</p>

<p>
"And that golden bubble is empty of all but hot vapour of pride."
</p>

The King cried in anger, "Leave my land."

Calmly said the saint, "Yes, banish me where you have banished my
God."

The trumpet lies in the dust.

The wind is weary, the light is dead.

Ah, the evil day!

<p>
Come, fighters, carrying your flags, and singers, with your war-songs!

<p>
Come, pilgrims of the march, hurrying on your journey!
</p>

<p>
The trumpet lies in the dust waiting for us.
</p>

<p class="p1">
I was on my way to the temple with my evening offerings, seeking for a place of
rest after the day's dusty toil: hoping my hurts would be healed and the
stains in my garment washed white, when I found thy trumpet lying in the dust.

<p>
Was it not the hour for me to light my evening lamp?

<p>
Had not the night sung its lullaby to the stars?
</p>

<p>
O thou blood-red rose, my poppies of sleep have paled and faded!

I was certain my wanderings were over and my debts all paid when suddenly I

Strike my drowsy heart with thy spell of youth!

Let my joy in life blaze up in fire. Let the shafts of awakening fly through
the heart of night, and a thrill of dread shake blindness and palsy.

<p>
I have come to raise thy trumpet from the dust.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Sleep is no more for me -- my walk shall be through showers of arrows.
</p>

<p>
Some shall run out of their houses and come to my side -- some shall weep.

Some in their beds shall toss and groan in dire dreams.

<p>
For to-night thy trumpet shall be sounded.

From thee I have asked peace only to find shame.

Now I stand before thee -- help me to put on my armour!

Let hard blows of trouble strike fire into my life.

<p>
When, mad in their mirth, they raised dust to soil thy robe, O Beautiful, it
made my heart sick.
</p>

<p>
I cried to thee and said, "Take thy rod of punishment and judge
them."
</p>

<p>
The morning light struck upon those eyes, red with the revel of night; the
place of the white lily greeted their burning breath; the stars through the
depth of the sacred dark stared at their carousing -- at those that raised dust
to soil thy robe, O Beautiful!
</p>

<p>
Thy judgment seat was in the flower garden, in the birds' notes in
springtime: in the shady river-banks, where the trees muttered in answer to the
muttering of the waves.
</p>

<p class="p1">
O my Lover, they were pitiless in their passion.
</p>

<p>
They prowled in the dark to snatch thy ornaments to deck their own desires.
</p>

<p>
When they had struck thee and thou wert pained, it pierced me to the quick, and
I cried to thee and said, "Take thy sword, O my Lover, and judge
them!"
</p>

<p>
Ah, but thy justice was vigilant.
</p>

<p>
A mother's tears were shed on their insolence; the imperishable faith of
a lover hid their spears of rebellion in its own wounds.
</p>

<p>
Thy judgment was in the mute pain of sleepless love: in the blush of the
chaste: in the tears of the night of the desolate: in the pale morning-light of
forgiveness.
</p>

<p class="p1">
O Terrible, they in their reckless greed climbed thy gate at night, breaking
into thy storehouse to rob thee.
</p>

<p>
But the weight of their plunder grew immense, too heavy to carry or to remove.
</p>

<p>
Thereupon I cried to thee and said, Forgive them, O Terrible!
</p>

<p>
Thy forgiveness burst in storms, throwing them down, scattering their thefts in
the dust.
</p>

<p>
Thy forgiveness was in the thunder-stone; in the shower of blood; in the angry
red of the sunset.

Upagupta, the disciple of Buddha, lay asleep on the dust by the city wall of
Mathura.
</p>

<p>
Lamps were all out, doors were all shut, and stars were all hidden by the murky
sky of August.
</p>

<p>
Whose feet were those tinkling with anklets, touching his breast of a sudden?
</p>

<p>
He woke up startled, and the light from a woman's lamp struck his
forgiving eyes.
</p>

<p>
It was the dancing girl, starred with jewels, clouded with a pale-blue mantle,
drunk with the wine of her youth.
</p>

<p class="p1">
She lowered her lamp and saw the young face, austerely beautiful.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, young ascetic," said the woman; "graciously come
to my house. The dusty earth is not a fit bed for you."
</p>

<p>
The ascetic answered, "Woman, go on your way; when the time is ripe I
will come to you."
</p>

<p class="p1">
Suddenly the black night showed its teeth in a flash of lightning.

<p>
The storm growled from the corner of the sky, and the woman trembled in fear.
</p>

<p class="center">
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The branches of the wayside trees were aching with blossom.

<p>
Gay notes of the flute came floating in the warm spring air from afar.
</p>

<p>
The citizens had gone to the woods, to the festival of flowers.
</p>

<p>
From the mid-sky gazed the full moon on the shadows of the silent town.
</p>

<p>
The young ascetic was walking in the lonely street, while overhead the lovesick
<i>koels</i> urged from the mango branches their sleepless plaint.
</p>

<p>
Upagupta passed through the city gates, and stood at the base of the rampart.
</p>

<p>
What woman lay in the shadow of the wall at his feet, struck with the black
pestilence, her body spotted with sores, hurriedly driven away from the town?
</p>

<p class="p1">
The ascetic sat by her side, taking her head on his knees, and moistened her
lips with water and smeared her body with balm.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, merciful one?" asked the woman.
</p>

<p>
"The time, at last, has come to visit you, and I am here," replied
the young ascetic.

Again and again the banks have burst, letting the flood sweep away my harvest,

The Boatman is out crossing the wild sea at night.

The mast is aching because of its full sails filled with the violent wind.
</p>

<p>
Stung with the night's fang the sky falls upon the sea, poisoned with
black fear.
</p>

<p>
The waves dash their heads against the dark unseen, and the Boatman is out
crossing the wild sea.
</p>

<p class="p1">
The Boatman is out, I know not for what tryst, startling the night with the
sudden white of his sails.
</p>

<p>
I know not at what shore, at last, he lands to reach the silent courtyard where
the lamp is burning and to find her who sits in the dust and waits.
</p>

<p>
What is the quest that makes his boat care not for storm nor darkness?
</p>

<p>
Is it heavy with gems and pearls?
</p>

<p>
Ah, no, the Boatman brings with him no treasure, but only a white rose in his
hand and a song on his lips.
</p>

<p>
It is for her who watches alone at night with her lamp burning.
</p>

<p class="p1">
She dwells in the wayside hut. Her loose hair flies in the wind and hides her
eyes.

The storm shrieks through her broken doors, the light flickers in her earthen
lamp flinging shadows on the walls.

Through the howl of the winds she hears him call her name, she whose name is
unknown.

It is long since the Boatman sailed. It will be long before the day breaks and
he knocks at the door.

The drums will not be beaten and none will know.

Over the relic of Lord Buddha King Bimbis&#257;r built a shrine, a salutation in
white marble.
</p>

<p>
There in the evening would come all the brides and daughters of the
King's house to offer flowers and light lamps.
</p>

<p class="p1">
When the son became king in his time he washed his father's creed away
with blood, and lit sacrificial fires with its sacred books.

<p class="p1">
The autumn day was dying.
</p>

<p>
The evening hour of worship was near.
</p>

<p>
Shrimati, the queen's maid, devoted to Lord Buddha, having bathed in holy
water, and decked the golden tray with lamps and fresh white blossoms, silently
raised her dark eyes to the queen's face.
</p>

<p class="p1">
The queen shuddered in fear and said, "Do you not know, foolish girl,
that death is the penalty for whoever brings worship to Buddha's shrine?
</p>

<p>
"Such is the king's will."
</p>

<p class="p1">
Shrimati bowed to the queen, and turning away from her door came and stood
before Amit&#257;, the newly wed bride of the king's son.
</p>

<p>
A mirror of burnished gold on her lap, the newly wed bride was braiding her
dark long tresses and painting the red spot of good luck at the parting of her
hair.
</p>

<p>
Her hands trembled when she saw the young maid, and she cried, "What
fearful peril would you bring me! Leave me this instant."
</p>

<p>
Princess Shukl&#257; sat at the window reading her book of romance by the light of
the setting sun.
</p>

<p>
She started when she saw at her door the maid with the sacred offerings.
</p>

<p>
Her book fell down from her lap, and she whispered in Shrimati's ears,
"Rush not to death, daring woman!"
</p>

<p class="p1">
Shrimati walked from door to door.
</p>

<p>
She raised her head and cried, "O women of the king's house,
hasten!
</p>

<p>
"The time for our Lord's worship is come!"
</p>

<p>
Some shut their doors in her face and some reviled her.
</p>

<p>
The last gleam of daylight faded from the bronze dome of the palace tower.
</p>

<p>
Deep shadows settled in street corners: the bustle of the city was hushed: the
gong at the temple of Shiva announced the time of the evening prayer.
</p>

<p>
In the dark of the autumn evening, deep as a limpid lake, stars throbbed with
light, when the guards of the palace garden were startled to see through the
trees a row of lamps burning at the shrine of Buddha.
</p>

<p>
They ran with their swords unsheathed, crying, "Who are you, foolish one,
reckless of death?"
</p>

<p class="p1">
"I am Shrimati," replied a sweet voice, "the servant of Lord
Buddha."
</p>

<p>
The next moment her heart's blood coloured the cold marble with its red.
</p>

<p>
And in the still hour of stars died the light of the last lamp of worship at
the foot of the shrine.

I found a few old letters of mine carefully hidden in her box -- a few small toys
for her memory to play with.
</p>

<p>
With a timorous heart she tried to steal these trifles from time's
turbulent stream, and said, "These are mine only!"
</p>

<p class="p1">
Ah, there is no one now to claim them, who can pay their price with loving
care, yet here they are still.
</p>

<p>
Surely there is love in this world to save her from utter loss, even like this
love of hers that saved these letters with such fond care.

You hide your treasure in the palm of your hand, and we cry that we are robbed.

If to leave this world be as real as to love it -- then there must be a meaning

Tulsidas, the poet, was wandering, deep in thought, by the Ganges, in that
lonely spot where they burn their dead.
</p>

<p>
He found a woman sitting at the feet of the corpse of her dead husband, gaily
dressed as for a wedding.
</p>

<p>
She rose as she saw him, bowed to him, and said, "Permit me, Master, with
your blessing, to follow my husband to heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Why such hurry, my daughter?" asked Tulsidas. "Is not this
earth also His who made heaven?"
</p>

<p>
"For heaven I do not long," said the woman. "I want my
husband."
</p>

<p>
Tulsidas smiled and said to her, "Go back to your home, my child. Before
the month is over you will find your husband."
</p>

<p>
The woman went back with glad hope. Tulsidas came to her every day and gave her
high thoughts to think, till her heart was filled to the brim with divine love.
</p>

<p>
When the month was scarcely over, her neighbours came to her, asking,
"Woman, have you found your husband?"
</p>

<p>
The widow smiled and said, "I have."

Eagerly they asked, "Where is he?"

She who is ever returning to God his own outflo wing of sweetness; she is the

sings in the morning light; she with heaving waves suckles the thirsty earth;

<p>
A smile shone in her face for a moment, then it faded.
</p>

<p>
"I have no joy in thee," she cried, the woman in sorrow.
</p>

<p class="p1">
I bought her jewelled anklets and fanned her with a fan gem-studded; I made her
a bed on a bedstead of gold.

There flickered a gleam of gladness in her eyes, then it died.

<p>
"I have no joy in these," she cried, the woman in sorrow.

I seated her upon a car of triumph and drove her from end to end of the earth.

<p>
The sun had set on the western margin of the river among the tangle of the
forest.
</p>

<p>
The hermit boys had brought the cattle home, and sat round the fire to listen
to the master, Guatama, when a strange boy came, and greeted him with fruits
and flowers, and, bowing low at his feet, spoke in a bird-like
voice -- "Lord, I have come to thee to be taken into the path of the
supreme Truth.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Satyak&#257;ma."
</p>

<p>
"Blessings be on thy head," said the master.
</p>

<p>
"Of what clan art thou, my child? It is only fitting for a Brahmin to
aspire to the highest wisdom."
</p>

<p>
"Master," answered the boy, "I know not of what clan I am. I
shall go and ask my mother."
</p>

<p class="p1">
Thus saying, Satyak&#257;ma took leave, and wading across the shallow
stream, came back to his mother's hut, which stood at the end of the
sandy waste at the edge of the sleeping village.
</p>

<p>
The lamp burnt dimly in the room, and the mother stood at the door in the dark
waiting for her son's return.
</p>

<p class="p1">
She clasped him to her bosom, kissed him on his hair, and asked him of his
errand to the master.
</p>

<p>
"What is the name of my father, dear mother?" asked the boy.
</p>

<p>
"It is only fitting for a Brahmin to aspire to the highest wisdom, said
Lord Guatama to me."
</p>

<p>
The woman lowered her eyes, and spoke in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"In my youth I was poor and had many masters. Thou didst come to thy
mother Jab&#257;l&#257;'s arms, my darling, who had no husband."
</p>

<p class="p1">
The early rays of the sun glistened on the tree-tops of the forest hermitage.
</p>

<p>
The students, with their tangled hair still wet with their morning bath, sat
under the ancient tree, before the master.
</p>

<p>
There came Satyak&#257;ma.
</p>

<p>
He bowed low at the feet of the sage, and stood silent.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," the great teacher asked him, "of what clan art
thou?"
</p>

<p>
"My lord," he answered, "I know it not. My mother said when I
asked her, 'I had served many masters in my youth, and thou hadst come to
thy mother Jab&#257;l&#257;'s arms, who had no husband.'"
</p>

<p>
There rose a murmur like the angry hum of bees disturbed in their hive; and the
students muttered at the shameless insolence of that outcast.
</p>

<p>
Master Guatama rose from his seat, stretched out his arms, took the boy to his
bosom, and said, "Best of all Brahmins art thou, my child. Thou hast the
noblest heritage of truth."

<h2>LXXXIII</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>
I feel that all the stars shine in me. The world breaks into my life like a
flood.
</p>

<p>
The flowers blossom in my body. All the youthfulness of land and water smokes
like an incense in my heart; and the breath of all things plays on my thoughts
as on a flute.
</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>
When the world sleeps I come to your door.
</p>

<p>
The stars are silent, and I am afraid to sing.
</p>

<p>
I wait and watch, till your shadow passes by the balcony of night and I return
with a full heart.
</p>

<p>
Then in the morning I sing by the roadside;
</p>

<p>
The flowers in the hedge give me answer and the morning air listens,
</p>

<p>
The travellers suddenly stop and look in my face, thinking I have called them
by their names.
</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>
Keep me at your door ever attending to your wishes, and let me go about in your
Kingdom accepting your call.
</p>

<p>
Let me not sink and disappear in the depth of languor.
</p>

<p>
Let not my life be worn out to tatters by penury of waste.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Let not those doubts encompass me, -- the dust of distractions.
</p>

<p>
Let me not pursue many paths to gather many things.
</p>

<p>
Let me not bend my heart to the yoke of the many.
</p>

<p>
Let me hold my head high in the courage and pride of being your servant.

<h2>LXXXIV<br/>
THE OARSMEN</h2>

<p>
Do you hear the tumult of death afar,<br/>
The call midst the fire-floods and poisonous clouds<br/>
 -- The Captain's call to the steersman to turn the ship to an unnamed
shore,<br/>
For that time is over -- the stagnant time in the port -- <br/>
Where the same old merchandise is bought and sold in an endless round,<br/>
Where dead things drift in the exhaustion and emptiness of truth.<br/>
</p>

<p class="p1">
They wake up in sudden fear and ask,<br/>
"Comrades, what hour has struck?<br/>
When shall the dawn begin?"<br/>
The clouds have blotted away the stars -- <br/>
Who is there then can see the beckoning finger of the day?<br/>
They run out with oars in hand, the beds are emptied, the mother prays, the
wife watches by the door;<br/>
There is a wail of parting that rises to the sky,<br/>
And there is the Captain's voice in the dark:<br/>
"Come, sailors, for the time in the harbour is over!"
</p>

<p class="p1">
All the black evils in the world have overflowed their banks,<br/>
Yet, oarsmen, take your places with the blessing of sorrow in your souls!<br/>
Whom do you blame, brothers? Bow your heads down!<br/>
The sin has been yours and ours.<br/>
The heat growing in the heart of God for ages -- <br/>
The cowardice of the weak, the arrogance of the strong, the greed of fat
prosperity, the rancour of the wronged, pride of race, and insult to man -- <br/>
Has burst God's peace, raging in storm.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Like a ripe pod, let the tempest break its heart into pieces, scattering
thunders.<br/>
Stop your bluster of dispraise and of self-praise,<br/>
And with the calm of silent prayer on your foreheads sail to that unnamed
shore.
</p>

<p class="p1">
We have known sins and evils every day and death we have known;<br/>
They pass over our world like clouds mocking us with their transient lightning
laughter.<br/>
Suddenly they have stopped, become a prodigy,<br/>
And men must stand before them saying:<br/>
"We do not fear you, O Monster! for we have lived every day by conquering
you,<br/>
"And we die with the faith that Peace is true, and Good is true, and true
is the eternal One!"
</p>

<p class="p1">
If the Deathless dwell not in the heart of death, <br/>
If glad wisdom bloom not bursting the sheath of sorrow,<br/>
If sin do not die of its own revealment,<br/>
If pride break not under its load of decorations,<br/>
Then whence comes the hope that drives these men from their homes like stars
rushing to their death in the morning light?<br/>
Shall the value of the martyrs' blood and mothers' tears be utterly
lost in the dust of the earth, not buying Heaven with their price?<br/>
And when Man bursts his mortal bounds, is not the Boundless revealed that
moment?
</p>

<h2>LXXXV<br/>
THE SONG OF THE DEFEATED</h2>

<p>
My Master has bid me while I stand at the roadside, to sing the song of Defeat,
for that is the bride whom He woos in secret.
</p>

<p>
She has put on the dark veil, hiding her face from the crowd, but the jewel
glows on her breast in the dark.
</p>

<p>
She is forsaken of the day, and God's night is waiting for her with its
lamps lighted and flowers wet with dew.
</p>

<p>
She is silent with her eyes downcast; she has left her home behind her, from
her home has come that wailing in the wind.
</p>

<p>
But the stars are singing the love-song of the eternal to a face sweet with
shame and suffering.
</p>

<p>
The door has been opened in the lonely chamber, the call has sounded, and the
heart of the darkness throbs with awe because of the coming tryst.

<h2>LXXXVI<br/>
THANKSGIVING</h2>

<p>
Those who walk on the path of pride crushing the lowly life under their tread,
covering the tender green of the earth with their footprints in blood;
</p>

<p>
Let them rejoice, and thank thee, Lord, for the day is theirs.
</p>

<p>
But I am thankful that my lot lies with the humble who suffer and bear the
burden of power, and hide their faces and stifle their sobs in the dark.
</p>

<p>
For every throb of their pain has pulsed in the secret depth of thy night, and
every insult has been gathered into thy great silence. And the morrow is
theirs.
</p>

<p>
O Sun, rise upon the bleeding hearts blossoming in flowers of the morning, and
the torchlight revelry of pride shrunken to ashes.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
