    <h3>
      SCENE I
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The curtain rises on the BARTHWICK'S dining-room, large, modern, and
        well furnished; the window curtains drawn. Electric light is burning. On
        the large round dining-table is set out a tray with whisky, a syphon,
        and a silver cigarette-box. It is past midnight. A fumbling is heard
        outside the door. It is opened suddenly; JACK BARTHWICK seems to fall
        into the room. He stands holding by the door knob, staring before him,
        with a beatific smile. He is in evening dress and opera hat, and carries
        in his hand a sky-blue velvet lady's reticule. His boyish face is
        freshly coloured and clean-shaven. An overcoat is hanging on his arm.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JACK. Hello! I've got home all ri --  -- [Defiantly.] Who says I
      sh'd never 've opened th' door without 'sistance. [He staggers in,
      fumbling with the reticule. A lady's handkerchief and purse of crimson
      silk fall out.] Serve her joll' well right -- everything droppin' out.
      Th' cat. I 've scored her off -- I 've got her bag. [He swings the
      reticule.] Serves her joly' well right. [He takes a cigarette out of the
      silver box and puts it in his mouth.] Never gave tha' fellow anything! [He
      hunts through all his pockets and pulls a shilling out; it drops and rolls
      away. He looks for it.] Beastly shilling! [He looks again.] Base
      ingratitude! Absolutely nothing. [He laughs.] Mus' tell him I've got
      absolutely nothing.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He lurches through the door and down a corridor, and presently returns,
        followed by JONES, who is advanced in liquor. JONES, about thirty years
        of age, has hollow cheeks, black circles round his eyes, and rusty
        clothes: He looks as though he might be unemployed, and enters in a
        hang-dog manner.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JACK. Sh! sh! sh! Don't you make a noise, whatever you do. Shu' the door,
      an' have a drink. [Very solemnly.] You helped me to open the door -- I
      've got nothin, for you. This is my house. My father's name's Barthwick;
      he's Member of Parliament -- Liberal Member of Parliament: I've told
      you that before. Have a drink! [He pours out whisky and drinks it up.] I'm
      not drunk [Subsiding on a sofa.] Tha's all right. Wha's your name? My
      name's Barthwick, so's my father's; I'm a Liberal too -- wha're you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [In a thick, sardonic voice.] I'm a bloomin' Conservative. My
      name's Jones! My wife works 'ere; she's the char; she works 'ere.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Jones? [He laughs.] There's 'nother Jones at College with me. I'm
      not a Socialist myself; I'm a Liberal -- there's ve -- lill
      difference, because of the principles of the Lib -- Liberal Party.
      We're all equal before the law -- tha's rot, tha's silly. [Laughs.]
      Wha' was I about to say? Give me some whisky.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [JONES gives him the whisky he desires, together with a squirt of
        syphon.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Wha' I was goin' tell you was -- I 've had a row with her. [He waves
      the reticule.] Have a drink, Jonessh 'd never have got in without you -- tha
      's why I 'm giving you a drink. Don' care who knows I've scored her off.
      Th' cat! [He throws his feet up on the sofa.] Don' you make a noise,
      whatever you do. You pour out a drink -- you make yourself good long,
      long drink -- you take cigarette -- you take anything you like. Sh'd
      never have got in without you. [Closing his eyes.] You're a Tory -- you're
      a Tory Socialist. I'm Liberal myself -- have a drink -- I 'm an
      excel'nt chap.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [His head drops back. He, smiling, falls asleep, and JONES stands
        looking at him; then, snatching up JACK's glass, he drinks it off. He
        picks the reticule from off JACK'S shirt-front, holds it to the light,
        and smells at it.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JONES. Been on the tiles and brought 'ome some of yer cat's fur. [He
      stuffs it into JACK's breast pocket.]
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Murmuring.] I 've scored you off! You cat!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [JONES looks around him furtively; he pours out whisky and drinks it.
        From the silver box he takes a cigarette, puffs at it, and drinks more
        whisky. There is no sobriety left in him.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JONES. Fat lot o' things they've got 'ere! [He sees the crimson purse
      lying on the floor.] More cat's fur. Puss, puss! [He fingers it, drops it
      on the tray, and looks at JACK.] Calf! Fat calf! [He sees his own
      presentment in a mirror. Lifting his hands, with fingers spread, he stares
      at it; then looks again at JACK, clenching his fist as if to batter in his
      sleeping, smiling face. Suddenly he tilts the rest o f the whisky into the
      glass and drinks it. With cunning glee he takes the silver box and purse
      and pockets them.] I 'll score you off too, that 's wot I 'll do!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He gives a little snarling laugh and lurches to the door. His shoulder
        rubs against the switch; the light goes out. There is a sound as of a
        closing outer door.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The curtain falls.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The curtain rises again at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCENE II
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In the BARTHWICK'S dining-room. JACK is still asleep; the morning light
        is coming through the curtains. The time is half-past eight. WHEELER,
        brisk person enters with a dust-pan, and MRS. JONES more slowly with a
        scuttle.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WHEELER. [Drawing the curtains.] That precious husband of yours was round
      for you after you'd gone yesterday, Mrs. Jones. Wanted your money for
      drink, I suppose. He hangs about the corner here half the time. I saw him
      outside the "Goat and Bells" when I went to the post last night. If I were
      you I would n't live with him. I would n't live with a man that raised his
      hand to me. I wouldn't put up with it. Why don't you take your children
      and leave him? If you put up with 'im it'll only make him worse. I never
      can see why, because a man's married you, he should knock you about.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Slim, dark-eyed, and dark-haired; oval-faced, and with a
      smooth, soft, even voice; her manner patient, her way of talking quite
      impersonal; she wears a blue linen dress, and boots with holes.] It was
      nearly two last night before he come home, and he wasn't himself. He made
      me get up, and he knocked me about; he didn't seem to know what he was
      saying or doing. Of course I would leave him, but I'm really afraid of
      what he'd do to me. He 's such a violent man when he's not himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEELER. Why don't you get him locked up? You'll never have any peace
      until you get him locked up. If I were you I'd go to the police court
      tomorrow. That's what I would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Of course I ought to go, because he does treat me so badly
      when he's not himself. But you see, Bettina, he has a very hard time -- he
      's been out of work two months, and it preys upon his mind. When he's in
      work he behaves himself much better. It's when he's out of work that he's
      so violent.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEELER. Well, if you won't take any steps you 'll never get rid of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Of course it's very wearing to me; I don't get my sleep at
      nights. And it 's not as if I were getting help from him, because I have
      to do for the children and all of us. And he throws such dreadful things
      up at me, talks of my having men to follow me about. Such a thing never
      happens; no man ever speaks to me. And of course, it's just the other way.
      It's what he does that's wrong and makes me so unhappy. And then he 's
      always threatenin' to cut my throat if I leave him. It's all the drink,
      and things preying on his mind; he 's not a bad man really. Sometimes
      he'll speak quite kind to me, but I've stood so much from him, I don't
      feel it in me to speak kind back, but just keep myself to myself. And he's
      all right with the children too, except when he's not himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEELER. You mean when he's drunk, the beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes. [Without change of voice] There's the young gentleman
      asleep on the sofa.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [They both look silently at Jack.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [At last, in her soft voice.] He does n't look quite himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEELER. He's a young limb, that's what he is. It 's my belief he was
      tipsy last night, like your husband. It 's another kind of bein' out of
      work that sets him to drink. I 'll go and tell Marlow. This is his job.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She goes.] [Mrs. Jones, upon her knees, begins a gentle sweeping.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JACK. [Waking.] Who's there? What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. It's me, sir, Mrs. Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Sitting up and looking round.] Where is it -- what -- what
      time is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. It's getting on for nine o'clock, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. For nine! Why -- what! [Rising, and loosening his tongue; putting
      hands to his head, and staring hard at Mrs. Jones.] Look here, you, Mrs. --  -- Mrs.
      Jones -- don't you say you caught me asleep here.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, sir, of course I won't sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. It's quite an accident; I don't know how it happened. I must have
      forgotten to go to bed. It's a queer thing. I 've got a most beastly
      headache. Mind you don't say anything, Mrs. Jones.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Goes out and passes MARLOW in the doorway. MARLOW is young and quiet;
        he is cleanshaven, and his hair is brushed high from his forehead in a
        coxcomb. Incidentally a butler, he is first a man. He looks at MRS.
        JONES, and smiles a private smile.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Not the first time, and won't be the last. Looked a bit dicky, eh,
      Mrs. Jones?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. He did n't look quite himself. Of course I did n't take
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. You're used to them. How's your old man?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Softly as throughout.] Well, he was very bad last night; he
      did n't seem to know what he was about. He was very late, and he was most
      abusive. But now, of course, he's asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. That's his way of finding a job, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. As a rule, Mr. Marlow, he goes out early every morning looking
      for work, and sometimes he comes in fit to drop -- and of course I
      can't say he does n't try to get it, because he does. Trade's very bad.
      [She stands quite still, her fan and brush before her, at the beginning
      and the end of long vistas of experience, traversing them with her
      impersonal eye.] But he's not a good husband to me -- last night he hit
      me, and he was so dreadfully abusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Bank 'oliday, eh! He 's too fond of the "Goat and Bells," that's
      what's the matter with him. I see him at the corner late every night. He
      hangs about.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. He gets to feeling very low walking about all day after work,
      and being refused so often, and then when he gets a drop in him it goes to
      his head. But he shouldn't treat his wife as he treats me. Sometimes I 've
      had to go and walk about at night, when he wouldn't let me stay in the
      room; but he's sorry for it afterwards. And he hangs about after me, he
      waits for me in the street; and I don't think he ought to, because I 've
      always been a good wife to him. And I tell him Mrs. Barthwick wouldn't
      like him coming about the place. But that only makes him angry, and he
      says dreadful things about the gentry. Of course it was through me that he
      first lost his place, through his not treating me right; and that's made
      him bitter against the gentry. He had a very good place as groom in the
      country; but it made such a stir, because of course he did n't treat me
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Got the sack?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes; his employer said he couldn't keep him, because there was
      a great deal of talk; and he said it was such a bad example. But it's very
      important for me to keep my work here; I have the three children, and I
      don't want him to come about after me in the streets, and make a
      disturbance as he sometimes does.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. [Holding up the empty decanter.] Not a drain! Next time he hits
      you get a witness and go down to the court --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, I think I 've made up my mind. I think I ought to.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. That's right. Where's the ciga --  -- ?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He searches for the silver box; he looks at MRS. JONES, who is sweeping
        on her hands and knees; he checks himself and stands reflecting. From
        the tray he picks two half-smoked cigarettes, and reads the name on
        them.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Nestor -- where the deuce --  -- ?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [With a meditative air he looks again at MRS. JONES, and, taking up
        JACK'S overcoat, he searches in the pockets. WHEELER, with a tray of
        breakfast things, comes in.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MARLOW. [Aside to WHEELER.] Have you seen the cigarette-box?
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEELER. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Well, it's gone. I put it on the tray last night. And he's been
      smoking. [Showing her the ends of cigarettes.] It's not in these pockets.
      He can't have taken it upstairs this morning! Have a good look in his room
      when he comes down. Who's been in here?
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEELER. Only me and Mrs. Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. I 've finished here; shall I do the drawing-room now?
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEELER. [Looking at her doubtfully.] Have you seen --  -- Better do
      the boudwower first.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MRS. JONES goes out with pan and brush. MARLOW and WHEELER look each
        other in the face.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MARLOW. It'll turn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEELER. [Hesitating.] You don't think she --  --  [Nodding at the
      door.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. [Stoutly.] I don't --  -- I never believes anything of
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEELER. But the master'll have to be told.
    </p>

      MARLOW. You wait a bit, and see if it don't turn up. Suspicion's no

      SCENE III
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        BARTHWICK and MRS. BARTHWICK are seated at the breakfast table. He is a
        man between fifty and sixty; quietly important, with a bald forehead,
        and pince-nez, and the "Times" in his hand. She is a lady of nearly
        fifty, well dressed, with greyish hair, good features, and a decided
        manner. They face each other.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [From behind his paper.] The Labour man has got in at the
      by-election for Barnside, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Another Labour? I can't think what on earth the country is
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. I predicted it. It's not a matter of vast importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Not? How can you take it so calmly, John? To me it's
      simply outrageous. And there you sit, you Liberals, and pretend to
      encourage these people!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Frowning.] The representation of all parties is necessary for
      any proper reform, for any proper social policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. I've no patience with your talk of reform -- all that
      nonsense about social policy. We know perfectly well what it is they want;
      they want things for themselves. Those Socialists and Labour men are an
      absolutely selfish set of people. They have no sense of patriotism, like
      the upper classes; they simply want what we've got.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Want what we've got! [He stares into space.] My dear, what are
      you talking about? [With a contortion.] I 'm no alarmist.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Cream? Quite uneducated men! Wait until they begin to tax
      our investments. I 'm convinced that when they once get a chance they will
      tax everything -- they 've no feeling for the country. You Liberals and
      Conservatives, you 're all alike; you don't see an inch before your noses.
      You've no imagination, not a scrap of imagination between you. You ought
      to join hands and nip it in the bud.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. You 're talking nonsense! How is it possible for Liberals and
      Conservatives to join hands, as you call it? That shows how absurd it is
      for women --  -- Why, the very essence of a Liberal is to trust in
      the people!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Now, John, eat your breakfast. As if there were any real
      difference between you and the Conservatives. All the upper classes have
      the same interests to protect, and the same principles. [Calmly.] Oh!
      you're sitting upon a volcano, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. What!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. I read a letter in the paper yesterday. I forget the man's
      name, but it made the whole thing perfectly clear. You don't look things
      in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Indeed! [Heavily.] I am a Liberal! Drop the subject, please!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Toast? I quite agree with what this man says: Education is
      simply ruining the lower classes. It unsettles them, and that's the worst
      thing for us all. I see an enormous difference in the manner of servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK, [With suspicious emphasis.] I welcome any change that will lead
      to something better. [He opens a letter.] H'm! This is that affair of
      Master Jack's again. "High Street, Oxford. Sir, We have received Mr. John
      Barthwick, Senior's, draft for forty pounds!" Oh! the letter's to him! "We
      now enclose the cheque you cashed with us, which, as we stated in our
      previous letter, was not met on presentation at your bank. We are, Sir,
      yours obediently, Moss and Sons, Tailors." H 'm! [Staring at the cheque.]
      A pretty business altogether! The boy might have been prosecuted.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Come, John, you know Jack did n't mean anything; he only
      thought he was overdrawing. I still think his bank ought to have cashed
      that cheque. They must know your position.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Replacing in the envelope the letter and the cheque.] Much
      good that would have done him in a court of law.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He stops as JACK comes in, fastening his waistcoat and staunching a
        razor cut upon his chin.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JACK. [Sitting down between them, and speaking with an artificial
      joviality.] Sorry I 'm late. [He looks lugubriously at the dishes.] Tea,
      please, mother. Any letters for me? [BARTHWICK hands the letter to him.]
      But look here, I say, this has been opened! I do wish you would n't --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Touching the envelope.] I suppose I 'm entitled to this name.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Sulkily.] Well, I can't help having your name, father! [He reads
      the letter, and mutters.] Brutes!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Eyeing him.] You don't deserve to be so well out of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Haven't you ragged me enough, dad?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Yes, John, let Jack have his breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. If you hadn't had me to come to, where would you have been?
      It's the merest accident -- suppose you had been the son of a poor man
      or a clerk. Obtaining money with a cheque you knew your bank could not
      meet. It might have ruined you for life. I can't see what's to become of
      you if these are your principles. I never did anything of the sort myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I expect you always had lots of money. If you've got plenty of
      money, of course --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. On the contrary, I had not your advantages. My father kept me
      very short of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. How much had you, dad?
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. It's not material. The question is, do you feel the gravity of
      what you did?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I don't know about the gravity. Of course, I 'm very sorry if you
      think it was wrong. Have n't I said so! I should never have done it at all
      if I had n't been so jolly hard up.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. How much of that forty pounds have you got left, Jack?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Hesitating.] I don't know -- not much.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. How much?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Desperately.] I have n't got any.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. I know I 've got the most beastly headache.

      MRS. BARTHWICK. Headache? My dear boy! Can't you eat any breakfast?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Drawing in his breath.] Too jolly bad!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. I'm so sorry. Come with me; dear; I'll give you something
      that will take it away at once.

    <p>
      BARTHWICK. What's that? What d 'you want?

    <p>
      MARLOW. I was looking for Mr. John, sir.

    <p>
      BARTHWICK. What d' you want Mr. John for?

    <p>
      MARLOW. [With hesitation.] I thought I should find him here, sir.

    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Suspiciously.] Yes, but what do you want him for?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. [Offhandedly.] There's a lady called -- asked to speak to him
      for a minute, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. A lady, at this time in the morning. What sort of a lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. [Without expression in his voice.] I can't tell, sir; no
      particular sort. She might be after charity. She might be a Sister of
      Mercy, I should think, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Is she dressed like one?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. No, sir, she's in plain clothes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Did n't she say what she wanted?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. No sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Where did you leave her?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. In the hall, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. In the hall? How do you know she's not a thief -- not got
      designs on the house?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. No, sir, I don't fancy so, sir.
    </p>

      BARTHWICK. Well, show her in here; I'll see her myself.

        with a bunch of Parma violets wrongly placed, and fuzzy-spotted veil. At
        the Sight of MR. BARTHWICK she exhibits every sign of nervousness.

    <p>
      UNKNOWN. Oh! but I must see him -- I 've come on purpose -- [She

      UNKNOWN. In my purse, in the reticule. It was a crimson silk purse.
      Really, I wouldn't have come -- I don't want to make any fuss. But I
      must get my money back -- mustn't I?

      n't been for me! You don't seem to have any principles. You -- you're
      one of those who are a nuisance to society; you -- you're dangerous!
      What your mother would say I don't know. Your conduct, as far as I can
      see, is absolutely unjustifiable. It's -- it's criminal. Why, a poor
      man who behaved as you've done  -- d' you think he'd have any mercy
      shown him? What you want is a good lesson. You and your sort are -- [he
      speaks with feeling] -- a nuisance to the community. Don't ask me to
      help you next time. You're not fit to be helped.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Turning upon his sire, with unexpected fierceness.] All right, I
      won't then, and see how you like it. You would n't have helped me this
      time, I know, if you had n't been scared the thing would get into the
      papers. Where are the cigarettes?
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Regarding him uneasily.] Well I 'll say no more about it. [He
      rings the bell.] I 'll pass it over for this once, but --  -- 
      [MARLOW Comes in.] You can clear away.

    <p>
      JACK. [Brightening.] I say, Marlow, where are the cigarettes?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. I put the box out with the whisky last night, sir, but this
      morning I can't find it anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Did you look in my room?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Yes, sir; I've looked all over the house. I found two Nestor ends
      in the tray this morning, so you must have been smokin' last night, sir.
      [Hesitating.] I 'm really afraid some one's purloined the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Uneasily.] Stolen it!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. What's that? The cigarette-box! Is anything else missing?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. No, sir; I 've been through the plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Was the house all right this morning? None of the windows open?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. No, sir. [Quietly to JACK.] You left your latch-key in the door
      last night, sir.

      JACK. Tst!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Who's been in the room this morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Me and Wheeler, and Mrs. Jones is all, sir, as far as I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Have you asked Mrs. Barthwick?
    </p>
    <p>
      [To JACK.] Go and ask your mother if she's had it; ask her to look and see
      if she's missed anything else.

    <p>
      Nothing is more disquieting than losing things like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Have you any suspicions?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW, No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. This Mrs. Jones -- how long has she been working here?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Only this last month, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. What sort of person?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. I don't know much about her, sir; seems a very quiet, respectable
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Who did the room this morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Wheeler and Mrs. Jones, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [With his forefinger upraised.] Now, was this Mrs. Jones in the
      room alone at any time?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. [Expressionless.] Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. How do you know that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. [Reluctantly.] I found her here, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. And has Wheeler been in the room alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. No, sir, she's not, sir. I should say, sir, that Mrs. Jones seems
      a very honest --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Holding up his hand.] I want to know this: Has this Mrs. Jones
      been here the whole morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Yes, sir -- no, sir -- she stepped over to the greengrocer's
      for cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. H'm! Is she in the house now?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Very good. I shall make a point of clearing this up. On
      principle I shall make a point of fixing the responsibility; it goes to
      the foundations of security. In all your interests --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. What sort of circumstances is this Mrs. Jones in? Is her
      husband in work?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. I believe not, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Very well. Say nothing about it to any one. Tell Wheeler not to
      speak of it, and ask Mrs. Jones to step up here.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Very good, sir.

    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Well, my dear, you've not seen it, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. No. But what an extraordinary thing, John! Marlow, of
      course, is out of the question. I 'm certain none of the maids as for
      cook!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Oh, cook!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Of course! It's perfectly detestable to me to suspect
      anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. It is not a question of one's feelings. It's a question of
      justice. On principle --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. I should n't be a bit surprised if the charwoman knew
      something about it. It was Laura who recommended her.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Judicially.] I am going to have Mrs. Jones up. Leave it to me;
      and -- er -- remember that nobody is guilty until they're proved so.
      I shall be careful. I have no intention of frightening her; I shall give
      her every chance. I hear she's in poor circumstances. If we are not able
      to do much for them we are bound to have the greatest sympathy with the
      poor. [MRS. JONES comes in.] [Pleasantly.] Oh! good morning, Mrs. Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Soft, and even, unemphatic.] Good morning, sir! Good morning,
      ma'am!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. About your husband -- he's not in work, I hear?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, sir; of course he's not in work just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Then I suppose he's earning nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, sir, he's not earning anything just now, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. And how many children have you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Three children; but of course they don't eat very much sir. [A
      little silence.]
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. And how old is the eldest?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Nine years old, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Do they go to school?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES, Yes, sir, they all three go to school every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Severely.] And what about their food when you're out at work?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Well, Sir, I have to give them their dinner to take with them.
      Of course I 'm not always able to give them anything; sometimes I have to
      send them without; but my husband is very good about the children when
      he's in work. But when he's not in work of course he's a very difficult
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. He drinks, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, Sir. Of course I can't say he does n't drink, because he
      does.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. And I suppose he takes all your money?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, sir, he's very good about my money, except when he's not
      himself, and then, of course, he treats me very badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Now what is he -- your husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. By profession, sir, of course he's a groom.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. A groom! How came he to lose his place?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. He lost his place a long time ago, sir, and he's never had a
      very long job since; and now, of course, the motor-cars are against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. When were you married to him, Mrs. Jones?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Eight years ago, sir that was in --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Sharply.] Eight? You said the eldest child was nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, ma'am; of course that was why he lost his place. He did
      n't treat me rightly, and of course his employer said he couldn't keep him
      because of the example.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. You mean he -- ahem --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, sir; and of course after he lost his place he married me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. You actually mean to say you -- you were --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. My dear --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Indignantly.] How disgraceful!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Hurriedly.] And where are you living now, Mrs. Jones?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. We've not got a home, sir. Of course we've been obliged to put
      away most of our things.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Put your things away! You mean to -- to -- er -- to
      pawn them?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, to put them away. We're living in Merthyr Street -- that
      is close by here, sir -- at No. 34. We just have the one room.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. And what do you pay a week?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. We pay six shillings a week, sir, for a furnished room.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. And I suppose you're behind in the rent?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, we're a little behind in the rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. But you're in good work, aren't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Well, Sir, I have a day in Stamford Place Thursdays. And
      Mondays and Wednesdays and Fridays I come here. But to-day, of course, is
      a half-day, because of yesterday's Bank Holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. I see; four days a week, and you get half a crown a day, is
      that it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, and my dinner; but sometimes it's only half a day,
      and that's eighteen pence.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. And when your husband earns anything he spends it in drink, I
      suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Sometimes he does, sir, and sometimes he gives it to me for
      the children. Of course he would work if he could get it, sir, but it
      seems there are a great many people out of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Ah! Yes. We -- er -- won't go into that.
      [Sympathetically.] And how about your work here? Do you find it hard?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Oh! no, sir, not very hard, sir; except of course, when I
      don't get my sleep at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Ah! And you help do all the rooms? And sometimes, I suppose,
      you go out for cook?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. And you 've been out this morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, of course I had to go to the greengrocer's.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Exactly. So your husband earns nothing? And he's a bad
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, Sir, I don't say that, sir. I think there's a great deal
      of good in him; though he does treat me very bad sometimes. And of course
      I don't like to leave him, but I think I ought to, because really I hardly
      know how to stay with him. He often raises his hand to me. Not long ago he
      gave me a blow here [touches her breast] and I can feel it now. So I think
      I ought to leave him, don't you, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Ah! I can't help you there. It's a very serious thing to leave
      your husband. Very serious thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, of course I 'm afraid of what he might do to me if I
      were to leave him; he can be so very violent.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. H'm! Well, that I can't pretend to say anything about. It's the
      bad principle I'm speaking of --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, Sir; I know nobody can help me. I know I must decide for
      myself, and of course I know that he has a very hard life. And he's fond
      of the children, and its very hard for him to see them going without food.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Hastily.] Well -- er -- thank you, I just wanted to hear
      about you. I don't think I need detain you any longer, Mrs. Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, sir, thank you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Good morning, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Good morning, sir; good morning, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Exchanging glances with his wife.] By the way, Mrs. Jones -- I
      think it is only fair to tell you, a silver cigarette-box  -- er -- is
      missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Looking from one face to the other.] I am very sorry, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Yes; you have not seen it, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Realising that suspicion is upon her; with an uneasy
      movement.] Where was it, sir; if you please, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Evasively.] Where did Marlow say? Er -- in this room, yes,
      in this room.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, Sir, I have n't seen it -- of course if I 'd seen it I
      should have noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Giving hey a rapid glance.] You -- you are sure of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Impassively.] Yes, Sir. [With a slow nodding of her head.] I
      have not seen it, and of course I don't know where it is.

      SCENE I
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The JONES's lodgings, Merthyr Street, at half-past two o'clock. The bare
        room, with tattered oilcloth and damp, distempered walls, has an air of
        tidy wretchedness. On the bed lies JONES, half-dressed; his coat is
        thrown across his feet, and muddy boots are lying on the floor close by.
        He is asleep. The door is opened and MRS. JONES comes in, dressed in a
        pinched black jacket and old black sailor hat; she carries a parcel
        wrapped up in the "Times." She puts her parcel down, unwraps an apron,
        half a loaf, two onions, three potatoes, and a tiny piece of bacon.
        Taking a teapot from the cupboard, she rinses it, shakes into it some
        powdered tea out of a screw of paper, puts it on the hearth, and sitting
        in a wooden chair quietly begins to cry.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JONES. [Stirring and yawning.] That you? What's the time?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Drying her eyes, and in her usual voice.] Half-past two.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. What you back so soon for?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. I only had the half day to-day, Jem.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [On his back, and in a drowsy voice.] Got anything for dinner?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Mrs. BARTHWICK's cook gave me a little bit of bacon. I'm going
      to make a stew. [She prepares for cooking.] There's fourteen shillings
      owing for rent, James, and of course I 've only got two and fourpence.
      They'll be coming for it to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Turning towards her on his elbow.] Let 'em come and find my
      surprise packet. I've had enough o' this tryin' for work. Why should I go
      round and round after a job like a bloomin' squirrel in a cage. "Give us a
      job, sir" -- "Take a man on" -- "Got a wife and three children."
      Sick of it I am! I 'd sooner lie here and rot. "Jones, you come and join
      the demonstration; come and 'old a flag, and listen to the ruddy orators,
      and go 'ome as empty as you came." There's some that seems to like that -- the
      sheep! When I go seekin' for a job now, and see the brutes lookin' me up
      an' down, it's like a thousand serpents in me. I 'm not arskin' for any
      treat. A man wants to sweat hisself silly and not allowed that's a rum
      start, ain't it? A man wants to sweat his soul out to keep the breath in
      him and ain't allowed -- that's justice that's freedom and all the rest
      of it! [He turns his face towards the wall.] You're so milky mild; you
      don't know what goes on inside o' me. I'm done with the silly game. If
      they want me, let 'em come for me!
    </p>

        [MRS. JONES stops cooking and stands unmoving at the table.]

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I've tried and done with it, I tell you. I've never been afraid of what 's
      before me. You mark my words -- if you think they've broke my spirit,
      you're mistook. I 'll lie and rot sooner than arsk 'em again. What makes
      you stand like that -- you long-sufferin', Gawd-forsaken image -- that's
      why I can't keep my hands off you. So now you know. Work! You can work,
      but you have n't the spirit of a louse!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Quietly.] You talk more wild sometimes when you're yourself,
      James, than when you 're not. If you don't get work, how are we to go on?
      They won't let us stay here; they're looking to their money to-day, I
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. I see this BARTHWICK o' yours every day goin' down to Pawlyment
      snug and comfortable to talk his silly soul out; an' I see that young
      calf, his son, swellin' it about, and goin' on the razzle-dazzle. Wot 'ave
      they done that makes 'em any better than wot I am? They never did a day's
      work in their lives. I see 'em day after day.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. And I wish you wouldn't come after me like that, and hang
      about the house. You don't seem able to keep away at all, and whatever you
      do it for I can't think, because of course they notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. I suppose I may go where I like. Where may I go? The other day I
      went to a place in the Edgware Road. "Gov'nor," I says to the boss, "take
      me on," I says. "I 'aven't done a stroke o' work not these two months; it
      takes the heart out of a man," I says; "I 'm one to work; I 'm not afraid
      of anything you can give me!" "My good man," 'e says, "I 've had thirty of
      you here this morning. I took the first two," he says, "and that's all I
      want." "Thank you, then rot the world!" I says. "Blasphemin'," he says,
      "is not the way to get a job. Out you go, my lad!" [He laughs
      sardonically.] Don't you raise your voice because you're starvin'; don't
      yer even think of it; take it lyin' down! Take it like a sensible man,
      carn't you? And a little way down the street a lady says to me: [Pinching
      his voice] "D' you want to earn a few pence, my man?" and gives me her dog
      to 'old outside a shop-fat as a butler 'e was -- tons o' meat had gone
      to the makin' of him. It did 'er good, it did, made 'er feel 'erself that
      charitable, but I see 'er lookin' at the copper standin' alongside o' me,
      for fear I should make off with 'er bloomin' fat dog. [He sits on the edge
      of the bed and puts a boot on. Then looking up.] What's in that head o'
      yours? [Almost pathetically.] Carn't you speak for once?

    <p>
      MRS. SEDDON. I thought I 'eard you come in, Mrs. Jones. I 've spoke to my
      'usband, but he says he really can't afford to wait another day.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [With scowling jocularity.] Never you mind what your 'usband says,

      JONES. [Mockingly.] Don't mention it.

    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Oh, James!
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. Oh, James! What about Oh, James! I picked it up I tell you. This is
      lost property, this is!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. But is n't there a name in it, or something?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. Name? No, there ain't no name. This don't belong to such as 'ave
      visitin' cards. This belongs to a perfec' lidy. Tike an' smell it. [He
      pitches her the purse, which she puts gently to her nose.] Now, you tell
      me what I ought to have done. You tell me that. You can always tell me
      what I ought to ha' done, can't yer?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Laying down the purse.] I can't say what you ought to have
      done, James. Of course the money was n't yours; you've taken somebody
      else's money.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. Finding's keeping. I 'll take it as wages for the time I 've gone
      about the streets asking for what's my rights. I'll take it for what's
      overdue, d' ye hear? [With strange triumph.] I've got money in my pocket,

      I 'ope you 'll be glad when I 'm gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Impassively.] You have, treated me very badly, James, and of
      course I can't prevent your going; but I can't tell whether I shall be
      glad when you're gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. It'll change my luck. I 've 'ad nothing but bad luck since I first
      took up with you. [More softly.] And you've 'ad no bloomin' picnic.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Of course it would have been better for us if we had never
      met. We were n't meant for each other. But you're set against me, that's
      what you are, and you have been for a long time. And you treat me so
      badly, James, going after that Rosie and all. You don't ever seem to think
      of the children that I 've had to bring into the world, and of all the
      trouble I 've had to keep them, and what 'll become of them when you're
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Crossing the room gloomily.] If you think I want to leave the
      little beggars you're bloomin' well mistaken.

    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Of course I know you're fond of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Fingering the purse, half angrily.] Well, then, you stow it, old
      girl. The kids 'll get along better with you than when I 'm here. If I 'd
      ha' known as much as I do now, I 'd never ha' had one o' them. What's the
      use o' bringin' 'em into a state o' things like this? It's a crime, that's
      what it is; but you find it out too late; that's what's the matter with
      this 'ere world.

      that. I should miss them dreadfully if I was to lose them.
    </p>

      When I go out I 'll take and chuck it in the water along with that there
      purse. I 'ad it when I was in liquor, and for what you do when you 're in
      liquor you're not responsible-and that's Gawd's truth as you ought to
      know. I don't want the thing -- I won't have it. I took it out o'
      spite. I 'm no thief, I tell you; and don't you call me one, or it'll be
      the worse for you.

      JONES. I tell you I was in liquor. I don't want it; what's the good of it
      to me? If I were to pawn it they'd only nab me. I 'm no thief. I 'm no
      worse than wot that young Barthwick is; he brought 'ome that purse that I
      picked up -- a lady's purse -- 'ad it off 'er in a row, kept sayin'
      'e 'd scored 'er off. Well, I scored 'im off. Tight as an owl 'e was! And

      What about young BARTHWICK?
    </p>

      prevents her.] What do you want with that? You drop it, I say!

    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. My instructions are to take you on a charge of stealing this box
      from J. BARTHWICK, Esquire, M.P., of 6, Rockingham Gate. Anything you say
      may be used against you. Well, Missis?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [In her quiet voice, still out of breath, her hand upon her
      breast.] Of course I did not take it, sir. I never have taken anything
      that did n't belong to me; and of course I know nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. You were at the house this morning; you did the room in which the
      box was left; you were alone in the room. I find the box 'ere. You say you
      did n't take it?
    </p>

      MRS. JONES. Yes, sir, of course I say I did not take it, because I did
      not.

      MRS. JONES. [Twisting her hands.] Of course I would n't say I had n't
      taken it if I had -- and I did n't take it, indeed I did n't. Of course
      I know appearances are against me, and I can't tell you what really
      happened: But my children are at school, and they'll be coming home -- and
      I don't know what they'll do without me.

      BARTHWICK. [Gloomily.] Stout? [He takes up the crackers -- with

      BARTHWICK. [Uneasily.] I'm not sure they were wise --  --

      MRS. BARTHWICK. Lady Holyrood told me: "I had her up," she said; "I said
      to her, 'You'll leave my house at once; I think your conduct disgraceful.
      I can't tell, I don't know, and I don't wish to know, what you were doing.
      I send you away on principle; you need not come to me for a character.'
      And the girl said: 'If you don't give me my notice, my lady, I want a
      month's wages. I'm perfectly respectable. I've done nothing.'"' -- Done
      nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. H'm!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Servants have too much license. They hang together so
      terribly you never can tell what they're really thinking; it's as if they
      were all in a conspiracy to keep you in the dark. Even with Marlow, you
      feel that he never lets you know what's really in his mind. I hate that
      secretiveness; it destroys all confidence. I feel sometimes I should like
      to shake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Marlow's a most decent chap. It's simply beastly every one knowing
      your affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. The less you say about that the better!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. It goes all through the lower classes. You can not tell
      when they are speaking the truth. To-day when I was shopping after leaving
      the Holyroods, one of these unemployed came up and spoke to me. I suppose
      I only had twenty yards or so to walk to the carnage, but he seemed to
      spring up in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Ah! You must be very careful whom you speak to in these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. I did n't answer him, of course. But I could see at once
      that he wasn't telling the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Cracking a nut.] There's one very good rule -- look at
      their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Crackers, please, Dad.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Passing the crackers.] If their eyes are straight-forward I
      sometimes give them sixpence. It 's against my principles, but it's most
      difficult to refuse. If you see that they're desperate, and dull, and
      shifty-looking, as so many of them are, it's certain to mean drink, or
      crime, or something unsatisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. This man had dreadful eyes. He looked as if he could
      commit a murder. "I 've 'ad nothing to eat to-day," he said. Just like
      that.

    <p>
      BARTHWICK. What was William about? He ought to have been waiting.

    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. I hate people that can't speak the truth. [Father and son
      exchange a look behind their port.] It 's just as easy to speak the truth
      as not. I've always found it easy enough. It makes it impossible to tell
      what is genuine; one feels as if one were continually being taken in.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Sententiously.] The lower classes are their own enemies. If
      they would only trust us, they would get on so much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. But even then it's so often their own fault. Look at that
      Mrs. Jones this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. I only want to do what's right in that matter. I had occasion
      to see Roper this afternoon. I mentioned it to him. He's coming in this
      evening. It all depends on what the detective says. I've had my doubts.
      I've been thinking it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. The woman impressed me most unfavourably. She seemed to
      have no shame. That affair she was talking about -- she and the man
      when they were young, so immoral! And before you and Jack! I could have
      put her out of the room!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Oh! I don't want to excuse them, but in looking at these
      matters one must consider --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Perhaps you'll say the man's employer was wrong in
      dismissing him?
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Of course not. It's not there that I feel doubt. What I ask
      myself is --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Port, please, Dad.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Circulating the decanter in religious imitation of the rising
      and setting of the sun.] I ask myself whether we are sufficiently careful
      in making inquiries about people before we engage them, especially as
      regards moral conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Pass the-port, please, Mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Passing it.] My dear boy, are n't you drinking too much?

      MARLOW. [Entering.] Detective Snow to see you, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Uneasily.] Ah! say I'll be with him in a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Without turning.] Let him come in here, Marlow.
    </p>

    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Half-rising.] Oh! Good evening!
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. Good evening, sir; good evening, ma'am. I 've called round to report
      what I 've done, rather late, I 'm afraid -- another case took me away.
      [He takes the silver box out o f his pocket, causing a sensation in the
      BARTHWICK family.] This is the identical article, I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Certainly, certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. Havin' your crest and cypher, as you described to me, sir, I 'd no
      hesitation in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Excellent. Will you have a glass of [he glances at the waning
      port] -- er -- sherry-[pours out sherry]. Jack, just give Mr. Snow
      this.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

        regards him indolently.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SNOW. [Drinking off wine and putting down the glass.] After seeing you I
      went round to this woman's lodgings, sir. It's a low neighborhood, and I
      thought it as well to place a constable below  -- and not without 'e
      was wanted, as things turned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. Yes, Sir, I 'ad some trouble. I asked her to account for the
      presence of the article. She could give me no answer, except to deny the
      theft; so I took her into custody; then her husband came for me, so I was
      obliged to take him, too, for assault. He was very violent on the way to
      the station -- very violent -- threatened you and your son, and
      altogether he was a handful, I can till you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. What a ruffian he must be!
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. Yes, ma'am, a rough customer.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Sipping his mine, bemused.] Punch the beggar's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. Given to drink, as I understand, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. It's to be hoped he will get a severe punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. The odd thing is, sir, that he persists in sayin' he took the box
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Took the box himself! [He smiles.] What does he think to gain
      by that?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. He says the young gentleman was intoxicated last night
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [JACK stops the cracking of a nut, and looks at SNOW.] [BARTHWICK,
        losing his smile, has put his wine-glass down; there is a silence -- SNOW,
        looking from face to face, remarks]

    <p>
       -- took him into the house and gave him whisky; and under the
      influence of an empty stomach the man says he took the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. The impudent wretch!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. D' you mean that he -- er -- intends to put this forward
      to-morrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. That'll be his line, sir; but whether he's endeavouring to shield
      his wife, or whether [he looks at JACK] there's something in it, will be
      for the magistrate to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Haughtily.] Something in what? I don't understand you. As
      if my son would bring a man like that into the house!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [From the fireplace, with an effort to be calm.] My son can
      speak for himself, no doubt. Well, Jack, what do you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Sharply.] What does he say? Why, of course, he says the
      whole story's stuff!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Embarrassed.] Well, of course, I -- of course, I don't know
      anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. I should think not, indeed! [To Snow.] The man is an
      audacious ruffian!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Suppressing jumps.] But in view of my son's saying there's
      nothing in this -- this fable -- will it be necessary to proceed
      against the man under the circumstances?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. We shall have to charge him with the assault, sir. It would be as
      well for your son to come down to the Court. There'll be a remand, no
      doubt. The queer thing is there was quite a sum of money found on him, and
      a crimson silk purse.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [BARTHWICK starts; JACK rises and sits dozen again.]

    <p>
      I suppose the lady has n't missed her purse?
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Hastily.] Oh, no! Oh! No!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. No!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Dreamily.] No! [To SNOW.] I 've been inquiring of the
      servants. This man does hang about the house. I shall feel much safer if
      he gets a good long sentence; I do think we ought to be protected against
      such ruffians.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Yes, yes, of course, on principle but in this case we have a
      number of things to think of. [To SNOW.] I suppose, as you say, the man
      must be charged, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. No question about that, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Staring gloomily at JACK.] This prosecution goes very much
      against the grain with me. I have great sympathy with the poor. In my
      position I 'm bound to recognise the distress there is amongst them. The
      condition of the people leaves much to be desired. D' you follow me? I
      wish I could see my way to drop it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Sharply.] John! it's simply not fair to other people.
      It's putting property at the mercy of any one who likes to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Trying to make signs to her aside.] I 'm not defending him,
      not at all. I'm trying to look at the matter broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Nonsense, John, there's a time for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. [Rather sardonically.] I might point out, sir, that to withdraw the
      charge of stealing would not make much difference, because the facts must
      come out [he looks significantly at JACK] in reference to the assault; and
      as I said that charge will have to go forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Hastily.] Yes, oh! exactly! It's entirely on the woman's
      account -- entirely a matter of my own private feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. If I were you, sir, I should let things take their course. It's not
      likely there'll be much difficulty. These things are very quick settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Doubtfully.] You think so -- you think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Rousing himself.] I say, what shall I have to swear to?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. That's best known to yourself, sir. [Retreating to the door.] Better
      employ a solicitor, sir, in case anything should arise. We shall have the
      butler to prove the loss of the article. You'll excuse me going, I 'm
      rather pressed to-night. The case may come on any time after eleven. Good
      evening, sir; good evening, ma'am. I shall have to produce the box in
      court to-morrow, so if you'll excuse me, sir, I may as well take it with
      me.

    <p>
      BARTHWICK. I do wish you'd leave me to manage things myself. You will put

      this!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Coldly.] I don't in the least know what you're talking
      about. If you can't stand up for your rights, I can. I 've no patience
      with your principles, it's such nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Principles! Good Heavens! What have principles to do with it
      for goodness sake? Don't you know that Jack was drunk last night!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Dad!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [In horror rising.] Jack!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Look here, Mother -- I had supper. Everybody does. I mean to say -- you
      know what I mean -- it's absurd to call it being drunk. At Oxford
      everybody gets a bit "on" sometimes --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Well, I think it's most dreadful! If that is really what
      you do at Oxford?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Angrily.] Well, why did you send me there? One must do as other
      fellows do. It's such nonsense, I mean, to call it being drunk. Of course
      I 'm awfully sorry. I 've had such a beastly headache all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Tcha! If you'd only had the common decency to remember what
      happened when you came in. Then we should know what truth there was in
      what this fellow says -- as it is, it's all the most confounded
      darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Staring as though at half-formed visions.] I just get a --  and
      then -- it 's gone --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Oh, Jack! do you mean to say you were so tipsy you can't
      even remember --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Look here, Mother! Of course I remember I came -- I must have
      come --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Unguardedly, and walking up and down.] Tcha! -- and that
      infernal purse! Good Heavens! It'll get into the papers. Who on earth
      could have foreseen a thing like this? Better to have lost a dozen
      cigarette-boxes, and said nothing about it. [To his wife.] It's all your
      doing. I told you so from the first. I wish to goodness Roper would come!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Sharply.] I don't know what you're talking about, John.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Turning on her.] No, you -- you -- you don't know
      anything! [Sharply.] Where the devil is Roper? If he can see a way out of
      this he's a better man than I take him for. I defy any one to see a way
      out of it. I can't.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Look here, don't excite Dad -- I can simply say I was too beastly
      tired, and don't remember anything except that I came in and [in a dying
      voice] went to bed the same as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Went to bed? Who knows where you went -- I 've lost all
      confidence. For all I know you slept on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Indignantly.] I did n't, I slept on the --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Sitting on the sofa.] Who cares where you slept; what does it
      matter if he mentions the -- the -- a perfect disgrace?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. What? [A silence.] I insist on knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Oh! nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Nothing? What do you mean by nothing, Jack? There's your
      father in such a state about it!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. It's only my purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Your purse! You know perfectly well you have n't got one.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Well, it was somebody else's -- it was all a joke -- I did n't
      want the beastly thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Do you mean that you had another person's purse, and that
      this man took it too?
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Tcha! Of course he took it too! A man like that Jones will make
      the most of it. It'll get into the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. I don't understand. What on earth is all the fuss about?
      [Bending over JACK, and softly.] Jack now, tell me dear! Don't be afraid.
      What is it? Come!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Oh, don't Mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. But don't what, dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. It was pure sport. I don't know how I got the thing. Of course I 'd
      had a bit of a row -- I did n't know what I was doing -- I was -- I
      Was -- well, you know -- I suppose I must have pulled the bag out of
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Out of her hand? Whose hand? What bag -- whose bag?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Oh! I don't know -- her bag -- it belonged to -- [in a
      desperate and rising voice] a woman.

    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. A woman? Oh! Jack! No!

      not my fault.

      man was ever here at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. You must speak the truth, if it is the truth. But if you do
      remember such a dirty business, I shall wash my hands of you altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Glaring at them.] Well, what the devil --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Jack!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Well, Mother, I -- I don't know what you do want.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. We want you to speak the truth and say you never let this
      low man into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Of course if you think that you really gave this man whisky in
      that disgraceful way, and let him see what you'd been doing, and were in
      such a disgusting condition that you don't remember a word of it --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. [Quick.] I've no memory myself -- never had.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Desperately.] I don't know what you're to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. [To JACK.] Say nothing at all! Don't put yourself in a false
      position. The man stole the things or the woman stole the things, you had
      nothing to do with it. You were asleep on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Your leaving the latch-key in the door was quite bad
      enough, there's no need to mention anything else. [Touching his forehead
      softly.] My dear, how hot your head is!
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. But I want to know what I 'm to do. [Passionately.] I won't be
      badgered like this.

      ROPER. [Very quickly.] You forget all about it. You were asleep.

    <p>
      JACK. Must I go down to the Court to-morrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. [Shaking his head.] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [In a relieved voice.] Is that so?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. But you'll go, Roper.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [With wan cheerfulness.] Thanks, awfully! So long as I don't have to
      go. [Putting his hand up to his head.] I think if you'll excuse me -- I've
      had a most beastly day. [He looks from his father to his mother.]
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Turning quickly.] Goodnight, my boy.

    <p>
      BARTHWICK. What! D' you mean he'll have to appear on the remand.

    <p>
      ROPER. Yes.

    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Mr. Roper, don't you think the magistrate ought to be told
      what sort of people these Jones's are; I mean about their immorality
      before they were married. I don't know if John told you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. Afraid it's not material.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Not material?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. Purely private life! May have happened to the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [With a movement as if to shift a burden.] Then you'll take the
      thing into your hands?

      ROPER. If the gods are kind. [He holds his hand out.]

    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [To himself.] There'll be a scandal!

      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Disguising her grief at once.] I simply can't imagine
      what Roper means by making a joke of a thing like that!

    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Staring strangely.] You! You can't imagine anything! You've no
      more imagination than a fly!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. [Angrily.] You dare to tell me that I have no imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Flustered.] I -- I 'm upset. From beginning to end, the
      whole thing has been utterly against my principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BARTHWICK. Rubbish! You have n't any! Your principles are nothing in
      the world but sheer fright!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. [Walking to the window.] I've never been frightened in my life.
      You heard what Roper said. It's enough to upset one when a thing like this
      happens. Everything one says and does seems to turn in one's mouth -- it's -- it's
      uncanny. It's not the sort of thing I've been accustomed to. [As though
      stifling, he throws the window open. The faint sobbing of a child comes
      in.] What's that?

      BARTHWICK. I'll shut the window; you'll hear nothing. [He shuts the
      window. There is silence.]

      What's that noise of crying, Marlow? It sounds like a child.

      BARTHWICK. It is a child. I can see it against the railings.

      little boy, ma'am; he came here after his mother.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Eight days have passed, and the scene is a London Police Court at one
        o'clock. A canopied seat of Justice is surmounted by the lion and
        unicorn. Before the fire a worn-looking MAGISTRATE is warming his
        coat-tails, and staring at two little girls in faded blue and orange
        rags, who are placed before the dock. Close to the witness-box is a
        RELIEVING OFFICER in an overcoat, and a short brown beard. Beside the
        little girls stands a bald POLICE CONSTABLE. On the front bench are
        sitting BARTHWICK and ROPER, and behind them JACK. In the railed
        enclosure are seedy-looking men and women. Some prosperous constables
        sit or stand about.

    <p>
      RELIEVING OFFICER. [In a monotone, pausing slightly at each sentence end,
      that his evidence may be inscribed.] About ten o'clock this morning, your
      Worship, I found these two little girls in Blue Street, Fulham, crying
      outside a public-house. Asked where their home was, they said they had no
      home. Mother had gone away. Asked about their father. Their father had no
      work. Asked where they slept last night. At their aunt's. I 've made
      inquiries, your Worship. The wife has broken up the home and gone on the
      streets. The husband is out of work and living in common lodging-houses.
      The husband's sister has eight children of her own, and says she can't
      afford to keep these little girls any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Returning to his seat beneath the canopy of justice.] Now,
      let me see. You say the mother is on the streets; what evidence have you
      of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      RELIEVING OFFICER. I have the husband here, your Worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Very well; then let us see him.

    <blockquote>
      <p>

        with hard compassion at the little girls. LIVENS comes in. He is quiet,
        with grizzled hair, and a muffler for a collar. He stands beside the
        witness-box.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And you, are their father? Now, why don't you keep your little girls at
      home. How is it you leave them to wander about the streets like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIVENS. I've got no home, your Worship. I'm living from 'and to mouth. I
      've got no work; and nothin' to keep them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. How is that?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIVENS. [Ashamedly.] My wife, she broke my 'ome up, and pawned the things.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. But what made you let her?
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVINS. Your Worship, I'd no chance to stop 'er, she did it when I was out
      lookin' for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Did you ill-treat her?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIVENS. [Emphatically.] I never raised my 'and to her in my life, your
      Worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Then what was it -- did she drink?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIVENS. Yes, your Worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Was she loose in her behaviour?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIVENS. [In a low voice.] Yes, your Worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. And where is she now?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIVENS. I don't know your Worship. She went off with a man, and after that
      I --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes. Who knows anything of her? [To the bald CONSTABLE.]
      Is she known here?
    </p>
    <p>
      RELIEVING OFFICER. Not in this district, your Worship; but I have
      ascertained that she is well known --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes -- yes; we'll stop at that. Now [To the Father] you say
      that she has broken up your home, and left these little girls. What
      provision can you make for them? You look a strong man.
    </p>
    <p>
      LIVENS. So I am, your Worship. I'm willin' enough to work, but for the
      life of me I can't get anything to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. But have you tried?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIVENS. I've tried everything, your Worship -- I 've tried my 'ardest.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Well, well --  --  [There is a silence.]
    </p>
    <p>
      RELIEVING OFFICER. If your Worship thinks it's a case, my people are
      willing to take them.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes, I know; but I've no evidence that this man is not
      the proper guardian for his children.

      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes; the mother, of course, is an improper person to have
      anything to do with them. [To the Father.] Well, now what do you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      LIVENS. Your Worship, I can only say that if I could get work I should be
      only too willing to provide for them. But what can I do, your Worship?
      Here I am obliged to live from 'and to mouth in these 'ere common
      lodging-houses. I 'm a strong man -- I'm willing to work  -- I'm
      half as alive again as some of 'em -- but you see, your Worship, my
      'airs' turned a bit, owing to the fever -- [Touches his hair] -- and
      that's against me; and I don't seem to get a chance anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes-yes. [Slowly.] Well, I think it 's a case. [Staring his
      hardest at the little girls.] Now, are you willing that these little girls
      should be sent to a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      LIVENS. Yes, your Worship, I should be very willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Well, I'll remand them for a week. Bring them again to-day
      week; if I see no reason against it then, I 'll make an order.

      CLERK. And did you miss the same at 8.45 on the following morning, on
      going to remove the tray?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. Is the female prisoner known to you?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MARLOW nods.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Is she the charwoman employed at 6, Rockingham Gate?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Again MARLOW nods.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Did you at the time of your missing the box find her in the room alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. Did you afterwards communicate the loss to your employer, and did
      he send you to the police station?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. [To MRS. JONES.] Have you anything to ask him?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, sir, nothing, thank you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. [To JONES.] James Jones, have you anything to ask this witness?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. I don't know 'im.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Are you sure you put the box in the place you say at the time
      you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARLOW. Yes, your Worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Very well; then now let us have the officer.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MARLOW leaves the box, and Snow goes into it.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      USHER. The evidence you give to the court shall be the truth, the whole
      truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God. [The book is kissed.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. [Reading from his papers.] Your name is Robert Allow? You are a
      detective in the X. B. division of the Metropolitan police force?
      According to instructions received did you on Easter Tuesday last proceed
      to the prisoner's lodgings at 34, Merthyr Street, St. Soames's? And did
      you on entering see the box produced, lying on the table?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. Is that the box?
    </p>
    <p>
      Snow. [Fingering the box.] Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. And did you thereupon take possession of it, and charge the female
      prisoner with theft of the box from 6, Rockingham Gate? And did she deny
      the same?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. Did you take her into custody?
    </p>
    <p>
      Snow. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. What was her behaviour?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. Perfectly quiet, your Worship. She persisted in the denial. That's
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. DO you know her?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. No, your Worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Is she known here?
    </p>
    <p>
      BALD CONSTABLE. No, your Worship, they're neither of them known, we 've
      nothing against them at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. [To MRS. JONES.] Have you anything to ask the officer?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, sir, thank you, I 've nothing to ask him.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Very well then -- go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. [Reading from his papers.] And while you were taking the female
      prisoner did the male prisoner interpose, and endeavour to hinder you in
      the execution of your duty, and did he strike you a blow?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. Yes, Sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. And did he say, "You, let her go, I took the box myself"?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. He did.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. And did you blow your whistle and obtain the assistance of another
      constable, and take him into custody?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. Was he violent on the way to the station, and did he use bad
      language, and did he several times repeat that he had taken the box
      himself?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Snow nods.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Did you thereupon ask him in what manner he had stolen the box? And did
      you understand him to say he had entered the house at the invitation of
      young Mr. BARTHWICK
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [BARTHWICK, turning in his seat, frowns at ROPER.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      after midnight on Easter Monday, and partaken of whisky, and that under
      the influence of the whisky he had taken the box?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. I did, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLERK. And was his demeanour throughout very violent?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. It was very violent.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Breaking in.] Violent -- -of course it was! You put your 'ands
      on my wife when I kept tellin' you I took the thing myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Hissing, with protruded neck.] Now -- you will have your
      chance of saying what you want to say presently. Have you anything to ask
      the officer?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Sullenly.] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Very well then. Now let us hear what the female prisoner has
      to say first.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Well, your Worship, of course I can only say what I 've said
      all along, that I did n't take the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes, but did you know that it was taken?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, your Worship. And, of course, to what my husband says,
      your Worship, I can't speak of my own knowledge. Of course, I know that he
      came home very late on the Monday night. It was past one o'clock when he
      came in, and he was not himself at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Had he been drinking?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, your Worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. And was he drunk?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, your Worship, he was almost quite drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. And did he say anything to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. No, your Worship, only to call me names. And of course in the
      morning when I got up and went to work he was asleep. And I don't know
      anything more about it until I came home again. Except that Mr. BARTHWICK -- that
      's my employer, your Worship -- told me the box was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. But of course when I was shaking out my husband's coat the
      cigarette-box fell out and all the cigarettes were scattered on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. You say all the cigarettes were scattered on the bed? [To
      SNOW.] Did you see the cigarettes scattered on the bed?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. No, your Worship, I did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. You see he says he did n't see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. Well, they were there for all that.
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. I can't say, your Worship, that I had the opportunity of going round
      the room; I had all my work cut out with the male prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [To MRS. JONES.] Well, what more have you to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Of course when I saw the box, your Worship, I was dreadfully
      upset, and I could n't think why he had done such a thing; when the
      officer came we were having words about it, because it is ruin to me, your
      Worship, in my profession, and I have three little children dependent on
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Protruding his neck]. Yes -- yes -- but what did he say
      to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. I asked him whatever came over him to do such a thing  -- and
      he said it was the drink. He said he had had too much to drink, and
      something came over him. And of course, your Worship, he had had very
      little to eat all day, and the drink does go to the head when you have not
      had enough to eat. Your Worship may not know, but it is the truth. And I
      would like to say that all through his married life, I have never known
      him to do such a thing before, though we have passed through great
      hardships and [speaking with soft emphasis] I am quite sure he would not
      have done it if he had been himself at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes. But don't you know that that is no excuse?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, your Worship. I know that it is no excuse.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. Tsst! [Sheltering his mouth he speaks to ROPER.] Roper, you had
      better get up now and say that considering the circumstances and the
      poverty of the prisoners, we have no wish to proceed any further, and if
      the magistrate would deal with the case as one of disorder only on the
      part of --  --

    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Now, supposing what you say and what your husband says is
      true, what I have to consider is -- how did he obtain access to this
      house, and were you in any way a party to his obtaining access? You are
      the charwoman employed at the house?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Yes, your Worship, and of course if I had let him into the
      house it would have been very wrong of me; and I have never done such a
      thing in any of the houses where I have been employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Well -- so you say. Now let us hear what story the male
      prisoner makes of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Who leans with his arms on the dock behind, speaks in a slow,
      sullen voice.] Wot I say is wot my wife says. I 've never been 'ad up in a
      police court before, an' I can prove I took it when in liquor. I told her,
      and she can tell you the same, that I was goin' to throw the thing into
      the water sooner then 'ave it on my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. But how did you get into the HOUSE?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. I was passin'. I was goin' 'ome from the "Goat and Bells."
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. The "Goat and Bells," -- what is that? A public-house?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. Yes, at the corner. It was Bank 'oliday, an' I'd 'ad a drop to
      drink. I see this young Mr. BARTHWICK tryin' to find the keyhole on the
      wrong side of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Slowly and with many pauses.] Well -- -I 'elped 'im to find it -- drunk
      as a lord 'e was. He goes on, an' comes back again, and says, I 've got
      nothin' for you, 'e says, but come in an' 'ave a drink. So I went in just
      as you might 'ave done yourself. We 'ad a drink o' whisky just as you
      might have 'ad, 'nd young Mr. BARTHWICK says to me, "Take a drink 'nd a
      smoke. Take anything you like, 'e says." And then he went to sleep on the
      sofa. I 'ad some more whisky -- an' I 'ad a smoke -- and I 'ad some
      more whisky -- an' I carn't tell yer what 'appened after that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Do you mean to say that you were so drunk that you can
      remember nothing?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Softly to his father.] I say, that's exactly what --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. TSSh!
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. That's what I do mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. And yet you say you stole the box?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. I never stole the box. I took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Hissing with protruded neck.] You did not steal it --  you
      took it. Did it belong to you -- what is that but stealing?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. I took it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. You took it -- you took it away from their house and you
      took it to your house --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Sullenly breaking in.] I ain't got a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Very well, let us hear what this young man Mr. -- Mr.
      BARTHWICK has to say to your story.

      ROPER. Speak up, please. Do you know the prisoners?
    </p>

      JACK. [Looking at the JONESES, in a low voice.] I 've seen Mrs. Jones. I
      [in a loud voice] don't know the man.

      JACK. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. And did you by mistake leave your latch key in the door?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Oh! You left your latch-key in the door?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. And is that all you can remember about your coming in?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [In a loud voice.] Yes, it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Now, you have heard the male prisoner's story, what do you say
      to that?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Turning to the MAGISTRATE, speaks suddenly in a confident,
      straight-forward voice.] The fact of the matter is, sir, that I 'd been
      out to the theatre that night, and had supper afterwards, and I came in
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Do you remember this man being outside when you came in?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. No, Sir. [He hesitates.] I don't think I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Somewhat puzzled.] Well, did he help you to open the door, as
      he says? Did any one help you to open the door?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. No, sir -- I don't think so, sir -- I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. You don't know? But you must know. It is n't a usual thing for
      you to have the door opened for you, is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [With a shamefaced smile.] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Very well, then --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Desperately.] The fact of the matter is, sir, I'm afraid I'd had
      too much champagne that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Smiling.] Oh! you'd had too much champagne?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. May I ask the gentleman a question?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes -- yes -- you may ask him what questions you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. Don't you remember you said you was a Liberal, same as your father,
      and you asked me wot I was?
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [With his hand against his brow.] I seem to remember --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. And I said to you, "I'm a bloomin' Conservative," I said; an' you
      said to me, "You look more like one of these 'ere Socialists. Take wotever
      you like," you said.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [With sudden resolution.] No, I don't. I don't remember anything of
      the sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. Well, I do, an' my word's as good as yours. I 've never been had up
      in a police court before. Look 'ere, don't you remember you had a sky-blue
      bag in your 'and [BARTHWICK jumps.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. I submit to your worship that these questions are hardly to the
      point, the prisoner having admitted that he himself does not remember
      anything. [There is a smile on the face of Justice.] It is a case of the
      blind leading the blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Violently.] I've done no more than wot he 'as. I'm a poor man;
      I've got no money an' no friends -- he 's a toff -- he can do wot I
      can't.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE: Now, now? All this won't help you -- you must be quiet. You
      say you took this box? Now, what made you take it? Were you pressed for
      money?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. I'm always pressed for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Was that the reason you took it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [To SNOW.] Was anything found on him?
    </p>
    <p>
      SNOW. Yes, your worship. There was six pounds twelve shillin's found on
      him, and this purse.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Staring at the purse.] Yes, yes -- let me see [There is a
      silence.] No, no, I 've nothing before me as to the purse. How did you
      come by all that money?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [After a long pause, suddenly.] I declines to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. But if you had all that money, what made you take this box?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. I took it out of spite.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Hissing, with protruded neck.] You took it out of spite? Well
      now, that's something! But do you imagine you can go about the town taking
      things out of spite?

      JONES. If you had my life, if you'd been out of work --  --

      MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes; I know -- because you're out of work you think
      it's an excuse for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Pointing at JACK.] You ask 'im wot made 'im take the --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      ROPER. [Quietly.] Does your Worship require this witness in the box any
      longer?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Ironically.] I think not; he is hardly profitable.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        [JACK leaves the witness-box, and hanging his head, resumes his seat.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JONES. You ask 'im wot made 'im take the lady's --  -- 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [But the BALD CONSTABLE catches him by the sleeve.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      BALD CONSTABLE. SSSh!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Emphatically.] Now listen to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I 've nothing to do with what he may or may not have taken. Why did you
      resist the police in the execution of their duty?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. It war n't their duty to take my wife, a respectable woman, that
      'ad n't done nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. But I say it was. What made you strike the officer a blow?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. Any man would a struck 'im a blow. I'd strike 'im again, I would.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. You are not making your case any better by violence. How do
      you suppose we could get on if everybody behaved like you?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Leaning forward, earnestly.] Well, wot, about 'er; who's to make
      up to 'er for this? Who's to give 'er back 'er good name?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. Your Worship, it's the children that's preying on his mind,
      because of course I 've lost my work. And I've had to find another room
      owing to the scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes, I know -- but if he had n't acted like this
      nobody would have suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Glaring round at JACK.] I 've done no worse than wot 'e 'as. Wot I
      want to know is wot 's goin' to be done to 'im.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The BALD CONSTABLE again says "HSSh"]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ROPER. Mr. BARTHWICK wishes it known, your Worship, that considering the
      poverty of the prisoners, he does not press the charge as to the box.
      Perhaps your Worship would deal with the case as one of disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. I don't want it smothered up, I want it all dealt with fair  -- I
      want my rights --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. [Rapping his desk.] Now you have said all you have to say, and
      you will be quiet.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [There is a silence; the MAGISTRATE bends over and parleys with his
        CLERK.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Yes, I think I may discharge the woman. [In a kindly voice he addresses
      MRS. JONES, who stands unmoving with her hands crossed on the rail.] It is
      very unfortunate for you that this man has behaved as he has. It is not
      the consequences to him but the consequences to you. You have been brought
      here twice, you have lost your work --  [He glares at JONES] -- and
      this is what always happens. Now you may go away, and I am very sorry it
      was necessary to bring you here at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Softly.] Thank you very much, your Worship.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She leaves the dock, and looking back at JONES, twists her fingers and
        is still.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Yes, yes, but I can't pass it over. Go away, there's a good
      woman.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MRS. JONES stands back. The MAGISTRATE leans his head on his hand; then
        raising it he speaks to JONES.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Now, listen to me. Do you wish the case to be settled here, or do you wish
      it to go before a jury?
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. [Muttering.] I don't want no jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Very well then, I will deal with it here. [After a pause.] You
      have pleaded guilty to stealing this box --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. Not to stealin' --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      BALD CONSTABLE. HSSShh!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. And to assaulting the police --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      JONES. Any man as was a man --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. Your conduct here has been most improper. You give the excuse
      that you were drunk when you stole the box. I tell you that is no excuse.
      If you choose to get drunk and break the law afterwards you must take the
      consequences. And let me tell you that men like you, who get drunk and
      give way to your spite or whatever it is that's in you, are -- are -- a
      nuisance to the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      JACK. [Leaning from his seat.] Dad! that's what you said to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      BARTHWICK. TSSt!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [There is a silence, while the MAGISTRATE consults his CLERK; JONES
        leans forward waiting.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. This is your first offence, and I am going to give you a light
      sentence. [Speaking sharply, but without expression.] One month with hard
      labour.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He bends, and parleys with his CLERK. The BALD CONSTABLE and another
        help JONES from the dock.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JONES. [Stopping and twisting round.] Call this justice? What about 'im?
      'E got drunk! 'E took the purse -- 'e took the purse but [in a muffled
      shout] it's 'is money got 'im off -- JUSTICE!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The prisoner's door is shut on JONES, and from the seedy-looking men
        and women comes a hoarse and whispering groan.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAGISTRATE. We will now adjourn for lunch! [He rises from his seat.]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The Court is in a stir. ROPER gets up and speaks to the reporter. JACK,
        throwing up his head, walks with a swagger to the corridor; BARTHWICK
        follows.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. JONES. [Turning to him zenith a humble gesture.] Oh! sir!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [BARTHWICK hesitates, then yielding to his nerves, he makes a
        shame-faced gesture of refusal, and hurries out of court. MRS. JONES
        stands looking after him.]

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
