<A NAME="MAIN"></A>

    <H2>1</H2>
    <P>STRAY birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away. </P>
    <P>And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall there
    with a sigh. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>2</H2>
    <P>O TROUPE of little vagrants of the world, leave your footprints in my
    words. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>3</H2>
    <P>THE world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover. </P>
    <P>It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>4</H2>
    <P>IT is the tears of the earth that keep her smiles in bloom. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>5</H2>
    <P>THE mighty desert is burning for the love of a blade of grass who shakes
    her head and laughs and flies away. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>6</H2>
    <P>IF you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>7</H2>
    <P>THE sands in your way beg for your song and your movement, dancing water.
    Will you carry the burden of their lameness? </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>8</H2>
    <P>HER wistful face haunts my dreams like the rain at night. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>9</H2>
    <P>ONCE we dreamt that we were strangers. </P>
    <P>We wake up to find that we were dear to each other. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>10</H2>
    <P>SORROW is hushed into peace in my heart like the evening among the silent
    trees. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>11</H2>
    <P>SOME unseen fingers, like idle breeze, are playing upon my heart the
    music of the ripples. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>12</H2>
    <P>"WHAT language is thine, O sea?" </P>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The language of eternal question." </P>
    <P>"What language is thy answer, O sky? </P>
    <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The language of eternal silence." </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>13</H2>
    <P>LISTEN, my heart, to the whispers of the world with which it makes love
    to you. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>14</H2>
    <P>THE mystery of creation is like the darkness of night--it is great.
    Delusions of knowledge are like the fog of the morning. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>15</H2>
    <P>DO not seat your love upon a precipice because it is high. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>16</H2>
    <P>I SIT at my window this morning where the world like a passer-by stops
    for a moment, nods to me and goes. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>17</H2>
    <P>THESE little thoughts are the rustle of leaves; they have their whisper
    of joy in my mind. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>18</H2>
    <P>WHAT you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>19</H2>
    <P>MY wishes are fools, they shout across thy songs, my Master. </P>
    <P>Let me but listen. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>20</H2>
    <P>I CANNOT choose the best. </P>
    <P>The best chooses me. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>21</H2>
    <P>THEY throw their shadows before them who carry their lantern on their
    back. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>22</H2>
    <P>THAT I exist is a perpetual surprise which is life. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>23</H2>
    <P>"WE, the rustling leaves, have a voice that answers the storms, but who
    are you so silent?" </P>
    <P>"I am a mere flower." </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>24</H2>
    <P>REST belongs to the work as the eyelids to the eyes. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>25</H2>
    <P>MAN is a born child, his power is the power of growth. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>26</H2>
    <P>GOD expects answers for the flowers he sends us, not for the sun and the
    earth. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>27</H2>
    <P>THE light that plays, like a naked child, among the green leaves happily
    knows not that man can lie. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>28</H2>
    <P>O BEAUTY, find thyself in love, not in the flattery of thy mirror. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>29</H2>
    <P>MY heart beats her waves at the shore of the world and writes upon it her
    signature in tears with the words, "I love thee." </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>30</H2>
    <P>"MOON, for what do you wait?" </P>
    <P>"To salute the sun for whom I must make way." </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>31</H2>
    <P>THE trees come up to my window like the yearning voice of the dumb earth.
    </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>32</H2>
    <P>HIS own mornings are new surprises to God. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>33</H2>
    <P>LIFE finds its wealth by the claims of the world, and its worth by the
    claims of love. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>34</H2>
    <P>THE dry river-bed finds no thanks for its past. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>35</H2>
    <P>THE bird wishes it were a cloud. The cloud wishes it were a bird. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>36</H2>
    <P>THE waterfall sings, "I find my song, when I find my freedom." </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>37</H2>
    <P>I CANNOT tell why this heart languishes in silence. </P>
    <P>It is for small needs it never asks, or knows or remembers. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>38</H2>
    <P>WOMAN, when you move about in your household service your limbs sing like
    a hill stream among its pebbles. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>39</H2>
    <P>THE sun goes to cross the Western sea, leaving its last salutation to the
    East. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>40</H2>
    <P>DO not blame your food because you have no appetite. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>41</H2>
    <P>THE trees, like the longings of the earth, stand a-tiptoe to peep at the
    heaven. </P><PRE>

</PRE>
    <H2>42</H2>
    <P>YOU smiled and talked to me of nothing and I felt that for this I had
    been waiting long. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>43</H2>
    <P>THE fish in the water is silent, the animal on the earth is noisy, the
    bird in the air is singing, </P>
    <P>But Man has in him the silence of the sea, the noise of the earth and the
    music of the air. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>44</H2>
    <P>THE world rushes on over the strings of the lingering heart making the
    music of sadness. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>45</H2>
    <P>HE has made his weapons his gods. When his weapons win he is defeated
    himself. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>46</H2>
    <P>GOD finds himself by creating. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>47</H2>
    <P>SHADOW, with her veil drawn, follows Light in secret meekness, with her
    silent steps of love. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>48</H2>
    <P>THE stars are not afraid to appear like fireflies. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>49</H2>
    <P>I THANK thee that I am none of the wheels of power but I am one with the
    living creatures that are crushed by it. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>50</H2>
    <P>THE mind, sharp but not broad, sticks at every point but does not move.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>51</H2>
    <P>YOUR idol is shattered in the dust to prove that God's dust is greater
    than your idol. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>52</H2>
    <P>MAN does not reveal himself in his history, he struggles up through it.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>53</H2>
    <P>WHILE the glass lamp rebukes the earthen for calling it cousin, the moon
    rises, and the glass lamp, with a bland smile, calls her, "My dear, dear
    sister." </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>54</H2>
    <P>LIKE the meeting of the seagulls and the waves we meet and come near. The
    seagulls fly off, the waves roll away and we depart. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>55</H2>
    <P>MY day is done, and I am like a boat drawn on the beach, listening to the
    dance-music of the tide in the evening. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>56</H2>
    <P>LIFE is given to us, we earn it by giving it. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>57</H2>
    <P>WE come nearest to the great when we are great in humility. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>58</H2>
    <P>THE sparrow is sorry for the peacock at the burden of its tail. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>59</H2>
    <P>NEVER be afraid of the moments--thus sings the voice of the everlasting.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>60</H2>
    <P>THE hurricane seeks the shortest road by the no-road, and suddenly ends
    its search in the Nowhere. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>61</H2>
    <P>TAKE my wine in my own cup, friend. </P>
    <P>It loses its wreath of foam when poured into that of others. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>62</H2>
    <P>THE Perfect decks itself in beauty for the love of the Imperfect. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>63</H2>
    <P>GOD says to man, "I heal you therefore I hurt, love you therefore
    punish." </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>64</H2>
    <P>THANK the flame for its light, but do not forget the lampholder standing
    in the shade with constancy of patience. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>65</H2>
    <P>TINY grass, your steps are small, but you possess the earth under your
    tread. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>66</H2>
    <P>THE infant flower opens its bud and cries, "Dear World, please do not
    fade." </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>67</H2>
    <P>GOD grows weary of great kingdoms, but never of little flowers. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>68</H2>
    <P>WRONG cannot afford defeat but Right can. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>69</H2>
    <P>"I GIVE my whole water in joy," sings the waterfall, "though little of it
    is enough for the thirsty." </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>70</H2>
    <P>WHERE is the fountain that throws up these flowers in a ceaseless
    outbreak of ecstasy? </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>71</H2>
    <P>THE woodcutter's axe begged for its handle from the tree. </P>
    <P>The tree gave it. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>72</H2>
    <P>IN my solitude of heart I feel the sigh of this widowed evening veiled
    with mist and rain. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>73</H2>
    <P>CHASTITY is a wealth that comes from abundance of love. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>74</H2>
    <P>THE mist, like love, plays upon the heart of the hills and brings out
    surprises of beauty. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>75</H2>
    <P>WE read the world wrong and say that it deceives us. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>76</H2>
    <P>THE poet wind is out over the sea and the forest to seek his own voice.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>77</H2>
    <P>EVERY child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of
    man. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>78</H2>
    <P>THE grass seeks her crowd in the earth. </P>
    <P>The tree seeks his solitude of the sky. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>79</H2>
    <P>MAN barricades against himself. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>80</H2>
    <P>YOUR voice, my friend, wanders in my heart, like the muffled sound of the
    sea among these listening pines. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>81</H2>
    <P>WHAT is this unseen flame of darkness whose sparks are the stars? </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>82</H2>
    <P>LET life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>83</H2>
    <P>HE who wants to do good knocks at the gate; he who loves finds the gate
    open. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>84</H2>
    <P>IN death the many becomes one; in life the one becomes many. </P>
    <P>Religion will be one when God is dead. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>85</H2>
    <P>THE artist is the lover of Nature, therefore he is her slave and her
    master. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>86</H2>
    <P>"HOW far are you from me, O Fruit?" </P>
    <P>"I am hidden in your heart, O Flower." </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>87</H2>
    <P>THIS longing is for the one who is felt in the dark, but not seen in the
    day. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>88</H2>
    <P>"YOU are the big drop of dew under the lotus leaf, I am the smaller one
    on its upper side," said the dewdrop to the lake. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>89</H2>
    <P>THE scabbard is content to be dull when it protects the keenness of the
    sword. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>90</H2>
    <P>IN darkness the One appears as uniform; in the light the One appears as
    manifold. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>91</H2>
    <P>THE great earth makes herself hospitable with the help of the grass. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>92</H2>
    <P>THE birth and death of the leaves are the rapid whirls of the eddy whose
    wider circles move slowly among stars. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>93</H2>
    <P>POWER said to the world, "You are mine. </P>
    <P>The world kept it prisoner on her throne. </P>
    <P>Love said to the world, "I am thine." </P>
    <P>The world gave it the freedom of her house. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>94</H2>
    <P>THE mist is like the earth's desire. It hides the sun for whom she cries.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>95</H2>
    <P>BE still, my heart, these great trees are prayers. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>96</H2>
    <P></P>
    <P>THE noise of the moment scoffs at the music of the Eternal. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>97</H2>
    <P>I THINK of other ages that floated upon the stream of life and love and
    death and are forgotten, and I feel the freedom of passing away. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>98</H2>
    <P>THE sadness of my soul is her bride's veil. </P>
    <P>It waits to be lifted in the night. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>99</H2>
    <P>DEATH'S stamp gives value to the coin of life; making it possible to buy
    with life what is truly precious. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>100</H2>
    <P>THE cloud stood humbly in a corner of the sky. </P>
    <P>The morning crowned it with splendour. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>101</H2>
    <P>THE dust receives insult and in return offers her flowers. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>102</H2>
    <P>DO not linger to gather flowers to keep them, but walk on, for flowers
    will keep themselves blooming all your way. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>103</H2>
    <P>ROOTS are the branches down in the earth. </P>
    <P>Branches are roots in the air. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>104</H2>
    <P>THE music of the far-away summer flutters around the Autumn seeking its
    former nest. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>105</H2>
    <P>DO not insult your friend by lending him merits from your own pocket. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>106</H2>
    <P>THE touch of the nameless days clings to my heart like mosses round the
    old tree. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>107</H2>
    <P>THE echo mocks her origin to prove she is the original. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>108</H2>
    <P>GOD is ashamed when the prosperous boasts of His special favour. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>109</H2>
    <P>I CAST my own shadow upon my path, because I have a lamp that has not
    been lighted. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>110</H2>
    <P>MAN goes into the noisy crowd to drown his own clamour of silence. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>111</H2>
    <P>THAT which ends in exhaustion is death, but the perfect ending is in the
    endless. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>112</H2>
    <P>THE sun has his simple robe of light. The clouds are decked with
    gorgeousness. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>113</H2>
    <P>THE hills are like shouts of children who raise their arms, trying to
    catch stars. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>114</H2>
    <P>THE road is lonely in its crowd for it is not loved. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>115</H2>
    <P>THE power that boasts of its mischiefs is laughed at by the yellow leaves
    that fall, and clouds that pass by. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>116</H2>
    <P>THE earth hums to me to-day in the sun, like a woman at her spinng, some
    ballad of the ancient time in a forgotten tongue. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>117</H2>
    <P>THE grass-blade is worth of the great world where it grows. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>118</H2>
    <P>DREAM is a wife who must talk. </P>
    <P>Sleep is a husband who silently suffers. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>119</H2>
    <P>THE night kisses the fading day whispering to his ear, "I am death, your
    mother. I am to give you fresh birth." </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>120</H2>
    <P>I FEEL, thy beauty, dark night, like that of the loved woman when she has
    put out the lamp. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>121</H2>
    <P>I CARRY in my world that flourishes the worlds that have failed. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>122</H2>
    <P>DEAR friend, I feel the silence of your great thoughts of may a deepening
    eventide on this beach when I listen to these waves. </P><PRE>

    <H2>261</H2>
    <P>LET your music, like a sword, pierce the noise of the market to its
    heart. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>262</H2>
    <P>THE trembling leaves of this tree touch my heart like the fingers of an
    infant child. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>263</H2>
    <P>THIS sadness of my soul is her bride's veil. </P>
    <P>It waits to be lifted in the night. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>264</H2>
    <P>THE little flower lies in the dust. </P>
    <P>It sought the path of the butterfly. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>265</H2>
    <P>I AM in the world of the roads. The night comes. Open thy gate, thou
    world of the home. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>266</H2>
    <P>I HAVE sung the songs of thy day. In the evening let me carry thy lamp
    through the stormy path. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>267</H2>
    <P>I DO not ask thee into the house. </P>
    <P>Come into my infinite loneliness, my Lover. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>268</H2>
    <P>DEATH belongs to life as birth does. The walk is in the raising of the
    foot as in the laying of it down. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>269</H2>
    <P>I HAVE learnt the simple meaning of thy whispers in flowers and
    sunshine--teach me to know thy words in pain and death. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>270</H2>
    <P>THE night's flower was late when the morning kissed her, she shivered and
    sighed and dropped to the ground. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>271</H2>
    <P>THROUGH the sadness of all things I hear the crooning of the Eternal
    Mother. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>272</H2>
    <P>I CAME to your shore as a stranger, I lived in your house as a guest, I
    leave your door as a friend, my earth. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>273</H2>
    <P>LET my thoughts come to you, when I am gone, like the afterglow of sunset
    at the margin of starry silence. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>274</H2>
    <P>LIGHT in my heart the evening star of rest and then let the night whisper
    to me of love. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>275</H2>
    <P>I AM a child in the dark. </P>
    <P>I stretch my hands through the coverlet of night for thee, Mother. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>276</H2>
    <P>THE day of work is done. Hide my face in your arms, Mother. </P>
    <P>Let me dream. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>277</H2>
    <P>THE lamp of meeting burns long; it goes out in a moment at the parting.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>278</H2>
    <P>ONE word keep for me in thy silence, O World, when I am dead, "I have
    loved." </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>279</H2>
    <P>WE live in this world when we love it. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>280</H2>
    <P>LET the dead have the immortality of fame, but the living the immortality
    of love. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>281</H2>
    <P>I HAVE seen thee as the half-awakened child sees his mother in the dusk
    of the dawn and then smiles and sleeps again. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>282</H2>
    <P>I SHALL die again and again to know that life is inexhaustible. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>283</H2>
    <P>WHILE I was passing with the crowd in the road I saw thy smile from the
    balcony and I sang and forgot all noise. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>284</H2>
    <P>LOVE is life in its fulness like the cup with its wine. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>285</H2>
    <P>THEY light their own lamps and sing their own words in their temples.</P>
    <P>But the birds sing thy name in thine own morning light,--for thy name is
    joy. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>286</H2>
    <P>LEAD me in the centre of thy silence to fill my heart with songs. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>287</H2>
    <P>LET them live who choose in their own hissing world of fireworks. </P>
    <P>My heart longs for thy stars, my God. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>288</H2>
    <P>LOVE'S pain sang round my life like the unplumbed sea, and love's joy
    sang like birds in its flowering groves. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>289</H2>
    <P>PUT out the lamp when thou wishest. </P>
    <P>I shall know thy darkness and shall love it. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>290</H2>
    <P>WHEN I stand before thee at the day's end thou shalt see my scars and
    know that I had my wounds and also my healing. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>291</H2>
    <P>SOME day I shall sing to thee in the sunrise of some other world, "I have
    seen thee before in the light of the earth, in the love of man." </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>292</H2>
    <P>CLOUDS come floating into my life from other days no longer to shed rain
    or usher storm but to give colour to my sunset sky. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>293</H2>
    <P>TRUTH raises against itself the storm that scatters its seeds broadcast.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>294</H2>
    <P>THE storm of the last night has crowned this morning with golden peace.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>295</H2>
    <P>TRUTH seems to come with its final word; and the final word gives birth
    to its next. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>296</H2>
    <P>BLESSED is he whose fame does not outshine his truth. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>297</H2>
    <P>SWEETNESS of thy name fills my heart when I forget mine--like thy morning
    sun when the mist is melted. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>298</H2>
    <P>THE silent night has the beauty of the mother and the clamorous day of
    the child. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>299</H2>
    <P>THE world loved man when he smiled. The world became afraid of him when
    he laughed. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>300</H2>
    <P>GOD waits for man to regain his childhood in wisdom. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>301</H2>
    <P>LET me feel this world as thy love taking form, then my love will help
    it. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>302</H2>
    <P>THY sunshine smiles upon the winter days of my heart, never doubting of
    its spring flowers. <PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>303</H2>
    <P>GOD kisses the finite in his love and man the infinite. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>304</H2>
    <P>THOU crossest desert lands of barren years to reach the moment of
    fulfilment. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>305</H2>
    <P>GOD's silence ripens man's thoughts into speech. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>306</H2>
    <P>THOU wilt find, Eternal Traveller, marks of thy footsteps across my
    songs. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>307</H2>
    <P>LET me not shame thee, Father, who displayest thy glory in thy children.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>308</H2>
    <P>CHEERLESS is the day, the light under frowning clouds is like a punished
    child with traces of tears on its pale cheeks, and the cry of the wind is
    like the cry of a wounded world. But I know I am travelling to meet my
    Friend. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>309</H2>
    <P>TO-NIGHT there is a stir among the palm leaves, a swell in the sea, Full
    Moon, like the heart throb of the world. From what unknown sky hast thou
    carried in thy silence the aching secret of love? </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>310</H2>
    <P>I DREAM of a star, an island of light, where I shall be born and in the
    depth of its quickening leisure my life will ripen its works like the
    ricefield in the autumn sun. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>311</H2>
    <P>THE smell of the wet earth in the rain rises like a great chant of praise
    from the voiceless multitude of the insignificant. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>312</H2>
    <P>THAT love can ever lose is a fact that we cannot accept as truth. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>313</H2>
    <P>WE shall know some day that death can never rob us of that which our soul
    has gained, for her gains are one with herself. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>314</H2>
    <P>GOD comes to me in the dusk of my evening with the flowers from my past
    kept fresh in his basket. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>315</H2>
    <P>WHEN all the strings of my life will be tuned, my Master, then at every
    touch of thine will come out the music of love. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>316</H2>
    <P>LET me live truly, my Lord, so that death to me become true. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>317</H2>
    <P>MAN'S history is waiting in patience for the triumph of the insulted man.
    </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>318</H2>
    <P>I FEEL thy gaze upon my heart this moment like the sunny silence of the
    morning upon the lonely field whose harvest is over. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>319</H2>
    <P>I LONG for the Island of Songs across this heaving Sea of Shouts. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>320</H2>
    <P>THE prelude of the night is commenced in the music of the sunset, in its
    solemn hymn to the ineffable dark. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>321</H2>
    <P>I HAVE scaled the peak and found no shelter in fame's bleak and barren
    height. Lead me, my Guide, before the light fades, into the valley of quiet
    where life's harvest mellows into golden wisdom. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>322</H2>
    <P>THINGS look phantastic in this dimness of the dusk--the spires whose
    bases are lost in the dark and tree tops like blots of ink. I shall wait for
    the morning and wake up to see thy city in the light. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>323</H2>
    <P>I HAVE suffered and despaired and known death and I am glad that I am in
    this great world. </P><PRE>

    <H2>324</H2>
    <P>THERE are tracts in my life that are bare and silent. They are the open
    spaces where my busy days had their light and air. </P><PRE>
</PRE>
    <H2>325</H2>
    <P>RELEASE me from my unfulfilled past clinging to me from behind making
    death difficult. </P><PRE>

    <H2>326</H2>
    <P>LET this be my last word, that I trust in thy love. </P><PRE>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
