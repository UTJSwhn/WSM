    <h2>
      ACT I
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is noon. In the Underwoods' dining-room a bright fire is burning. On
        one side of the fireplace are double-doors leading to the drawing-room,
        on the other side a door leading to the hall. In the centre of the room
        a long dining-table without a cloth is set out as a Board table. At the
        head of it, in the Chairman's seat, sits JOHN ANTHONY, an old man, big,
        clean-shaven, and high-coloured, with thick white hair, and thick dark
        eyebrows. His movements are rather slow and feeble, but his eyes are
        very much alive. There is a glass of water by his side. On his right
        sits his son EDGAR, an earnest-looking man of thirty, reading a
        newspaper. Next him WANKLIN, a man with jutting eyebrows, and
        silver-streaked light hair, is bending over transfer papers. TENCH, the
        Secretary, a short and rather humble, nervous man, with side whiskers,
        stands helping him. On WANKLIN'S right sits UNDERWOOD, the Manager, a
        quiet man, with along, stiff jaw, and steady eyes. Back to the fire is
        SCANTLEBURY, a very large, pale, sleepy man, with grey hair, rather
        bald. Between him and the Chairman are two empty chairs.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WILDER. [Who is lean, cadaverous, and complaining, with drooping grey
      moustaches, stands before the fire.] I say, this fire's the devil! Can I
      have a screen, Tench?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. A screen, ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. Certainly, Mr. Wilder. [He looks at UNDERWOOD.] That is&mdash;
      perhaps the Manager&mdash;perhaps Mr. Underwood&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. These fireplaces of yours, Underwood&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. [Roused from studying some papers.] A screen? Rather! I'm
      sorry. [He goes to the door with a little smile.] We're not accustomed to
      complaints of too much fire down here just now.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He speaks as though he holds a pipe between his teeth, slowly,
        ironically.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WILDER. [In an injured voice.] You mean the men. H'm!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [UNDERWOOD goes out.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. Poor devils!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. It's their own fault, Scantlebury.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Holding out his paper.] There's great distress among them,
      according to the Trenartha News.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Oh, that rag! Give it to Wanklin. Suit his Radical views. They
      call us monsters, I suppose. The editor of that rubbish ought to be shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Reading.] "If the Board of worthy gentlemen who control the
      Trenartha Tin Plate Works from their arm-chairs in London would condescend
      to come and see for themselves the conditions prevailing amongst their
      work-people during this strike&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Well, we have come.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Continuing.] "We cannot believe that even their leg-of-mutton
      hearts would remain untouched."
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [WANKLIN takes the paper from him.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WILDER. Ruffian! I remember that fellow when he had n't a penny to his
      name; little snivel of a chap that's made his way by black-guarding
      everybody who takes a different view to himself.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ANTHONY says something that is not heard.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WILDER. What does your father say?
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. He says "The kettle and the pot."
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. H'm!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He sits down next to SCANTLEBURY.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Blowing out his cheeks.] I shall boil if I don't get that
      screen.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [UNDERWOOD and ENID enter with a screen, which they place before the
        fire. ENID is tall; she has a small, decided face, and is twenty-eight
        years old.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ENID. Put it closer, Frank. Will that do, Mr. Wilder? It's the highest
      we've got.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Thanks, capitally.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Turning, with a sigh of pleasure.] Ah! Merci, Madame!
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Is there anything else you want, Father? [ANTHONY shakes his head.]
      Edgar&mdash;anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. You might give me a "J" nib, old girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. There are some down there by Mr. Scantlebury.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Handing a little box of nibs.] Ah! your brother uses "J's."
      What does the manager use? [With expansive politeness.] What does your
      husband use, Mrs. Underwood?
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. A quill!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. The homely product of the goose. [He holds out quills.]
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. [Drily.] Thanks, if you can spare me one. [He takes a quill.]
      What about lunch, Enid?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Stopping at the double-doors and looking back.] We're going to have
      lunch here, in the drawing-room, so you need n't hurry with your meeting.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [WANKLIN and WILDER bow, and she goes out.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Rousing himself, suddenly.] Ah! Lunch! That hotel&mdash;
      Dreadful! Did you try the whitebait last night? Fried fat!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Past twelve! Are n't you going to read the minutes, Tench?
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. [Looking for the CHAIRMAN'S assent, reads in a rapid and monotonous
      voice.] "At a Board Meeting held the 31st of January at the Company's
      Offices, 512, Cannon Street, E.C. Present&mdash;Mr. Anthony in the chair,
      Messrs. F. H. Wilder, William Scantlebury, Oliver Wanklin, and Edgar
      Anthony. Read letters from the Manager dated January 20th, 23d, 25th,
      28th, relative to the strike at the Company's Works. Read letters to the
      Manager of January 21st, 24th, 26th, 29th. Read letter from Mr. Simon
      Harness, of the Central Union, asking for an interview with the Board.
      Read letter from the Men's Committee, signed David Roberts, James Green,
      John Bulgin, Henry Thomas, George Rous, desiring conference with the
      Board; and it was resolved that a special Board Meeting be called for
      February 7th at the house of the Manager, for the purpose of discussing
      the situation with Mr. Simon Harness and the Men's Committee on the spot.
      Passed twelve transfers, signed and sealed nine certificates and one
      balance certificate."
    </p>
    <p>
      [He pushes the book over to the CHAIRMAN.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. [With a heavy sigh.] If it's your pleasure, sign the same.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He signs, moving the pen with difficulty. ]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. What's the Union's game, Tench? They have n't made up their split
      with the men. What does Harness want this interview for?
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. Hoping we shall come to a compromise, I think, sir; he's having a
      meeting with the men this afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Harness! Ah! He's one of those cold-blooded, cool-headed chaps. I
      distrust them. I don't know that we didn't make a mistake to come down.
      What time'll the men be here?
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. Any time now.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Well, if we're not ready, they'll have to wait&mdash;won't do them
      any harm to cool their heels a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Slowly.] Poor devils! It's snowing. What weather!
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. [With meaning slowness.] This house'll be the warmest place
      they've been in this winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Well, I hope we're going to settle this business in time for me to
      catch the 6.30. I've got to take my wife to Spain to-morrow. [Chattily.]
      My old father had a strike at his works in '69; just such a February as
      this. They wanted to shoot him.
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. What! In the close season?
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. By George, there was no close season for employers then! He used
      to go down to his office with a pistol in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Faintly alarmed.] Not seriously?
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. [With finality.] Ended in his shootin' one of 'em in the legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Unavoidably feeling his thigh.] No? Which?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. [Lifting the agenda paper.] To consider the policy of the Board
      in relation to the strike. [There is a silence.]
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. It's this infernal three-cornered duel&mdash;the Union, the men,
      and ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. We need n't consider the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. It's my experience that you've always got to, consider the Union,
      confound them! If the Union were going to withdraw their support from the
      men, as they've done, why did they ever allow them to strike at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. We've had that over a dozen times.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Well, I've never understood it! It's beyond me. They talk of the
      engineers' and furnace-men's demands being excessive&mdash;so they are&mdash;but
      that's not enough to make the Union withdraw their support. What's behind
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. Fear of strikes at Harper's and Tinewell's.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. [With triumph.] Afraid of other strikes&mdash;now, that's a
      reason! Why could n't we have been told that before?
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. You were.
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. You were absent from the Board that day, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. The men must have seen they had no chance when the Union gave
      them up. It's madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. It's Roberts!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Just our luck, the men finding a fanatical firebrand like Roberts
      for leader. [A pause.]
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. [Looking at ANTHONY.] Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. [Breaking in fussily.] It's a regular mess. I don't like the
      position we're in; I don't like it; I've said so for a long time. [Looking
      at WANKLIN.] When Wanklin and I came down here before Christmas it looked
      as if the men must collapse. You thought so too, Underwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Well, they haven't! Here we are, going from bad to worse losing
      our customers&mdash;shares going down!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Shaking his head.] M'm! M'm!
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. What loss have we made by this strike, Tench?
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. Over fifty thousand, sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY, [Pained.] You don't say!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. We shall never got it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Who'd have supposed the men were going to stick out like this&mdash;nobody
      suggested that. [Looking angrily at TENCH.]
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Shaking his head.] I've never liked a fight&mdash;never
      shall.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. No surrender! [All look at him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Who wants to surrender? [ANTHONY looks at him.] I&mdash;I want to
      act reasonably. When the men sent Roberts up to the Board in December&mdash;then
      was the time. We ought to have humoured him; instead of that the Chairman&mdash;[Dropping
      his eyes before ANTHONY'S]&mdash;er&mdash;we snapped his head off. We
      could have got them in then by a little tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. No compromise!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. There we are! This strike's been going on now since October, and
      as far as I can see it may last another six months. Pretty mess we shall
      be in by then. The only comfort is, the men'll be in a worse!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [To UNDERWOOD.] What sort of state are they really in, Frank?
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. [Without expression.] Damnable!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Well, who on earth would have thought they'd have held on like
      this without support!
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. Those who know them.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. I defy any one to know them! And what about tin? Price going up
      daily. When we do get started we shall have to work off our contracts at
      the top of the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. What do you say to that, Chairman?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Can't be helped!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Shan't pay a dividend till goodness knows when!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [With emphasis.] We ought to think of the shareholders.
      [Turning heavily.] Chairman, I say we ought to think of the shareholders.
      [ANTHONY mutters.]
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. The Chairman says he is thinking of you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Sinking back into torpor.] Cynic!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. It's past a joke. I don't want to go without a dividend for years
      if the Chairman does. We can't go on playing ducks and drakes with the
      Company's prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Rather ashamedly.] I think we ought to consider the men.
    </p>

    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [With a sigh.] We must n't think of our private feelings,
      young man. That'll never do.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Ironically.] I'm not thinking of our feelings. I'm thinking of the
      men's.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. As to that&mdash;we're men of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. That is the little trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. There's no necessity for pushing things so far in the face of all
      this suffering&mdash;it's&mdash;it's cruel.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. [With an ironical smile.] I'm afraid we must n't base our policy
      on luxuries like sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. I detest this state of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. We did n't seek the quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. I know that sir, but surely we've gone far enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. No. [All look at one another.]
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. Luxuries apart, Chairman, we must look out what we're doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Give way to the men once and there'll be no end to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. I quite agree, but&mdash;&mdash;

    <blockquote>
      <p>

      You make it a question of bedrock principle?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ANTHONY nods.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Luxuries again, Chairman! The shares are below par.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Yes, and they'll drop to a half when we pass the next dividend.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [With alarm.] Come, come! Not so bad as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. [Grimly.] You'll see! [Craning forward to catch ANTHONY'S speech.]
      I didn't catch&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. [Hesitating.] The Chairman says, sir, "Fais que&mdash;que&mdash;devra."
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Sharply.] My father says: "Do what we ought&mdash;and let things
      rip."
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Tcha!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Throwing up his hands.] The Chairman's a Stoic&mdash;I
      always said the Chairman was a Stoic.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Much good that'll do us.
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. [Suavely.] Seriously, Chairman, are you going to let the ship
      sink under you, for the sake of&mdash;a principle?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. She won't sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [With alarm.] Not while I'm on the Board I hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. [With a twinkle.] Better rat, Scantlebury.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. What a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. I've always fought them; I've never been beaten yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. We're with you in theory, Chairman. But we're not all made of
      cast-iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. We've only to hold on.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. [Rising and going to the fire.] And go to the devil as fast as we
      can!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Better go to the devil than give in!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. [Fretfully.] That may suit you, sir, but it does n't suit me, or
      any one else I should think.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ANTHONY looks him in the face-a silence.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      EDGAR. I don't see how we can get over it that to go on like this means
      starvation to the men's wives and families.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [WILDER turns abruptly to the fire, and SCANTLEBURY puts out a hand to
        push the idea away.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. I'm afraid again that sounds a little sentimental.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. Men of business are excused from decency, you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Nobody's more sorry for the men than I am, but if they [lashing
      himself] choose to be such a pig-headed lot, it's nothing to do with us;
      we've quite enough on our hands to think of ourselves and the
      shareholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Irritably.] It won't kill the shareholders to miss a dividend or
      two; I don't see that that's reason enough for knuckling under.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [With grave discomfort.] You talk very lightly of your
      dividends, young man; I don't know where we are.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. There's only one sound way of looking at it. We can't go on
      ruining ourselves with this strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. No caving in!
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [With a gesture of despair.] Look at him!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

    <p>
      WILDER. [Returning to his seat.] Well, all I can say is, if that's the
      Chairman's view, I don't know what we've come down here for.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. To tell the men that we've got nothing for them&mdash;&mdash;
      [Grimly.] They won't believe it till they hear it spoken in plain English.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. H'm! Shouldn't be a bit surprised if that brute Roberts had n't
      got us down here with the very same idea. I hate a man with a grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Resentfully.] We didn't pay him enough for his discovery. I always
      said that at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. We paid him five hundred and a bonus of two hundred three years
      later. If that's not enough! What does he want, for goodness' sake?
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. [Complainingly.] Company made a hundred thousand out of his brains,
      and paid him seven hundred&mdash;that's the way he goes on, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. The man's a rank agitator! Look here, I hate the Unions. But now
      we've got Harness here let's get him to settle the whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. No! [Again they look at him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. Roberts won't let the men assent to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. Fanatic! Fanatic!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. [Looking at ANTHONY.] And not the only one! [FROST enters from the
      hall.]
    </p>
    <p>
      FROST. [To ANTHONY.] Mr. Harness from the Union, waiting, sir. The men are
      here too, sir.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ANTHONY nods. UNDERWOOD goes to the door, returning with HARNESS, a
        pale, clean-shaven man with hollow cheeks, quick eyes, and lantern jaw&mdash;FROST
        has retired.]

    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. [Pointing to TENCH'S chair.] Sit there next the Chairman,

    <blockquote>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [With a sharp look round, and a bow.] Thanks! [He sits&mdash;-
      his accent is slightly nasal.] Well, gentlemen, we're going to do business
      at last, I hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Depends on what you call business, Harness. Why don't you make the
      men come in?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Sardonically.] The men are far more in the right than you are.
      The question with us is whether we shan't begin to support them again.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He ignores them all, except ANTHONY, to whom he turns in speaking.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Support them if you like; we'll put in free labour and have done
      with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. That won't do, Mr. Anthony. You can't get free labour, and you
      know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. We shall see that.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. I'm quite frank with you. We were forced to withhold our support
      from your men because some of their demands are in excess of current
      rates. I expect to make them withdraw those demands to-day: if they do,
      take it straight from me, gentlemen, we shall back them again at once.
      Now, I want to see something fixed upon before I go back to-night. Can't
      we have done with this old-fashioned tug-of-war business? What good's it
      doing you? Why don't you recognise once for all that these people are men
      like yourselves, and want what's good for them just as you want what's
      good for you [Bitterly.] Your motor-cars, and champagne, and eight-course
      dinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. If the men will come in, we'll do something for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Ironically.] Is that your opinion too, sir&mdash;and yours&mdash;
      and yours? [The Directors do not answer.] Well, all I can say is: It's a
      kind of high and mighty aristocratic tone I thought we'd grown out of&mdash;seems
      I was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. It's the tone the men use. Remains to be seen which can hold out
      longest&mdash;they without us, or we without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. As business men, I wonder you're not ashamed of this waste of
      force, gentlemen. You know what it'll all end in.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. What?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. Compromise&mdash;it always does.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. Can't you persuade the men that their interests are the same
      as ours?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Turning, ironically.] I could persuade them of that, sir, if
      they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Come, Harness, you're a clever man, you don't believe all the
      Socialistic claptrap that's talked nowadays. There 's no real difference
      between their interests and ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. There's just one very simple question I'd like to put to you.
      Will you pay your men one penny more than they force you to pay them?
    </p>

        [WILDER is silent.]

    <p>
      WANKLIN. [Chiming in.] I humbly thought that not to pay more than was
      necessary was the A B C of commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [With irony.] Yes, that seems to be the A B C of commerce, sir;
      and the A B C of commerce is between your interests and the men's.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Whispering.] We ought to arrange something.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Drily.] Am I to understand then, gentlemen, that your Board is
      going to make no concessions?

    <p>
      EDGAR. [Looking up suddenly.] We're sorry for the state of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Icily.] The men have no use for your pity, sir. What they want
      is justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Then let them be just.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. For that word "just" read "humble," Mr. Anthony. Why should they
      be humble? Barring the accident of money, are n't they as good men as you?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Cant!
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. Well, I've been five years in America. It colours a man's
      notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Suddenly, as though avenging his uncompleted grunt.] Let's
      have the men in and hear what they've got to say!

      <p>
        [Again ANTHONY nods, and taking up his glass drinks.] [UNDERWOOD comes
        in again, followed by ROBERTS, GREEN, BULGIN, THOMAS, ROUS. They file
        in, hat in hand, and stand silent in a row. ROBERTS is lean, of middle
        height, with a slight stoop. He has a little rat-gnawn, brown-grey
        beard, moustaches, high cheek-bones, hollow cheeks, small fiery eyes. He
        wears an old and grease-stained blue serge suit, and carries an old
        bowler hat. He stands nearest the Chairman. GREEN, next to him, has a
        clean, worn face, with a small grey goatee beard and drooping
        moustaches, iron spectacles, and mild, straightforward eyes. He wears an
        overcoat, green with age, and a linen collar. Next to him is BULGIN, a
        tall, strong man, with a dark moustache, and fighting jaw, wearing a red
        muffler, who keeps changing his cap from one hand to the other. Next to
        him is THOMAS, an old man with a grey moustache, full beard, and
        weatherbeaten, bony face, whose overcoat discloses a lean,
        plucked-looking neck. On his right, ROUS, the youngest of the five,
        looks like a soldier; he has a glitter in his eyes.]

      Roberts; won't you draw them up and sit down?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. Underwood&mdash;we'll stand in the presence of the
      Board. [He speaks in a biting and staccato voice, rolling his r's,
      pronouncing his a's like an Italian a, and his consonants short and
      crisp.] How are you, Mr. Harness? Did n't expect t' have the pleasure of
      seeing you till this afternoon.

    <p>
      HARNESS. [Steadily.] We shall meet again then, Roberts.

    <p>
      ROBERTS. Glad to hear that; we shall have some news for you to take to
      your people.

    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Acidly.] Beg pardon, I don't quite catch the Chairman's remark.

      TENCH. [From behind the Chairman's chair.] The Chairman wishes to know
      what the men have to say.

      ROBERTS. It's what the Board has to say we've come to hear. It's for the
      Board to speak first.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. The Board has nothing to say.
    </p>

      Directors' time. We'll be taking our feet off this pretty carpet.

      conference, the Board wish to hear what they have to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Gad! If I was to begin to tell ye all they have to say, I
      wouldn't be finished to-day. And there'd be some that'd wish they'd never
      left their London palaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. What's your proposition, man? Be reasonable.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. You want reason Mr. Harness? Take a look round this afternoon
      before the meeting. [He looks at the men; no sound escapes them.] You'll
      see some very pretty scenery.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. All right my friend; you won't put me off.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [To the men.] We shan't put Mr. Harness off. Have some champagne
      with your lunch, Mr. Harness; you'll want it, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. Come, get to business, man!
    </p>
    <p>
      THOMAS. What we're asking, look you, is just simple justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Venomously.] Justice from London? What are you talking about,
      Henry Thomas? Have you gone silly? [THOMAS is silent.] We know very well
      what we are&mdash;discontented dogs&mdash;never satisfied. What did the
      Chairman tell me up in London? That I did n't know what I was talking
      about. I was a foolish, uneducated man, that knew nothing of the wants of
      the men I spoke for.

    <p>
      ROUS. [Suddenly.] Speak out, Roberts, or leave it to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Ironically.] Thank you, George Rous. [Addressing himself to
      ANTHONY.] The Chairman and Board of Directors have honoured us by leaving
      London and coming all this way to hear what we've got to say; it would not
      be polite to keep them any longer waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. Well, thank God for that!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Ye will not dare to thank Him when I have done, Mr. Wilder, for
      all your piety. May be your God up in London has no time to listen to the
      working man. I'm told He is a wealthy God; but if he listens to what I
      tell Him, He will know more than ever He learned in Kensington.
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. Come, Roberts, you have your own God. Respect the God of other
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. That's right, sir. We have another God down here; I doubt He is
      rather different to Mr. Wilder's. Ask Henry Thomas; he will tell you
      whether his God and Mr. Wilder's are the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      WANKLIN. For goodness' sake, let 's keep to the point, Roberts.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. I rather think it is the point, Mr. Wanklin. If you can get the
      God of Capital to walk through the streets of Labour, and pay attention to
      what he sees, you're a brighter man than I take you for, for all that
      you're a Radical.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Attend to me, Roberts! [Roberts is silent.] You are here to speak
      for the men, as I am here to speak for the Board.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He looks slowly round.] [WILDER, WANKLIN, and SCANTLEBURY make
        movements of uneasiness, and EDGAR gazes at the floor. A faint smile
        comes on HARNESS'S face.]

    <p>
      Now then, what is it?

      ROBERTS. Right, Sir!

      <p>
        [Throughout all that follows, he and ANTHONY look fixedly upon each
        other. Men and Directors show in their various ways suppressed

        have spoken.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The men can't afford to travel up to London; and they don't trust you to
      believe what they say in black and white. They know what the post is [he
      darts a look at UNDERWOOD and TENCH], and what Directors' meetings are:
      "Refer it to the manager&mdash;let the manager advise us on the men's
      condition. Can we squeeze them a little more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      UNDERWOOD. [In a low voice.] Don't hit below the belt, Roberts!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Is it below the belt, Mr. Underwood? The men know. When I came up
      to London, I told you the position straight. An' what came of it? I was
      told I did n't know what I was talkin' about. I can't afford to travel up
      to London to be told that again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. What have you to say for the men?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. I have this to say&mdash;and first as to their condition. Ye
      shall 'ave no need to go and ask your manager. Ye can't squeeze them any
      more. Every man of us is well-nigh starving. [A surprised murmur rises
      from the men. ROBERTS looks round.] Ye wonder why I tell ye that? Every
      man of us is going short. We can't be no worse off than we've been these
      weeks past. Ye need n't think that by waiting yell drive us to come in.
      We'll die first, the whole lot of us. The men have sent for ye to know,
      once and for all, whether ye are going to grant them their demands. I see
      the sheet of paper in the Secretary's hand. [TENCH moves nervously.]
      That's it, I think, Mr. Tench. It's not very large.
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. [Nodding.] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. There's not one sentence of writing on that paper that we can do
      without.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [A movement amongst the men. ROBERTS turns on them sharply.]

    <p>
      Isn't that so?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The men assent reluctantly. ANTHONY takes from TENCH the paper and
        peruses it.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Not one single sentence. All those demands are fair. We have not. asked
      anything that we are not entitled to ask. What I said up in London, I say
      again now: there is not anything on that piece of paper that a just man
      should not ask, and a just man give.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [A pause.]
      </p>

    <p>
      ANTHONY. There is not one single demand on this paper that we will grant.

    <blockquote>

      ANTHONY. I do.

        [WILDER at the fire makes an emphatic movement of disgust.]
      </p>

    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Noting it, with dry intensity.] Ye best know whether the
      condition of the Company is any better than the condition of the men.
      [Scanning the Directors' faces.] Ye best know whether ye can afford your
      tyranny&mdash;but this I tell ye: If ye think the men will give way the
      least part of an inch, ye're making the worst mistake ye ever made. [He
      fixes his eyes on SCANTLEBURY.] Ye think because the Union is not
      supporting us&mdash;more shame to it!&mdash;that we'll be coming on our
      knees to you one fine morning. Ye think because the men have got their
      wives an' families to think of&mdash;that it's just a question of a week
      or two&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. It would be better if you did not speculate so much on what we
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Aye! It's not much profit to us! I will say this for you, Mr.
      Anthony&mdash;ye know your own mind! [Staying at ANTHONY.] I can reckon on
      ye!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. [Ironically.] I am obliged to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. And I know mine. I tell ye this: The men will send their wives
      and families where the country will have to keep them; an' they will
      starve sooner than give way. I advise ye, Mr. Anthony, to prepare yourself
      for the worst that can happen to your Company. We are not so ignorant as
      you might suppose. We know the way the cat is jumping. Your position is
      not all that it might be&mdash;not exactly!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Be good enough to allow us to judge of our position for
      ourselves. Go back, and reconsider your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Stepping forward.] Mr. Anthony, you are not a young man now;
      from the time I remember anything ye have been an enemy to every man that
      has come into your works. I don't say that ye're a mean man, or a cruel
      man, but ye've grudged them the say of any word in their own fate. Ye've
      fought them down four times. I've heard ye say ye love a fight&mdash;mark
      my words&mdash;ye're fighting the last fight ye'll ever fight!
    </p>

      ROBERTS. Roberts! Roberts! I must n't speak my mind to the Chairman, but
      the Chairman may speak his mind to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      WILDER. What are things coming to?
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY, [With a grim smile at WILDER.] Go on, Roberts; say what you like!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [After a pause.] I have no more to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. The meeting stands adjourned to five o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      WANKLIN. [In a low voice to UNDERWOOD.] We shall never settle anything
      like this.

      their gracious hearing.

      HARNESS. [Ironically.] I congratulate you on the conciliatory spirit

      slowly, looking back.]

    <p>
      ANTHONY. I don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. It's such a horrid position for us. If you were the wife of the
      manager, and lived down here, and saw it all. You can't realise, Dad!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. We see all the distress. You remember my maid Annie, who married
      Roberts? [ANTHONY nods.] It's so wretched, her heart's weak; since the
      strike began, she has n't even been getting proper food. I know it for a
      fact, Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Give her what she wants, poor woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Roberts won't let her take anything from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. [Staring before him.] I can't be answerable for the men's
      obstinacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. They're all suffering. Father! Do stop it, for my sake!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. [With a keen look at her.] You don't understand, my dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. If I were on the Board, I'd do something.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. What would you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. It's because you can't bear to give way. It's so&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. So unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. What do you know about necessity? Read your novels, play your
      music, talk your talk, but don't try and tell me what's at the bottom of a
      struggle like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. I live down here, and see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. What d' you imagine stands between you and your class and these
      men that you're so sorry for?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Coldly.] I don't know what you mean, Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. In a few years you and your children would be down in the
      condition they're in, but for those who have the eyes to see things as
      they are and the backbone to stand up for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. You don't know the state the men are in.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. I know it well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. You don't, Father; if you did, you would n't
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. It's you who don't know the simple facts of the position. What
      sort of mercy do you suppose you'd get if no one stood between you and the
      continual demands of labour? This sort of mercy&mdash; [He puts his hand
      up to his throat and squeezes it.] First would go your sentiments, my
      dear; then your culture, and your comforts would be going all the time!
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. I don't believe in barriers between classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. You&mdash;don't&mdash;believe&mdash;in&mdash;barriers&mdash;between
      the classes?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Coldly.] And I don't know what that has to do with this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. It will take a generation or two for you to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. It's only you and Roberts, Father, and you know it!

      ANTHONY. Allow me to judge of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Resentfully.] I won't stand by and let poor Annie Roberts suffer
      like this! And think of the children, Father! I warn you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. [With a grim smile.] What do you propose to do?

      oughtn't to have this strain on you&mdash;you know what Dr. Fisher said!
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. No old man can afford to listen to old women.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. But you have done enough, even if it really is such a matter of
      principle with you.

    <p>
      ANTHONY. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. I'm obliged to see everything that's going on, sir; I&mdash;I
      depend upon the Company entirely. If anything were to happen to it, it'd
      be disastrous for me. [ANTHONY nods.] And, of course, my wife's just had
      another; and so it makes me doubly anxious just now. And the rates are
      really terrible down our way.

    <p>
      ANTHONY. [With grim amusement.] Not more terrible than they are up mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. No, Sir? [Very nervously.] I know the Company means a great deal to
      you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. It does; I founded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. Yes, Sir. If the strike goes on it'll be very serious. I think the
      Directors are beginning to realise that, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. [Ironically.] Indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. I know you hold very strong views, sir, and it's always your habit
      to look things in the face; but I don't think the Directors&mdash; like
      it, sir, now they&mdash;they see it.

    <p>
      ANTHONY. [Grimly.] Nor you, it seems.

      ACT II

    <h3>
      SCENE I
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is half-past three. In the kitchen of Roberts's cottage a meagre
        little fire is burning. The room is clean and tidy, very barely
        furnished, with a brick floor and white-washed walls, much stained with
        smoke. There is a kettle on the fire. A door opposite the fireplace
        opens inward from a snowy street. On the wooden table are a cup and
        saucer, a teapot, knife, and plate of bread and cheese. Close to the
        fireplace in an old arm-chair, wrapped in a rug, sits MRS. ROBERTS, a
        thin and dark-haired woman about thirty-five, with patient eyes. Her
        hair is not done up, but tied back with a piece of ribbon. By the fire,
        too, is MRS. YEO; a red-haired, broad-faced person. Sitting near the
        table is MRS. ROUS, an old lady, ashen-white, with silver hair; by the
        door, standing, as if about to go, is MRS. BULGIN, a little pale,
        pinched-up woman. In a chair, with her elbows resting on the table, avid
        her face resting in her hands, sits MADGE THOMAS, a good-looking girl,
        of twenty-two, with high cheekbones, deep-set eyes, and dark untidy
        hair. She is listening to the talk, but she neither speaks nor moves.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. YEO. So he give me a sixpence, and that's the first bit o' money I
      seen this week. There an't much 'eat to this fire. Come and warm yerself
      Mrs. Rous, you're lookin' as white as the snow, you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROUS. [Shivering&mdash;placidly.] Ah! but the winter my old man was
      took was the proper winter. Seventy-nine that was, when none of you was
      hardly born&mdash;not Madge Thomas, nor Sue Bulgin. [Looking at them in
      turn.] Annie Roberts, 'ow old were you, dear?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS ROBERTS. Seven, Mrs. Rous.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROUS. Seven&mdash;well, there! A tiny little thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. YEO. [Aggressively.] Well, I was ten myself, I remembers it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. Rous. [Placidly.] The Company hadn't been started three years. Father
      was workin' on the acid, that's 'ow he got 'is pisoned-leg. I kep' sayin'
      to 'im, "Father, you've got a pisoned leg." "Well," 'e said, "Mother,
      pison or no pison, I can't afford to go a-layin' up." An' two days after,
      he was on 'is back, and never got up again. It was Providence! There was
      n't none o' these Compensation Acts then.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. YEO. Ye had n't no strike that winter! [With grim humour.] This
      winter's 'ard enough for me. Mrs. Roberts, you don't want no 'arder
      winter, do you? Wouldn't seem natural to 'ave a dinner, would it, Mrs.
      Bulgin?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BULGIN. We've had bread and tea last four days.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. YEO. You got that Friday's laundry job?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BULGIN. [Dispiritedly.] They said they'd give it me, but when I went
      last Friday, they were full up. I got to go again next week.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. YEO. Ah! There's too many after that. I send Yeo out on the ice to
      put on the gentry's skates an' pick up what 'e can. Stops 'im from
      broodin' about the 'ouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BULGIN. [In a desolate, matter-of-fact voice.] Leavin' out the men&mdash;it's
      bad enough with the children. I keep 'em in bed, they don't get so hungry
      when they're not running about; but they're that restless in bed they
      worry your life out.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. YEO. You're lucky they're all so small. It 's the goin' to school
      that makes 'em 'ungry. Don't Bulgin give you anythin'?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. BULGIN. [Shakes her head, then, as though by afterthought.] Would if
      he could, I s'pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. YEO. [Sardonically.] What! 'Ave n't 'e got no shares in the Company?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROUS. [Rising with tremulous cheerfulness.] Well, good-bye, Annie
      Roberts, I'm going along home.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. Stay an' have a cup of tea, Mrs. Rous?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROUS. [With the faintest smile.] Roberts 'll want 'is tea when he
      comes in. I'll just go an' get to bed; it's warmer there than anywhere.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She moves very shakily towards the door.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MRS. YEO. [Rising and giving her an arm.] Come on, Mother, take my arm;
      we're all going' the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROUS. [Taking the arm.]Thank you, my dearies!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [THEY go out, followed by MRS. BULGIN.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MADGE. [Moving for the first time.] There, Annie, you see that! I told
      George Rous, "Don't think to have my company till you've made an end of
      all this trouble. You ought to be ashamed," I said, "with your own mother
      looking like a ghost, and not a stick to put on the fire. So long as
      you're able to fill your pipes, you'll let us starve." "I 'll take my
      oath, Madge," he said, "I 've not had smoke nor drink these three weeks!"
      "Well, then, why do you go on with it?" "I can't go back on Roberts!" . .
      . That's it! Roberts, always Roberts! They'd all drop it but for him. When
      he talks it's the devil that comes into them.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [A silence. MRS. ROBERTS makes a movement of pain.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Ah! You don't want him beaten! He's your man. With everybody like their
      own shadows! [She makes a gesture towards MRS. ROBERTS.] If ROUS wants me
      he must give up Roberts. If he gave him up&mdash;they all would. They're
      only waiting for a lead. Father's against him&mdash; they're all against
      him in their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. You won't beat Roberts!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [They look silently at each other.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MADGE. Won't I? The cowards&mdash;when their own mothers and their own
      children don't know where to turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. Madge!
    </p>
    <p>
      MADGE. [Looking searchingly at MRS. ROBERTS.] I wonder he can look you in
      the face. [She squats before the fire, with her hands out to the flame.]
      Harness is here again. They'll have to make up their minds to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [In a soft, slow voice, with a slight West-country burr.]
      Roberts will never give up the furnace-men and engineers. 'T wouldn't be
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      MADGE. You can't deceive me. It's just his pride.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        wears a round fur cap, and a jacket of squirrel's fur. She closes the
        door behind her.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ENID. Can I come in, Annie?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [Flinching.] Miss Enid! Give Mrs. Underwood a chair, Madge!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MADGE gives ENID the chair she has been sitting on.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ENID. Thank you!
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Are you any better?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. Yes, M'm; thank you, M'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Looking at the sullen MADGE as though requesting her departure.]
      Why did you send back the jelly? I call that really wicked of you!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. Thank you, M'm, I'd no need for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Of course! It was Roberts's doing, wasn't it? How can he let all
      this suffering go on amongst you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MADGE. [Suddenly.] What suffering?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Surprised.] I beg your pardon!
    </p>
    <p>
      MADGE. Who said there was suffering?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. Madge!
    </p>
    <p>
      MADGE. [Throwing her shawl over her head.] Please to let us keep ourselves
      to ourselves. We don't want you coming here and spying on us.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Confronting her, but without rising.] I did n't speak to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MADGE. [In a low, fierce voice.] Keep your kind feelings to yourself. You
      think you can come amongst us, but you're mistaken. Go back and tell the
      Manager that.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Stonily.] This is not your house.
    </p>
    <p>
      MADGE. [Turning to the door.] No, it is not my house; keep clear of my
      house, Mrs. Underwood.

    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. Please to forgive Madge Thomas, M'm; she's a bit upset
      to-day.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [A pause.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ENID. [Looking at her.] Oh, I think they're so stupid, all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [With a faint smile]. Yes, M'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Is Roberts out?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. Yes, M'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. It is his doing, that they don't come to an agreement. Now is n't
      it, Annie?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [Softly, with her eyes on ENID, and moving the fingers of
      one hand continually on her breast.] They do say that your father, M'm&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. My father's getting an old man, and you know what old men are.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. I am sorry, M'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [More softly.] I don't expect you to feel sorry, Annie. I know it's
      his fault as well as Roberts's.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. I'm sorry for any one that gets old, M'm; it 's dreadful to
      get old, and Mr. Anthony was such a fine old man, I always used to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Impulsively.] He always liked you, don't you remember? Look here,
      Annie, what can I do? I do so want to know. You don't get what you ought
      to have. [Going to the fire, she takes the kettle off, and looks for
      coals.] And you're so naughty sending back the soup and things.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [With a faint smile.] Yes, M'm?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Resentfully.] Why, you have n't even got coals?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. If you please, M'm, to put the kettle on again; Roberts
      won't have long for his tea when he comes in. He's got to meet the men at
      four.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Putting the kettle on.] That means he'll lash them into a fury
      again. Can't you stop his going, Annie?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MRS. ROBERTS smiles ironically.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Have you tried?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [A silence.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Does he know how ill you are?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. It's only my weak 'eard, M'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. You used to be so well when you were with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [Stiffening.] Roberts is always good to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. But you ought to have everything you want, and you have nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [Appealingly.] They tell me I don't look like a dyin' woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Of course you don't; if you could only have proper&mdash;- Will you
      see my doctor if I send him to you? I'm sure he'd do you good.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [With faint questioning.] Yes, M'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Madge Thomas ought n't to come here; she only excites you. As if I
      did n't know what suffering there is amongst the men! I do feel for them
      dreadfully, but you know they have gone too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [Continually moving her fingers.] They say there's no other
      way to get better wages, M'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Earnestly.] But, Annie, that's why the Union won't help them. My
      husband's very sympathetic with the men, but he says they are not
      underpaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. No, M'm?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. They never think how the Company could go on if we paid the wages
      they want.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [With an effort.] But the dividends having been so big, M'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Takes aback.] You all seem to think the shareholders are rich men,
      but they're not&mdash;most of them are really no better off than working
      men.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MRS. ROBERTS smiles.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      They have to keep up appearances.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. Yes, M'm?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. You don't have to pay rates and taxes, and a hundred other things
      that they do. If the men did n't spend such a lot in drink and betting
      they'd be quite well off!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. They say, workin' so hard, they must have some pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. But surely not low pleasure like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [A little resentfully.] Roberts never touches a drop; and
      he's never had a bet in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Oh! but he's not a com&mdash;&mdash;I mean he's an engineer&mdash;&mdash;
      a superior man.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. Yes, M'm. Roberts says they've no chance of other pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Musing.] Of course, I know it's hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [With a spice of malice.] And they say gentlefolk's just as
      bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [With a smile.] I go as far as most people, Annie, but you know,
      yourself, that's nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [With painful effort.] A lot 'o the men never go near the
      Public; but even they don't save but very little, and that goes if there's
      illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. But they've got their clubs, have n't they?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. The clubs only give up to eighteen shillin's a week, M'm,
      and it's not much amongst a family. Roberts says workin' folk have always
      lived from hand to mouth. Sixpence to-day is worth more than a shillin'
      to-morrow, that's what they say.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. But that's the spirit of gambling.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [With a sort of excitement.] Roberts says a working man's
      life is all a gamble, from the time 'e 's born to the time 'e dies.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ENID leans forward, interested. MRS. ROBERTS goes on with a growing
        excitement that culminates in the personal feeling of the last words.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      He says, M'm, that when a working man's baby is born, it's a toss-up from
      breath to breath whether it ever draws another, and so on all 'is life;
      an' when he comes to be old, it's the workhouse or the grave. He says that
      without a man is very near, and pinches and stints 'imself and 'is
      children to save, there can't be neither surplus nor security. That's why
      he wouldn't have no children [she sinks back], not though I wanted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Yes, yes, I know!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. No you don't, M'm. You've got your children, and you'll
      never need to trouble for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Gently.] You oughtn't to be talking so much, Annie. [Then, in spite
      of herself.] But Roberts was paid a lot of money, was n't he, for
      discovering that process?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. [On the defensive.] All Roberts's savin's have gone. He 's
      always looked forward to this strike. He says he's no right to a farthing
      when the others are suffering. 'T is n't so with all o' them! Some don't
      seem to care no more than that&mdash;so long as they get their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. I don't see how they can be expected to when they 're suffering like
      this. [In a changed voice.] But Roberts ought to think of you! It's all
      terrible&mdash;&mdash;! The kettle's boiling. Shall I make the tea? [She
      takes the teapot and, seeing tea there, pours water into it.] Won't you
      have a cup?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. No, thank you, M'm. [She is listening, as though for
      footsteps.] I'd&mdash;sooner you did n't see Roberts, M'm, he gets so
      wild.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Oh! but I must, Annie; I'll be quite calm, I promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. It's life an' death to him, M'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Very gently.] I'll get him to talk to me outside, we won't excite
      you.

      MRS. ROBERTS. [Faintly.] No, M'm.

      give way a little, if it's only for your own sakes!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Speaking to himself.] The daughter of Mr. Anthony begs me to
      give way a little, if it's only for our own sakes!
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. For everybody's sake; for your wife's sake.

    <p>
      ROBERTS. For my wife's sake, for everybody's sake&mdash;for the sake of
      Mr. Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Why are you so bitter against my father? He has never done anything
      to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Has he not?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. He can't help his views, any more than you can help yours.

    <p>
      ROBERTS. I really did n't know that I had a right to views!

      and I could save him by lifting my hand, I would not lift the little
      finger of it.

    <p>
      ENID. You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;[She stops again, biting her lips.]
    </p>

      ROBERTS. I would not, and that's flat!

      ENID. [Coldly.] You don't mean what you say, and you know it!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. I mean every word of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. But why?
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [With a flash.] Mr. Anthony stands for tyranny! That's why!

    <p>
      ENID. [Recoiling with a sort of horror.] I believe&mdash;you are mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. The house of a madman then is not the fit place for a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. I 'm not afraid of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Bowing.] I would not expect the daughter of Mr. Anthony to be
      afraid. Mr. Anthony is not a coward like the rest of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Suddenly.] I suppose you think it brave, then, to go on with the
      struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Does Mr. Anthony think it brave to fight against women and
      children? Mr. Anthony is a rich man, I believe; does he think it brave to
      fight against those who have n't a penny? Does he think it brave to set
      children crying with hunger, an' women shivering with cold?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Putting up her hand, as though warding off a blow.] My father is
      acting on his principles, and you know it!

      ROBERTS. And so am I!
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. You hate us; and you can't bear to be beaten!

      sharks are out o' the town: [He walks up and down.] I shall have a bother
      with the men&mdash;there's no heart in them, the cowards. Blind as bats,
      they are&mdash;can't see a day before their noses.

    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. It's the women, David.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Ah! So they say! They can remember the women when their own
      bellies speak! The women never stop them from the drink; but from a little
      suffering to themselves in a sacred cause, the women stop them fast
      enough.

      MRS. ROBERTS. But think o' the children, David.

    <p>
      ROBERTS. There, there! Come, come! That's right! [Bitterly.] Not one penny
      will they put by for a day like this. Not they! Hand to mouth&mdash;Gad!&mdash;I
      know them! They've broke my heart. There was no holdin' them at the start,
      but now the pinch 'as come.

    <p>
      MRS. ROBERTS. How can you expect it, David? They're not made of iron.

      ROBERTS. Expect it? Wouldn't I expect what I would do meself? Wouldn't I
      starve an' rot rather than give in? What one man can do, another can.

        changed to horrified surprise. She makes a sudden movement, sitting
        forward, pressing her hands against her breast. Then slowly she sinks'
        back; slowly her face loses the look of pain, the smile returns. She
        fixes her eyes again on JAN, and moves her lips and finger to the tune.]

      SCENE II
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is past four. In a grey, failing light, an open muddy space is
        crowded with workmen. Beyond, divided from it by a barbed-wire fence, is
        the raised towing-path of a canal, on which is moored a barge. In the
        distance are marshes and snow-covered hills. The "Works" high wall runs
        from the canal across the open space, and ivy the angle of this wall is
        a rude platform of barrels and boards. On it, HARNESS is standing.
        ROBERTS, a little apart from the crowd, leans his back against the wall.
        On the raised towing-path two bargemen lounge and smoke indifferently.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Holding out his hand.] Well, I've spoken to you straight. If I
      speak till to-morrow I can't say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAGO. [A dark, sallow, Spanish-looking man with a short, thin beard.]
      Mister, want to ask you! Can they get blacklegs?

    <p>
      BULGIN. [Menacing.] Let 'em try.

      BROWN. [A round-faced man.] Where could they get 'em then?
    </p>
    <p>
      EVANS. [A small, restless, harassed man, with a fighting face.] There's
      always blacklegs; it's the nature of 'em. There's always men that'll save
      their own skins.

        crowd, takes his stand in front.]

    <p>
      HARNESS. [Holding up his hand.] They can't get them. But that won't help
      you. Now men, be reasonable. Your demands would have brought on us the
      burden of a dozen strikes at a time when we were not prepared for them.
      The Unions live by justice, not to one, but all. Any fair man will tell
      you&mdash;you were ill-advised! I don't say you go too far for that which
      you're entitled to, but you're going too far for the moment; you've dug a
      pit for yourselves. Are you to stay there, or are you to climb out? Come!

    <p>
      HARNESS. Cut your demands to the right pattern, and we 'll see you

      again. I 'm not the sort that speaks at random, as you ought to know by
      this time. If you're the sound men I take you for&mdash;no matter who
      advises you against it&mdash;[he fixes his eyes on ROBERTS] you 'll make
      up your minds to come in, and trust to us to get your terms. Which is it
      to be? Hands together, and victory&mdash;or&mdash;the starvation you've
      got now?

    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Lifting his voice above the murmur.] Know? [With cold passion.]
      All that you've been through, my friend, I 've been through&mdash;I was
      through it when I was no bigger than [pointing to a youth] that shaver
      there; the Unions then were n't what they are now. What's made them
      strong? It's hands together that 's made them strong. I 've been through
      it all, I tell you, the brand's on my soul yet. I know what you 've
      suffered&mdash;there's nothing you can tell me that I don't know; but the
      whole is greater than the part, and you are only the part. Stand by us,
      and we will stand by you.

      much as the furnace men in similar works elsewhere.

      Nature iss a fery pig thing; it is pigger than what a man is. There iss
      more years to my hett than to the hett of any one here. It is fery pat,

      him, and what had he to say? "None can pretend," he said, "that I'm not a
      believer in principle&mdash;[with biting irony]&mdash;but when Nature
      says: 'No further, 't es going agenst Nature.'" I tell you if a man cannot
      say to Nature: "Budge me from this if ye can!"&mdash; [with a sort of
      exaltation] his principles are but his belly. "Oh, but," Thomas says, "a
      man can be pure and honest, just and merciful, and take off his hat to
      Nature!" I tell you Nature's neither pure nor honest, just nor merciful.
      You chaps that live over the hill, an' go home dead beat in the dark on a
      snowy night&mdash;don't ye fight your way every inch of it? Do ye go lyin'
      down an' trustin' to the tender mercies of this merciful Nature? Try it
      and you'll soon know with what ye've got to deal. 'T es only by that&mdash;[he
      strikes a blow with his clenched fist]&mdash;in Nature's face that a man
      can be a man. "Give in," says Thomas, "go down on your knees; throw up
      your foolish fight, an' perhaps," he said, "perhaps your enemy will chuck
      you down a crust."

    <p>
      JAGO. Never!

    <p>
      EVANS. Curse them!
    </p>
    <p>
      THOMAS. I nefer said that.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Bitingly.] If ye did not say it, man, ye meant it. An' what did
      ye say about Chapel? "Chapel's against it," ye said. "She 's against it!"
      Well, if Chapel and Nature go hand in hand, it's the first I've ever heard
      of it. That young man there&mdash; [pointing to ROUS]&mdash;said I 'ad
      'ell fire on my tongue. If I had I would use it all to scorch and wither
      this talking of surrender. Surrendering 's the work of cowards and
      traitors.

      HENRY ROUS. [As GEORGE ROUS moves forward.] Go for him, George&mdash;
      don't stand his lip!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Flinging out his finger.] Stop there, George Rous, it's no time
      this to settle personal matters. [ROUS stops.] But there was one other
      spoke to you&mdash;Mr. Simon Harness. We have not much to thank Mr.
      Harness and the Union for. They said to us "Desert your mates, or we'll
      desert you." An' they did desert us.
    </p>
    <p>
      EVANS. They did.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Mr. Simon Harness is a clever man, but he has come too late.
      [With intense conviction.] For all that Mr. Simon Harness says, for all
      that Thomas, Rous, for all that any man present here can say&mdash;We've
      won the fight!

    <p>
      [With withering scorn.] You've felt the pinch o't in your bellies. You've
      forgotten what that fight 'as been; many times I have told you; I will
      tell you now this once again. The fight o' the country's body and blood
      against a blood-sucker. The fight of those that spend themselves with
      every blow they strike and every breath they draw, against a thing that
      fattens on them, and grows and grows by the law of merciful Nature. That
      thing is Capital! A thing that buys the sweat o' men's brows, and the
      tortures o' their brains, at its own price. Don't I know that? Wasn't the
      work o' my brains bought for seven hundred pounds, and has n't one hundred
      thousand pounds been gained them by that seven hundred without the
      stirring of a finger. It is a thing that will take as much and give you as
      little as it can. That's Capital! A thing that will say&mdash;"I'm very
      sorry for you, poor fellows&mdash;you have a cruel time of it, I know,"
      but will not give one sixpence of its dividends to help you have a better
      time. That's Capital! Tell me, for all their talk, is there one of them
      that will consent to another penny on the Income Tax to help the poor?
      That's Capital! A white-faced, stony-hearted monster! Ye have got it on
      its knees; are ye to give up at the last minute to save your miserable
      bodies pain? When I went this morning to those old men from London, I
      looked into their very 'earts. One of them was sitting there&mdash;Mr.
      Scantlebury, a mass of flesh nourished on us: sittin' there for all the
      world like the shareholders in this Company, that sit not moving tongue
      nor finger, takin' dividends a great dumb ox that can only be roused when
      its food is threatened. I looked into his eyes and I saw he was afraid&mdash;afraid
      for himself and his dividends; afraid for his fees, afraid of the very
      shareholders he stands for; and all but one of them's afraid&mdash;like
      children that get into a wood at night, and start at every rustle of the
      leaves. I ask you, men&mdash;[he pauses, holding out his hand till there
      is utter silence]&mdash;give me a free hand to tell them: "Go you back to
      London. The men have nothing for you!" [A murmuring.] Give me that, an' I
      swear to you, within a week you shall have from London all you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      EVANS, JAGO, and OTHERS. A free hand! Give him a free hand! Bravo &mdash;bravo!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. 'T is not for this little moment of time we're fighting [the
      murmuring dies], not for ourselves, our own little bodies, and their
      wants, 't is for all those that come after throughout all time. [With
      intense sadness.] Oh! men&mdash;for the love o' them, don't roll up
      another stone upon their heads, don't help to blacken the sky, an' let the
      bitter sea in over them. They're welcome to the worst that can happen to
      me, to the worst that can happen to us all, are n't they&mdash;are n't
      they? If we can shake [passionately] that white-faced monster with the
      bloody lips, that has sucked the life out of ourselves, our wives, and
      children, since the world began. [Dropping the note of passion but with
      the utmost weight and intensity.] If we have not the hearts of men to
      stand against it breast to breast, and eye to eye, and force it backward
      till it cry for mercy, it will go on sucking life; and we shall stay
      forever what we are [in almost a whisper], less than the very dogs.

      ACT III
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        It is five o'clock. In the UNDERWOODS' drawing-room, which is
        artistically furnished, ENID is sitting on the sofa working at a baby's
        frock. EDGAR, by a little spindle-legged table in the centre of the
        room, is fingering a china-box. His eyes are fixed on the double-doors
        that lead into the dining-room.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Putting down the china-box, and glancing at his watch.] Just on
      five, they're all in there waiting, except Frank. Where's he?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. He's had to go down to Gasgoyne's about a contract. Will you want
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. He can't help us. This is a director's job. [Motioning towards a
      single door half hidden by a curtain.] Father in his room?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. I wish he'd stay there, Enid.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ENID looks up at him. This is a beastly business, old girl?] [He takes
        up the little box again and turns it over and over.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ENID. I went to the Roberts's this afternoon, Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. That was n't very wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. He's simply killing his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. We are you mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Suddenly.] Roberts ought to give way!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. There's a lot to be said on the men's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. I don't feel half so sympathetic with them as I did before I went.
      They just set up class feeling against you. Poor Annie was looking dread
      fully bad&mdash;fire going out, and nothing fit for her to eat.
    </p>

      <p>
        [EDGAR walks to and fro.]

    <p>
      But she would stand up for Roberts. When you see all this wretchedness
      going on and feel you can do nothing, you have to shut your eyes to the
      whole thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. If you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. When I went I was all on their side, but as soon as I got there I
      began to feel quite different at once. People talk about sympathy with the
      working classes, they don't know what it means to try and put it into
      practice. It seems hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. Ah! well.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. It's dreadful going on with the men in this state. I do hope the Dad
      will make concessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. He won't. [Gloomily.] It's a sort of religion with him. Curse it! I
      know what's coming! He'll be voted down.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. They would n't dare!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. They will&mdash;they're in a funk.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Indignantly.] He'd never stand it!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [With a shrug.] My dear girl, if you're beaten in a vote, you've
      got to stand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Oh! [She gets up in alarm.] But would he resign?
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. Of course! It goes to the roots of his beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. But he's so wrapped up in this company, Ted! There'd be nothing left
      for him! It'd be dreadful!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [EDGAR shrugs his shoulders.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Oh, Ted, he's so old now! You must n't let them!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Hiding his feelings in an outburst.] My sympathies in this strike
      are all on the side of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. He's been Chairman for more than thirty years! He made the whole
      thing! And think of the bad times they've had; it's always been he who
      pulled them through. Oh, Ted, you must!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. What is it you want? You said just now you hoped he'd make
      concessions. Now you want me to back him in not making them. This is n't a
      game, Enid!
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Hotly.] It is n't a game to me that the Dad's in danger of losing
      all he cares about in life. If he won't give way, and he's beaten, it'll
      simply break him down!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. Did n't you say it was dreadful going on with the men in this
      state?
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. But can't you see, Ted, Father'll never get over it! You must stop
      them somehow. The others are afraid of him. If you back him up&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Putting his hand to his head.] Against my convictions&mdash;
      against yours! The moment it begins to pinch one personally&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. It is n't personal, it's the Dad!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. Your family or yourself, and over goes the show!
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Resentfully.] If you don't take it seriously, I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. I am as fond of him as you are; that's nothing to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. We can't tell about the men; it's all guess-work. But we know the
      Dad might have a stroke any day. D' you mean to say that he isn't more to
      you than&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. Of course he is.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. I don't understand you then.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. H'm!
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. If it were for oneself it would be different, but for our own
      Father! You don't seem to realise.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. I realise perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. It's your first duty to save him.
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. I wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Imploring.] Oh, Ted? It's the only interest he's got left; it'll be
      like a death-blow to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      EDGAR. [Restraining his emotion.] I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Promise!

      FROST. I could put them in the pantry, M'm.

      day.

    <p>
      ENID. I know Frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROST. Nothin' but two whiskies and sodas, M'm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. Oh! you oughtn't to have let him have those.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROST. [Gravely.] Mr. Anthony is a little difficult, M'm. It's not as if
      he were a younger man, an' knew what was good for 'im; he will have his
      own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. I suppose we all want that.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROST. Yes, M'm. [Quietly.] Excuse me speakin' about the strike. I'm sure
      if the other gentlemen were to give up to Mr. Anthony, and quietly let the
      men 'ave what they want, afterwards, that'd be the best way. I find that
      very useful with him at times, M'm.

    <p>
      [With feeling.] Bein' with Mr. Anthony, as you know, M'm, ever since I was
      fifteen, it worries me to see him crossed like this at his age. I've taken
      the liberty to speak to Mr. Wanklin [dropping his voice]&mdash; seems to
      be the most sensible of the gentlemen&mdash;but 'e said to me: "That's all
      very well, Frost, but this strike's a very serious thing," 'e said.
      "Serious for all parties, no doubt," I said, "but yumour 'im, sir," I
      said, "yumour 'im. It's like this, if a man comes to a stone wall, 'e does
      n't drive 'is 'ead against it, 'e gets over it." "Yes," 'e said, "you'd
      better tell your master that." [FROST looks at his nails.] That's where it
      is, M'm. I said to Mr. Anthony this morning: "Is it worth it, sir?" "Damn
      it," he said to me, "Frost! Mind your own business, or take a month's
      notice!" Beg pardon, M'm, for using such a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Moving to the double-doors, and listening.] Do you know that man
      Roberts, Frost?
    </p>
    <p>
      FROST. Yes, M'm; that's to say, not to speak to. But to look at 'im you
      can tell what he's like.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Stopping.] Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      FROST. He's not one of these 'ere ordinary 'armless Socialists. 'E's
      violent; got a fire inside 'im. What I call "personal." A man may 'ave
      what opinions 'e likes, so long as 'e 's not personal; when 'e 's that 'e
      's not safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. I think that's what my father feels about Roberts.
    </p>

      FROST. No doubt, M'm, Mr. Anthony has a feeling against him.

    <p>
      It 's, a regular right down struggle between the two. I've no patience
      with this Roberts, from what I 'ear he's just an ordinary workin' man like
      the rest of 'em. If he did invent a thing he's no worse off than 'undreds
      of others. My brother invented a new kind o' dumb-waiter&mdash;nobody gave

      that?

      ENID. [Standing her ground.] Don't talk nonsense!

      as it safely can. If you blame me for want of principle: I say that we're

    <p>
      EDGAR. [Facing him angrily.] No, sir. I tell you exactly what I think. If
      we pretend the men are not suffering, it's humbug; and if they're
      suffering, we know enough of human nature to know the women are suffering
      more, and as to the children&mdash;well&mdash;it's damnable!

      did we let it drift till it came to this? You know perfectly well why&mdash;because
      we hoped we should starve the men out. Well, all we've done is to starve

      have been ended long ago, and this poor woman's life wouldn't have been
      crushed out of her like this. For all we can tell there may be a dozen
      other starving women.

      WANKLIN. Cowardice is an unpleasant word, Mr. Edgar Anthony. It will look
      very like cowardice if we suddenly concede the men's demands when a thing
      like this happens; we must be careful!

    <p>
      WILDER. Of course we must. We've no knowledge of this matter, except a

      Chairman of this Company since its inception two-and-thirty years ago. I

      interests are as wide asunder as the poles. It has been said that the
      Board is only part of a machine. Cant! We are the machine; its brains and
      sinews; it is for us to lead and to determine what is to be done, and to
      do it without fear or favour. Fear of the men! Fear of the shareholders!

      no doubt, would call his social policy. You can't eat cake and have it!
      This middle-class sentiment, or socialism, or whatever it may be, is
      rotten. Masters are masters, men are men! Yield one demand, and they will

      those demands are yielded.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ANTHONY looks at him but does not speak. There is a movement amongst
        the men as though they were bewildered.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HARNESS. Roberts!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Glancing fiercely at him, and back to ANTHONY.] Is that clear
      enough for ye? Is it short enough and to the point? Ye made a mistake to
      think that we would come to heel. Ye may break the body, but ye cannot
      break the spirit. Get back to London, the men have nothing for ye?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Pausing uneasily he takes a step towards the unmoving ANTHONY.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      EDGAR. We're all sorry for you, Roberts, but&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Keep your sorrow, young man. Let your father speak!
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [With the sheet of paper in his hand, speaking from behind the
      little table.] Roberts!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERT. [TO ANTHONY, with passionate intensity.] Why don't ye answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. Roberts!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Turning sharply.] What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Gravely.] You're talking without the book; things have travelled
      past you.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He makes a sign to TENCH, who beckons the Directors. They quickly sign
        his copy of the terms.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Look at this, man! [Holding up his sheet of paper.] "Demands conceded,
      with the exception of those relating to the engineers and furnace-men.
      Double wages for Saturday's overtime. Night-shifts as they are." These
      terms have been agreed. The men go back to work again to-morrow. The
      strike is at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Reading the paper, and turning on the men. They shrink back from
      him, all but ROUS, who stands his ground. With deadly stillness.] Ye have
      gone back on me? I stood by ye to the death; ye waited for that to throw
      me over!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The men answer, all speaking together.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ROUS. It's a lie!
    </p>
    <p>
      THOMAS. Ye were past endurance, man.
    </p>
    <p>
      GREEN. If ye'd listen to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      BULGIN. (Under his breath.) Hold your jaw!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Ye waited for that!
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Taking the Director's copy of the terms, and handing his own to
      TENCH.] That's enough, men. You had better go.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The men shuffle slowly, awkwardly away.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WILDER. [In a low, nervous voice.] There's nothing to stay for now, I
      suppose. [He follows to the door.] I shall have a try for that train!
      Coming, Scantlebury?
    </p>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Following with WANKLIN.] Yes, yes; wait for me. [He stops as
      ROBERTS speaks.]
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [To ANTHONY.] But ye have not signed them terms! They can't make
      terms without their Chairman! Ye would never sign them terms! [ANTHONY
      looks at him without speaking.] Don't tell me ye have! for the love o'
      God! [With passionate appeal.] I reckoned on ye!
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Holding out the Director's copy of the teems.] The Board has
      signed!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ROBERTS looks dully at the signatures&mdash;dashes the paper from him,
        and covers up his eyes.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SCANTLEBURY. [Behind his hand to TENCH.] Look after the Chairman! He's not
      well; he's not well&mdash;he had no lunch. If there's any fund started for
      the women and children, put me down for&mdash;for twenty pounds.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He goes out into the hall, in cumbrous haste; and WANKLIN, who has been
        staring at ROBERTS and ANTHONY With twitchings of his face, follows.
        EDGAR remains seated on the sofa, looking at the ground; TENCH,
        returning to the bureau, writes in his minute&mdash; book. HARNESS
        stands by the little table, gravely watching ROBERTS.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. Then you're no longer Chairman of this Company! [Breaking into
      half-mad laughter.] Ah! ha-ah, ha, ha! They've thrown ye over thrown over
      their Chairman: Ah-ha-ha! [With a sudden dreadful calm.] So&mdash;they've
      done us both down, Mr. Anthony?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ENID, hurrying through the double-doors, comes quickly to her father.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ANTHONY. Both broken men, my friend Roberts!
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [Coming down and laying his hands on ROBERTS'S sleeve.] For
      shame, Roberts! Go home quietly, man; go home!
    </p>
    <p>
      ROBERTS. [Tearing his arm away.] Home? [Shrinking together&mdash;in a
      whisper.] Home!
    </p>
    <p>
      ENID. [Quietly to her father.] Come away, dear! Come to your room
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [ANTHONY rises with an effort. He turns to ROBERTS who looks at him.
        They stand several seconds, gazing at each other fixedly; ANTHONY lifts
        his hand, as though to salute, but lets it fall. The expression of
        ROBERTS'S face changes from hostility to wonder. They bend their heads
        in token of respect. ANTHONY turns, and slowly walks towards the
        curtained door. Suddenly he sways as though about to fall, recovers
        himself, and is assisted out by EDGAR and ENID; UNDERWOOD follows, but
        stops at the door. ROBERTS remains motionless for several seconds,
        staring intently after ANTHONY, then goes out into the hall.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TENCH. [Approaching HARNESS.] It's a great weight off my mind, Mr.
      Harness! But what a painful scene, sir! [He wipes his brow.]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [HARNESS, pale and resolute, regards with a grim half-smile the
        quavering.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      TENCH. It's all been so violent! What did he mean by: "Done us both down?"
      If he has lost his wife, poor fellow, he oughtn't to have spoken to the
      Chairman like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. A woman dead; and the two best men both broken!
    </p>
    <p>
      TENCH. [Staring at him-suddenly excited.] D'you know, sir&mdash;these
      terms, they're the very same we drew up together, you and I, and put to
      both sides before the fight began? All this&mdash;all this&mdash;and&mdash;and
      what for?
    </p>
    <p>
      HARNESS. [In a slow grim voice.] That's where the fun comes in!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [UNDERWOOD without turning from the door makes a gesture of assent.]

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
