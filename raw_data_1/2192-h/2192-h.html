      I
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked along Holywell that afternoon of early June with his short gown
      drooping down his arms, and no cap on his thick dark hair. A youth of
      middle height, and built as if he had come of two very different strains,
      one sturdy, the other wiry and light. His face, too, was a curious blend,
      for, though it was strongly formed, its expression was rather soft and
      moody. His eyes -- dark grey, with a good deal of light in them, and
      very black lashes -- had a way of looking beyond what they saw, so that
      he did not seem always to be quite present; but his smile was exceedingly
      swift, uncovering teeth as white as a negro's, and giving his face a
      peculiar eagerness. People stared at him a little as he passed -- since
      in eighteen hundred and eighty he was before his time in not wearing a
      cap. Women especially were interested; they perceived that he took no
      notice of them, seeming rather to be looking into distance, and making
      combinations in his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he know of what he was thinking -- did he ever know quite
      definitely at that time of his life, when things, especially those beyond
      the immediate horizon, were so curious and interesting? -- the things
      he was going to see and do when he had got through Oxford, where everybody
      was 'awfully decent' to him and 'all right' of course, but not so very
      interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on his way to his tutor's to read an essay on Oliver Cromwell; and
      under the old wall, which had once hedged in the town, he took out of his
      pocket a beast. It was a small tortoise, and, with an extreme absorption,
      he watched it move its little inquiring head, feeling it all the time with
      his short, broad fingers, as though to discover exactly how it was made.
      It was mighty hard in the back! No wonder poor old Aeschylus felt a bit
      sick when it fell on his head! The ancients used it to stand the world on -- a
      pagoda world, perhaps, of men and beasts and trees, like that carving on
      his guardian's Chinese cabinet. The Chinese made jolly beasts and trees,
      as if they believed in everything having a soul, and not only being just
      fit for people to eat or drive or make houses of. If only the Art School
      would let him model things 'on his own,' instead of copying and copying -- it
      was just as if they imagined it would be dangerous to let you think out
      anything for yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
      He held the tortoise to his waistcoat, and let it crawl, till, noticing
      that it was gnawing the corner of his essay, he put it back into his
      pocket. What would his tutor do if he were to know it was there? -- cock
      his head a little to one side, and say: "Ah! there are things, Lennan, not
      dreamed of in my philosophy!" Yes, there were a good many not dreamed of
      by 'old Stormer,' who seemed so awfully afraid of anything that wasn't
      usual; who seemed always laughing at you, for fear that you should laugh
      at him. There were lots of people in Oxford like that. It was stupid. You
      couldn't do anything decent if you were afraid of being laughed at! Mrs.
      Stormer wasn't like that; she did things because -- they came into her
      head. But then, of course, she was Austrian, not English, and ever so much
      younger than old Stormer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And having reached the door of his tutor's house, he rang the bell....
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      When Anna Stormer came into the study she found her husband standing at
      the window with his head a little on one side -- a tall, long-legged
      figure in clothes of a pleasant tweed, and wearing a low turn-over collar
      (not common in those days) and a blue silk tie, which she had knitted,
      strung through a ring. He was humming and gently tapping the window-pane
      with his well-kept finger-nails. Though celebrated for the amount of work
      he got through, she never caught him doing any in this house of theirs,
      chosen because it was more than half a mile away from the College which
      held the 'dear young clowns,' as he called them, of whom he was tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not turn -- it was not, of course, his habit to notice what was
      not absolutely necessary -- but she felt that he was aware of her. She
      came to the window seat and sat down. He looked round at that, and said:
      "Ah!"
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a murmur almost of admiration, not usual from him, since, with the
      exception of certain portions of the classics, it was hardly his custom to
      admire. But she knew that she was looking her best sitting there, her
      really beautiful figure poised, the sun shining on her brown hair, and
      brightening her deep-set, ice-green eyes under their black lashes. It was
      sometimes a great comfort to her that she remained so good-looking. It
      would have been an added vexation indeed to have felt that she ruffled her
      husband's fastidiousness. Even so, her cheekbones were too high for his
      taste, symbols of that something in her character which did not go with
      his -- the dash of desperation, of vividness, that lack of a certain
      English smoothness, which always annoyed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harold!" -- she would never quite flatten her r's -- "I want to go
      to the mountains this year."
     </p>
    <p>
      The mountains! She had not seen them since that season at San Martino di
      Castrozza twelve years ago, which had ended in her marrying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nostalgia!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what that means -- I am homesick. Can we go?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "If you like -- why not? But no leading up the Cimone della Pala for
      ME!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew what he meant by that. No romance. How splendidly he had led that
      day! She had almost worshipped him. What blindness! What distortion! Was
      it really the same man standing there with those bright, doubting eyes,
      with grey already in his hair? Yes, romance was over! And she sat silent,
      looking out into the street -- that little old street into which she
      looked day and night. A figure passed out there, came to the door, and
      rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said softly: "Here is Mark Lennan!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt her husband's eyes rest on her just for a moment, knew that he
      had turned, heard him murmur: "Ah, the angel clown!" And, quite still, she
      waited for the door to open. There was the boy, with his blessed dark
      head, and his shy, gentle gravity, and his essay in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Lennan, and how's old Noll? Hypocrite of genius, eh? Draw up; let's
      get him over!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Motionless, from her seat at the window, she watched those two figures at
      the table -- the boy reading in his queer, velvety bass voice; her
      husband leaning back with the tips of his fingers pressed together, his
      head a little on one side, and that faint, satiric smile which never
      reached his eyes. Yes, he was dozing, falling asleep; and the boy, not
      seeing, was going on. Then he came to the end and glanced up. What eyes he
      had! Other boys would have laughed; but he looked almost sorry. She heard
      him murmur: "I'm awfully sorry, sir."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Lennan, you caught me! Fact is, term's fagged me out. We're going to
      the mountains. Ever been to the mountains? What -- never! You should
      come with us, eh? What do you say, Anna? Don't you think this young man
      ought to come with us?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She got up, and stood staring at them both. Had she heard aright?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she answered -- very gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I think he ought."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Good; we'll get HIM to lead up the Cimone della Pala!"
     </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boy had said good-bye, and she had watched him out into the
      street, Anna stood for a moment in the streak of sunlight that came in
      through the open door, her hands pressed to cheeks which were flaming.
      Then she shut the door and leaned her forehead against the window-pane,
      seeing nothing. Her heart beat very fast; she was going over and over
      again the scene just passed through. This meant so much more than it had
      seemed to mean....
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she always had Heimweh, and especially at the end of the summer
      term, this year it had been a different feeling altogether that made her
      say to her husband: "I want to go to the mountains!"
     </p>
    <p>
      For twelve years she had longed for the mountains every summer, but had
      not pleaded for them; this year she had pleaded, but she did not long for
      them. It was because she had suddenly realized the strange fact that she
      did not want to leave England, and the reason for it, that she had come
      and begged to go. Yet why, when it was just to get away from thought of
      this boy, had she said: "Yes, I think he ought to come!" Ah! but life for
      her was always a strange pull between the conscientious and the desperate;
      a queer, vivid, aching business! How long was it now since that day when
      he first came to lunch, silent and shy, and suddenly smiling as if he were
      all lighted up within -- the day when she had said to her husband
      afterwards: "Ah, he's an angel!" Not yet a year -- the beginning of
      last October term, in fact. He was different from all the other boys; not
      that he was a prodigy with untidy hair, ill-fitting clothes, and a clever
      tongue; but because of something -- something -- Ah! well -- different;
      because he was -- he; because she longed to take his head between her
      hands and kiss it. She remembered so well the day that longing first came
      to her. She was giving him tea, it was quite early in the Easter term; he
      was stroking her cat, who always went to him, and telling her that he
      meant to be a sculptor, but that his guardian objected, so that, of
      course, he could not start till he was of age. The lamp on the table had a
      rose-coloured shade; he had been rowing -- a very cold day -- and
      his face was glowing; generally it was rather pale. And suddenly he
      smiled, and said: "It's rotten waiting for things, isn't it?" It was then
      she had almost stretched out her hands to draw his forehead to her lips.
      She had thought then that she wanted to kiss him, because it would have
      been so nice to be his mother -- she might just have been his mother,
      if she had married at sixteen. But she had long known now that she wanted
      to kiss, not his forehead, but his lips. He was there in her life -- a
      fire in a cold and unaired house; it had even become hard to understand
      that she could have gone on all these years without him. She had missed
      him so those six weeks of the Easter vacation, she had revelled so in his
      three queer little letters, half-shy, half-confidential; kissed them, and
      worn them in her dress! And in return had written him long, perfectly
      correct epistles in her still rather quaint English. She had never let him
      guess her feelings; the idea that he might shocked her inexpressibly. When
      the summer term began, life seemed to be all made up of thoughts of him.
      If, ten years ago, her baby had lived, if its cruel death -- after her
      agony -- had not killed for good her wish to have another; if for years
      now she had not been living with the knowledge that she had no warmth to
      expect, and that love was all over for her; if life in the most beautiful
      of all old cities had been able to grip her -- there would have been
      forces to check this feeling. But there was nothing in the world to divert
      the current. And she was so brimful of life, so conscious of vitality
      running to sheer waste. Sometimes it had been terrific, that feeling
      within her, of wanting to live -- to find outlet for her energy. So
      many hundreds of lonely walks she had taken during all these years, trying
      to lose herself in Nature -- hurrying alone, running in the woods, over
      the fields, where people did not come, trying to get rid of that sense of
      waste, trying once more to feel as she had felt when a girl, with the
      whole world before her. It was not for nothing that her figure was superb,
      her hair so bright a brown, her eyes so full of light. She had tried many
      distractions. Work in the back streets, music, acting, hunting; given them
      up one after the other; taken to them passionately again. They had served
      in the past. But this year they had not served.... One Sunday, coming from
      confession unconfessed, she had faced herself. It was wicked. She would
      have to kill this feeling -- must fly from this boy who moved her so!
      If she did not act quickly, she would be swept away. And then the thought
      had come: Why not? Life was to be lived -- not torpidly dozed through
      in this queer cultured place, where age was in the blood! Life was for
      love -- to be enjoyed! And she would be thirty-six next month! It
      seemed to her already an enormous age. Thirty-six! Soon she would be old,
      actually old -- and never have known passion! The worship, which had
      made a hero of the distinguished-looking Englishman, twelve years older
      than herself, who could lead up the Cimone della Pala, had not been
      passion. It might, perhaps, have become passion if he had so willed. But
      he was all form, ice, books. Had he a heart at all, had he blood in his
      veins? Was there any joy of life in this too beautiful city and these
      people who lived in it -- this place where even enthusiasms seemed to
      be formal and have no wings, where everything was settled and
      sophisticated as the very chapels and cloisters? And yet, to have this
      feeling for a boy -- for one almost young enough to be her son! It was
      so -- shameless! That thought haunted her, made her flush in the dark,
      lying awake at night. And desperately she would pray -- for she was
      devout -- pray to be made pure, to be given the holy feelings of a
      mother, to be filled simply with the sweet sense that she could do
      everything, suffer anything for him, for his good. After these long
      prayers she would feel calmed, drowsy, as though she had taken a drug. For
      hours, perhaps, she would stay like that. And then it would all come over
      her again. She never thought of his loving her; that would be -- unnatural.
      Why should he love her? She was very humble about it. Ever since that
      Sunday, when she avoided the confessional, she had brooded over how to
      make an end -- how to get away from a longing that was too strong for
      her. And she had hit on this plan -- to beg for the mountains, to go
      back to where her husband had come into her life, and try if this feeling
      would not die. If it did not, she would ask to be left out there with her
      own people, away from this danger. And now the fool -- the blind fool -- the
      superior fool -- with his satiric smile, his everlasting patronage, had
      driven her to overturn her own plan. Well, let him take the consequences;
      she had done her best! She would have this one fling of joy, even if it
      meant that she must stay out there, and never see the boy again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing in her dusky hall, where a faint scent of woodrot crept out into
      the air, whenever windows and doors were closed, she was all tremulous
      with secret happiness. To be with him among her mountains, to show him all
      those wonderful, glittering or tawny crags, to go with him to the top of
      them and see the kingdoms of the world spread out below; to wander with
      him in the pine woods, on the Alps in all the scent of the trees and the
      flowers, where the sun was hot! The first of July; and it was only the
      tenth of June! Would she ever live so long? They would not go to San
      Martino this time, rather to Cortina -- some new place that had no
      memories!
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved from the window, and busied herself with a bowl of flowers. She
      had heard that humming sound which often heralded her husband's approach,
      as though warning the world to recover its good form before he reached it.
      In her happiness she felt kind and friendly to him. If he had not meant to
      give her joy, he had nevertheless given it! He came downstairs two at a
      time, with that air of not being a pedagogue, which she knew so well; and,
      taking his hat off the stand, half turned round to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pleasant youth, young Lennan; hope he won't bore us out there!"
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice seemed to have an accent of compunction, to ask pardon for
      having issued that impulsive invitation. And there came to her an
      overwhelming wish to laugh. To hide it, to find excuse for it, she ran up
      to him, and, pulling his coat lapels till his face was within reach, she
      kissed the tip of his nose. And then she laughed. And he stood looking at
      her, with his head just a little on one side, and his eyebrows just a
      little raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      When young Mark heard a soft tapping at his door, though out of bed, he
      was getting on but dreamily -- it was so jolly to watch the mountains
      lying out in this early light like huge beasts. That one they were going
      up, with his head just raised above his paws, looked very far away out
      there! Opening the door an inch, he whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it late?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Five o'clock; aren't you ready?"
     </p>
    <p>
      It was awfully rude of him to keep her waiting! And he was soon down in
      the empty dining-room, where a sleepy maid was already bringing in their
      coffee. Anna was there alone. She had on a flax-blue shirt, open at the
      neck, a short green skirt, and a grey-green velvety hat, small, with one
      black-cock's feather. Why could not people always wear such nice things,
      and be as splendid-looking! And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do look jolly, Mrs. Stormer!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer for so long that he wondered if it had been rude to say
      that. But she DID look so strong, and swift, and happy-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the hill, through a wood of larch-trees, to the river, and across the
      bridge, to mount at once by a path through hay-fields. How could old
      Stormer stay in bed on such a morning! The peasant girls in their blue
      linen skirts were already gathering into bundles what the men had scythed.
      One, raking at the edge of a field, paused and shyly nodded to them. She
      had the face of a Madonna, very calm and grave and sweet, with delicate
      arched brows -- a face it was pure pleasure to see. The boy looked back
      at her. Everything to him, who had never been out of England before,
      seemed strange and glamorous. The chalets, with their long wide
      burnt-brown wooden balconies and low-hanging eaves jutting far beyond the
      walls; these bright dresses of the peasant women; the friendly little
      cream-coloured cows, with blunt, smoke-grey muzzles. Even the feel in the
      air was new, that delicious crisp burning warmth that lay so lightly as it
      were on the surface of frozen stillness; and the special sweetness of all
      places at the foot of mountains -- scent of pine-gum, burning
      larch-wood, and all the meadow flowers and grasses. But newest of all was
      the feeling within him -- a sort of pride, a sense of importance, a
      queer exhilaration at being alone with her, chosen companion of one so
      beautiful.

    <p>
      They passed all the other pilgrims bound the same way -- stout square
      Germans with their coats slung through straps, who trailed behind them
      heavy alpenstocks, carried greenish bags, and marched stolidly at a pace
      that never varied, growling, as Anna and the boy went by: "Aber eilen ist
      nichts!"
     </p>
    <p>
      But those two could not go fast enough to keep pace with their spirits.
      This was no real climb -- just a training walk to the top of the
      Nuvolau; and they were up before noon, and soon again descending, very
      hungry. When they entered the little dining-room of the Cinque Torre
      Hutte, they found it occupied by a party of English people, eating
      omelettes, who looked at Anna with faint signs of recognition, but did not
      cease talking in voices that all had a certain half-languid precision, a
      slight but brisk pinching of sounds, as if determined not to tolerate a
      drawl, and yet to have one. Most of them had field-glasses slung round
      them, and cameras were dotted here and there about the room. Their faces
      were not really much alike, but they all had a peculiar drooping smile,
      and a particular lift of the eyebrows, that made them seem reproductions
      of a single type. Their teeth, too, for the most part were a little
      prominent, as though the drooping of their mouths had forced them forward.
      They were eating as people eat who distrust the lower senses, preferring
      not to be compelled to taste or smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From our hotel," whispered Anna; and, ordering red wine and schnitzels,
      she and the boy sat down. The lady who seemed in command of the English
      party inquired now how Mr. Stormer was -- he was not laid up, she
      hoped. No? Only lazy? Indeed! He was a great climber, she believed. It
      seemed to the boy that this lady somehow did not quite approve of them.
      The talk was all maintained between her, a gentleman with a crumpled
      collar and puggaree, and a short thick-set grey-bearded man in a dark
      Norfolk jacket. If any of the younger members of the party spoke, the
      remark was received with an arch lifting of the brows, and drooping of the
      lids, as who should say: "Ah! Very promising!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing in my life has given me greater pain than to observe the aptitude
      of human nature for becoming crystallized." It was the lady in command who
      spoke, and all the young people swayed their faces up and down, as if
      assenting. How like they were, the boy thought, to guinea-fowl, with their
      small heads and sloping shoulders and speckly grey coats!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! my dear lady" -- it was the gentleman with the crumpled collar -- "you
      novelists are always girding at the precious quality of conformity. The
      sadness of our times lies in this questioning spirit. Never was there more
      revolt, especially among the young. To find the individual judging for
      himself is a grave symptom of national degeneration. But this is not a
      subject -- "
     </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, the subject is of the most poignant interest to all young
      people." Again all the young ones raised their faces and moved them
      slightly from side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear lady, we are too prone to let the interest that things arouse
      blind our judgment in regard to the advisability of discussing them. We
      let these speculations creep and creep until they twine themselves round
      our faith and paralyze it."
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the young men interjected suddenly: "Madre" -- and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not, I think" -- it was the lady speaking -- "be accused of
      licence when I say that I have always felt that speculation is only
      dangerous when indulged in by the crude intelligence. If culture has
      nothing to give us, then let us have no culture; but if culture be, as I
      think it, indispensable, then we must accept the dangers that culture
      brings."
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the young people moved their faces, and again the younger of the two
      young men said: "Madre -- "
     </p>
    <p>
      "Dangers? Have cultured people dangers?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Who had spoken thus? Every eyebrow was going up, every mouth was drooping,
      and there was silence. The boy stared at his companion. In what a strange
      voice she had made that little interjection! There seemed a sort of flame,
      too, lighted in her eyes. Then the little grey-bearded man said, and his
      rather whispering voice sounded hard and acid:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are all human, my dear madam."
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy felt his heart go thump at Anna's laugh. It was just as if she had
      said: "Ah! but not you -- surely!" And he got up to follow her towards
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The English party had begun already talking -- of the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two walked some way from the 'hut' in silence, before Anna said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't like me when I laughed?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "You hurt their feelings, I think."
     </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to -- the English Grundys! Ah! don't be cross with me! They
      WERE English Grundys, weren't they -- every one?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked into his face so hard, that he felt the blood rush to his
      cheeks, and a dizzy sensation of being drawn forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have no blood, those people! Their voices, their supercilious eyes
      that look you up and down! Oh! I've had so much of them! That woman with
      her Liberalism, just as bad as any. I hate them all!"
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have liked to hate them, too, since she did; but they had only
      seemed to him amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They aren't human. They don't FEEL! Some day you'll know them. They won't
      amuse you then!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She went on, in a quiet, almost dreamy voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they come here? It's still young and warm and good out here. Why
      don't they keep to their Culture, where no one knows what it is to ache
      and feel hunger, and hearts don't beat. Feel!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Disturbed beyond measure, the boy could not tell whether it was in her
      heart or in his hand that the blood was pulsing so. Was he glad or sorry
      when she let his hand go?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, well! They can't spoil this day. Let's rest."
     </p>
    <p>
      At the edge of the larch-wood where they sat, were growing numbers of
      little mountain pinks, with fringed edges and the sweetest scent
      imaginable; and she got up presently to gather them. But he stayed where
      he was, and odd sensations stirred in him. The blue of the sky, the
      feathery green of the larch-trees, the mountains, were no longer to him
      what they had been early that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came back with her hands full of the little pinks, spread her fingers
      and let them drop. They showered all over his face and neck. Never was so
      wonderful a scent; never such a strange feeling as they gave him. They
      clung to his hair, his forehead, his eyes, one even got caught on the
      curve of his lips; and he stared up at her through their fringed petals.
      There must have been something wild in his eyes then, something of the
      feeling that was stinging his heart, for her smile died; she walked away,
      and stood with her face turned from him. Confused, and unhappy, he
      gathered the strewn flowers; and not till he had collected every one did
      he get up and shyly take them to her, where she still stood, gazing into
      the depths of the larch-wood.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      What did he know of women, that should make him understand? At his public
      school he had seen none to speak to; at Oxford, only this one. At home in
      the holidays, not any, save his sister Cicely. The two hobbies of their
      guardian, fishing, and the antiquities of his native county, rendered him
      averse to society; so that his little Devonshire manor-house, with its
      black oak panels and its wild stone-walled park along the river-side was,
      from year's end to year's end, innocent of all petticoats, save those of
      Cicely and old Miss Tring, the governess. Then, too, the boy was shy. No,
      there was nothing in his past, of not yet quite nineteen years, to go by.
      He was not of those youths who are always thinking of conquests. The very
      idea of conquest seemed to him vulgar, mean, horrid. There must be many
      signs indeed before it would come into his head that a woman was in love
      with him, especially the one to whom he looked up, and thought so
      beautiful. For before all beauty he was humble, inclined to think himself
      a clod. It was the part of life which was always unconsciously sacred, and
      to be approached trembling. The more he admired, the more tremulous and
      diffident he became. And so, after his one wild moment, when she plucked
      those sweet-scented blossoms and dropped them over him, he felt abashed;
      and walking home beside her he was quieter than ever, awkward to the
      depths of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there were confusion in his heart which had been innocent of trouble,
      what must there have been in hers, that for so long had secretly desired
      the dawning of that confusion? And she, too, was very silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing a church with open door in the outskirts of the village, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't wait for me -- I want to go in here a little."
     </p>
    <p>
      In the empty twilight within, one figure, a countrywoman in her black
      shawl, was kneeling -- marvellously still. He would have liked to stay.
      That kneeling figure, the smile of the sunlight filtering through into the
      half darkness! He lingered long enough to see Anna, too, go down on her
      knees in the stillness. Was she praying? Again he had the turbulent
      feeling with which he had watched her pluck those flowers. She looked so
      splendid kneeling there! It was caddish to feel like that, when she was
      praying, and he turned quickly away into the road. But that sharp, sweet
      stinging sensation did not leave him. He shut his eyes to get rid of her
      image -- and instantly she became ten times more visible, his feeling
      ten times stronger. He mounted to the hotel; there on the terrace was his
      tutor. And oddly enough, the sight of him at that moment was no more
      embarrassing than if it had been the hotel concierge. Stormer did not
      somehow seem to count; did not seem to want you to count him. Besides, he
      was so old -- nearly fifty!
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who was so old was posed in a characteristic attitude -- hands
      in the pockets of his Norfolk jacket, one shoulder slightly raised, head
      just a little on one side, as if preparing to quiz something. He spoke as
      Lennan came up, smiling -- but not with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, young man, and what have you done with my wife?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Left her in a church, sir."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! She will do that! Has she run you off your legs? No? Then let's walk
      and talk a little."
     </p>
    <p>
      To be thus pacing up and down and talking with her husband seemed quite
      natural, did not even interfere with those new sensations, did not in the
      least increase his shame for having them. He only wondered a little how
      she could have married him -- but so little! Quite far and academic was
      his wonder -- like his wonder in old days how his sister could care to
      play with dolls. If he had any other feeling, it was just a longing to get
      away and go down the hill again to the church. It seemed cold and lonely
      after all that long day with her -- as if he had left himself up there,
      walking along hour after hour, or lying out in the sun beside her. What
      was old Stormer talking about? The difference between the Greek and Roman
      views of honour. Always in the past -- seemed to think the present was
      bad form. And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We met some English Grundys, sir, on the mountain."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes! Any particular brand?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Some advanced, and some not; but all the same, I think, really."
     </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Grundys, I think you said?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir, from this hotel. It was Mrs. Stormer's name for them. They were
      so very superior."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something unusual in the tone of that little word. And the boy
      stared -- for the first time there seemed a real man standing there.
      Then the blood rushed up into his cheeks, for there she was! Would she
      come up to them? How splendid she was looking, burnt by the sun, and
      walking as if just starting! But she passed into the hotel without turning
      her head their way. Had he offended, hurt her? He made an excuse, and got
      away to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the window from which that same morning he had watched the mountains
      lying out like lions in the dim light, he stood again, and gazed at the
      sun dropping over the high horizon. What had happened to him? He felt so
      different, so utterly different. It was another world. And the most
      strange feeling came on him, as of the flowers falling again all over his
      face and neck and hands, the tickling of their soft-fringed edges, the
      stinging sweetness of their scent. And he seemed to hear her voice saying:
      "Feel!" and to feel her heart once more beating under his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone with that black-shawled figure in the silent church, Anna did not
      pray. Resting there on her knees, she experienced only the sore sensation
      of revolt. Why had Fate flung this feeling into her heart, lighted up her
      life suddenly, if God refused her its enjoyment? Some of the mountain
      pinks remained clinging to her belt, and the scent of them, crushed
      against her, warred with the faint odour of age and incense. While they
      were there, with their enticement and their memories, prayer would never
      come. But did she want to pray? Did she desire the mood of that poor soul
      in her black shawl, who had not moved by one hair's breadth since she had
      been watching her, who seemed resting her humble self so utterly, letting
      life lift from her, feeling the relief of nothingness? Ah, yes! what would
      it be to have a life so toilsome, so little exciting from day to day and
      hour to hour, that just to kneel there in wistful stupor was the greatest
      pleasure one could know? It was beautiful to see her, but it was sad. And
      there came over Anna a longing to go up to her neighbour and say: "Tell me
      your troubles; we are both women." She had lost a son, perhaps, some love -- or
      perhaps not really love, only some illusion. Ah! Love.... Why should any
      spirit yearn, why should any body, full of strength and joy, wither slowly
      away for want of love? Was there not enough in this great world for her,
      Anna, to have a little? She would not harm him, for she would know when he
      had had enough of her; she would surely have the pride and grace then to
      let him go. For, of course, he would get tired of her. At her age she
      could never hope to hold a boy more than a few years -- months,
      perhaps. But would she ever hold him at all? Youth was so hard -- it
      had no heart! And then the memory of his eyes came back -- gazing up,
      troubled, almost wild -- when she had dropped on him those flowers.
      That memory filled her with a sort of delirium. One look from her then,
      one touch, and he would have clasped her to him. She was sure of it, yet
      scarcely dared to believe what meant so much. And suddenly the torment
      that she must go through, whatever happened, seemed to her too brutal and
      undeserved! She rose. Just one gleam of sunlight was still slanting
      through the doorway; it failed by a yard or so to reach the kneeling
      countrywoman, and Anna watched. Would it steal on and touch her, or would
      the sun pass down behind the mountains, and it fade away? Unconscious of
      that issue, the black-shawled figure knelt, never moving. And the beam
      crept on. "If it touches her, then he will love me, if only for an hour;
      if it fades out too soon -- " And the beam crept on. That shadowy path
      of light, with its dancing dust-motes, was it indeed charged with Fate -- indeed
      the augury of Love or Darkness? And, slowly moving, it mounted, the sun
      sinking; it rose above that bent head, hovered in a golden mist, passed -- and
      suddenly was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsteadily, seeing nothing plain, Anna walked out of the church. Why she
      passed her husband and the boy on the terrace without a look she could not
      quite have said -- perhaps because the tortured does not salute her
      torturers. When she reached her room she felt deadly tired, and lying down
      on her bed, almost at once fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wakened by a sound, and, recognizing the delicate 'rat-tat' of her
      husband's knock, did not answer, indifferent whether he came in or no. He
      entered noiselessly. If she did not let him know she was awake, he would
      not wake her. She lay still and watched him sit down astride of a chair,
      cross his arms on its back, rest his chin on them, and fix his eyes on
      her. Through her veil of eyelashes she had unconsciously contrived that
      his face should be the one object plainly seen -- the more intensely
      visualized, because of this queer isolation. She did not feel at all
      ashamed of this mutual fixed scrutiny, in which she had such advantage. He
      had never shown her what was in him, never revealed what lay behind those
      bright satiric eyes. Now, perhaps, she would see! And she lay, regarding
      him with the intense excited absorption with which one looks at a tiny
      wildflower through a magnifying-lens, and watches its insignificance
      expanded to the size and importance of a hothouse bloom. In her mind was
      this thought: He is looking at me with his real self, since he has no
      reason for armour against me now. At first his eyes seemed masked with
      their customary brightness, his whole face with its usual decorous
      formality; then gradually he became so changed that she hardly knew him.
      That decorousness, that brightness, melted off what lay behind, as frosty
      dew melts off grass. And her very soul contracted within her, as if she
      had become identified with what he was seeing -- a something to be
      passed over, a very nothing. Yes, his was the face of one looking at what
      was unintelligible, and therefore negligible; at that which had no soul;
      at something of a different and inferior species and of no great interest
      to a man. His face was like a soundless avowal of some conclusion, so
      fixed and intimate that it must surely emanate from the very core of him -- be
      instinctive, unchangeable. This was the real he! A man despising women!
      Her first thought was: And he's married -- what a fate! Her second: If
      he feels that, perhaps thousands of men do! Am I and all women really what
      they think us? The conviction in his stare -- its through-and-through
      conviction -- had infected her; and she gave in to it for the moment,
      crushed. Then her spirit revolted with such turbulence, and the blood so
      throbbed in her, that she could hardly lie still. How dare he think her
      like that -- a nothing, a bundle of soulless inexplicable whims and
      moods and sensuality? A thousand times, No! It was HE who was the soulless
      one, the dry, the godless one; who, in his sickening superiority, could
      thus deny her, and with her all women! That stare was as if he saw her -- a
      doll tricked out in garments labelled soul, spirit, rights,
      responsibilities, dignity, freedom -- all so many words. It was vile,
      it was horrible, that he should see her thus! And a really terrific
      struggle began in her between the desire to get up and cry this out, and
      the knowledge that it would be stupid, undignified, even mad, to show her
      comprehension of what he would never admit or even understand that he had
      revealed to her. And then a sort of cynicism came to her rescue. What a
      funny thing was married life -- to have lived all these years with him,
      and never known what was at the bottom of his heart! She had the feeling
      now that, if she went up to him and said: "I am in love with that boy!" it
      would only make him droop the corners of his mouth and say in his most
      satiric voice: "Really! That is very interesting!" -- would not change
      in one iota his real thoughts of her; only confirm him in the conviction
      that she was negligible, inexplicable, an inferior strange form of animal,
      of no real interest to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, just when she felt that she could not hold herself in any
      longer, he got up, passed on tiptoe to the door, opened it noiselessly,
      and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he had gone, she jumped up. So, then, she was linked to one for
      whom she, for whom women, did not, as it were, exist! It seemed to her
      that she had stumbled on knowledge of almost sacred importance, on the key
      of everything that had been puzzling and hopeless in their married life.
      If he really, secretly, whole-heartedly despised her, the only feeling she
      need have for one so dry, so narrow, so basically stupid, was just
      contempt. But she knew well enough that contempt would not shake what she
      had seen in his face; he was impregnably walled within his clever, dull
      conviction of superiority. He was for ever intrenched, and she would
      always be only the assailant. Though -- what did it matter, now?
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually swift, almost careless, she was a long time that evening over her
      toilette. Her neck was very sunburnt, and she lingered, doubtful whether
      to hide it with powder, or accept her gipsy colouring. She did accept it,
      for she saw that it gave her eyes, so like glacier ice, under their black
      lashes, and her hair, with its surprising glints of flame colour, a
      peculiar value.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dinner-bell rang she passed her husband's door without, as usual,
      knocking, and went down alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall she noticed some of the English party of the mountain hut.
      They did not greet her, conceiving an immediate interest in the barometer;
      but she could feel them staring at her very hard. She sat down to wait,
      and at once became conscious of the boy coming over from the other side of
      the room, rather like a person walking in his sleep. He said not a word.
      But how he looked! And her heart began to beat. Was this the moment she
      had longed for? If it, indeed, had come, dared she take it? Then she saw
      her husband descending the stairs, saw him greet the English party, heard
      the intoning of their drawl. She looked up at the boy, and said quickly:
      "Was it a happy day?" It gave her such delight to keep that look on his
      face, that look as if he had forgotten everything except just the sight of
      her. His eyes seemed to have in them something holy at that moment,
      something of the wonder-yearning of Nature and of innocence. It was
      dreadful to know that in a moment that look must be gone; perhaps never to
      come back on his face -- that look so precious! Her husband was
      approaching now! Let him see, if he would! Let him see that someone could
      adore -- that she was not to everyone a kind of lower animal. Yes, he
      must have seen the boy's face; and yet his expression never changed. He
      noticed nothing! Or was it that he disdained to notice?
    </p>

      VII
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed for young Lennan a strange time, when he never knew from
      minute to minute whether he was happy -- always trying to be with her,
      restless if he could not be, sore if she talked with and smiled at others;
      yet, when he was with her, restless too, unsatisfied, suffering from his
      own timidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      One wet morning, when she was playing the hotel piano, and he listening,
      thinking to have her to himself, there came a young German violinist -- pale,
      and with a brown, thin-waisted coat, longish hair, and little whiskers -- rather
      a beast, in fact. Soon, of course, this young beast was asking her to
      accompany him -- as if anyone wanted to hear him play his disgusting
      violin! Every word and smile that she gave him hurt so, seeing how much
      more interesting than himself this foreigner was! And his heart grew
      heavier and heavier, and he thought: If she likes him I ought not to mind -- only,
      I DO mind! How can I help minding? It was hateful to see her smiling, and
      the young beast bending down to her. And they were talking German, so that
      he could not tell what they were saying, which made it more unbearable. He
      had not known there could be such torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he began to want to hurt her, too. But that was mean -- besides,
      how could he hurt her? She did not care for him. He was nothing to her -- only
      a boy. If she really thought him only a boy, who felt so old -- it
      would be horrible. It flashed across him that she might be playing that
      young violinist against him! No, she never would do that! But the young
      beast looked just the sort that might take advantage of her smiles. If
      only he WOULD do something that was not respectful, how splendid it would
      be to ask him to come for a walk in the woods, and, having told him why,
      give him a thrashing. Afterwards, he would not tell her, he would not try
      to gain credit by it. He would keep away till she wanted him back. But
      suddenly the thought of what he would feel if she really meant to take
      this young man as her friend in place of him became so actual, so
      poignant, so horribly painful, that he got up abruptly and went towards
      the door. Would she not say a word to him before he got out of the room,
      would she not try and keep him? If she did not, surely it would be all
      over; it would mean that anybody was more to her than he. That little
      journey to the door, indeed, seemed like a march to execution. Would she
      not call after him? He looked back. She was smiling. But HE could not
      smile; she had hurt him too much! Turning his head away, he went out, and
      dashed into the rain bareheaded. The feeling of it on his face gave him a
      sort of dismal satisfaction. Soon he would be wet through. Perhaps he
      would get ill. Out here, far away from his people, she would have to offer
      to nurse him; and perhaps -- perhaps in his illness he would seem to
      her again more interesting than that young beast, and then -- Ah! if
      only he could be ill!
    </p>
    <p>
      He mounted rapidly through the dripping leaves towards the foot of the low
      mountain that rose behind the hotel. A trail went up there to the top, and
      he struck into it, going at a great pace. His sense of injury began dying
      away; he no longer wanted to be ill. The rain had stopped, the sun came
      out; he went on, up and up. He would get to the top quicker than anyone
      ever had! It was something he could do better than that young beast. The
      pine-trees gave way to stunted larches, and these to pine scrub and bare
      scree, up which he scrambled, clutching at the tough bushes, terribly out
      of breath, his heart pumping, the sweat streaming into his eyes. He had no
      feeling now but wonder whether he would get to the top before he dropped,
      exhausted. He thought he would die of the beating of his heart; but it was
      better to die than to stop and be beaten by a few yards. He stumbled up at
      last on to the little plateau at the top. For full ten minutes he lay
      there on his face without moving, then rolled over. His heart had given up
      that terrific thumping; he breathed luxuriously, stretched out his arms
      along the steaming grass -- felt happy. It was wonderful up here, with
      the sun burning hot in a sky clear-blue already. How tiny everything
      looked below -- hotel, trees, village, chalets -- little toy things!
      He had never before felt the sheer joy of being high up. The rain-clouds,
      torn and driven in huge white shapes along the mountains to the South,
      were like an army of giants with chariots and white horses hurrying away.
      He thought suddenly: "Suppose I had died when my heart pumped so! Would it
      have mattered the least bit? Everything would be going on just the same,
      the sun shining, the blue up there the same; and those toy things down in
      the valley." That jealousy of his an hour ago, why -- it was nothing -- he
      himself nothing! What did it matter if she were nice to that fellow in the
      brown coat? What did anything matter when the whole thing was so big -- and
      he such a tiny scrap of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the edge of the plateau, to mark the highest point, someone had erected
      a rude cross, which jutted out stark against the blue sky. It looked cruel
      somehow, sagged all crooked, and out of place up here; a piece of bad
      manners, as if people with only one idea had dragged it in, without caring
      whether or no it suited what was around it. One might just as well
      introduce one of these rocks into that jolly dark church where he had left
      her the other day, as put a cross up here.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sound of bells, and of sniffing and scuffling, roused him; a large grey
      goat had come up and was smelling at his hair -- the leader of a flock,
      that were soon all round him, solemnly curious, with their queer yellow
      oblong-pupilled eyes, and their quaint little beards and tails. Awfully
      decent beasts -- and friendly! What jolly things to model! He lay still
      (having learnt from the fisherman, his guardian, that necessary habit in
      the presence of all beasts), while the leader sampled the flavour of his
      neck. The passage of that long rough tongue athwart his skin gave him an
      agreeable sensation, awakened a strange deep sense of comradeship. He
      restrained his desire to stroke the creature's nose. It appeared that they
      now all wished to taste his neck; but some were timid, and the touch of
      their tongues simply a tickle, so that he was compelled to laugh, and at
      that peculiar sound they withdrew and gazed at him. There seemed to be no
      one with them; then, at a little distance, quite motionless in the shade
      of a rock, he spied the goatherd, a boy about his own age. How lonely he
      must be up here all day! Perhaps he talked to his goats. He looked as if
      he might. One would get to have queer thoughts up here, get to know the
      rocks, and clouds, and beasts, and what they all meant. The goatherd
      uttered a peculiar whistle, and something, Lennan could not tell exactly
      what, happened among the goats -- a sort of "Here, Sir!" seemed to come
      from them. And then the goatherd moved out from the shade and went over to
      the edge of the plateau, and two of the goats that were feeding there
      thrust their noses into his hand, and rubbed themselves against his legs.
      The three looked beautiful standing there together on the edge against the
      sky....
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, after dinner, the dining-room was cleared for dancing, so that
      the guests might feel freedom and gaiety in the air. And, indeed,
      presently, a couple began sawing up and down over the polished boards, in
      the apologetic manner peculiar to hotel guests. Then three pairs of
      Italians suddenly launched themselves into space -- twirling and
      twirling, and glaring into each other's eyes; and some Americans,
      stimulated by their precept, began airily backing and filling. Two of the
      'English Grundys' with carefully amused faces next moved out. To Lennan it
      seemed that they all danced very well, better than he could. Did he dare
      ask HER? Then he saw the young violinist go up, saw her rise and take his
      arm and vanish into the dancing-room; and leaning his forehead against a
      window-pane, with a sick, beaten feeling, he stayed, looking out into the
      moonlight, seeing nothing. He heard his name spoken; his tutor was
      standing beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and I, Lennan, must console each other. Dancing's for the young, eh?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately it was the boy's instinct and his training not to show his
      feelings; to be pleasant, though suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir. Jolly moonlight, isn't it, out there?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! very jolly; yes. When I was your age I twirled the light fantastic
      with the best. But gradually, Lennan, one came to see it could not be done
      without a partner -- there was the rub! Tell me -- do you regard
      women as responsible beings? I should like to have your opinion on that."
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, of course, ironical -- yet there was something in those words -- something!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's you, sir, who ought to give me yours."
     </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Lennan -- my experience is a mere nothing!"
     </p>
    <p>
      That was meant for unkindness to her! He would not answer. If only Stormer
      would go away! The music had stopped. They would be sitting out somewhere,
      talking! He made an effort, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was up the hill at the back this morning, where the cross is. There
      were some jolly goats."
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he saw her coming. She was alone -- flushed, smiling; it
      struck him that her frock was the same colour as the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harold, will you dance?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He would say 'Yes,' and she would be gone again! But his tutor only made
      her a little bow, and said with that smile of his:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lennan and I have agreed that dancing is for the young."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes the old must sacrifice themselves. Mark, will you dance?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind him he heard his tutor murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Lennan -- you betray me!"
     </p>
    <p>
      That little silent journey with her to the dancing-room was the happiest
      moment perhaps that he had ever known. And he need not have been so much
      afraid about his dancing. Truly, it was not polished, but it could not
      spoil hers, so light, firm, buoyant! It was wonderful to dance with her.
      Only when the music stopped and they sat down did he know how his head was
      going round. He felt strange, very strange indeed. He heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, dear boy? You look so white!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Without quite knowing what he did, he bent his face towards the hand that
      she had laid on his sleeve, then knew no more, having fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing boy -- over-exertion in the morning! That was all! He was
      himself very quickly, and walked up to bed without assistance. Rotten of
      him! Never was anyone more ashamed of his little weakness than this boy.
      Now that he was really a trifle indisposed, he simply could not bear the
      idea of being nursed at all or tended. Almost rudely he had got away. Only
      when he was in bed did he remember the look on her face as he left her.
      How wistful and unhappy, seeming to implore him to forgive her! As if
      there were anything to forgive! As if she had not made him perfectly happy
      when she danced with him! He longed to say to her: "If I might be close to
      you like that one minute every day, then I don't mind all the rest!"
       Perhaps he would dare say that to-morrow. Lying there he still felt a
      little funny. He had forgotten to close the ribs of the blinds, and
      moonlight was filtering in; but he was too idle, too drowsy to get up now
      and do it. They had given him brandy, rather a lot -- that perhaps was
      the reason he felt so queer; not ill, but mazy, as if dreaming, as if he
      had lost the desire ever to move again. Just to lie there, and watch the
      powdery moonlight, and hear faraway music throbbing down below, and still
      feel the touch of her, as in the dance she swayed against him, and all the
      time to have the scent about him of flowers! His thoughts were dreams, his
      dreams thoughts -- all precious unreality. And then it seemed to him
      that the moonlight was gathered into a single slip of pallor -- there
      was a thrumming, a throbbing, and that shape of moonlight moved towards
      him. It came so close that he felt its warmth against his brow; it sighed,
      hovered, drew back soundless, and was gone. He must have fallen then into
      dreamless sleep....
    </p>
    <p>
      What time was it when he was awakened by that delicate 'rat-tat' to see
      his tutor standing in the door-way with a cup of tea?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was young Lennan all right? Yes, he was perfectly all right -- would be
      down directly! It was most frightfully good of Mr. Stormer to come! He
      really didn't want anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, yes; but the maimed and the halt must be attended to!
    </p>
    <p>
      His face seemed to the boy very kind just then -- only to laugh at him
      a very little -- just enough. And it was awfully decent of him to have
      come, and to stand there while he drank the tea. He was really all right,
      but for a little headache. Many times while he was dressing he stood
      still, trying to remember. That white slip of moonlight? Was it moonlight?
      Was it part of a dream; or was it, could it have been she, in her
      moonlight-coloured frock? Why had he not stayed awake? He would not dare
      to ask her, and now would never know whether the vague memory of warmth on
      his brow had been a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      He breakfasted alone in the room where they had danced. There were two
      letters for him. One from his guardian enclosing money, and complaining of
      the shyness of the trout; the other from his sister. The man she was
      engaged to -- he was a budding diplomat, attached to the Embassy at
      Rome -- was afraid that his leave was going to be curtailed. They would
      have to be married at once. They might even have to get a special licence.
      It was lucky Mark was coming back so soon. They simply MUST have him for
      best man. The only bridesmaid now would be Sylvia.... Sylvia Doone? Why,
      she was only a kid! And the memory of a little girl in a very short
      holland frock, with flaxen hair, pretty blue eyes, and a face so fair that
      you could almost see through it, came up before him. But that, of course,
      was six years ago; she would not still be in a frock that showed her
      knees, or wear beads, or be afraid of bulls that were never there. It was
      stupid being best man -- they might have got some decent chap! And then
      he forgot all -- for there was SHE, out on the terrace. In his rush to
      join her he passed several of the 'English Grundys,' who stared at him
      askance. Indeed, his conduct of the night before might well have upset
      them. An Oxford man, fainting in an hotel! Something wrong there! . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, when he reached her, he did find courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it really moonlight?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "All moonlight."
     </p>
    <p>
      "But it was warm!"
     </p>
    <p>
      And, when she did not answer that, he had within him just the same light,
      intoxicated feeling as after he had won a race at school.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now came a dreadful blow. His tutor's old guide had suddenly turned
      up, after a climb with a party of Germans. The war-horse had been aroused
      in Stormer. He wished to start that afternoon for a certain hut, and go up
      a certain peak at dawn next day. But Lennan was not to go. Why not?
      Because of last night's faint; and because, forsooth, he was not some
      stupid thing they called 'an expert.' As if -- ! Where she could go he
      could! This was to treat him like a child. Of course he could go up this
      rotten mountain. It was because she did not care enough to take him! She
      did not think him man enough! Did she think that he could not climb what -- her
      husband -- could? And if it were dangerous SHE ought not to be going,
      leaving him behind -- that was simply cruel! But she only smiled, and
      he flung away from her, not having seen that all this grief of his only
      made her happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that afternoon they went off without him. What deep, dark thoughts he
      had then! What passionate hatred of his own youth! What schemes he wove,
      by which she might come back, and find him gone-up some mountain far more
      dangerous and fatiguing! If people did not think him fit to climb with, he
      would climb by himself. That, anyway, everyone admitted, was dangerous.
      And it would be her fault. She would be sorry then. He would get up, and
      be off before dawn; he put his things out ready, and filled his flask. The
      moonlight that evening was more wonderful than ever, the mountains like
      great ghosts of themselves. And she was up there at the hut, among them!
      It was very long before he went to sleep, brooding over his injuries -- intending
      not to sleep at all, so as to be ready to be off at three o'clock. At NINE
      o'clock he woke. His wrath was gone; he only felt restless and ashamed.
      If, instead of flying out, he had made the best of it, he could have gone
      with them as far as the hut, could have stayed the night there. And now he
      cursed himself for being such a fool and idiot. Some little of that idiocy
      he could, perhaps, retrieve. If he started for the hut at once, he might
      still be in time to meet them coming down, and accompany them home. He
      swallowed his coffee, and set off. He knew the way at first, then in woods
      lost it, recovered the right track again at last, but did not reach the
      hut till nearly two o'clock. Yes, the party had made the ascent that
      morning -- they had been seen, been heard jodelling on the top. Gewiss!
      Gewiss! But they would not come down the same way. Oh, no! They would be
      going home down to the West and over the other pass. They would be back in
      house before the young Herr himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard this, oddly, almost with relief. Was it the long walk alone, or
      being up there so high? Or simply that he was very hungry? Or just these
      nice friendly folk in the hut, and their young daughter with her fresh
      face, queer little black cloth sailor hat with long ribbons, velvet
      bodice, and perfect simple manners; or the sight of the little silvery-dun
      cows, thrusting their broad black noses against her hand? What was it that
      had taken away from him all his restless feeling, made him happy and
      content?... He did not know that the newest thing always fascinates the
      puppy in its gambols! ... He sat a long while after lunch, trying to draw
      the little cows, watching the sun on the cheek of that pretty maiden,
      trying to talk to her in German. And when at last he said: "Adieu!" and
      she murmured "Kuss die Hand. Adieu!" there was quite a little pang in his
      heart.... Wonderful and queer is the heart of a man!... For all that, as
      he neared home he hastened, till he was actually running. Why had he
      stayed so long up there? She would be back -- she would expect to see
      him; and that young beast of a violinist would be with her, perhaps,
      instead! He reached the hotel just in time to rush up and dress, and rush
      down to dinner. Ah! They were tired, no doubt -- were resting in their
      rooms. He sat through dinner as best he could; got away before dessert,
      and flew upstairs. For a minute he stood there doubtful; on which door
      should he knock? Then timidly he tapped on hers. No answer! He knocked
      loud on his tutor's door. No answer! They were not back, then. Not back?
      What could that mean? Or could it be that they were both asleep? Once more
      he knocked on her door; then desperately turned the handle, and took a
      flying glance. Empty, tidy, untouched! Not back! He turned and ran
      downstairs again. All the guests were streaming out from dinner, and he
      became entangled with a group of 'English Grundys' discussing a climbing
      accident which had occurred in Switzerland. He listened, feeling suddenly
      quite sick. One of them, the short grey-bearded Grundy with the rather
      whispering voice, said to him: "All alone again to-night? The Stormers not
      back?" Lennan did his best to answer, but something had closed his throat;
      he could only shake his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They had a guide, I think?" said the 'English Grundy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Lennan managed to get out: "Yes, sir."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Stormer, I fancy, is quite an expert!" and turning to the lady whom the
      young 'Grundys' addressed as 'Madre' he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me the great charm of mountain-climbing was always the freedom from
      people -- the remoteness."
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother of the young 'Grundys,' looking at Lennan with her half-closed
      eyes, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, to me, would be the disadvantage; I always like to be mixing with
      my own kind."
     </p>
    <p>
      The grey-bearded 'Grundy' murmured in a muffled voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dangerous thing, that, to say -- in an hotel!"
     </p>
    <p>
      And they went on talking, but of what Lennan no longer knew, lost in this
      sudden feeling of sick fear. In the presence of these 'English Grundys,'
      so superior to all vulgar sensations, he could not give vent to his alarm;
      already they viewed him as unsound for having fainted. Then he grasped
      that there had begun all round him a sort of luxurious speculation on what
      might have happened to the Stormers. The descent was very nasty; there was
      a particularly bad traverse. The 'Grundy,' whose collar was not now
      crumpled, said he did not believe in women climbing. It was one of the
      signs of the times that he most deplored. The mother of the young
      'Grundys' countered him at once: In practice she agreed that they were out
      of place, but theoretically she could not see why they should not climb.
      An American standing near threw all into confusion by saying he guessed
      that it might be liable to develop their understandings. Lennan made for
      the front door. The moon had just come up over in the South, and exactly
      under it he could see their mountain. What visions he had then! He saw her
      lying dead, saw himself climbing down in the moonlight and raising her
      still-living, but half-frozen, form from some perilous ledge. Even that
      was almost better than this actuality of not knowing where she was, or
      what had happened. People passed out into the moonlight, looking curiously
      at his set face staring so fixedly. One or two asked him if he were
      anxious, and he answered: "Oh no, thanks!" Soon there would have to be a
      search party. How soon? He would, he must be, of it! They should not stop
      him this time. And suddenly he thought: Ah, it is all because I stayed up
      there this afternoon talking to that girl, all because I forgot HER!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he heard a stir behind him. There they were, coming down the
      passage from a side door -- she in front with her alpenstock and
      rucksack -- smiling. Instinctively he recoiled behind some plants. They
      passed. Her sunburned face, with its high cheek-bones and its deep-set
      eyes, looked so happy; smiling, tired, triumphant. Somehow he could not
      bear it, and when they were gone by he stole out into the wood and threw
      himself down in shadow, burying his face, and choking back a horrible dry
      sobbing that would keep rising in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      IX
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he was happy; for all the afternoon he lay out in the shade of
      that same wood at her feet, gazing up through larch-boughs. It was so
      wonderful, with nobody but Nature near. Nature so alive, and busy, and so
      big!
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming down from the hut the day before, he had seen a peak that looked
      exactly like the figure of a woman with a garment over her head, the
      biggest statue in the world; from further down it had become the figure of
      a bearded man, with his arm bent over his eyes. Had she seen it? Had she
      noticed how all the mountains in moonlight or very early morning took the
      shape of beasts? What he wanted most in life was to be able to make images
      of beasts and creatures of all sorts, that were like -- that had -- that
      gave out the spirit of -- Nature; so that by just looking at them one
      could have all those jolly feelings one had when one was watching trees,
      and beasts, and rocks, and even some sorts of men -- but not 'English
      Grundys.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was quite determined to study Art?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh yes, of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      He would want to leave -- Oxford, then!
    </p>
    <p>
      No, oh no! Only some day he would have to.
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered: "Some never get away!"
     </p>
    <p>
      And he said quickly: "Of course, I shall never want to leave Oxford while
      you are there."
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard her draw her breath in sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, you will! Now help me up!" And she led the way back to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed out on the terrace when she had gone in, restless and unhappy
      the moment he was away from her. A voice close by said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, friend Lennan -- brown study, or blue devils, which?"
     </p>
    <p>
      There, in one of those high wicker chairs that insulate their occupants
      from the world, he saw his tutor leaning back, head a little to one side,
      and tips of fingers pressed together. He looked like an idol sitting there
      inert, and yet -- yesterday he had gone up that mountain!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheer up! You will break your neck yet! When I was your age, I remember
      feeling it deeply that I was not allowed to risk the lives of others."
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan stammered out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think of that; but I thought where Mrs. Stormer could go, I
      could."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! For all our admiration we cannot quite admit -- can we, when it
      comes to the point?"
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy's loyalty broke into flame:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not that. I think Mrs. Stormer as good as any man -- only -- only -- "
     </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite so good as you, eh?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred times better, sir."
     </p>
    <p>
      Stormer smiled. Ironic beast!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lennan," he said, "distrust hyperbole."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I know I'm no good at climbing," the boy broke out again; "but -- but -- I
      thought where she was allowed to risk her life, I ought to be!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Good! I like that." It was said so entirely without irony for once, that
      the boy was disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are young, Brother Lennan," his tutor went on. "Now, at what age do
      you consider men develop discretion? Because, there is just one thing
      always worth remembering -- women have none of that better part of
      valour."
     </p>
    <p>
      "I think women are the best things in the world," the boy blurted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May you long have that opinion!" His tutor had risen, and was ironically
      surveying his knees. "A bit stiff!" he said. "Let me know when you change
      your views!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I never shall, sir."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah! Never is a long word, Lennan. I am going to have some tea;" and
      gingerly he walked away, quizzing, as it were, with a smile, his own
      stiffness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lennan remained where he was, with burning cheeks. His tutor's words again
      had seemed directed against her. How could a man say such things about
      women! If they were true, he did not want to know; if they were not true,
      it was wicked to say them. It must be awful never to have generous
      feelings; always to have to be satirical. Dreadful to be like the 'English
      Grundys'; only different, of course, because, after all, old Stormer was
      much more interesting and intelligent -- ever so much more; only, just
      as 'superior.' "Some never get away!" Had she meant -- from that
      superiority? Just down below were a family of peasants scything and
      gathering in the grass. One could imagine her doing that, and looking
      beautiful, with a coloured handkerchief over her head; one could imagine
      her doing anything simple -- one could not imagine old Stormer doing
      anything but what he did do. And suddenly the boy felt miserable,
      oppressed by these dim glimmerings of lives misplaced. And he resolved
      that he would not be like Stormer when he was old! No, he would rather be
      a regular beast than be like that! . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went to his room to change for dinner he saw in a glass of water a
      large clove carnation. Who had put it there? Who could have put it there -- but
      she? It had the same scent as the mountain pinks she had dropped over him,
      but deeper, richer -- a scent moving, dark, and sweet. He put his lips
      to it before he pinned it into his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was dancing again that night -- more couples this time, and a
      violin beside the piano; and she had on a black frock. He had never seen
      her in black. Her face and neck were powdered over their sunburn. The
      first sight of that powder gave him a faint shock. He had not somehow
      thought that ladies ever put on powder. But if SHE did -- then it must
      be right! And his eyes never left her. He saw the young German violinist
      hovering round her, even dancing with her twice; watched her dancing with
      others, but all without jealousy, without troubling; all in a sort of
      dream. What was it? Had he been bewitched into that queer state, bewitched
      by the gift of that flower in his coat? What was it, when he danced with
      her, that kept him happy in her silence and his own? There was no
      expectation in him of anything that she would say, or do -- no
      expectation, no desire. Even when he wandered out with her on to the
      terrace, even when they went down the bank and sat on a bench above the
      fields where the peasants had been scything, he had still no feeling but
      that quiet, dreamy adoration. The night was black and dreamy too, for the
      moon was still well down behind the mountains. The little band was playing
      the next waltz; but he sat, not moving, not thinking, as if all power of
      action and thought had been stolen out of him. And the scent of the flower
      in his coat rose, for there was no wind. Suddenly his heart stopped
      beating. She had leaned against him, he felt her shoulder press his arm,
      her hair touch his cheek. He closed his eyes then, and turned his face to
      her. He felt her lips press his mouth with a swift, burning kiss. He
      sighed, stretched out his arms. There was nothing there but air. The
      rustle of her dress against the grass was all! The flower -- it, too,
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      X
    </p>
    <p>
      Not one minute all that night did Anna sleep. Was it remorse that kept her
      awake, or the intoxication of memory? If she felt that her kiss had been a
      crime, it was not against her husband or herself, but against the boy -- the
      murder of illusion, of something sacred. But she could not help feeling a
      delirious happiness too, and the thought of trying to annul what she had
      done did not even occur to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was ready, then, to give her a little love! Ever so little, compared to
      hers, but still a little! There could be no other meaning to that movement
      of his face with the closed eyes, as if he would nestle it down on her
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she ashamed of her little manoeuvres of these last few days -- ashamed
      of having smiled at the young violinist, of that late return from the
      mountain climb, of the flower she had given him, of all the conscious
      siege she had laid since the evening her husband came in and sat watching
      her, without knowing that she saw him? No; not really ashamed! Her remorse
      rose only from the kiss. It hurt to think of that, because it was death,
      the final extinction of the mother-feeling in her; the awakening of -- who
      knew what -- in the boy! For if she was mysterious to him, what was he
      not to her, with his eagerness, and his dreaminess, his youthful warmth,
      his innocence! What if it had killed in him trust, brushed off the dew,
      tumbled a star down? Could she forgive herself for that? Could she bear it
      if she were to make him like so many other boys, like that young
      violinist; just a cynical youth, looking on women as what they called
      'fair game'? But COULD she make him into such -- would he ever grow
      like that? Oh! surely not; or she would not have loved him from the moment
      she first set eyes on him and spoke of him as 'an angel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After that kiss -- that crime, if it were one -- in the dark she had
      not known what he had done, where gone -- perhaps wandering, perhaps
      straight up to his room. Why had she refrained, left him there, vanished
      out of his arms? This she herself hardly understood. Not shame; not fear;
      reverence perhaps -- for what? For love -- for the illusion, the
      mystery, all that made love beautiful; for youth, and the poetry of it;
      just for the sake of the black still night itself, and the scent of that
      flower -- dark flower of passion that had won him to her, and that she
      had stolen back, and now wore all night long close to her neck, and in the
      morning placed withered within her dress. She had been starved so long,
      and so long waited for that moment -- it was little wonder if she did
      not clearly know why she had done just this, and not that!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now how should she meet him, how first look into his eyes? Would they
      have changed? Would they no longer have the straight look she so loved? It
      would be for her to lead, to make the future. And she kept saying to
      herself: I am not going to be afraid. It is done. I will take what life
      offers! Of her husband she did not think at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the first moment she saw the boy, she knew that something from
      outside, and untoward, had happened since that kiss. He came up to her,
      indeed, but he said nothing, stood trembling all over and handed her a
      telegram that contained these words: "Come back at once Wedding immediate
      Expect you day after to-morrow. Cicely." The words grew indistinct even as
      she read them, and the boy's face all blurred. Then, making an effort, she
      said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, you must go. You cannot miss your only sister's wedding."
     </p>
    <p>
      Without protest he looked at her; and she could hardly bear that look -- it
      seemed to know so little, and ask so much. She said: "It is nothing -- only
      a few days. You will come back, or we will come to you."
     </p>
    <p>
      His face brightened at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you really come to us soon, at once -- if they ask you? Then I
      don't mind -- I -- I -- " And then he stopped, choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask us. We will come."
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized her hand; pressed and pressed it in both his own, then stroked
      it gently, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I'm hurting it!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, not wishing to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he would have to start to catch the only train that would
      get him home in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went and helped him to pack. Her heart felt like lead, but, not able
      to bear that look on his face again, she kept cheerfully talking of their
      return, asking about his home, how to get to it, speaking of Oxford and
      next term. When his things were ready she put her arms round his neck, and
      for a moment pressed him to her. Then she escaped. Looking back from his
      door, she saw him standing exactly as when she had withdrawn her arms. Her
      cheeks were wet; she dried them as she went downstairs. When she felt
      herself safe, she went out on the terrace. Her husband was there, and she
      said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come with me into the town? I want to buy some things."
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his eyebrows, smiled dimly, and followed her. They walked slowly
      down the hill into the long street of the little town. All the time she
      talked of she knew not what, and all the time she thought: His carriage
      will pass -- his carriage will pass!
    </p>
    <p>
      Several carriages went jingling by. At last he came. Sitting there, and
      staring straight before him, he did not see them. She heard her husband
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hullo! Where is our young friend Lennan off to, with his luggage -- looking
      like a lion cub in trouble?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered in a voice that she tried to make clear and steady:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There must be something wrong; or else it is his sister's wedding."
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt that her husband was gazing at her, and wondered what her face
      was like; but at that moment the word "Madre!" sounded close in her ear
      and they were surrounded by a small drove of 'English Grundys.'
    </p>
    <p>
      XI
    </p>
    <p>
      That twenty mile drive was perhaps the worst part of the journey for the
      boy. It is always hard to sit still and suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Anna left him the night before, he had wandered about in the dark,
      not knowing quite where he went. Then the moon came up, and he found
      himself sitting under the eave of a barn close to a chalet where all was
      dark and quiet; and down below him the moon-whitened valley village -- its
      roofs and spires and little glamorous unreal lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his evening suit, his dark ruffled hair uncovered, he would have made a
      quaint spectacle for the owners of that chalet, if they had chanced to see
      him seated on the hay-strewn boards against their barn, staring before him
      with such wistful rapture. But they were folk to whom sleep was
      precious....
    </p>
    <p>
      And now it was all snatched away from him, relegated to some immensely
      far-off future. Would it indeed be possible to get his guardian to ask
      them down to Hayle? And would they really come? His tutor would surely
      never care to visit a place right away in the country -- far from books
      and everything! He frowned, thinking of his tutor, but it was with
      perplexity -- no other feeling. And yet, if he could not have them down
      there, how could he wait the two whole months till next term began! So
      went his thoughts, round and round, while the horses jogged, dragging him
      further and further from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was better in the train; the distraction of all the strange crowd of
      foreigners, the interest of new faces and new country; and then sleep -- a
      long night of it, snoozed up in his corner, thoroughly fagged out. And
      next day more new country, more new faces; and slowly, his mood changing
      from ache and bewilderment to a sense of something promised, delightful to
      look forward to. Then Calais at last, and a night-crossing in a wet little
      steamer, a summer gale blowing spray in his face, waves leaping white in a
      black sea, and the wild sound of the wind. On again to London, the early
      drive across the town, still sleepy in August haze; an English breakfast -- porridge,
      chops, marmalade. And, at last, the train for home. At all events he could
      write to her, and tearing a page out of his little sketch-book, he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am writing in the train, so please forgive this joggly writing -- "
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he did not know how to go on, for all that he wanted to say was such
      as he had never even dreamed of writing -- things about his feelings
      which would look horrible in words; besides, he must not put anything that
      might not be read, by anyone, so what was there to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has been such a long journey," he wrote at last, "away from the
      Tyrol;" (he did not dare even to put "from you,") "I thought it would
      never end. But at last it has -- very nearly. I have thought a great
      deal about the Tyrol. It was a lovely time -- the loveliest time I have
      ever had. And now it's over, I try to console myself by thinking of the
      future, but not the immediate future -- THAT is not very enjoyable. I
      wonder how the mountains are looking to-day. Please give my love to them,
      especially the lion ones that come and lie out in the moonlight -- you
      will not recognize them from this" -- then followed a sketch. "And this
      is the church we went to, with someone kneeling. And this is meant for the
      'English Grundys,' looking at someone who is coming in very late with an
      alpenstock -- only, I am better at the 'English Grundys' than at the
      person with the alpenstock. I wish I were the 'English Grundys' now, still
      in the Tyrol. I hope I shall get a letter from you soon; and that it will
      say you are getting ready to come back. My guardian will be awfully keen
      for you to come and stay with us. He is not half bad when you know him,
      and there will be his sister, Mrs. Doone, and her daughter left there
      after the wedding. It will be simply disgusting if you and Mr. Stormer
      don't come. I wish I could write all I feel about my lovely time in the
      Tyrol, but you must please imagine it."
     </p>
    <p>
      And just as he had not known how to address her, so he could not tell how
      to subscribe himself, and only put "Mark Lennan."
     </p>
    <p>
      He posted the letter at Exeter, where he had some time to wait; and his
      mind moved still more from past to future. Now that he was nearing home he
      began to think of his sister. In two days she would be gone to Italy; he
      would not see her again for a long time, and a whole crowd of memories
      began to stretch out hands to him. How she and he used to walk together in
      the walled garden, and on the sunk croquet ground; she telling him
      stories, her arm round his neck, because she was two years older, and
      taller than he in those days. Their first talk each holidays, when he came
      back to her; the first tea -- with unlimited jam -- in the old
      mullion-windowed, flower-chintzed schoolroom, just himself and her and old
      Tingle (Miss Tring, the ancient governess, whose chaperonage would now be
      gone), and sometimes that kid Sylvia, when she chanced to be staying there
      with her mother. Cicely had always understood him when he explained to her
      how inferior school was, because nobody took any interest in beasts or
      birds except to kill them; or in drawing, or making things, or anything
      decent. They would go off together, rambling along the river, or up the
      park, where everything looked so jolly and wild -- the ragged
      oak-trees, and huge boulders, of whose presence old Godden, the coachman,
      had said: "I can't think but what these ha' been washed here by the Flood,
      Mast' Mark!" These and a thousand other memories beset his conscience now.
      And as the train drew closer to their station, he eagerly made ready to
      jump out and greet her. There was the honeysuckle full out along the
      paling of the platform over the waiting-room; wonderful, this year -- and
      there was she, standing alone on the platform. No, it was not Cicely! He
      got out with a blank sensation, as if those memories had played him false.
      It was a girl, indeed, but she only looked about sixteen, and wore a
      sunbonnet that hid her hair and half her face. She had on a blue frock,
      and some honeysuckle in her waist-belt. She seemed to be smiling at him,
      and expecting him to smile at her; and so he did smile. She came up to him
      then, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm Sylvia."
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered: "Oh! thanks awfully -- it was awfully good of you to come
      and meet me."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Cicely's so busy. It's only the T-cart. Have you got much luggage?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She took up his hold-all, and he took it from her; she took his bag, and
      he took it from her; then they went out to the T-cart. A small groom stood
      there, holding a silver-roan cob with a black mane and black swish tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "D'you mind if I drive, because I'm learning."
     </p>
    <p>
      And he answered: "Oh, no! rather not."
     </p>
    <p>
      She got up; he noticed that her eyes looked quite excited. Then his
      portmanteau came out and was deposited with the other things behind; and
      he got up beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "Let go, Billy."
     </p>
    <p>
      The roan rushed past the little groom, whose top boots seemed to twinkle
      as he jumped up behind. They whizzed round the corner from the station
      yard, and observing that her mouth was just a little open as though this
      had disconcerted her, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He pulls a bit."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes -- but isn't he perfectly sweet?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "He IS rather decent."
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! when SHE came, he would drive her; they would go off alone in the
      T-cart, and he would show her all the country round.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was re-awakened by the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I know he's going to shy!" At once there was a swerve. The roan was
      cantering.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had passed a pig.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't he look lovely now? Ought I to have whipped him when he shied?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Rather not."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Because horses are horses, and pigs are pigs; it's natural for horses to
      shy at them."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!"
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her then, sidelong. The curve of her cheek and chin looked
      very soft, and rather jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know you, you know!" he said. "You've grown up so awfully."
     </p>
    <p>
      "I knew you at once. Your voice is still furry."
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another silence, till she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does pull, rather -- doesn't he, going home?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I drive?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, please."
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood up and took the reins, and she slipped past under them in front
      of him; her hair smelt exactly like hay, as she was softly bumped against
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept regarding him steadily with very blue eyes, now that she was
      relieved of driving.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cicely was afraid you weren't coming," she said suddenly. "What sort of
      people are those old Stormers?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself grow very red, choked something down, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's only he that's old. She's not more than about thirty-five."
     </p>
    <p>
      "That IS old."
     </p>
    <p>
      He restrained the words: "Of course it's old to a kid like you!" And,
      instead, he looked at her. Was she exactly a kid? She seemed quite tall
      (for a girl) and not very thin, and there was something frank and soft
      about her face, and as if she wanted you to be nice to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she very pretty?"
     </p>
    <p>
      This time he did not go red, such was the disturbance that question made
      in him. If he said: "Yes," it was like letting the world know his
      adoration; but to say anything less would be horrible, disloyal. So he did
      say: "Yes," listening hard to the tone of his own voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought she was. Do you like her very much?" Again he struggled with
      that thing in his throat, and again said: "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to hate this girl, yet somehow could not -- she looked so
      soft and confiding. She was staring before her now, her lips still just
      parted, so evidently THAT had not been because of Bolero's pulling; they
      were pretty all the same, and so was her short, straight little nose, and
      her chin, and she was awfully fair. His thoughts flew back to that other
      face -- so splendid, so full of life. Suddenly he found himself unable
      to picture it -- for the first time since he had started on his journey
      it would not come before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Look!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand was pulling at his arm. There in the field over the hedge a
      buzzard hawk was dropping like a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mark! Oh! Oh! It's got it!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She was covering her face with both her hands, and the hawk, with a young
      rabbit in its claws, was sailing up again. It looked so beautiful that he
      did not somehow feel sorry for the rabbit; but he wanted to stroke and
      comfort her, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right, Sylvia; it really is. The rabbit's dead already, you
      know. And it's quite natural."
     </p>
    <p>
      She took her hands away from a face that looked just as if she were going
      to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little rabbit! It was such a little one!"
     </p>
    <p>
      XII
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of the day following he sat in the smoking-room with a
      prayer book in his hand, and a frown on his forehead, reading the Marriage
      Service. The book had been effectively designed for not spoiling the
      figure when carried in a pocket. But this did not matter, for even if he
      could have read the words, he would not have known what they meant, seeing
      that he was thinking how he could make a certain petition to a certain
      person sitting just behind at a large bureau with a sliding top, examining
      artificial flies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fixed at last upon this form:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gordy!" (Why Gordy no one quite knew now -- whether because his name
      was George, or by way of corruption from Guardian.) "When Cis is gone
      it'll be rather awful, won't it?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit."
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Heatherley was a man of perhaps sixty-four, if indeed guardians have
      ages, and like a doctor rather than a squire; his face square and puffy,
      his eyes always half-closed, and his curly mouth using bluntly a voice of
      that refined coarseness peculiar to people of old family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it will, you know!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Well, supposin' it is?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I only wondered if you'd mind asking Mr. and Mrs. Stormer to come here
      for a little -- they were awfully kind to me out there."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Strange man and woman! My dear fellow!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Stormer likes fishing."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Does he? And what does she like?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Very grateful that his back was turned, the boy said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know -- anything -- she's awfully nice."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Pretty?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered faintly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what YOU call pretty, Gordy."
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt, rather than saw, his guardian scrutinizing him with those
      half-closed eyes under their gouty lids.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right; do as you like. Have 'em here and have done with it, by all
      means."
     </p>
    <p>
      Did his heart jump? Not quite; but it felt warm and happy, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks awfully, Gordy. It's most frightfully decent of you," and turned
      again to the Marriage Service. He could make out some of it. In places it
      seemed to him fine, and in other places queer. About obeying, for
      instance. If you loved anybody, it seemed rotten to expect them to obey
      you. If you loved them and they loved you, there couldn't ever be any
      question of obeying, because you would both do the things always of your
      own accord. And if they didn't love you, or you them, then -- oh! then
      it would be simply too disgusting for anything, to go on living with a
      person you didn't love or who didn't love you. But of course SHE didn't
      love his tutor. Had she once? Those bright doubting eyes, that studiously
      satiric mouth came very clearly up before him. You could not love them;
      and yet -- he was really very decent. A feeling as of pity, almost of
      affection, rose in him for his remote tutor. It was queer to feel so,
      since the last time they had talked together out there, on the terrace, he
      had not felt at all like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of the bureau top sliding down aroused him; Mr. Heatherley was
      closing in the remains of the artificial flies. That meant he would be
      going out to fish. And the moment he heard the door shut, Mark sprang up,
      slid back the bureau top, and began to write his letter. It was hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR MRS. STORMER,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My guardian wishes me to beg you and Mr. Stormer to pay us a visit as
      soon as you come back from the Tyrol. Please tell Mr. Stormer that only
      the very best fishermen -- like him -- can catch our trout; the rest
      catch our trees. This is me catching our trees (here followed a sketch).
      My sister is going to be married to-morrow, and it will be disgusting
      afterwards unless you come. So do come, please. And with my very best
      greetings,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your humble servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. LENNAN."
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had stamped this production and dropped it in the letter-box, he
      had the oddest feeling, as if he had been let out of school; a desire to
      rush about, to frolic. What should he do? Cis, of course, would be busy -- they
      were all busy about the wedding. He would go and saddle Bolero, and jump
      him in the park; or should he go down along the river and watch the jays?
      Both seemed lonely occupations. And he stood in the window -- dejected.
      At the age of five, walking with his nurse, he had been overheard
      remarking: "Nurse, I want to eat a biscuit -- ALL THE WAY I want to eat
      a biscuit!" and it was still rather so with him perhaps -- all the way
      he wanted to eat a biscuit. He bethought him then of his modelling, and
      went out to the little empty greenhouse where he kept his masterpieces.
      They seemed to him now quite horrible -- and two of them, the sheep and
      the turkey, he marked out for summary destruction. The idea occurred to
      him that he might try and model that hawk escaping with the little rabbit;
      but when he tried, no nice feeling came, and flinging the things down he
      went out. He ran along the unweeded path to the tennis ground -- lawn
      tennis was then just coming in. The grass looked very rough. But then,
      everything about that little manor house was left rather wild and anyhow;
      why, nobody quite knew, and nobody seemed to mind. He stood there
      scrutinizing the condition of the ground. A sound of humming came to his
      ears. He got up on the wall. There was Sylvia sitting in the field, making
      a wreath of honeysuckle. He stood very quiet and listened. She looked
      pretty -- lost in her tune. Then he slid down off the wall, and said
      gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked round at him, her eyes very wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your voice is jolly, Sylvia!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "It is. Come and climb a tree!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "In the park, of course."
     </p>
    <p>
      They were some time selecting the tree, many being too easy for him, and
      many too hard for her; but one was found at last, an oak of great age, and
      frequented by rooks. Then, insisting that she must be roped to him, he
      departed to the house for some blind-cord. The climb began at four o'clock -- named
      by him the ascent of the Cimone della Pala. He led the momentous
      expedition, taking a hitch of the blind-cord round a branch before he
      permitted her to move. Two or three times he was obliged to make the cord
      fast and return to help her, for she was not an 'expert'; her arms seemed
      soft, and she was inclined to straddle instead of trusting to one foot.
      But at last they were settled, streaked indeed with moss, on the top
      branch but two. They rested there, silent, listening to the rooks soothing
      an outraged dignity. Save for this slowly subsiding demonstration it was
      marvellously peaceful and remote up there, half-way to a blue sky thinly
      veiled from them by the crinkled brown-green leaves. The peculiar dry
      mossy smell of an oak-tree was disturbed into the air by the least motion
      of their feet or hands against the bark. They could hardly see the ground,
      and all around, other gnarled trees barred off any view.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we stay up here till it's dark we might see owls."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! Owls are horrible!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "What! They're LOVELY -- especially the white ones."
     </p>
    <p>
      "I can't stand their eyes, and they squeak so when they're hunting."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! but that's so jolly, and their eyes are beautiful."
     </p>
    <p>
      "They're always catching mice and little chickens; all sorts of little
      things."
     </p>
    <p>
      "But they don't mean to; they only want them to eat. Don't you think
      things are jolliest at night?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She slipped her arm in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I don't like the dark."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? It's splendid -- when things get mysterious." He dwelt
      lovingly on that word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like mysterious things. They frighten you."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Sylvia!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "No, I like early morning -- especially in spring, when it's beginning
      to get leafy."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Well, of course."
     </p>
    <p>
      She was leaning against him, for safety, just a little; and stretching out
      his arm, he took good hold of the branch to make a back for her. There was
      a silence. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you could only have one tree, which would you have?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Not oaks. Limes -- no -- birches. Which would you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He pondered. There were so many trees that were perfect. Birches and
      limes, of course; but beeches and cypresses, and yews, and cedars, and
      holm-oaks -- almost, and plane-trees; then he said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pines; I mean the big ones with reddish stems and branches pretty high
      up."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he pondered. It was very important to explain exactly why; his
      feelings about everything were concerned in this. And while he mused she
      gazed at him, as if surprised to see anyone think so deeply. At last he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because they're independent and dignified and never quite cold, and their
      branches seem to brood, but chiefly because the ones I mean are generally
      out of the common where you find them. You know -- just one or two,
      strong and dark, standing out against the sky."
     </p>
    <p>
      "They're TOO dark."
     </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to him suddenly that he had forgotten larches. They, of
      course, could be heavenly, when you lay under them and looked up at the
      sky, as he had that afternoon out there. Then he heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could only have one flower, I should have lilies of the valley, the
      small ones that grow wild and smell so jolly."
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a swift vision of another flower, dark -- very different, and
      was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you have, Mark?" Her voice sounded a little hurt. "You ARE
      thinking of one, aren't you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He said honestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Which?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "It's dark, too; you wouldn't care for it a bit."
     </p>
    <p>
      "How d'you know?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "A clove carnation."
     </p>
    <p>
      "But I do like it -- only -- not very much."
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew you wouldn't."
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a silence fell between them. She had ceased to lean against him, and
      he missed the cosy friendliness of it. Now that their voices and the
      cawings of the rooks had ceased, there was nothing heard but the dry
      rustle of the leaves, and the plaintive cry of a buzzard hawk hunting over
      the little tor across the river. There were nearly always two up there,
      quartering the sky. To the boy it was lovely, that silence -- like
      Nature talking to you -- Nature always talked in silences. The beasts,
      the birds, the insects, only really showed themselves when you were still;
      you had to be awfully quiet, too, for flowers and plants, otherwise you
      couldn't see the real jolly separate life there was in them. Even the
      boulders down there, that old Godden thought had been washed up by the
      Flood, never showed you what queer shapes they had, and let you feel close
      to them, unless you were thinking of nothing else. Sylvia, after all, was
      better in that way than he had expected. She could keep quiet (he had
      thought girls hopeless); she was gentle, and it was rather jolly to watch
      her. Through the leaves there came the faint far tinkle of the tea-bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "We must get down."
     </p>
    <p>
      It was much too jolly to go in, really. But if she wanted her tea -- girls
      always wanted tea! And, twisting the cord carefully round the branch, he
      began to superintend her descent. About to follow, he heard her cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mark! I'm stuck -- I'm stuck! I can't reach it with my foot! I'm
      swinging!" And he saw that she WAS swinging by her hands and the cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let go; drop on to the branch below -- the cord'll hold you straight
      till you grab the trunk."
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice mounted piteously:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't -- I really can't -- I should slip!"
     </p>
    <p>
      He tied the cord, and slithered hastily to the branch below her; then,
      bracing himself against the trunk, he clutched her round the waist and
      knees; but the taut cord held her up, and she would not come to anchor. He
      could not hold her and untie the cord, which was fast round her waist. If
      he let her go with one hand, and got out his knife, he would never be able
      to cut and hold her at the same time. For a moment he thought he had
      better climb up again and slack off the cord, but he could see by her face
      that she was getting frightened; he could feel it by the quivering of her
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I heave you up," he said, "can you get hold again above?" And, without
      waiting for an answer, he heaved. She caught hold frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on just for a second."
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, but he saw that her face had gone very white. He
      snatched out his knife and cut the cord. She clung just for that moment,
      then came loose into his arms, and he hauled her to him against the trunk.
      Safe there, she buried her face on his shoulder. He began to murmur to her
      and smooth her softly, with quite a feeling of its being his business to
      smooth her like this, to protect her. He knew she was crying, but she let
      no sound escape, and he was very careful not to show that he knew, for
      fear she should feel ashamed. He wondered if he ought to kiss her. At last
      he did, on the top of her head, very gently. Then she put up her face and
      said she was a beast. And he kissed her again on an eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that she seemed all right, and very gingerly they descended to the
      ground, where shadows were beginning to lengthen over the fern and the sun
      to slant into their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIII
    </p>
    <p>
      The night after the wedding the boy stood at the window of his pleasant
      attic bedroom, with one wall sloping, and a faint smell of mice. He was
      tired and excited, and his brain, full of pictures. This was his first
      wedding, and he was haunted by a vision of his sister's little white form,
      and her face with its starry eyes. She was gone -- his no more! How
      fearful the Wedding March had sounded on that organ -- that awful old
      wheezer; and the sermon! One didn't want to hear that sort of thing when
      one felt inclined to cry. Even Gordy had looked rather boiled when he was
      giving her away. With perfect distinctness he could still see the group
      before the altar rails, just as if he had not been a part of it himself.
      Cis in her white, Sylvia in fluffy grey; his impassive brother-in-law's
      tall figure; Gordy looking queer in a black coat, with a very yellow face,
      and eyes still half-closed. The rotten part of it all had been that you
      wanted to be just FEELING, and you had to be thinking of the ring, and
      your gloves, and whether the lowest button of your white waistcoat was
      properly undone. Girls could do both, it seemed -- Cis seemed to be
      seeing something wonderful all the time, and Sylvia had looked quite holy.
      He himself had been too conscious of the rector's voice, and the sort of
      professional manner with which he did it all, as if he were making up a
      prescription, with directions how to take it. And yet it was all rather
      beautiful in a kind of fashion, every face turned one way, and a
      tremendous hush -- except for poor old Godden's blowing of his nose
      with his enormous red handkerchief; and the soft darkness up in the roof,
      and down in the pews; and the sunlight brightening the South windows. All
      the same, it would have been much jollier just taking hands by themselves
      somewhere, and saying out before God what they really felt -- because,
      after all, God was everything, everywhere, not only in stuffy churches.
      That was how HE would like to be married, out of doors on a starry night
      like this, when everything felt wonderful all round you. Surely God wasn't
      half as small as people seemed always making Him -- a sort of superior
      man a little bigger than themselves! Even the very most beautiful and
      wonderful and awful things one could imagine or make, could only be just
      nothing to a God who had a temple like the night out there. But then you
      couldn't be married alone, and no girl would ever like to be married
      without rings and flowers and dresses, and words that made it all feel
      small and cosy! Cis might have, perhaps, only she wouldn't, because of not
      hurting other people's feelings; but Sylvia -- never -- she would be
      afraid. Only, of course, she was young! And the thread of his thoughts
      broke -- and scattered like beads from a string.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning out, and resting his chin on his hands, he drew the night air into
      his lungs. Honeysuckle, or was it the scent of lilies still? The stars all
      out, and lots of owls to-night -- four at least. What would night be
      like without owls and stars? But that was it -- you never could think
      what things would be like if they weren't just what and where they were.
      You never knew what was coming, either; and yet, when it came, it seemed
      as if nothing else ever could have come. That was queer-you could do
      anything you liked until you'd done it, but when you HAD done it, then you
      knew, of course, that you must always have had to... What was that light,
      below and to the left? Whose room? Old Tingle's -- no, the little spare
      room -- Sylvia's! She must be awake, then! He leaned far out, and
      whispered in the voice she had said was still furry:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sylvia!"
     </p>
    <p>
      The light flickered, he could just see her head appear, with hair all
      loose, and her face turning up to him. He could only half see, half
      imagine it, mysterious, blurry; and he whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't this jolly?"
     </p>
    <p>
      The whisper travelled back:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Awfully."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you sleepy?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "No; are you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Not a bit. D'you hear the owls?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Rather."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't it smell good?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Perfect. Can you see me?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Only just, not too much. Can you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I can't see your nose. Shall I get the candle?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "No -- that'd spoil it. What are you sitting on?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "The window sill."
     </p>
    <p>
      "It doesn't twist your neck, does it?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "No -- o -- only a little bit."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Are you hungry?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Wait half a shake. I'll let down some chocolate in my big bath towel;
      it'll swing along to you -- reach out."
     </p>
    <p>
      A dim white arm reached out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Catch! I say, you won't get cold?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Rather not."
     </p>
    <p>
      "It's too jolly to sleep, isn't it?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Mark!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Which star is yours? Mine is the white one over the top branch of the big
      sycamore, from here."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Mine is that twinkling red one over the summer house. Sylvia!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Catch!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I couldn't -- what was it?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing."
     </p>
    <p>
      "No, but what WAS it?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Only my star. It's caught in your hair."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Listen!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence, then, until her awed whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
     </p>
    <p>
      And his floating down, dying away:
    </p>
    <p>
      "CAVE!"
     </p>
    <p>
      What had stirred -- some window opened? Cautiously he spied along the
      face of the dim house. There was no light anywhere, nor any shifting blur
      of white at her window below. All was dark, remote -- still sweet with
      the scent of something jolly. And then he saw what that something was. All
      over the wall below his window white jessamine was in flower -- stars,
      not only in the sky. Perhaps the sky was really a field of white flowers;
      and God walked there, and plucked the stars....
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning there was a letter on his plate when he came down to
      breakfast. He couldn't open it with Sylvia on one side of him, and old
      Tingle on the other. Then with a sort of anger he did open it. He need not
      have been afraid. It was written so that anyone might have read; it told
      of a climb, of bad weather, said they were coming home. Was he relieved,
      disturbed, pleased at their coming back, or only uneasily ashamed? She had
      not got his second letter yet. He could feel old Tingle looking round at
      him with those queer sharp twinkling eyes of hers, and Sylvia regarding
      him quite frankly. And conscious that he was growing red, he said to
      himself: 'I won't!' And did not. In three days they would be at Oxford.
      Would they come on here at once? Old Tingle was speaking. He heard Sylvia
      answer: "No, I don't like 'bopsies.' They're so hard!" It was their old
      name for high cheekbones. Sylvia certainly had none, her cheeks went
      softly up to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you, Mark?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "On some people."
     </p>
    <p>
      "People who have them are strong-willed, aren't they?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Was SHE -- Anna -- strong-willed? It came to him that he did not
      know at all what she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When breakfast was over and he had got away to his old greenhouse, he had
      a strange, unhappy time. He was a beast, he had not been thinking of her
      half enough! He took the letter out, and frowned at it horribly. Why could
      he not feel more? What was the matter with him? Why was he such a brute -- not
      to be thinking of her day and night? For long he stood, disconsolate, in
      the little dark greenhouse among the images of his beasts, the letter in
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole out presently, and got down to the river unobserved. Comforting -- that
      crisp, gentle sound of water; ever so comforting to sit on a stone, very
      still, and wait for things to happen round you. You lost yourself that
      way, just became branches, and stones, and water, and birds, and sky. You
      did not feel such a beast. Gordy would never understand why he did not
      care for fishing -- one thing trying to catch another -- instead of
      watching and understanding what things were. You never got to the end of
      looking into water, or grass or fern; always something queer and new. It
      was like that, too, with yourself, if you sat down and looked properly -- most
      awfully interesting to see things working in your mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft rain had begun to fall, hissing gently on the leaves, but he had
      still a boy's love of getting wet, and stayed where he was, on the stone.
      Some people saw fairies in woods and down in water, or said they did; that
      did not seem to him much fun. What was really interesting was noticing
      that each thing was different from every other thing, and what made it so;
      you must see that before you could draw or model decently. It was
      fascinating to see your creatures coming out with shapes of their very
      own; they did that without your understanding how. But this vacation he
      was no good -- couldn't draw or model a bit!
    </p>
    <p>
      A jay had settled about forty yards away, and remained in full view,
      attending to his many-coloured feathers. Of all things, birds were the
      most fascinating! He watched it a long time, and when it flew on, followed
      it over the high wall up into the park. He heard the lunch-bell ring in
      the far distance, but did not go in. So long as he was out there in the
      soft rain with the birds and trees and other creatures, he was free from
      that unhappy feeling of the morning. He did not go back till nearly seven,
      properly wet through, and very hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      All through dinner he noticed that Sylvia seemed to be watching him, as if
      wanting to ask him something. She looked very soft in her white frock,
      open at the neck; and her hair almost the colour of special moonlight, so
      goldy-pale; and he wanted her to understand that it wasn't a bit because
      of her that he had been out alone all day. After dinner, when they were
      getting the table ready to play 'red nines,' he did murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you sleep last night -- after?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded fervently to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was raining really hard now, swishing and dripping out in the darkness,
      and he whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our stars would be drowned to-night."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really think we have stars?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "We might. But mine's safe, of course; your hair IS jolly, Sylvia."
     </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him, very sweet and surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIV
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna did not receive the boy's letter in the Tyrol. It followed her to
      Oxford. She was just going out when it came, and she took it up with the
      mingled beatitude and almost sickening tremor that a lover feels touching
      the loved one's letter. She would not open it in the street, but carried
      it all the way to the garden of a certain College, and sat down to read it
      under the cedar-tree. That little letter, so short, boyish, and dry,
      transported her halfway to heaven. She was to see him again at once, not
      to wait weeks, with the fear that he would quite forget her! Her husband
      had said at breakfast that Oxford without 'the dear young clowns'
      assuredly was charming, but Oxford 'full of tourists and other strange
      bodies' as certainly was not. Where should they go? Thank heaven, the
      letter could be shown him! For all that, a little stab of pain went
      through her that there was not one word which made it unsuitable to show.
      Still, she was happy. Never had her favourite College garden seemed so
      beautiful, with each tree and flower so cared for, and the very wind
      excluded; never had the birds seemed so tame and friendly. The sun shone
      softly, even the clouds were luminous and joyful. She sat a long time,
      musing, and went back forgetting all she had come out to do. Having both
      courage and decision, she did not leave the letter to burn a hole in her
      corsets, but gave it to her husband at lunch, looking him in the face, and
      saying carelessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Providence, you see, answers your question."
     </p>
    <p>
      He read it, raised his eyebrows, smiled, and, without looking up,
      murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish to prosecute this romantic episode?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Did he mean anything -- or was it simply his way of putting things?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I naturally want to be anywhere but here."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you would like to go alone?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He said that, of course, knowing she could not say: Yes. And she answered
      simply: "No."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Then let us both go -- on Monday. I will catch the young man's trout;
      thou shalt catch -- h'm! -- he shall catch -- What is it he
      catches -- trees? Good! That's settled."
     </p>
    <p>
      And, three days later, without another word exchanged on the subject, they
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she grateful to him? No. Afraid of him? No. Scornful of him? Not
      quite. But she was afraid of HERSELF, horribly. How would she ever be able
      to keep herself in hand, how disguise from these people that she loved
      their boy? It was her desperate mood that she feared. But since she so
      much wanted all the best for him that life could give, surely she would
      have the strength to do nothing that might harm him. Yet she was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was there at the station to meet them, in riding things and a nice
      rough Norfolk jacket that she did not recognize, though she thought she
      knew his clothes by heart; and as the train came slowly to a standstill
      the memory of her last moment with him, up in his room amid the luggage
      that she had helped to pack, very nearly overcame her. It seemed so hard
      to have to meet him coldly, formally, to have to wait -- who knew how
      long -- for a minute with him alone! And he was so polite, so
      beautifully considerate, with all the manners of a host; hoping she wasn't
      tired, hoping Mr. Stormer had brought his fishing-rod, though they had
      lots, of course, they could lend him; hoping the weather would be fine;
      hoping that they wouldn't mind having to drive three miles, and busying
      himself about their luggage. All this when she just wanted to take him in
      her arms and push his hair back from his forehead, and look at him!
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not drive with them -- he had thought they would be too crowded -- but
      followed, keeping quite close in the dust to point out the scenery,
      mounted on a 'palfrey,' as her husband called the roan with the black
      swish tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      This countryside, so rich and yet a little wild, the independent-looking
      cottages, the old dark cosy manor-house, all was very new to one used to
      Oxford, and to London, and to little else of England. And all was
      delightful. Even Mark's guardian seemed to her delightful. For Gordy, when
      absolutely forced to face an unknown woman, could bring to the encounter a
      certain bluff ingratiation. His sister, too, Mrs. Doone, with her faded
      gentleness, seemed soothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Anna was alone in her room, reached by an unexpected little stairway,
      she stood looking at its carved four-poster bed and the wide lattice
      window with chintz curtains, and the flowers in a blue bowl. Yes, all was
      delightful. And yet! What was it? What had she missed? Ah, she was a fool
      to fret! It was only his anxiety that they should be comfortable, his fear
      that he might betray himself. Out there those last few days -- his
      eyes! And now! She brooded earnestly over what dress she should put on.
      She, who tanned so quickly, had almost lost her sunburn in the week of
      travelling and Oxford. To-day her eyes looked tired, and she was pale. She
      was not going to disdain anything that might help. She had reached
      thirty-six last month, and he would be nineteen to-morrow! She decided on
      black. In black she knew that her neck looked whiter, and the colour of
      her eyes and hair stranger. She put on no jewellery, did not even pin a
      rose at her breast, took white gloves. Since her husband did not come to
      her room, she went up the little stairway to his. She surprised him ready
      dressed, standing by the fireplace, smiling faintly. What was he thinking
      of, standing there with that smile? Was there blood in him at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      He inclined his head slightly and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! Chaste as the night! Black suits you. Shall we find our way down to
      these savage halls?"
     </p>
    <p>
      And they went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was already there, waiting. A single neighbouring squire and
      magistrate, by name Trusham, had been bidden, to make numbers equal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was announced; they went in. At the round table in a dining-room,
      all black oak, with many candles, and terrible portraits of departed
      ancestors, Anna sat between the magistrate and Gordy. Mark was opposite,
      between a quaint-looking old lady and a young girl who had not been
      introduced, a girl in white, with very fair hair and very white skin, blue
      eyes, and lips a little parted; a daughter evidently of the faded Mrs.
      Doone. A girl like a silvery moth, like a forget-me-not! Anna found it
      hard to take her eyes away from this girl's face; not that she admired her
      exactly; pretty she was -- yes; but weak, with those parted lips and
      soft chin, and almost wistful look, as if her deep-blue half-eager eyes
      were in spite of her. But she was young -- so young! That was why not
      to watch her seemed impossible. "Sylvia Doone?" Indeed! Yes. A soft name,
      a pretty name -- and very like her! Every time her eyes could travel
      away from her duty to Squire Trusham, and to Gordy (on both of whom she
      was clearly making an impression), she gazed at this girl, sitting there
      by the boy, and whenever those two young things smiled and spoke together
      she felt her heart contract and hurt her. Was THIS why that something had
      gone out of his eyes? Ah, she was foolish! If every girl or woman the boy
      knew was to cause such a feeling in her, what would life be like? And her
      will hardened against her fears. She was looking brilliant herself; and
      she saw that the girl in her turn could not help gazing at her eagerly,
      wistfully, a little bewildered -- hatefully young. And the boy? Slowly,
      surely, as a magnet draws, Anna could feel that she was drawing him, could
      see him stealing chances to look at her. Once she surprised him full. What
      troubled eyes! It was not the old adoring face; yet she knew from its
      expression that she could make him want her -- make him jealous -- easily
      fire him with her kisses, if she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the dinner wore to an end. Then came the moment when the girl and she
      must meet under the eyes of the mother, and that sharp, quaint-looking old
      governess. It would be a hard moment, that! And it came -- a hard
      moment and a long one, for Gordy sat full span over his wine. But Anna had
      not served her time beneath the gaze of upper Oxford for nothing; she
      managed to be charming, full of interest and questions in her still rather
      foreign accent. Miss Doone -- soon she became Sylvia -- must show
      her all the treasures and antiquities. Was it too dark to go out just to
      look at the old house by night? Oh, no. Not a bit. There were goloshes in
      the hall. And they went, the girl leading, and talking of Anna knew not
      what, so absorbed was she in thinking how for a moment, just a moment, she
      could contrive to be with the boy alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not remarkable, this old house, but it was his home -- might
      some day perhaps be his. And houses at night were strangely alive with
      their window eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my room," the girl said, "where the jessamine is -- you can
      just see it. Mark's is above -- look, under where the eave hangs out,
      away to the left. The other night -- "
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; the other night?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't -- ! Listen. That's an owl. We have heaps of owls. Mark
      likes them. I don't, much."
     </p>
    <p>
      Always Mark!
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's awfully keen, you see, about all beasts and birds -- he models
      them. Shall I show you his workshop? -- it's an old greenhouse. Here,
      you can see in."
     </p>
    <p>
      There through the glass Anna indeed could just see the boy's quaint
      creations huddling in the dark on a bare floor, a grotesque company of
      small monsters. She murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I see them, but I won't really look unless he brings me himself."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he's sure to. They interest him more than anything in the world."
     </p>
    <p>
      For all her cautious resolutions Anna could not for the life of her help
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, more than you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave her a wistful stare before she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I don't count much."
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna laughed, and took her arm. How soft and young it felt! A pang went
      through her heart, half jealous, half remorseful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know," she said, "that you are very sweet?"
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you his cousin?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "No. Gordy is only Mark's uncle by marriage; my mother is Gordy's sister -- so
      I'm nothing."
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see -- just what you English call 'a connection.'"
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent, seeming to examine the night; then the girl said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to see you awfully. You're not like what I thought."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! And what DID you think?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you would have dark eyes, and Venetian red hair, and not be
      quite so tall. Of course, I haven't any imagination."
     </p>
    <p>
      They were at the door again when the girl said that, and the hall light
      was falling on her; her slip of a white figure showed clear. Young -- how
      young she looked! Everything she said -- so young!
    </p>
    <p>
      And Anna murmured: "And you are -- more than I thought, too."
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the men came out from the dining-room; her husband with the look
      on his face that denoted he had been well listened to; Squire Trusham
      laughing as a man does who has no sense of humour; Gordy having a curly,
      slightly asphyxiated air; and the boy his pale, brooding look, as though
      he had lost touch with his surroundings. He wavered towards her, seemed to
      lose himself, went and sat down by the old governess. Was it because he
      did not dare to come up to her, or only because he saw the old lady
      sitting alone? It might well be that.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the evening, so different from what she had dreamed of, closed in.
      Squire Trusham was gone in his high dog-cart, with his famous mare whose
      exploits had entertained her all through dinner. Her candle had been given
      her; she had said good-night to all but Mark. What should she do when she
      had his hand in hers? She would be alone with him in that grasp, whose
      strength no one could see. And she did not know whether to clasp it
      passionately, or to let it go coolly back to its owner; whether to claim
      him or to wait. But she was unable to help pressing it feverishly. At once
      in his face she saw again that troubled look; and her heart smote her. She
      let it go, and that she might not see him say good-night to the girl,
      turned and mounted to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fully dressed, she flung herself on the bed, and there lay, her
      handkerchief across her mouth, gnawing at its edges.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mark's nineteenth birthday rose in grey mist, slowly dropped its veil to
      the grass, and shone clear and glistening. He woke early. From his window
      he could see nothing in the steep park but the soft blue-grey,
      balloon-shaped oaks suspended one above the other among the round-topped
      boulders. It was in early morning that he always got his strongest feeling
      of wanting to model things; then and after dark, when, for want of light,
      it was no use. This morning he had the craving badly, and the sense of not
      knowing how weighed down his spirit. His drawings, his models -- they
      were all so bad, so fumbly. If only this had been his twenty-first
      birthday, and he had his money, and could do what he liked. He would not
      stay in England. He would be off to Athens, or Rome, or even to Paris, and
      work till he COULD do something. And in his holidays he would study
      animals and birds in wild countries where there were plenty of them, and
      you could watch them in their haunts. It was stupid having to stay in a
      place like Oxford; but at the thought of what Oxford meant, his roaming
      fancy, like a bird hypnotized by a hawk, fluttered, stayed suspended, and
      dived back to earth. And that feeling of wanting to make things suddenly
      left him. It was as though he had woken up, his real self; then -- lost
      that self again. Very quietly he made his way downstairs. The garden door
      was not shuttered, not even locked -- it must have been forgotten
      overnight. Last night! He had never thought he would feel like this when
      she came -- so bewildered, and confused; drawn towards her, but by
      something held back. And he felt impatient, angry with himself, almost
      with her. Why could he not be just simply happy, as this morning was
      happy? He got his field-glasses and searched the meadow that led down to
      the river. Yes, there were several rabbits out. With the white marguerites
      and the dew cobwebs, it was all moon-flowery and white; and the rabbits
      being there made it perfect. He wanted one badly to model from, and for a
      moment was tempted to get his rook rifle -- but what was the good of a
      dead rabbit -- besides, they looked so happy! He put the glasses down
      and went towards his greenhouse to get a drawing block, thinking to sit on
      the wall and make a sort of Midsummer Night's Dream sketch of flowers and
      rabbits. Someone was there, bending down and doing something to his
      creatures. Who had the cheek? Why, it was Sylvia -- in her
      dressing-gown! He grew hot, then cold, with anger. He could not bear
      anyone in that holy place! It was hateful to have his things even looked
      at; and she -- she seemed to be fingering them. He pulled the door open
      with a jerk, and said: "What are you doing?" He was indeed so stirred by
      righteous wrath that he hardly noticed the gasp she gave, and the collapse
      of her figure against the wall. She ran past him, and vanished without a
      word. He went up to his creatures and saw that she had placed on the head
      of each one of them a little sprig of jessamine flower. Why! It was
      idiotic! He could see nothing at first but the ludicrousness of flowers on
      the heads of his beasts! Then the desperation of this attempt to imagine
      something graceful, something that would give him pleasure touched him;
      for he saw now that this was a birthday decoration. From that it was only
      a second before he was horrified with himself. Poor little Sylvia! What a
      brute he was! She had plucked all that jessamine, hung out of her window
      and risked falling to get hold of it; and she had woken up early and come
      down in her dressing-gown just to do something that she thought he would
      like! Horrible -- what he had done! Now, when it was too late, he saw,
      only too clearly, her startled white face and quivering lips, and the way
      she had shrunk against the wall. How pretty she had looked in her
      dressing-gown with her hair all about her, frightened like that! He would
      do anything now to make up to her for having been such a perfect beast!
      The feeling, always a little with him, that he must look after her -- dating,
      no doubt, from days when he had protected her from the bulls that were not
      there; and the feeling of her being so sweet and decent to him always; and
      some other feeling too -- all these suddenly reached poignant climax.
      He simply must make it up to her! He ran back into the house and stole
      upstairs. Outside her room he listened with all his might, but could hear
      nothing; then tapped softly with one nail, and, putting his mouth to the
      keyhole, whispered: "Sylvia!" Again and again he whispered her name. He
      even tried the handle, meaning to open the door an inch, but it was
      bolted. Once he thought he heard a noise like sobbing, and this made him
      still more wretched. At last he gave it up; she would not come, would not
      be consoled. He deserved it, he knew, but it was very hard. And dreadfully
      dispirited he went up to his room, took a bit of paper, and tried to
      write:
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAREST SYLVIA,
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was most awfully sweet of you to put your stars on my beasts. It was
      just about the most sweet thing you could have done. I am an awful brute,
      but, of course, if I had only known what you were doing, I should have
      loved it. Do forgive me; I deserve it, I know -- only it IS my
      birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your sorrowful
    </p>
    <p>
      "MARK."
     </p>
    <p>
      He took this down, slipped it under her door, tapped so that she might
      notice it, and stole away. It relieved his mind a little, and he went
      downstairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the greenhouse, sitting on a stool, he ruefully contemplated those
      chapletted beasts. They consisted of a crow, a sheep, a turkey, two doves,
      a pony, and sundry fragments. She had fastened the jessamine sprigs to the
      tops of their heads by a tiny daub of wet clay, and had evidently been
      surprised trying to put a sprig into the mouth of one of the doves, for it
      hung by a little thread of clay from the beak. He detached it and put it
      in his buttonhole. Poor little Sylvia! she took things awfully to heart.
      He would be as nice as ever he could to her all day. And, balancing on his
      stool, he stared fixedly at the wall against which she had fallen back;
      the line of her soft chin and throat seemed now to be his only memory. It
      was very queer how he could see nothing but that, the way the throat
      moved, swallowed -- so white, so soft. And HE had made it go like that!
      It seemed an unconscionable time till breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the hour approached he haunted the hall, hoping she might be first
      down. At last he heard footsteps, and waited, hidden behind the door of
      the empty dining-room, lest at sight of him she should turn back. He had
      rehearsed what he was going to do -- bend down and kiss her hand and
      say: "Dulcinea del Toboso is the most beautiful lady in the world, and I
      the most unfortunate knight upon the earth," from his favourite passage
      out of his favourite book, 'Don Quixote.' She would surely forgive him
      then, and his heart would no longer hurt him. Certainly she could never go
      on making him so miserable if she knew his feelings! She was too soft and
      gentle for that. Alas! it was not Sylvia who came; but Anna, fresh from
      sleep, with her ice-green eyes and bright hair; and in sudden strange
      antipathy to her, that strong, vivid figure, he stood dumb. And this first
      lonely moment, which he had so many times in fancy spent locked in her
      arms, passed without even a kiss; for quickly one by one the others came.
      But of Sylvia only news through Mrs. Doone that she had a headache, and
      was staying in bed. Her present was on the sideboard, a book called
      'Sartor Resartus.' "Mark -- from Sylvia, August 1st, 1880," together
      with Gordy's cheque, Mrs. Doone's pearl pin, old Tingle's 'Stones of
      Venice,' and one other little parcel wrapped in tissue-paper -- four
      ties of varying shades of green, red, and blue, hand-knitted in silk -- a
      present of how many hours made short by the thought that he would wear the
      produce of that clicking. He did not fail in outer gratitude, but did he
      realize what had been knitted into those ties? Not then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birthdays, like Christmas days, were made for disenchantment. Always the
      false gaiety of gaiety arranged -- always that pistol to the head:
      'Confound you! enjoy yourself!' How could he enjoy himself with the
      thought of Sylvia in her room, made ill by his brutality! The vision of
      her throat working, swallowing her grief, haunted him like a little white,
      soft spectre all through the long drive out on to the moor, and the picnic
      in the heather, and the long drive home -- haunted him so that when
      Anna touched or looked at him he had no spirit to answer, no spirit even
      to try and be with her alone, but almost a dread of it instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when at last they were at home again, and she whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? What have I done?" he could only mutter:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing! Oh, nothing! It's only that I've been a brute!"
     </p>
    <p>
      At that enigmatic answer she might well search his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it my husband?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He could answer that, at all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, then? Tell me."
     </p>
    <p>
      They were standing in the inner porch, pretending to examine the ancestral
      chart -- dotted and starred with dolphins and little full-rigged
      galleons sailing into harbours -- which always hung just there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, Mark; I don't like to suffer!"
     </p>
    <p>
      What could he say, since he did not know himself? He stammered, tried to
      speak, could not get anything out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it that girl?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Startled, he looked away, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not."
     </p>
    <p>
      She shivered, and went into the house. But he stayed, staring at the chart
      with a dreadful stirred-up feeling -- of shame and irritation, pity,
      impatience, fear, all mixed. What had he done, said, lost? It was that
      horrid feeling of when one has not been kind and not quite true, yet might
      have been kinder if one had been still less true. Ah! but it was all so
      mixed up. It felt all bleak, too, and wintry in him, as if he had suddenly
      lost everybody's love. Then he was conscious of his tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! friend Lennan -- looking deeply into the past from the less
      romantic present? Nice things, those old charts. The dolphins are
      extremely jolly."
     </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to remember not to be ill-mannered then. Why did Stormer
      jeer like that? He just managed to answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir; I wish we had some now."
     </p>
    <p>
      "There are so many moons we wish for, Lennan, and they none of them come
      tumbling down."
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice was almost earnest, and the boy's resentment fled. He felt
      sorry, but why he did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the meantime," he heard his tutor say, "let us dress for dinner."
     </p>
    <p>
      When he came down to the drawing-room, Anna in her moonlight-coloured
      frock was sitting on the sofa talking to -- Sylvia. He kept away from
      them; they could neither of them want him. But it did seem odd to him, who
      knew not too much concerning women, that she could be talking so gaily,
      when only half an hour ago she had said: "Is it that girl?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat next her at dinner. Again it was puzzling that she should be
      laughing so serenely at Gordy's stories. Did the whispering in the porch,
      then, mean nothing? And Sylvia would not look at him; he felt sure that
      she turned her eyes away simply because she knew he was going to look in
      her direction. And this roused in him a sore feeling -- everything that
      night seemed to rouse that feeling -- of injustice; he was cast out,
      and he could not tell why. He had not meant to hurt either of them! Why
      should they both want to hurt him so? And presently there came to him a
      feeling that he did not care: Let them treat him as they liked! There were
      other things besides love! If they did not want him -- he did not want
      them! And he hugged this reckless, unhappy, don't-care feeling to him with
      all the abandonment of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even birthdays come to an end. And moods and feelings that seem so
      desperately real die in the unreality of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      XVI
    </p>
    <p>
      If to the boy that birthday was all bewildered disillusionment, to Anna it
      was verily slow torture; SHE found no relief in thinking that there were
      things in life other than love. But next morning brought readjustment, a
      sense of yesterday's extravagance, a renewal of hope. Impossible surely
      that in one short fortnight she had lost what she had made so sure of! She
      had only to be resolute. Only to grasp firmly what was hers. After all
      these empty years was she not to have her hour? To sit still meekly and
      see it snatched from her by a slip of a soft girl? A thousand times, no!
      And she watched her chance. She saw him about noon sally forth towards the
      river, with his rod. She had to wait a little, for Gordy and his bailiff
      were down there by the tennis lawn, but they soon moved on. She ran out
      then to the park gate. Once through that she felt safe; her husband, she
      knew, was working in his room; the girl somewhere invisible; the old
      governess still at her housekeeping; Mrs. Doone writing letters. She felt
      full of hope and courage. This old wild tangle of a park, that she had not
      yet seen, was beautiful -- a true trysting-place for fauns and nymphs,
      with its mossy trees and boulders and the high bracken. She kept along
      under the wall in the direction of the river, but came to no gate, and
      began to be afraid that she was going wrong. She could hear the river on
      the other side, and looked for some place where she could climb and see
      exactly where she was. An old ash-tree tempted her. Scrambling up into its
      fork, she could just see over. There was the little river within twenty
      yards, its clear dark water running between thick foliage. On its bank lay
      a huge stone balanced on another stone still more huge. And with his back
      to this stone stood the boy, his rod leaning beside him. And there, on the
      ground, her arms resting on her knees, her chin on her hands, that girl
      sat looking up. How eager his eyes now -- how different from the
      brooding eyes of yesterday!
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you see, that was all. You might forgive me, Sylvia!"
     </p>
    <p>
      And to Anna it seemed verily as if those two young faces formed suddenly
      but one -- the face of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had stayed there looking for all time, she could not have had
      graven on her heart a vision more indelible. Vision of Spring, of all that
      was gone from her for ever! She shrank back out of the fork of the old
      ash-tree, and, like a stricken beast, went hurrying, stumbling away,
      amongst the stones and bracken. She ran thus perhaps a quarter of a mile,
      then threw up her arms, fell down amongst the fern, and lay there on her
      face. At first her heart hurt her so that she felt nothing but that
      physical pain. If she could have died! But she knew it was nothing but
      breathlessness. It left her, and that which took its place she tried to
      drive away by pressing her breast against the ground, by clutching the
      stalks of the bracken -- an ache, an emptiness too dreadful! Youth to
      youth! He was gone from her -- and she was alone again! She did not
      cry. What good in crying? But gusts of shame kept sweeping through her;
      shame and rage. So this was all she was worth! The sun struck hot on her
      back in that lair of tangled fern, where she had fallen; she felt faint
      and sick. She had not known till now quite what this passion for the boy
      had meant to her; how much of her very belief in herself was bound up with
      it; how much clinging to her own youth. What bitterness! One soft slip of
      a white girl -- one YOUNG thing -- and she had become as nothing!
      But was that true? Could she not even now wrench him back to her with the
      passion that this child knew nothing of! Surely! Oh, surely! Let him but
      once taste the rapture she could give him! And at that thought she ceased
      clutching at the bracken stalks, lying as still as the very stones around
      her. Could she not? Might she not, even now? And all feeling, except just
      a sort of quivering, deserted her -- as if she had fallen into a
      trance. Why spare this girl? Why falter? She was first! He had been hers
      out there. And she still had the power to draw him. At dinner the first
      evening she had dragged his gaze to her, away from that girl -- away
      from youth, as a magnet draws steel. She could still bind him with chains
      that for a little while at all events he would not want to break! Bind
      him? Hateful word! Take him, hankering after what she could not give him -- youth,
      white innocence, Spring? It would be infamous, infamous! She sprang up
      from the fern, and ran along the hillside, not looking where she went,
      stumbling among the tangled growth, in and out of the boulders, till she
      once more sank breathless on to a stone. It was bare of trees just here,
      and she could see, across the river valley, the high larch-crowned tor on
      the far side. The sky was clear -- the sun bright. A hawk was wheeling
      over that hill; far up, very near the blue! Infamous! She could not do
      that! Could not drug him, drag him to her by his senses, by all that was
      least high in him, when she wished for him all the finest things that life
      could give, as if she had been his mother. She could not. It would be
      wicked! In that moment of intense spiritual agony, those two down there in
      the sun, by the grey stone and the dark water, seemed guarded from her,
      protected. The girl's white flower-face trembling up, the boy's gaze
      leaping down! Strange that a heart which felt that, could hate at the same
      moment that flower-face, and burn to kill with kisses that eagerness in
      the boy's eyes. The storm in her slowly passed. And she prayed just to
      feel nothing. It was natural that she should lose her hour! Natural that
      her thirst should go unslaked, and her passion never bloom; natural that
      youth should go to youth, this boy to his own kind, by the law of -- love.
      The breeze blowing down the valley fanned her cheeks, and brought her a
      faint sensation of relief. Nobility! Was it just a word? Or did those that
      gave up happiness feel noble?
    </p>
    <p>
      She wandered for a long time in the park. Not till late afternoon did she
      again pass out by the gate, through which she had entered, full of hope.
      She met no one before she reached her room; and there, to be safe, took
      refuge in her bed. She dreaded only lest the feeling of utter weariness
      should leave her. She wanted no vigour of mind or body till she was away
      from here. She meant neither to eat nor drink; only to sleep, if she
      could. To-morrow, if there were any early train, she could be gone before
      she need see anyone; her husband must arrange. As to what he would think,
      and she could say -- time enough to decide that. And what did it
      matter? The one vital thing now was not to see the boy, for she could not
      again go through hours of struggle like those. She rang the bell, and sent
      the startled maid with a message to her husband. And while she waited for
      him to come, her pride began revolting. She must not let him see. That
      would be horrible. And slipping out of bed she got a handkerchief and the
      eau-de-Cologne flask, and bandaged her forehead. He came almost instantly,
      entering in his quick, noiseless way, and stood looking at her. He did not
      ask what was the matter, but simply waited. And never before had she
      realized so completely how he began, as it were, where she left off; began
      on a plane from which instinct and feeling were as carefully ruled out as
      though they had been blasphemous. She summoned all her courage, and said:
      "I went into the park; the sun must have been too hot. I should like to go
      home to-morrow, if you don't mind. I can't bear not feeling well in other
      people's houses."
     </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of a smile flickering over his face; then it grew grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" he said; "yes. The sun, a touch of that will last some days. Will
      you be fit to travel, though?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She had a sudden conviction that he knew all about it, but that -- since
      to know all about it was to feel himself ridiculous -- he had the power
      of making himself believe that he knew nothing. Was this fine of him, or
      was it hateful?
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My head is bad, but I SHALL be able. Only I don't want a fuss made. Could
      we go by a train before they are down?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard him say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. That will have its advantages."
     </p>
    <p>
      There was not the faintest sound now, but of course he was still there. In
      that dumb, motionless presence was all her future. Yes, that would be her
      future -- a thing without feeling, and without motion. A fearful
      curiosity came on her to look at it. She opened her gaze. He was still
      standing just as he had been, his eyes fixed on her. But one hand, on the
      edge of his coat pocket -- out of the picture, as it were -- was
      nervously closing and unclosing. And suddenly she felt pity. Not for her
      future -- which must be like that; but for him. How dreadful to have
      grown so that all emotion was exiled -- how dreadful! And she said
      gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry, Harold."
     </p>
    <p>
      As if he had heard something strange and startling, his eyes dilated in a
      curious way, he buried that nervous hand in his pocket, turned, and went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      XVII
    </p>
    <p>
      When young Mark came on Sylvia by the logan-stone, it was less surprising
      to him than if he had not known she was there -- having watched her go.
      She was sitting, all humped together, brooding over the water, her
      sunbonnet thrown back; and that hair, in which his star had caught,
      shining faint-gold under the sun. He came on her softly through the grass,
      and, when he was a little way off, thought it best to halt. If he startled
      her she might run away, and he would not have the heart to follow. How
      still she was, lost in her brooding! He wished he could see her face. He
      spoke at last, gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sylvia!... Would you mind?"
     </p>
    <p>
      And, seeing that she did not move, he went up to her. Surely she could not
      still be angry with him!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks most awfully for that book you gave me -- it looks splendid!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer. And leaning his rod against the stone, he sighed. That
      silence of hers seemed to him unjust; what was it she wanted him to say or
      do? Life was not worth living, if it was to be all bottled up like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never meant to hurt you. I hate hurting people. It's only that my
      beasts are so bad -- I can't bear people to see them -- especially
      you -- I want to please you -- I do really. So, you see, that was
      all. You MIGHT forgive me, Sylvia!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Something over the wall, a rustling, a scattering in the fern -- deer,
      no doubt! And again he said eagerly, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might be nice to me, Sylvia; you really might."
     </p>
    <p>
      Very quickly, turning her head away, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't that any more. It's -- it's something else."
     </p>
    <p>
      "What else?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing -- only, that I don't count -- now -- "
     </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down beside her. What did she mean? But he knew well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, you count! Most awfully! Oh, don't be unhappy! I hate people
      being unhappy. Don't be unhappy, Sylvia!" And he began gently to stroke
      her arm. It was all strange and troubled within him; one thing only plain -- he
      must not admit anything! As if reading that thought, her blue eyes seemed
      suddenly to search right into him. Then she pulled some blades of grass,
      and began plaiting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "SHE counts."
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! He was not going to say: She doesn't! It would be caddish to say that.
      Even if she didn't count -- Did she still? -- it would be mean and
      low. And in his eyes just then there was the look that had made his tutor
      compare him to a lion cub in trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia was touching his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mark!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Don't!"
     </p>
    <p>
      He got up and took his rod. What was the use? He could not stay there with
      her, since he could not -- must not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Are you angry? PLEASE don't be angry with me."
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt a choke in his throat, bent down to her hand, and kissed it; then
      shouldered his rod, and marched away. Looking back once, he saw her still
      sitting there, gazing after him, forlorn, by that great stone. It seemed
      to him, then, there was nowhere he could go; nowhere except among the
      birds and beasts and trees, who did not mind even if you were all mixed up
      and horrible inside. He lay down in the grass on the bank. He could see
      the tiny trout moving round and round the stones; swallows came all about
      him, flying very low; a hornet, too, bore him company for a little. But he
      could take interest in nothing; it was as if his spirit were in prison. It
      would have been nice, indeed, to be that water, never staying, passing,
      passing; or wind, touching everything, never caught. To be able to do
      nothing without hurting someone -- that was what was so ghastly. If
      only one were like a flower, that just sprang up and lived its life all to
      itself, and died. But whatever he did, or said now, would be like telling
      lies, or else being cruel. The only thing was to keep away from people.
      And yet how keep away from his own guests?
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back to the house for lunch, but both those guests were out, no
      one seemed quite to know where. Restless, unhappy, puzzled, he wandered
      round and about all the afternoon. Just before dinner he was told of Mrs.
      Stormer's not being well, and that they would be leaving to-morrow. Going -- after
      three days! That plunged him deeper into his strange and sorrowful
      confusion. He was reduced now to a complete brooding silence. He knew he
      was attracting attention, but could not help it. Several times during
      dinner he caught Gordy's eyes fixed on him, from under those puffy
      half-closed lids, with asphyxiated speculation. But he simply COULD not
      talk -- everything that came into his mind to say seemed false. Ah! it
      was a sad evening -- with its glimmering vision into another's sore
      heart, its confused gnawing sense of things broken, faith betrayed; and
      yet always the perplexed wonder -- "How could I have helped it?" And
      always Sylvia's wistful face that he tried not to look at.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole out, leaving Gordy and his tutor still over their wine, and
      roamed about the garden a long time, listening sadly to the owls. It was a
      blessing to get upstairs, though of course he would not sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did sleep, all through a night of many dreams, in the last of which
      he was lying on a mountain side, Anna looking down into his eyes, and
      bending her face to his. He woke just as her lips touched him. Still under
      the spell of that troubling dream, he became conscious of the sound of
      wheels and horses' hoofs on the gravel, and sprang out of bed. There was
      the waggonette moving from the door, old Godden driving, luggage piled up
      beside him, and the Stormers sitting opposite each other in the carriage.
      Going away like that -- having never even said good-bye! For a moment
      he felt as people must when they have unwittingly killed someone -- utterly
      stunned and miserable. Then he dashed into his clothes. He would not let
      her go thus! He would -- he must -- see her again! What had he done
      that she should go like this? He rushed downstairs. The hall was empty;
      nineteen minutes to eight! The train left at eight o'clock. Had he time to
      saddle Bolero? He rushed round to the stables; but the cob was out, being
      shoed. He would -- he must get there in time. It would show her anyway
      that he was not quite a cad. He walked till the drive curved, then began
      running hard. A quarter of a mile, and already he felt better, not so
      miserable and guilty; it was something to feel you had a tough job in
      hand, all your work cut out -- something to have to think of
      economizing strength, picking out the best going, keeping out of the sun,
      saving your wind uphill, flying down any slope. It was cool still, and the
      dew had laid the dust; there was no traffic and scarcely anyone to look
      back and gape as he ran by. What he would do, if he got there in time -- how
      explain this mad three-mile run -- he did not think. He passed a farm
      that he knew was just half-way. He had left his watch. Indeed, he had put
      on only his trousers, shirt, and Norfolk jacket; no tie, no hat, not even
      socks under his tennis shoes, and he was as hot as fire, with his hair
      flying back -- a strange young creature indeed for anyone to meet. But
      he had lost now all feeling, save the will to get there. A flock of sheep
      came out of a field into the lane. He pushed through them somehow, but
      they lost him several seconds. More than a mile still; and he was blown,
      and his legs beginning to give! Downhill indeed they went of their own
      accord, but there was the long run-in, quite level; and he could hear the
      train, now slowly puffing its way along the valley. Then, in spite of
      exhaustion, his spirit rose. He would not go in looking like a scarecrow,
      utterly done, and make a scene. He must pull himself together at the end,
      and stroll in -- as if he had come for fun. But how -- seeing that
      at any moment he felt he might fall flat in the dust, and stay there for
      ever! And, as he ran, he made little desperate efforts to mop his face,
      and brush his clothes. There were the gates, at last -- two hundred
      yards away. The train, he could hear no longer. It must be standing in the
      station. And a sob came from his overdriven lungs. He heard the guard's
      whistle as he reached the gates. Instead of making for the booking-office,
      he ran along the paling, where an entrance to the goods'-shed was open,
      and dashing through he fell back against the honeysuckle. The engine was
      just abreast of him; he snatched at his sleeve and passed it over his
      face, to wipe the sweat away. Everything was blurred. He must see -- surely
      he had not come in time just not to see! He pushed his hands over his
      forehead and hair, and spied up dizzily at the slowly passing train. She
      was there, at a window! Standing, looking out! He dared not step forward,
      for fear of falling, but he put out his hand -- She saw him. Yes, she
      saw him! Wasn't she going to make a sign? Not one? And suddenly he saw her
      tear at her dress, pluck something out, and throw it. It fell close to his
      feet. He did not pick it up -- he wanted to see her face till she was
      gone. It looked wonderful -- very proud, and pale. She put her hand up
      to her lips. Then everything went blurred again and when he could see once
      more, the train had vanished. But at his feet was what she had thrown. He
      picked it up! All dry and dark, it was the flower she had given him in the
      Tyrol, and stolen back from his buttonhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creeping out, past the goods'-shed, he made his way to a field, and lay
      down with his face pressed to that withered thing which still had its
      scent....
    </p>
    <p>
      The asphyxiated speculation in his guardian's eyes had not been without
      significance. Mark did not go back to Oxford. He went instead to Rome -- to
      live in his sister's house, and attend a school of sculpture. That was the
      beginning of a time when nothing counted except his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Anna he wrote twice, but received no answer. From his tutor he had one
      little note:
    </p>
    <p>
      "MY DEAR LENNAN,
    </p>
    <p>
      "So! You abandon us for Art? Ah! well -- it was your moon, if I
      remember -- one of them. A worthy moon -- a little dusty in these
      days -- a little in her decline -- but to you no doubt a virgin
      goddess, whose hem, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall retain the friendliest memories of you in spite of your
      defection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once your tutor and still your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      "HAROLD STORMER."
     </p>
    <p>
      After that vacation it was long -- very long before he saw Sylvia
      again.

    <h2>
      PART II -- SUMMER
    </h2>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      Gleam of a thousand lights; clack and mutter of innumerable voices,
      laughter, footsteps; hiss and rumble of passing trains taking gamblers
      back to Nice or Mentone; fevered wailing from the violins of four fiddlers
      with dark-white skins outside the cafe; and above, around, beyond, the
      dark sky, and the dark mountains, and the dark sea, like some great dark
      flower to whose heart is clinging a jewelled beetle. So was Monte Carlo on
      that May night of 1887.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mark Lennan, at one of the little marble-topped tables, was in too
      great maze and exaltation of spirit and of senses to be conscious of its
      glare and babel, even of its beauty. He sat so very still that his
      neighbours, with the instinctive aversion of the human creature to what is
      too remote from its own mood, after one good stare, turned their eyes
      away, as from something ludicrous, almost offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was lost, indeed, in memory of the minutes just gone by. For it had
      come at last, after all these weeks of ferment, after all this strange
      time of perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very stealthily it had been creeping on him, ever since that chance
      introduction nearly a year ago, soon after he settled down in London,
      following those six years of Rome and Paris. First the merest
      friendliness, because she was so nice about his work; then respectful
      admiration, because she was so beautiful; then pity, because she was so
      unhappy in her marriage. If she had been happy, he would have fled. The
      knowledge that she had been unhappy long before he knew her had kept his
      conscience still. And at last one afternoon she said: "Ah! if you come out
      there too!" Marvelously subtle, the way that one little outslipped saying
      had worked in him, as though it had a life of its own -- like a strange
      bird that had flown into the garden of his heart, and established itself
      with its new song and flutterings, its new flight, its wistful and ever
      clearer call. That and one moment, a few days later in her London
      drawing-room, when he had told her that he WAS coming, and she did not,
      could not, he felt, look at him. Queer, that nothing momentous said, done -- or
      even left undone -- had altered all the future!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so she had gone with her uncle and aunt, under whose wing one might be
      sure she would meet with no wayward or exotic happenings. And he had
      received from her this little letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      "HOTEL COEUR D'OR, "MONTE CARLO. "MY DEAR MARK,
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've arrived. It is so good to be in the sun. The flowers are wonderful.
      I am keeping Gorbio and Roquebrune till you come.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      "OLIVE CRAMIER."
     </p>
    <p>
      That letter was the single clear memory he had of the time between her
      going and his following. He received it one afternoon, sitting on an old
      low garden wall with the spring sun shining on him through apple-trees in
      blossom, and a feeling as if all the desire of the world lay before him,
      and he had but to stretch out his arms to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then confused unrest, all things vague; till at the end of his journey he
      stepped out of the train at Beaulieu with a furiously beating heart. But
      why? Surely he had not expected her to come out from Monte Carlo to meet
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      A week had gone by since then in one long effort to be with her and appear
      to others as though he did not greatly wish to be; two concerts, two walks
      with her alone, when all that he had said seemed as nothing said, and all
      her sayings but ghosts of what he wished to hear; a week of confusion, day
      and night, until, a few minutes ago, her handkerchief had fallen from her
      glove on to the dusty road, and he had picked it up and put it to his
      lips. Nothing could take away the look she had given him then. Nothing
      could ever again separate her from him utterly. She had confessed in it to
      the same sweet, fearful trouble that he himself was feeling. She had not
      spoken, but he had seen her lips part, her breast rise and fall. And HE
      had not spoken. What was the use of words?
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt in the pocket of his coat. There, against his fingers, was that
      wisp of lawn and lace, soft, yet somehow alive; and stealthily he took it
      out. The whole of her, with her fragrance, seemed pressed to his face in
      the touch of that lawn border, roughened by little white stars. More
      secretly than ever he put it back; and for the first time looked round.
      These people! They belonged to a world that he had left. They gave him the
      same feeling that her uncle and aunt had given him just now, when they
      said good-night, following her into their hotel. That good Colonel, that
      good Mrs. Ercott! The very concretion of the world he had been brought up
      in, of the English point of view; symbolic figures of health, reason, and
      the straight path, on which at that moment, seemingly, he had turned his
      back. The Colonel's profile, ruddy through its tan, with grey moustache
      guiltless of any wax, his cheery, high-pitched: "Good-night, young
      Lennan!" His wife's curly smile, her flat, cosy, confidential voice -- how
      strange and remote they had suddenly become! And all these people here,
      chattering, drinking -- how queer and far away! Or was it just that he
      was queer and remote to them?
    </p>
    <p>
      And getting up from his table, he passed the fiddlers with the dark-white
      skins, out into the Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up the side streets to the back of her hotel, and stood by the
      railings of the garden -- one of those hotel gardens which exist but to
      figure in advertisements, with its few arid palms, its paths staring white
      between them, and a fringe of dusty lilacs and mimosas.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there came to him the oddest feeling -- that he had been there
      before, peering through blossoms at those staring paths and shuttered
      windows. A scent of wood-smoke was abroad, and some dry plant rustled ever
      so faintly in what little wind was stirring. What was there of memory in
      this night, this garden? Some dark sweet thing, invisible, to feel whose
      presence was at once ecstasy, and the irritation of a thirst that will not
      be quenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he walked on. Houses, houses! At last he was away from them, alone on
      the high road, beyond the limits of Monaco. And walking thus through the
      night he had thoughts that he imagined no one had ever had before him. The
      knowledge that she loved him had made everything seem very sacred and
      responsible. Whatever he did, he must not harm her. Women were so
      helpless!
    </p>
    <p>
      For in spite of six years of art in Rome and Paris, he still had a
      fastidious reverence for women. If she had loved her husband she would
      have been safe enough from him; but to be bound to a companionship that
      she gave unwillingly -- this had seemed to him atrocious, even before
      he loved her. How could any husband ask that? Have so little pride -- so
      little pity? The unpardonable thing! What was there to respect in such a
      marriage? Only, he must not do her harm! But now that her eyes had said, I
      love you! -- What then? It was simply miraculous to know THAT, under
      the stars of this warm Southern night, burning its incense of trees and
      flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Climbing up above the road, he lay down. If only she were there beside
      him! The fragrance of the earth not yet chilled, crept to his face; and
      for just a moment it seemed to him that she did come. If he could keep her
      there for ever in that embrace that was no embrace -- in that ghostly
      rapture, on this wild fragrant bed that no lovers before had ever pressed,
      save the creeping things, and the flowers; save sunlight and moonlight
      with their shadows; and the wind kissing the earth! . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she was gone; his hands touched nothing but the crumbled pine dust,
      and the flowers of the wild thyme fallen into sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood on the edge of the little cliff, above the road between the dark
      mountains and the sea black with depth. Too late for any passer-by; as far
      from what men thought and said and did as the very night itself with its
      whispering warmth. And he conjured up her face, making certain of it -- the
      eyes, clear and brown, and wide apart; the close, sweet mouth; the dark
      hair; the whole flying loveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he leaped down into the road, and ran -- one could not walk,
      feeling this miracle, that no one had ever felt before, the miracle of
      love.

      III
    </p>
    <p>
      In their most reputable hotel 'Le Coeur d'Or,' long since remodelled and
      renamed, Mrs. Ercott lay in her brass-bound bed looking by starlight at
      the Colonel in his brass-bound bed. Her ears were carefully freed from the
      pressure of her pillow, for she thought she heard a mosquito. Companion
      for thirty years to one whose life had been feverishly punctuated by the
      attentions of those little beasts, she had no love for them. It was the
      one subject on which perhaps her imagination was stronger than her common
      sense. For in fact there was not, and could not be, a mosquito, since the
      first thing the Colonel did, on arriving at any place farther South than
      Parallel 46 of latitude, was to open the windows very wide, and nail with
      many tiny tacks a piece of mosquito netting across that refreshing space,
      while she held him firmly by the coat-tails. The fact that other people
      did not so secure their windows did not at all trouble the Colonel, a true
      Englishman, who loved to act in his own way, and to think in the ways of
      other people. After that they would wait till night came, then burn a
      peculiar little lamp with a peculiar little smell, and, in the full glare
      of the gaslight, stand about on chairs, with slippers, and their eyes
      fixed on true or imaginary beasts. Then would fall little slaps, making
      little messes, and little joyous or doleful cries would arise: "I've got
      that one!" "Oh, John, I missed him!" And in the middle of the room, the
      Colonel, in pyjamas, and spectacles (only worn in very solemn moments, low
      down on his nose), would revolve slowly, turning his eyes, with that look
      in them of out-facing death which he had so long acquired, on every inch
      of wall and ceiling, till at last he would say: "Well, Dolly, that's the
      lot!" At which she would say: "Give me a kiss, dear!" and he would kiss
      her, and get into his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, then, no mosquito, save that general ghost of him which
      lingered in the mind of one devoted to her husband. Spying out his
      profile, for he was lying on his back, she refrained from saying: "John,
      are you awake?" A whiffling sound was coming from a nose, to which -- originally
      straight -- attention to military duties had given a slight crook, half
      an inch below the level of grizzled eyebrows raised a little, as though
      surprised at the sounds beneath. She could hardly see him, but she
      thought: "How good he looks!" And, in fact, he did. It was the face of a
      man incapable of evil, having in its sleep the candour of one at heart a
      child -- that simple candour of those who have never known how to seek
      adventures of the mind, and have always sought adventures of the body.
      Then somehow she did say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "John! Are you asleep?"
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, instantly alive, as at some old-time attack, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "That poor young man!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Which?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Mark Lennan. Haven't you seen?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, it was under your nose. But you never do see these things!"
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel slowly turned his head. His wife was an imaginative woman! She
      had always been so. Dimly he perceived that something romantic was about
      to come from her. But with that almost professional gentleness of a man
      who has cut the heads and arms off people in his time, he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What things?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "He picked up her handkerchief."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Whose?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Olive's. He put it in his pocket. I distinctly saw him."
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence; then Mrs. Ercott's voice rose again, impersonal, far
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What always astonishes me about young people is the way they think
      they're not seen -- poor dears!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Still there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John! Are you thinking?"
     </p>
    <p>
      For a considerable sound of breathing, not mere whiffling now, was coming
      from the Colonel -- to his wife a sure sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed he WAS thinking. Dolly was an imaginative woman, but something
      told him that in this case she might not be riding past the hounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ercott raised herself. He looked more good than ever; a little
      perplexed frown had climbed up with his eyebrows and got caught in the
      wrinkles across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm very fond of Olive," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ercott fell back on her pillows. In her heart there was just that
      little soreness natural to a woman over fifty, whose husband has a niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt," she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something vague moved deep down in the Colonel; he stretched out his hand.
      In that strip of gloom between the beds it encountered another hand, which
      squeezed it rather hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "Look here, old girl!" and there was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ercott in her turn was thinking. Her thoughts were flat and rapid
      like her voice, but had that sort of sentiment which accompanies the
      mental exercise of women with good hearts. Poor young man! And poor Olive!
      But was a woman ever to be pitied, when she was so pretty as that!
      Besides, when all was said and done, she had a fine-looking man for
      husband; in Parliament, with a career, and fond of her -- decidedly.
      And their little house in London, so close to Westminster, was a distinct
      dear; and nothing could be more charming than their cottage by the river.
      Was Olive, then, to be pitied? And yet -- she was not happy. It was no
      good pretending that she was happy. All very well to say that such things
      were within one's control, but if you read novels at all, you knew they
      weren't. There was such a thing as incompatibility. Oh yes! And there was
      the matter of difference in their ages! Olive was twenty-six, Robert
      Cramier forty-two. And now this young Mark Lennan was in love with her.
      What if she were in love with him! John would realize then, perhaps, that
      the young flew to the young. For men -- even the best, like John, were
      funny! She would never dream of feeling for any of her nephews as John
      clearly felt for Olive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel's voice broke in on her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice young fellow -- Lennan! Great pity! Better sheer off -- if
      he's getting -- "
     </p>
    <p>
      And, rather suddenly, she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose he can't!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Can't?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Did you never hear of a 'grande passion'?"
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel rose on his elbow. This was another of those occasions that
      showed him how, during the later years of his service in Madras and Upper
      Burmah, when Dolly's health had not been equal to the heat, she had picked
      up in London a queer way of looking at things -- as if they were not -- not
      so right or wrong as -- as he felt them to be. And he repeated those
      two French words in his own way, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't that just what I'm saying? The sooner he stands clear, the better."
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Ercott, too, sat up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be human," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel experienced the same sensation as when one suddenly knows that
      one is not digesting food. Because young Lennan was in danger of getting
      into a dishonourable fix, he was told to be human! Really, Dolly was -- !
      The white blur of her new boudoir cap suddenly impinged on his
      consciousness. Surely she was not getting -- un-English! At her time of
      life!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking of Olive," he said; "I don't want her worried with that sort
      of thing."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps Olive can manage for herself. In these days it doesn't do to
      interfere with love."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Love!" muttered the Colonel. "What? Phew!"
     </p>
    <p>
      If one's own wife called this -- this sort of -- thing, love -- then,
      why had he been faithful to her -- in very hot climates -- all these
      years? A sense of waste, and of injustice, tried to rear its head against
      all the side of him that attached certain meanings to certain words, and
      acted up to them. And this revolt gave him a feeling, strange and so
      unpleasant. Love! It was not a word to use thus loosely! Love led to
      marriage; this could not lead to marriage, except through -- the
      Divorce Court. And suddenly the Colonel had a vision of his dead brother
      Lindsay, Olive's father, standing there in the dark, with his grave,
      clear-cut, ivory-pale face, under the black hair supposed to be derived
      from a French ancestress who had escaped from the massacre of St.
      Bartholomew. Upright fellow always, Lindsay -- even before he was made
      bishop! Queer somehow that Olive should be his daughter. Not that she was
      not upright; not at all! But she was soft! Lindsay was not! Imagine him
      seeing that young fellow putting her handkerchief in his pocket. But had
      young Lennan really done such a thing? Dolly was imaginative! He had
      mistaken it probably for his own; if he had chanced to blow his nose, he
      would have realized. For, coupled with the almost child-like candour of
      his mind, the Colonel had real administrative vigour, a true sense of
      practical values; an ounce of illustration was always worth to him a pound
      of theory! Dolly was given to riding off on theories. Thank God! she never
      acted on 'em!
    </p>
    <p>
      He said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear! Young Lennan may be an artist and all that, but he's a
      gentleman! I know old Heatherley, his guardian. Why I introduced him to
      Olive myself!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "What has that to do with it? He's in love with her."
     </p>
    <p>
      One of the countless legion that hold a creed taken at face value, into
      whose roots and reasons they have never dreamed of going, the Colonel was
      staggered. Like some native on an island surrounded by troubled seas,
      which he has stared at with a certain contemptuous awe all his life, but
      never entered, he was disconcerted by thus being asked to leave the shore.
      And by his own wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, Mrs. Ercott had not intended to go so far; but there was in her,
      as in all women whose minds are more active than their husbands', a
      something worrying her always to go a little farther than she meant. With
      real compunction she heard the Colonel say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must get up and drink some water."
     </p>
    <p>
      She was out of bed in a moment. "Not without boiling!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She had seriously troubled him, then! Now he would not sleep -- the
      blood went to his head so quickly. He would just lie awake, trying not to
      disturb her. She could not bear him not to disturb her. It seemed so
      selfish of her! She ought to have known that the whole subject was too
      dangerous to discuss at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became conscious that he was standing just behind her; his figure in
      its thin covering looked very lean, his face strangely worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry you put that idea into my head!" he said. "I'm fond of Olive."
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mrs. Ercott felt that jealous twinge, soon lost this time in the
      motherliness of a childless woman for her husband. He must not be
      troubled! He should not be troubled. And she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The water's boiling! Now sip a good glass slowly, and get into bed, or
      I'll take your temperature!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Obediently the Colonel took from her the glass, and as he sipped, she put
      her hand up and stroked his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      In the room below them the subject of their discussion was lying very wide
      awake. She knew that she had betrayed herself, made plain to Mark Lennan
      what she had never until now admitted to herself. But the love-look, which
      for the life of her she could not keep back, had been followed by a
      feeling of having 'lost caste.' For, hitherto, the world of women had been
      strictly divided by her into those who did and those who did not do such
      things; and to be no longer quite sure to which half she belonged was
      frightening. But what was the good of thinking, of being frightened? -- it
      could not lead to anything. Yesterday she had not known this would come;
      and now she could not guess at to-morrow! To-night was enough! To-night
      with its swimming loveliness! Just to feel! To love, and to be loved!
    </p>
    <p>
      A new sensation for her -- as different from those excited by the
      courtships of her girlhood, or by her marriage, as light from darkness.
      For she had never been in love, not even with her husband. She knew it
      now. The sun was shining in a world where she had thought there was none.
      Nothing could come of it. But the sun was shining; and in that sunshine
      she must warm herself a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite simply she began to plan what he and she would do. There were six
      days left. They had not yet been to Gorbio, nor to Castellar -- none of
      those long walks or rides they had designed to do for the beauty of them.
      Would he come early to-morrow? What could they do together? No one should
      know what these six days would be to her -- not even he. To be with
      him, watch his face, hear his voice, and now and then just touch him! She
      could trust herself to show no one. And then, it would be -- over!
      Though, of course, she would see him again in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, lying there in the dark, she thought of their first meeting, one
      Sunday morning, in Hyde Park. The Colonel religiously observed Church
      Parade, and would even come all the way down to Westminster, from his flat
      near Knightsbridge, in order to fetch his niece up to it. She remembered
      how, during their stroll, he had stopped suddenly in front of an old
      gentleman with a puffy yellow face and eyes half open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Mr. Heatherley -- you up from Devonshire? How's your nephew -- the -- er -- sculptor?"
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old gentleman, glaring a little, as it seemed to her, from under
      his eyelids and his grey top hat, had answered: "Colonel Ercott, I think?
      Here's the fellow himself -- Mark!" And a young man had taken off his
      hat. She had only noticed at first that his dark hair grew -- not long -- but
      very thick; and that his eyes were very deep-set. Then she saw him smile;
      it made his face all eager, yet left it shy; and she decided that he was
      nice. Soon after, she had gone with the Ercotts to see his 'things'; for
      it was, of course, and especially in those days, quite an event to know a
      sculptor -- rather like having a zebra in your park. The Colonel had
      been delighted and a little relieved to find that the 'things' were nearly
      all of beasts and birds. "Very interestin'" to one full of curious lore
      about such, having in his time killed many of them, and finding himself at
      the end of it with a curious aversion to killing any more -- which he
      never put into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acquaintanceship had ripened fast after that first visit to his studio,
      and now it was her turn to be relieved that Mark Lennan devoted himself
      almost entirely to beasts and birds instead of to the human form,
      so-called divine. Ah! yes -- she would have suffered; now that she
      loved him, she saw that. At all events she could watch his work and help
      it with sympathy. That could not be wrong....
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell asleep at last, and dreamed that she was in a boat alone on the
      river near her country cottage, drifting along among spiky flowers like
      asphodels, with birds singing and flying round her. She could move neither
      face nor limbs, but that helpless feeling was not unpleasant, till she
      became conscious that she was drawing nearer and nearer to what was
      neither water nor land, light nor darkness, but simply some unutterable
      feeling. And then she saw, gazing at her out of the rushes on the banks, a
      great bull head. It moved as she moved -- it was on both sides of her,
      yet all the time only one head. She tried to raise her hands and cover her
      eyes, but could not -- and woke with a sob.... It was light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly six o'clock already! Her dream made her disinclined to trust again
      to sleep. Sleep was a robber now -- of each minute of these few days!
      She got up, and looked out. The morning was fine, the air warm already,
      sweet with dew, and heliotrope nailed to the wall outside her window. She
      had but to open her shutters and walk into the sun. She dressed, took her
      sunshade, stealthily slipped the shutters back, and stole forth. Shunning
      the hotel garden, where the eccentricity of her early wandering might
      betray the condition of her spirit, she passed through into the road
      toward the Casino. Without perhaps knowing it, she was making for where
      she had sat with him yesterday afternoon, listening to the band. Hatless,
      but defended by her sunshade, she excited the admiration of the few
      connoisseurs as yet abroad, strolling in blue blouses to their labours;
      and this simple admiration gave her pleasure. For once she was really
      conscious of the grace in her own limbs, actually felt the gentle
      vividness of her own face, with its nearly black hair and eyes, and creamy
      skin -- strange sensation, and very comforting!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Casino gardens she walked more slowly, savouring the aromatic
      trees, and stopping to bend and look at almost every flower; then, on the
      seat, where she had sat with him yesterday, she rested. A few paces away
      were the steps that led to the railway-station, trodden upwards eagerly by
      so many, day after day, night after night, and lightly or sorrowfully
      descended. Above her, two pines, a pepper-tree, and a palm mingled their
      shade -- so fantastic the jumbling of trees and souls in this strange
      place! She furled her sunshade and leaned back. Her gaze, free and
      friendly, passed from bough to bough. Against the bright sky, unbesieged
      as yet by heat or dust, they had a spiritual look, lying sharp and flat
      along the air. She plucked a cluster of pinkish berries from the
      pepper-tree, crushing and rubbing them between her hands to get their
      fragrance. All these beautiful and sweet things seemed to be a part of her
      joy at being loved, part of this sudden summer in her heart. The sky, the
      flowers, that jewel of green-blue sea, the bright acacias, were nothing in
      the world but love.
    </p>
    <p>
      And those few who passed, and saw her sitting there under the pepper-tree,
      wondered no doubt at the stillness of this dame bien mise, who had risen
      so early.
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      In the small hours, which so many wish were smaller, the Colonel had
      awakened, with the affair of the handkerchief swelling visibly. His
      niece's husband was not a man that he had much liking for -- a taciturn
      fellow, with possibly a bit of the brute in him, a man who rather rode
      people down; but, since Dolly and he were in charge of Olive, the notion
      that young Lennan was falling in love with her under their very noses was
      alarming to one naturally punctilious. It was not until he fell asleep
      again, and woke in full morning light, that the remedy occurred to him.
      She must be taken out of herself! Dolly and he had been slack; too
      interested in this queer place, this queer lot of people! They had
      neglected her, left her to. . . Boys and girls! -- One ought always to
      remember. But it was not too late. She was old Lindsay's daughter; would
      not forget herself. Poor old Lindsay -- fine fellow; bit too much,
      perhaps, of the -- Huguenot in him! Queer, those throw-backs! Had
      noticed in horses, time and again -- white hairs about the tail,
      carriage of the head -- skip generations and then pop out. And Olive
      had something of his look -- the same ivory skin, same colour of eyes
      and hair! Only she was not severe, like her father, not exactly! And once
      more there shot through the Colonel a vague dread, as of a trusteeship
      neglected. It disappeared, however, in his bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was out before eight o'clock, a thin upright figure in hard straw hat
      and grey flannel clothes, walking with the indescribable loose poise of
      the soldier Englishman, with that air, different from the French, German,
      what not, because of shoulders ever asserting, through their drill, the
      right to put on mufti; with that perfectly quiet and modest air of knowing
      that, whatever might be said, there was only one way of wearing clothes
      and moving legs. And, as he walked, he smoothed his drooping grey
      moustache, considering how best to take his niece out of herself. He
      passed along by the Terrace, and stood for a moment looking down at the
      sea beyond the pigeon-shooting ground. Then he moved on round under the
      Casino into the gardens at the back. A beautiful spot! Wonderful care they
      had taken with the plants! It made him think a little of Tushawore, where
      his old friend the Rajah -- precious old rascal! -- had gardens to
      his palace rather like these. He paced again to the front. It was nice and
      quiet in the early mornings, with the sea down there, and nobody trying to
      get the better of anybody else. There were fellows never happy unless they
      were doing someone in the eye. He had known men who would ride at the
      devil himself, make it a point of honour to swindle a friend out of a few
      pounds! Odd place this 'Monte' -- sort of a Garden of Eden gone wrong.
      And all the real, but quite inarticulate love of Nature, which had
      supported the Colonel through deserts and jungles, on transports at sea,
      and in mountain camps, awoke in the sweetness of these gardens. His dear
      mother! He had never forgotten the words with which she had shown him the
      sunset through the coppice down at old Withes Norton, when he was nine
      years old: "That is beauty, Jack! Do you feel it, darling?" He had not
      felt it at the time -- not he; a thick-headed, scampering youngster.
      Even when he first went to India he had had no eye for a sunset. The
      rising generation were different. That young couple, for instance, under
      the pepper-tree, sitting there without a word, just looking at the trees.
      How long, he wondered, had they been sitting like that? And suddenly
      something in the Colonel leaped; his steel-coloured eyes took on their
      look of out-facing death. Choking down a cough, he faced about, back to
      where he had stood above the pigeon-shooting ground.... Olive and that
      young fellow! An assignation! At this time in the morning! The earth
      reeled. His brother's child -- his favourite niece! The woman whom he
      most admired -- the woman for whom his heart was softest. Leaning over
      the stone parapet, no longer seeing either the smooth green of the
      pigeon-shooting ground, or the smooth blue of the sea beyond, he was
      moved, distressed, bewildered beyond words. Before breakfast! That was the
      devil of it! Confession, as it were, of everything. Moreover, he had seen
      their hands touching on the seat. The blood rushed up to his face; he had
      seen, spied out, what was not intended for his eyes. Nice position -- that!
      Dolly, too, last night, had seen. But that was different. Women might see
      things -- it was expected of them. But for a man -- a -- a
      gentleman! The fullness of his embarrassment gradually disclosed itself.
      His hands were tied. Could he even consult Dolly? He had a feeling of
      isolation, of utter solitude. Nobody -- not anybody in the world -- could
      understand his secret and intense discomfort. To take up a position -- the
      position he was bound to take up, as Olive's nearest relative and
      protector, and -- what was it -- chaperon, by the aid of knowledge
      come at in such a way, however unintentionally! Never in all his days in
      the regiment -- and many delicate matters affecting honour had come his
      way -- had he had a thing like this to deal with. Poor child! But he
      had no business to think of her like that. No, indeed! She had not behaved -- as -- And
      there he paused, curiously unable to condemn her. Suppose they got up and
      came that way!
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his hands off the stone parapet, and made for his hotel. His palms
      were white from the force of his grip. He said to himself as he went
      along: "I must consider the whole question calmly; I must think it out."
       This gave him relief. With young Lennan, at all events, he could be angry.
      But even there he found, to his dismay, no finality of judgment. And this
      absence of finality, so unwonted, distressed him horribly. There was
      something in the way the young man had been sitting there beside her -- so
      quiet, so almost timid -- that had touched him. This was bad, by Jove -- very
      bad! The two of them, they made, somehow, a nice couple! Confound it! This
      would not do! The chaplain of the little English church, passing at this
      moment, called out, "Fine morning, Colonel Ercott." The Colonel saluted,
      and did not answer. The greeting at the moment seemed to him paltry. No
      morning could be fine that contained such a discovery. He entered the
      hotel, passed into the dining-room, and sat down. Nobody was there. They
      all had their breakfast upstairs, even Dolly. Olive alone was in the habit
      of supporting him while he ate an English breakfast. And suddenly he
      perceived that he was face to face already with this dreadful situation.
      To have breakfast without, as usual, waiting for her, seemed too pointed.
      She might be coming in at any minute now. To wait for her, and have it,
      without showing anything -- how could he do that?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a faint rustling behind him. There she was, and
      nothing decided. In this moment of hopeless confusion the Colonel acted by
      pure instinct, rose, patted her cheek, and placed a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear," he said; "hungry?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She was looking very dainty, very soft. That creamy dress showed off her
      dark hair and eyes, which seemed somehow to be -- flying off somewhere;
      yes -- it was queer, but that was the only way to put it. He got no
      reassurance, no comfort, from the sight of her. And slowly he stripped the
      skin from the banana with which he always commenced breakfast. One might
      just as well be asked to shoot a tame dove or tear a pretty flower to
      pieces as be expected to take her to task, even if he could, in honour.
      And he sought refuge in the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been out?" Then could have bitten his tongue off. Suppose she answered:
      "No."
     </p>
    <p>
      But she did not so answer. The colour came into her cheeks, indeed, but
      she nodded: "It's so lovely!"
     </p>
    <p>
      How pretty she looked saying that! He had put himself out of court now -- could
      never tell her what he had seen, after setting, as it were, that trap for
      her; and presently he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got any plans to-day?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered, without flinching in the least:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mark Lennan and I were going to take mules from Mentone up to Gorbio."
     </p>
    <p>
      He was amazed at her steadiness -- never, to his knowledge, having
      encountered a woman armoured at every point to preserve a love that flies
      against the world. How tell what was under her smile! And in confusion of
      feeling that amounted almost to pain he heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you and Aunt Dolly come?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Between sense of trusteeship and hatred of spoiling sport; between
      knowledge of the danger she was in and half-pitying admiration at the
      sight of her; between real disapproval of an illicit and underhand
      business (what else was it, after all?) and some dim perception that here
      was something he did not begin to be able to fathom -- something that
      perhaps no one but those two themselves could deal with -- between
      these various extremes he was lost indeed. And he stammered out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must ask your aunt; she's -- she's not very good on a mule."
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in an impulse of sheer affection, he said with startling suddenness:
      "My dear, I've often meant to ask, are you happy at home?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "At home?"
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something sinister about the way she repeated that, as if the
      word "home" were strange to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drank her coffee and got up; and the Colonel felt afraid of her,
      standing there -- afraid of what she was going to tell him. He grew
      very red. But, worse than all, she said absolutely nothing; only shrugged
      her shoulders with a little smile that went to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      On the wild thyme, under the olives below the rock village of Gorbio, with
      their mules cropping at a little distance, those two sat after their
      lunch, listening to the cuckoos. Since their uncanny chance meeting that
      morning in the gardens, when they sat with their hands just touching,
      amazed and elated by their own good fortune, there was not much need to
      say what they felt, to break with words this rapture of belonging to each
      other -- so shyly, so wildly, so, as it were, without reality. They
      were like epicures with old wine in their glasses, not yet tired of its
      fragrance and the spell of anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so their talk was not of love, but, in that pathetic way of
      star-crossed lovers, of the things they loved; leaving out -- each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the telling of her dream that brought the words from him at last;
      but she drew away, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't -- it mustn't be!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he just clung to her hand; and presently, seeing that her eyes were
      wet, took courage enough to kiss her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling and fugitive indeed that first passage of their love. Not much
      of the conquering male in him, nor in her of the ordinary enchantress.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then they went, outwardly sober enough, riding their mules down the
      stony slopes back to Mentone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the grey, dusty railway-carriage when she had left him, he was like
      a man drugged, staring at where she had sat opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two hours later, at dinner in her hotel, between her and Mrs. Ercott, with
      the Colonel opposite, he knew for the first time what he was faced with.
      To watch every thought that passed within him, lest it should by the
      slightest sign betray him; to regulate and veil every look and every word
      he spoke to her; never for a second to forget that these other persons
      were actual and dangerous, not merely the insignificant and grotesque
      shadows that they seemed. It would be perhaps for ever a part of his love
      for her to seem not to love her. He did not dare dream of fulfilment. He
      was to be her friend, and try to bring her happiness -- burn and long
      for her, and not think about reward. This was his first real overwhelming
      passion -- so different to the loves of spring -- and he brought to
      it all that naivete, that touching quality of young Englishmen, whose
      secret instinct it is to back away from the full nature of love, even from
      admitting that it has that nature. They two were to love, and -- not to
      love! For the first time he understood a little of what that meant. A few
      stolen adoring minutes now and then, and, for the rest, the presence of a
      world that must be deceived. Already he had almost a hatred of that
      orderly, brown-faced Colonel, with his eyes that looked so steady and saw
      nothing; of that flat, kindly lady, who talked so pleasantly throughout
      dinner, saying things that he had to answer without knowing what they
      signified. He realized, with a sense of shock, that he was deprived of all
      interests in life but one; not even his work had any meaning apart from
      HER. It lit no fire within him to hear Mrs. Ercott praise certain
      execrable pictures in the Royal Academy, which she had religiously visited
      the day before leaving home. And as the interminable meal wore on, he
      began even to feel grief and wonder that Olive could be so smiling, so
      gay, and calm; so, as it seemed to him, indifferent to this intolerable
      impossibility of exchanging even one look of love. Did she really love him -- could
      she love him, and show not one little sign of it? And suddenly he felt her
      foot touch his own. It was the faintest sidelong, supplicating pressure,
      withdrawn at once, but it said: 'I know what you are suffering; I, too,
      but I love you.' Characteristically, he felt that it cost her dear to make
      use of that little primitive device of common loves; the touch awoke
      within him only chivalry. He would burn for ever sooner than cause her the
      pain of thinking that he was not happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, they sat out on a balcony. The stars glowed above the palms;
      a frog was croaking. He managed to draw his chair so that he could look at
      her unseen. How deep, and softly dark her eyes, when for a second they
      rested on his! A moth settled on her knee -- a cunning little creature,
      with its hooded, horned owl's face, and tiny black slits of eyes! Would it
      have come so confidingly to anyone but her? The Colonel knew its name -- he
      had collected it. Very common, he said. The interest in it passed; but
      Lennan stayed, bent forward, gazing at that silk-covered knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Mrs. Ercott, sharper than its wont, said: "What day does
      Robert say he wants you back, my dear?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He managed to remain gazing at the moth, even to take it gently from her
      knee, while he listened to her calm answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tuesday, I believe."
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he got up, and let the moth fly into the darkness; his hands and lips
      were trembling, and he was afraid of their being seen. He had never known,
      had not dreamed, of such a violent, sick feeling. That this man could thus
      hale her home at will! It was grotesque, fantastic, awful, but -- it
      was true! Next Tuesday she would journey back away from him to be again at
      the mercy of her Fate! The pain of this thought made him grip the railing,
      and grit his teeth, to keep himself from crying out. And another thought
      came to him: I shall have to go about with this feeling, day and night,
      and keep it secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were saying good-night; and he had to smirk and smile, and pretend -- to
      her above all -- that he was happy, and he could see that she knew it
      was pretence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was alone, with the feeling that he had failed her at the first
      shot; torn, too, between horror of what he suddenly saw before him, and
      longing to be back in her presence at any cost.... And all this on the day
      of that first kiss which had seemed to him to make her so utterly his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on a bench facing the Casino. Neither the lights, nor the
      people passing in and out, not even the gipsy bandsmen's music, distracted
      his thoughts for a second. Could it be less than twenty-four hours since
      he had picked up her handkerchief, not thirty yards away? In that
      twenty-four hours he seemed to have known every emotion that man could
      feel. And in all the world there was now not one soul to whom he could
      speak his real thoughts -- not even to her, because from her, beyond
      all, he must keep at any cost all knowledge of his unhappiness. So this
      was illicit love -- as it was called! Loneliness, and torture! Not
      jealousy -- for her heart was his; but amazement, outrage, fear.
      Endless lonely suffering! And nobody, if they knew, would care, or pity
      him one jot!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there really, then, as the ancients thought, a Daemon that liked to
      play with men, as men liked to stir an earwig and turn it over and put a
      foot on it in the end?
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and made his way towards the railway-station. There was the
      bench where she had been sitting when he came on her that very morning.
      The stars in their courses had seemed to fight for them then; but whether
      for joy he no longer knew. And there on the seat were still the pepper
      berries she had crushed and strewn. He broke off another bunch and bruised
      them. That scent was the ghost of sacred minutes when her hand lay against
      his own. The stars in their courses -- for joy or sorrow!
    </p>
    <p>
      VII
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no peace now for Colonel and Mrs. Ercott. They felt themselves
      conspirators, and of conspiracy they had never had the habit. Yet how
      could they openly deal with anxieties which had arisen solely from what
      they had chanced secretly to see? What was not intended for one's eyes and
      ears did not exist; no canon of conduct could be quite so sacred. As well
      defend the opening of another person's letters as admit the possibility of
      making use of adventitious knowledge. So far tradition, and indeed
      character, made them feel at one, and conspire freely. But they diverged
      on a deeper plane. Mrs. Ercott had SAID, indeed, that here was something
      which could not be controlled; the Colonel had FELT it -- a very
      different thing! Less tolerant in theory, he was touched at heart; Mrs.
      Ercott, in theory almost approving -- she read that dangerous
      authoress, George Eliot -- at heart felt cold towards her husband's
      niece. For these reasons they could not in fact conspire without, in the
      end, saying suddenly: "Well, it's no good talking about it!" and almost at
      once beginning to talk about it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In proposing to her that mule, the Colonel had not had time, or, rather,
      not quite conviction enough as to his line of action, to explain so
      immediately the new need for her to sit upon it. It was only when, to his
      somewhat strange relief, she had refused the expedition, and Olive had
      started without them, that he told her of the meeting in the Gardens, of
      which he had been witness. She then said at once that if she had known she
      would, of course, have put up with anything in order to go; not because
      she approved of interfering, but because they must think of Robert! And
      the Colonel had said: "D -- n the fellow!" And there the matter had
      rested for the moment, for both of them were, wondering a little which
      fellow it was that he had damned. That indeed was the trouble. If the
      Colonel had not cared so much about his niece, and had liked, instead of
      rather disliking Cramier; if Mrs. Ercott had not found Mark Lennan a 'nice
      boy,' and had not secretly felt her husband's niece rather dangerous to
      her peace of mind; if, in few words, those three had been puppets made of
      wood and worked by law, it would have been so much simpler for all
      concerned. It was the discovery that there was a personal equation in such
      matters, instead of just a simple rule of three, which disorganized the
      Colonel and made him almost angry; which depressed Mrs. Ercott and made
      her almost silent.... These two good souls had stumbled on a problem which
      has divided the world from birth. Shall cases be decided on their
      individual merits, or according to formal codes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath an appearance and a vocabulary more orthodox than ever, the
      Colonel's allegiance to Authority and the laws of Form was really shaken;
      he simply could not get out of his head the sight of those two young
      people sitting side by side, nor the tone of Olive's voice, when she had
      repeated his regrettable words about happiness at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only the thing had not been so human! If only she had been someone
      else's niece, it would clearly have been her duty to remain unhappy. As it
      was, the more he thought, the less he knew what to think. A man who had
      never had any balance to speak of at his bank, and from the nomadic
      condition of his life had no exaggerated feeling for a settled social
      status -- deeming Society in fact rather a bore -- he did not unduly
      exaggerate the worldly dangers of this affair; neither did he honestly
      believe that she would burn in everlasting torment if she did not succeed
      in remaining true to 'that great black chap,' as he secretly called
      Cramier. His feeling was simply that it was an awful pity; a sort of
      unhappy conviction that it was not like the women of his family to fall
      upon such ways; that his dead brother would turn in his grave; in two
      words that it was 'not done.' Yet he was by no means of those who, giving
      latitude to women in general, fall with whips on those of their own family
      who take it. On the contrary, believing that 'Woman in general' should be
      stainless to the world's eye, he was inclined to make allowance for any
      individual woman that he knew and loved. A suspicion he had always
      entertained, that Cramier was not by breeding 'quite the clean potato' may
      insensibly have influenced him just a little. He had heard indeed that he
      was not even entitled to the name of Cramier, but had been adopted by a
      childless man, who had brought him up and left him a lot of money. There
      was something in this that went against the grain of the childless
      Colonel. He had never adopted, nor been adopted by anyone himself. There
      was a certain lack about a man who had been adopted, of reasonable
      guarantee -- he was like a non-vintage wine, or a horse without a
      pedigree; you could not quite rely on what he might do, having no
      tradition in his blood. His appearance, too, and manner somehow lent
      colour to this distrust. A touch of the tar-brush somewhere, and a
      stubborn, silent, pushing fellow. Why on earth had Olive ever married him!
      But then women were such kittle cattle, poor things! and old Lindsay, with
      his vestments and his views on obedience, must have been a Tartar as a
      father, poor old chap! Besides, Cramier, no doubt, was what most women
      would call good-looking; more taking to the eye than such a quiet fellow
      as young Lennan, whose features were rather anyhow, though pleasant
      enough, and with a nice smile -- the sort of young man one could not
      help liking, and who certainly would never hurt a fly! And suddenly there
      came the thought: Why should he not go to young Lennan and put it to him
      straight? That he was in love with Olive? Not quite -- but the way to
      do it would come to him. He brooded long over this idea, and spoke of it
      to Mrs. Ercott, while shaving, the next morning. Her answer: "My dear
      John, bosh!" removed his last doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without saying where he was going, he strolled out the moment after
      breakfast -- and took a train to Beaulieu. At the young man's hotel he
      sent in his card, and was told that this Monsieur had already gone out for
      the day. His mood of marching straight up to the guns thus checked, he was
      left pensive and distraught. Not having seen Beaulieu (they spoke of it
      then as a coming place), he made his way up an incline. That whole
      hillside was covered with rose-trees. Thousands of these flowers were
      starring the lower air, and the strewn petals of blown and fallen roses
      covered the light soil. The Colonel put his nose to blossoms here and
      there, but they had little scent, as if they knew that the season was
      already over. A few blue-bloused peasants were still busy among them. And
      suddenly he came on young Lennan himself, sitting on a stone and dabbing
      away with his fingers at a lump of putty stuff. The Colonel hesitated.
      Apart from obvious reasons for discomfiture, he had that feeling towards
      Art common to so many of his caste. It was not work, of course, but it was
      very clever -- a mystery to him how anyone could do it! On seeing him,
      Lennan had risen, dropping his handkerchief over what he was modelling -- but
      not before the Colonel had received a dim impression of something
      familiar. The young man was very red -- the Colonel, too, was conscious
      suddenly of the heat. He held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice quiet place this," he stammered; "never seen it before. I called at
      your hotel."
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that he had his chance, he was completely at a loss. The sight of the
      face emerging from that lump of 'putty stuff' had quite unnerved him. The
      notion of this young man working at it up here all by himself, just
      because he was away an hour or two from the original, touched him. How on
      earth to say what he had come to say? It was altogether different from
      what he had thought. And it suddenly flashed through him -- Dolly was
      right! She's always right -- hang it!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're busy," he said; "I mustn't interrupt you."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, sir. It was awfully good of you to look me up."
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel stared. There was something about young Lennan that he had not
      noticed before; a 'Don't take liberties with me!' look that made things
      difficult. But still he lingered, staring wistfully at the young man, who
      stood waiting with such politeness. Then a safe question shot into his
      mind:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! And when do you go back to England? We're off on Tuesday."
     </p>
    <p>
      While he spoke, a puff of wind lifted the handkerchief from the modelled
      face. Would the young fellow put it back? He did not. And the Colonel
      thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would have been bad form. He knew I wouldn't take advantage. Yes! He's
      a gentleman!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Lifting his hand to the salute, he said: "Well, I must be getting back.
      See you at dinner perhaps?" And turning on his heel he marched away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remembrance of that face in the 'putty stuff' up there by the side of
      the road accompanied him home. It was bad -- it was serious! And the
      sense that he counted for nothing in all of it grew and grew in him. He
      told no one of where he had been....

      When the Colonel turned with ceremony and left him, Lennan sat down again
      on the flat stone, took up his 'putty stuff,' and presently effaced that
      image. He sat still a long time, to all appearance watching the little
      blue butterflies playing round the red and tawny roses. Then his fingers
      began to work, feverishly shaping a head; not of a man, not of a beast,
      but a sort of horned, heavy mingling of the two. There was something
      frenetic in the movement of those rather short, blunt-ended fingers, as
      though they were strangling the thing they were creating.

      VIII
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days, such as had served their country travelled, as befitted
      Spartans, in ordinary first-class carriages, and woke in the morning at La
      Roche or some strange-sounding place, for paler coffee and the pale
      brioche. So it was with Colonel and Mrs. Ercott and their niece,
      accompanied by books they did not read, viands they did not eat, and one
      somnolent Irishman returning from the East. In the disposition of legs
      there was the usual difficulty, no one quite liking to put them up, and
      all ultimately doing so, save Olive. More than once during that night the
      Colonel, lying on the seat opposite, awoke and saw her sitting, withdrawn
      into her corner, with eyes still open. Staring at that little head which
      he admired so much, upright and unmoving, in its dark straw toque against
      the cushion, he would become suddenly alert. Kicking the Irishman slightly
      in the effort, he would slip his legs down, bend across to her in the
      darkness, and, conscious of a faint fragrance as of violets, whisper
      huskily: "Anything I can do for you, my dear?" When she had smiled and
      shaken her head, he would retreat, and after holding his breath to see if
      Dolly were asleep, would restore his feet, slightly kicking the Irishman.
      After one such expedition, for full ten minutes he remained awake,
      wondering at her tireless immobility. For indeed she was spending this
      night entranced, with the feeling that Lennan was beside her, holding her
      hand in his. She seemed actually to feel the touch of his finger against
      the tiny patch of her bare palm where the glove opened. It was wonderful,
      this uncanny communion in the dark rushing night -- she would not have
      slept for worlds! Never before had she felt so close to him, not even when
      he had kissed her that once under the olives; nor even when at the concert
      yesterday his arm pressed hers; and his voice whispered words she heard so
      thirstily. And that golden fortnight passed and passed through her on an
      endless band of reminiscence. Its memories were like flowers, such scent
      and warmth and colour in them; and of all, none perhaps quite so poignant
      as the memory of the moment, at the door of their carriage, when he said,
      so low that she just heard: "Good-bye, my darling!"
     </p>
    <p>
      He had never before called her that. Not even his touch on her cheek under
      the olives equalled the simple treasure of that word. And above the roar
      and clatter of the train, and the snoring of the Irishman, it kept
      sounding in her ears, hour after dark hour. It was perhaps not wonderful,
      that through all that night she never once looked the future in the face -- made
      no plans, took no stock of her position; just yielded to memory, and to
      the half-dreamed sensation of his presence close beside her. Whatever
      might come afterwards, she was his this night. Such was the trance that
      gave to her the strange, soft, tireless immobility which so moved her
      Uncle whenever he woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paris they drove from station to station in a vehicle unfit for three -- 'to
      stretch their legs' -- as the Colonel said. Since he saw in his niece
      no signs of flagging, no regret, his spirits were rising, and he confided
      to Mrs. Ercott in the buffet at the Gare du Nord, when Olive had gone to
      wash, that he did not think there was much in it, after all, looking at
      the way she'd travelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Ercott answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you ever noticed that Olive never shows what she does not want
      to? She has not got those eyes for nothing."
     </p>
    <p>
      "What eyes?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Eyes that see everything, and seem to see nothing."
     </p>
    <p>
      Conscious that something was hurting her, the Colonel tried to take her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Ercott rose quickly, and went where he could not follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus suddenly deserted, the Colonel brooded, drumming on the little table.
      What now! Dolly was unjust! Poor Dolly! He was as fond of her as ever! Of
      course! How could he help Olive's being young -- and pretty; how could
      he help looking after her, and wanting to save her from this mess! Thus he
      sat wondering, dismayed by the unreasonableness of women. It did not enter
      his head that Mrs. Ercott had been almost as sleepless as his niece,
      watching through closed eyes every one of those little expeditions of his,
      and saying to herself: "Ah! He doesn't care how I travel!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She returned serene enough, concealing her 'grief,' and soon they were
      once more whirling towards England.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the future had begun to lay its hand on Olive; the spell of the past
      was already losing power; the sense that it had all been a dream grew
      stronger every minute. In a few hours she would re-enter the little house
      close under the shadow of that old Wren church, which reminded her somehow
      of childhood, and her austere father with his chiselled face. The meeting
      with her husband! How go through that! And to-night! But she did not care
      to contemplate to-night. And all those to-morrows wherein there was
      nothing she had to do of which it was reasonable to complain, yet nothing
      she could do without feeling that all the friendliness and zest and colour
      was out of life, and she a prisoner. Into those to-morrows she felt she
      would slip back, out of her dream; lost, with hardly perhaps an effort. To
      get away to the house on the river, where her husband came only at
      weekends, had hitherto been a refuge; only she would not see Mark there -- unless -- !
      Then, with the thought that she would, must still see him sometimes, all
      again grew faintly glamorous. If only she did see him, what would the rest
      matter? Never again as it had before!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was reaching down her handbag; his cheery: "Looks as if it
      would be rough!" aroused her. Glad to be alone, and tired enough now, she
      sought the ladies' cabin, and slept through the crossing, till the voice
      of the old stewardess awakened her: "You've had a nice sleep. We're
      alongside, miss." Ah! if she were but THAT now! She had been dreaming that
      she was sitting in a flowery field, and Lennan had drawn her up by the
      hands, with the words: "We're here, my darling!"
     </p>
    <p>
      On deck, the Colonel, laden with bags, was looking back for her, and
      trying to keep a space between him and his wife. He signalled with his
      chin. Threading her way towards him, she happened to look up. By the rails
      of the pier above she saw her husband. He was leaning there, looking
      intently down; his tall broad figure made the people on each side of him
      seem insignificant. The clean-shaved, square-cut face, with those almost
      epileptic, forceful eyes, had a stillness and intensity beside which the
      neighbouring faces seemed to disappear. She saw him very clearly, even
      noting the touch of silver in his dark hair, on each side under his straw
      hat; noting that he seemed too massive for his neat blue suit. His face
      relaxed; he made a little movement of one hand. Suddenly it shot through
      her: Suppose Mark had travelled with them, as he had wished to do? For
      ever and ever now, that dark massive creature, smiling down at her, was
      her enemy; from whom she must guard and keep herself if she could; keep,
      at all events, each one of her real thoughts and hopes! She could have
      writhed, and cried out; instead, she tightened her grip on the handle of
      her bag, and smiled. Though so skilled in knowledge of his moods, she
      felt, in his greeting, his fierce grip of her shoulders, the smouldering
      of some feeling the nature of which she could not quite fathom. His voice
      had a grim sincerity: "Glad you're back -- thought you were never
      coming!" Resigned to his charge, a feeling of sheer physical faintness so
      beset her that she could hardly reach the compartment he had reserved. It
      seemed to her that, for all her foreboding, she had not till this moment
      had the smallest inkling of what was now before her; and at his muttered:
      "Must we have the old fossils in?" she looked back to assure herself that
      her Uncle and Aunt were following. To avoid having to talk, she feigned to
      have travelled badly, leaning back with closed eyes, in her corner. If
      only she could open them and see, not this square-jawed face with its
      intent gaze of possession, but that other with its eager eyes humbly
      adoring her. The interminable journey ended all too soon. She clung quite
      desperately to the Colonel's hand on the platform at Charing Cross. When
      his kind face vanished she would be lost indeed! Then, in the closed cab,
      she heard her husband's: "Aren't you going to kiss me?" and submitted to
      his embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried so hard to think: What does it matter? It's not I, not my soul,
      my spirit -- only my miserable lips!
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard him say: "You don't seem too glad to see me!" And then: "I hear
      you had young Lennan out there. What was HE doing?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt the turmoil of sudden fear, wondered whether she was showing it,
      lost it in unnatural alertness -- all in the second before she
      answered: "Oh! just a holiday."
     </p>
    <p>
      Some seconds passed, and then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't mention him in your letters."
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered coolly: "Didn't I? We saw a good deal of him."
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew that he was looking at her -- an inquisitive, half-menacing
      regard. Why -- oh, why! -- could she not then and there cry out:
      "And I love him -- do you hear? -- I love him!" So awful did it seem
      to be denying her love with these half lies! But it was all so much more
      grim and hopeless than even she had thought. How inconceivable, now, that
      she had ever given herself up to this man for life! If only she could get
      away from him to her room, and scheme and think! For his eyes never left
      her, travelling over her with their pathetic greed, their menacing
      inquiry, till he said: "Well, it's not done you any harm. You look very
      fit." But his touch was too much even for her self-command, and she
      recoiled as if he had struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter? Did I hurt you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her that he was jeering -- then realized as vividly that
      he was not. And the full danger to her, perhaps to Mark himself, of
      shrinking from this man, striking her with all its pitiable force, she
      made a painful effort, slipped her hand under his arm, and said: "I'm very
      tired. You startled me."
     </p>
    <p>
      But he put her hand away, and turning his face, stared out of the window.
      And so they reached their home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had left her alone, she remained where she was standing, by her
      wardrobe, without sound or movement, thinking: What am I going to do? How
      am I going to live?
    </p>
    <p>
      IX
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mark Lennan, travelling through from Beaulieu, reached his rooms in
      Chelsea, he went at once to the little pile of his letters, twice hunted
      through them, then stood very still, with a stunned, sick feeling. Why had
      she not sent him that promised note? And now he realized -- though not
      yet to the full -- what it meant to be in love with a married woman. He
      must wait in this suspense for eighteen hours at least, till he could
      call, and find out what had happened to prevent her, till he could hear
      from her lips that she still loved him. The chilliest of legal lovers had
      access to his love, but he must possess a soul that was on fire, in this
      deadly patience, for fear of doing something that might jeopardize her.
      Telegraph? He dared not. Write? She would get it by the first post; but
      what could he say that was not dangerous, if Cramier chanced to see? Call?
      Still more impossible till three o'clock, at very earliest, to-morrow. His
      gaze wandered round the studio. Were these household gods, and all these
      works of his, indeed the same he had left twenty days ago? They seemed to
      exist now only in so far as she might come to see them -- come and sit
      in such a chair, and drink out of such a cup, and let him put this cushion
      for her back, and that footstool for her feet. And so vividly could he see
      her lying back in that chair looking across at him, that he could hardly
      believe she had never yet sat there. It was odd how -- without any
      resolution taken, without admission that their love could not remain
      platonic, without any change in their relations, save one humble kiss and
      a few whispered words -- everything was changed. A month or so ago, if
      he had wanted, he would have gone at once calmly to her house. It would
      have seemed harmless, and quite natural. Now it was impossible to do
      openly the least thing that strict convention did not find desirable.
      Sooner or later they would find him stepping over convention, and take him
      for what he was not -- a real lover! A real lover! He knelt down before
      the empty chair and stretched out his arms. No substance -- no warmth -- no
      fragrance -- nothing! Longing that passed through air, as the wind
      through grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the little round window, which overlooked the river. The last
      evening of May; gloaming above the water, dusk resting in the trees, and
      the air warm! Better to be out, and moving in the night, out in the ebb
      and flow of things, among others whose hearts were beating, than stay in
      this place that without her was so cold and meaningless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lamps -- the passion-fruit of towns -- were turning from pallor to
      full orange, and the stars were coming out. Half-past nine! At ten
      o'clock, and not before, he would walk past her house. To have this
      something to look forward to, however furtive and barren, helped. But on a
      Saturday night there would be no sitting at the House. Cramier would be at
      home; or they would both be out; or perhaps have gone down to their river
      cottage. Cramier! What cruel demon had presided over that marring of her
      life! Why had he never met her till after she had bound herself to this
      man! From a negative contempt for one who was either not sensitive enough
      to recognize that his marriage was a failure, or not chivalrous enough to
      make that failure bear as little hardly as possible on his wife, he had
      come already to jealous hatred as of a monster. To be face to face with
      Cramier in a mortal conflict could alone have satisfied his feeling....
      Yet he was a young man by nature gentle!
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart beat desperately as he approached that street -- one of those
      little old streets, so beautiful, that belonged to a vanished London. It
      was very narrow, there was no shelter; and he thought confusedly of what
      he could say, if met in this remote backwater that led nowhere. He would
      tell some lie, no doubt. Lies would now be his daily business. Lies and
      hatred, those violent things of life, would come to seem quite natural, in
      the violence of his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment, hesitating, by the rails of the old church. Black,
      white-veined, with shadowy summits, in that half darkness, it was like
      some gigantic vision. Mystery itself seemed modelled there. He turned and
      walked quickly down the street close to the houses on the further side.
      The windows of her house were lighted! So, she was not away! Dim light in
      the dining-room, lights in the room above -- her bedroom, doubtless.
      Was there no way to bring her to the window, no way his spirit could climb
      up there and beckon hers out to him? Perhaps she was not there, perhaps it
      was but a servant taking up hot water. He was at the end of the street by
      now, but to leave without once more passing was impossible. And this time
      he went slowly, his head down, feigning abstraction, grudging every inch
      of pavement, and all the time furtively searching that window with the
      light behind the curtains. Nothing! Once more he was close to the railings
      of the church, and once more could not bring himself to go away. In the
      little, close, deserted street, not a soul was moving, not even a cat or
      dog; nothing alive but many discreet, lighted windows. Like veiled faces,
      showing no emotion, they seemed to watch his indecision. And he thought:
      "Ah, well! I dare say there are lots like me. Lots as near, and yet as far
      away! Lots who have to suffer!" But what would he not have given for the
      throwing open of those curtains. Then, suddenly scared by an approaching
      figure, he turned and walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      X
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o'clock next day he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of her white drawing-room, whose latticed window ran the
      whole length of one wall, stood a little table on which was a silver jar
      full of early larkspurs, evidently from her garden by the river. And
      Lennan waited, his eyes fixed on those blossoms so like to little blue
      butterflies and strange-hued crickets, tethered to the pale green stems.
      In this room she passed her days, guarded from him. Once a week, at most,
      he would be able to come there -- once a week for an hour or two of the
      hundred and sixty-eight hours that he longed to be with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he was conscious of her. She had come in without sound, and
      was standing by the piano, so pale, in her cream-white dress, that her
      eyes looked jet black. He hardly knew that face, like a flower closed
      against cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had he done? What had happened in these five days to make her like
      this to him? He took her hands and tried to kiss them; but she said
      quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's in!"
     </p>
    <p>
      At that he stood silent, looking into that face, frozen to a dreadful
      composure, on the breaking up of which his very life seemed to depend. At
      last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? Am I nothing to you, after all?"
     </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as he had spoken he saw that he need not have asked, and flung
      his arms round her. She clung to him with desperation; then freed herself,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; let's sit down quietly!"
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, half-divining, half-refusing to admit all that lay behind that
      strange coldness, and this desperate embrace; all the self-pity, and
      self-loathing, shame, rage, and longing of a married woman for the first
      time face to face with her lover in her husband's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed now to be trying to make him forget her strange behaviour; to
      be what she had been during that fortnight in the sunshine. But, suddenly,
      just moving her lips, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick! When can we see each other? I will come to you to tea -- to-morrow,"
       and, following her eyes, he saw the door opening, and Cramier coming in.
      Unsmiling, very big in the low room, he crossed over to them, and offered
      his hand to Lennan; then drawing a low chair forward between their two
      chairs, sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you're back," he said. "Have a good time?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, yes; very."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Luck for Olive you were there; those places are dull holes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "It was luck for me."
     </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt." And with those words he turned to his wife. His elbows rested
      along the arms of his chair, so that his clenched palms were upwards; it
      was as if he knew that he was holding those two, gripped one in each hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder," he said slowly, "that fellows like you, with nothing in the
      world to tie them, ever sit down in a place like London. I should have
      thought Rome or Paris were your happy hunting-grounds." In his voice, in
      those eyes of his, a little bloodshot, with their look of power, in his
      whole attitude, there was a sort of muffled menace, and contempt, as
      though he were thinking: "Step into my path, and I will crush you!"
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lennan thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long must I sit here?" Then, past that figure planted solidly between
      them, he caught a look from her, swift, sure, marvellously timed -- again
      and again -- as if she were being urged by the very presence of this
      danger. One of those glances would surely -- surely be seen by Cramier.
      Is there need for fear that a swallow should dash itself against the wall
      over which it skims? But he got up, unable to bear it longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going?" That one suave word had an inimitable insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hardly see his hand touching Cramier's heavy fist. Then he
      realized that she was standing so that their faces when they must say
      good-bye could not be seen. Her eyes were smiling, yet imploring; her lips
      shaped the word: "To-morrow!" And squeezing her hand desperately, he got
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never dreamed that to see her in the presence of the man who owned
      her would be so terrible. For a moment he thought that he must give her
      up, give up a love that would drive him mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed on to an omnibus travelling West. Another twenty-four hours of
      starvation had begun. It did not matter at all what he did with them. They
      were simply so much aching that had to be got through somehow -- so
      much aching; and what relief at the end? An hour or two with her,
      desperately holding himself in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like most artists, and few Englishmen, he lived on feelings rather than on
      facts; so, found no refuge in decisive resolutions. But he made many -- the
      resolution to give her up; to be true to the ideal of service for no
      reward; to beseech her to leave Cramier and come to him -- and he made
      each many times.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Hyde Park Corner he got down, and went into the Park, thinking that to
      walk would help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great number of people were sitting there, taking mysterious anodyne,
      doing the right thing; to avoid them, he kept along the rails, and ran
      almost into the arms of Colonel and Mrs. Ercott, who were coming from the
      direction of Knightsbridge, slightly flushed, having lunched and talked of
      'Monte' at the house of a certain General.
    </p>
    <p>
      They greeted him with the surprise of those who had said to each other
      many times: "That young man will come rushing back!" It was very nice -- they
      said -- to run across him. When did he arrive? They had thought he was
      going on to Italy -- he was looking rather tired. They did not ask if
      he had seen her -- being too kind, and perhaps afraid that he would say
      'Yes,' which would be embarrassing; or that he would say 'No,' which would
      be still more embarrassing when they found that he ought to have said
      'Yes.' Would he not come and sit with them a little -- they were going
      presently to see how Olive was? Lennan perceived that they were warning
      him. And, forcing himself to look at them very straight, he said: "I have
      just been there."
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ercott phrased her impressions that same evening: "He looks quite
      hunted, poor young man! I'm afraid there's going to be fearful trouble
      there. Did you notice how quickly he ran away from us? He's thin, too; if
      it wasn't for his tan, he'd look really ill. The boy's eyes are so
      pathetic; and he used to have such a nice smile in them."
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel, who was fastening her hooks, paused in an operation that
      required concentration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a thousand pities," he muttered, "that he hasn't any work to do.
      That puddling about with clay or whatever he does is no good at all." And
      slowly fastening one hook, he unhooked several others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ercott went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I saw Olive, when she thought I wasn't looking; it was just as if
      she'd taken off a mask. But Robert Cramier will never put up with it. He's
      in love with her still; I watched him. It's tragic, John."
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel let his hands fall from the hooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I thought that," he said, "I'd do something."
     </p>
    <p>
      "If you could, it would not be tragic."
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel stared. There was always SOMETHING to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You read too many novels," he said, but without spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ercott smiled, and made no answer to an aspersion she had heard
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      XI
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lennan reached his rooms again after that encounter with the Ercotts,
      he found in his letterbox a visiting card: "Mrs. Doone" "Miss Sylvia
      Doone," and on it pencilled the words: "Do come and see us before we go
      down to Hayle -- Sylvia." He stared blankly at the round handwriting he
      knew so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia! Nothing perhaps could have made so plain to him how in this
      tornado of his passion the world was drowned. Sylvia! He had almost
      forgotten her existence; and yet, only last year, after he definitely
      settled down in London, he had once more seen a good deal of her; and even
      had soft thoughts of her again -- with her pale-gold hair, her true
      look, her sweetness. Then they had gone for the winter to Algiers for her
      mother's health.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came back, he had already avoided seeing her, though that was
      before Olive went to Monte Carlo, before he had even admitted his own
      feeling. And since -- he had not once thought of her. Not once! The
      world had indeed vanished. "Do come and see us -- Sylvia." The very
      notion was an irritation. No rest from aching and impatience to be had
      that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the idea came to him: Why not kill these hours of waiting for
      to-morrow's meeting by going on the river passing by her cottage? There
      was still one train that he could catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the village after dark, and spent the night at the inn; got up
      early next morning, took a boat, and pulled down-stream. The bluffs of the
      opposite bank were wooded with high trees. The sun shone softly on their
      leaves, and the bright stream was ruffled by a breeze that bent all the
      reeds and slowly swayed the water-flowers. One thin white line of wind
      streaked the blue sky. He shipped his sculls and drifted, listening to the
      wood-pigeons, watching the swallows chasing. If only she were here! To
      spend one long day thus, drifting with the stream! To have but one such
      rest from longing! Her cottage, he knew, lay on the same side as the
      village, and just beyond an island. She had told him of a hedge of
      yew-trees, and a white dovecote almost at the water's edge. He came to the
      island, and let his boat slide into the backwater. It was all overgrown
      with willow-trees and alders, dark even in this early morning radiance,
      and marvellously still. There was no room to row; he took the boathook and
      tried to punt, but the green water was too deep and entangled with great
      roots, so that he had to make his way by clawing with the hook at
      branches. Birds seemed to shun this gloom, but a single magpie crossed the
      one little clear patch of sky, and flew low behind the willows. The air
      here had a sweetish, earthy odour of too rank foliage; all brightness
      seemed entombed. He was glad to pass out again under a huge poplar-tree
      into the fluttering gold and silver of the morning. And almost at once he
      saw the yew-hedge at the border of some bright green turf, and a
      pigeon-house, high on its pole, painted cream-white. About it a number of
      ring-doves and snow-white pigeons were perched or flying; and beyond the
      lawn he could see the dark veranda of a low house, covered by wistaria
      just going out of flower. A drift of scent from late lilacs, and new-mown
      grass, was borne out to him, together with the sound of a mowing-machine,
      and the humming of many bees. It was beautiful here, and seemed, for all
      its restfulness, to have something of that flying quality he so loved
      about her face, about the sweep of her hair, the quick, soft turn of her
      eyes -- or was that but the darkness of the yew-trees, the whiteness of
      the dovecote, and the doves themselves, flying?
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay there a long time quietly beneath the bank, careful not to attract
      the attention of the old gardener, who was methodically pushing his
      machine across and across the lawn. How he wanted her with him then!
      Wonderful that there could be in life such beauty and wild softness as
      made the heart ache with the delight of it, and in that same life grey
      rules and rigid barriers -- coffins of happiness! That doors should be
      closed on love and joy! There was not so much of it in the world! She, who
      was the very spirit of this flying, nymph-like summer, was untimely
      wintered-up in bleak sorrow. There was a hateful unwisdom in that thought;
      it seemed so grim and violent, so corpse-like, gruesome, narrow and
      extravagant! What possible end could it serve that she should be unhappy!
      Even if he had not loved her, he would have hated her fate just as much -- all
      such stories of imprisoned lives had roused his anger even as a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soft white clouds -- those bright angels of the river, never very long
      away -- had begun now to spread their wings over the woods; and the
      wind had dropped so that the slumbrous warmth and murmuring of summer
      gathered full over the water. The old gardener had finished his job of
      mowing, and came with a little basket of grain to feed the doves. Lennan
      watched them going to him, the ring-doves, very dainty, and capricious,
      keeping to themselves. In place of that old fellow, he was really seeing
      HER, feeding from her hands those birds of Cypris. What a group he could
      have made of her with them perching and flying round her! If she were his,
      what could he not achieve -- to make her immortal -- like the old
      Greeks and Italians, who, in their work, had rescued their mistresses from
      Time! . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      He was back in his rooms in London two hours before he dared begin
      expecting her. Living alone there but for a caretaker who came every
      morning for an hour or two, made dust, and departed, he had no need for
      caution. And when he had procured flowers, and the fruits and cakes which
      they certainly would not eat -- when he had arranged the tea-table, and
      made the grand tour at least twenty times, he placed himself with a book
      at the little round window, to watch for her approach. There, very still,
      he sat, not reading a word, continually moistening his dry lips and
      sighing, to relieve the tension of his heart. At last he saw her coming.
      She was walking close to the railings of the houses, looking neither to
      right nor left. She had on a lawn frock, and a hat of the palest
      coffee-coloured straw, with a narrow black velvet ribbon. She crossed the
      side street, stopped for a second, gave a swift look round, then came
      resolutely on. What was it made him love her so? What was the secret of
      her fascination? Certainly, no conscious enticements. Never did anyone try
      less to fascinate. He could not recall one single little thing that she
      had done to draw him to her. Was it, perhaps, her very passivity, her
      native pride that never offered or asked anything, a sort of soft stoicism
      in her fibre; that and some mysterious charm, as close and intimate as
      scent was to a flower?
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited to open till he heard her footstep just outside. She came in
      without a word, not even looking at him. And he, too, said not a word till
      he had closed the door, and made sure of her. Then they turned to each
      other. Her breast was heaving a little, under her thin frock, but she was
      calmer than he, with that wonderful composure of pretty women in all the
      passages of love, as who should say: This is my native air!
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood and looked at each other, as if they could never have enough,
      till he said at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I should die before this moment came. There isn't a minute that
      I don't long for you so terribly that I can hardly live."
     </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think that I don't long for you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Then come to me!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him mournfully and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he had known that she would not. He had not earned her. What right
      had he to ask her to fly against the world, to brave everything, to have
      such faith in him -- as yet? He had no heart to press his words,
      beginning then to understand the paralyzing truth that there was no longer
      any resolving this or that; with love like his he had ceased to be a
      separate being with a separate will. He was entwined with her, could act
      only if her will and his were one. He would never be able to say to her:
      'You must!' He loved her too much. And she knew it. So there was nothing
      for it but to forget the ache, and make the hour happy. But how about that
      other truth -- that in love there is no pause, no resting?... With any
      watering, however scant, the flower will grow till its time comes to be
      plucked.... This oasis in the desert -- these few minutes with her
      alone, were swept through and through with a feverish wind. To be closer!
      How not try to be that? How not long for her lips when he had but her hand
      to kiss? And how not be poisoned with the thought that in a few minutes
      she would leave him and go back to the presence of that other, who, even
      though she loathed him, could see and touch her when he would? She was
      leaning back in the very chair where in fancy he had seen her, and he only
      dared sit at her feet and look up. And this, which a week ago would have
      been rapture, was now almost torture, so far did it fall short of his
      longing. It was torture, too, to keep his voice in tune with the sober
      sweetness of her voice. And bitterly he thought: How can she sit there,
      and not want me, as I want her? Then at a touch of her fingers on his
      hair, he lost control, and kissed her lips. Her surrender lasted only for
      a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no -- you must not!"
     </p>
    <p>
      That mournful surprise sobered him at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up, stood away from her, begged to be forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, when she was gone, he sat in the chair where she had sat. That clasp
      of her, the kiss he had begged her to forget -- to forget! -- nothing
      could take that from him. He had done wrong; had startled her, had fallen
      short of chivalry! And yet -- a smile of utter happiness would cling
      about his lips. His fastidiousness, his imagination almost made him think
      that this was all he wanted. If he could close his eyes, now, and pass
      out, before he lost that moment of half-fulfilment!
    </p>
    <p>
      And, the smile still on his lips, he lay back watching the flies wheeling
      and chasing round the hanging-lamp. Sixteen of them there were, wheeling
      and chasing -- never still!
    </p>
    <p>
      XII
    </p>
    <p>
      When, walking from Lennan's studio, Olive reentered her dark little hall,
      she approached its alcove and glanced first at the hat-stand. They were
      all there -- the silk hat, the bowler, the straw! So he was in! And
      within each hat, in turn, she seemed to see her husband's head -- with
      the face turned away from her -- so distinctly as to note the leathery
      look of the skin of his cheek and neck. And she thought: "I pray that he
      will die! It is wicked, but I pray that he will die!" Then, quietly, that
      he might not hear, she mounted to her bedroom. The door into his
      dressing-room was open, and she went to shut it. He was standing there at
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! You're in! Been anywhere?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "To the National Gallery."
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the first direct lie she had ever told him, and she was surprised
      to feel neither shame nor fear, but rather a sense of pleasure at
      defeating him. He was the enemy, all the more the enemy because she was
      still fighting against herself, and, so strangely, in his behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alone?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Rather boring, wasn't it? I should have thought you'd have got young
      Lennan to take you there."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
     </p>
    <p>
      By instinct she had seized on the boldest answer; and there was nothing to
      be told from her face. If he were her superior in strength, he was her
      inferior in quickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lowered his eyes, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "His line, isn't it?"
     </p>
    <p>
      With a shrug she turned away and shut the door. She sat down on the edge
      of her bed, very still. In that little passage of wits she had won, she
      could win in many such; but the full hideousness of things had come to
      her. Lies! lies! That was to be her life! That; or to say farewell to all
      she now cared for, to cause despair not only in herself, but in her lover,
      and -- for what? In order that her body might remain at the disposal of
      that man in the next room -- her spirit having flown from him for ever.
      Such were the alternatives, unless those words: "Then come to me," were to
      be more than words. Were they? Could they be? They would mean such
      happiness if -- if his love for her were more than a summer love? And
      hers for him? Was it -- were they -- more than summer loves? How
      know? And, without knowing, how give such pain to everyone? How break a
      vow she had thought herself quite above breaking? How make such a
      desperate departure from all the traditions and beliefs in which she had
      been brought up! But in the very nature of passion is that which resents
      the intrusion of hard and fast decisions.... And suddenly she thought: If
      our love cannot stay what it is, and if I cannot yet go to him for always,
      is there not still another way?
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up and began to dress for dinner. Standing before her glass she
      was surprised to see that her face showed no signs of the fears and doubts
      that were now her comrades. Was it because, whatever happened, she loved
      and was beloved! She wondered how she had looked when he kissed her so
      passionately; had she shown her joy before she checked him?
    </p>
    <p>
      In her garden by the river were certain flowers that, for all her care, would
      grow rank and of the wrong colour -- wanting a different soil. Was she,
      then, like those flowers of hers? Ah! Let her but have her true soil, and
      she would grow straight and true enough!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the doorway she saw her husband. She had never, till to-day, quite
      hated him; but now she did, with a real blind horrible feeling. What did
      he want of her standing there with those eyes fixed on her -- those
      forceful eyes, touched with blood, that seemed at once to threaten, covet,
      and beseech! She drew her wrapper close round her shoulders. At that he
      came up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at me, Olive!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Against instinct and will she obeyed, and he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be careful! I say, be careful!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he took her by the shoulders, and raised her up to him. And, quite
      unnerved, she stood without resisting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want you," he said; "I mean to keep you."
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly letting her go, he covered his eyes with his hands. That
      frightened her most -- it was so unlike him. Not till now had she
      understood between what terrifying forces she was balancing. She did not
      speak, but her face grew white. From behind those hands he uttered a
      sound, not quite like a human noise, turned sharply, and went out. She
      dropped back into the chair before her mirror, overcome by the most
      singular feeling she had ever known; as if she had lost everything, even
      her love for Lennan, and her longing for his love. What was it all worth,
      what was anything worth in a world like this? All was loathsome, herself
      loathsome! All was a void! Hateful, hateful, hateful! It was like having
      no heart at all! And that same evening, when her husband had gone down to
      the House, she wrote to Lennan:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our love must never turn to earthiness as it might have this afternoon.
      Everything is black and hopeless. HE suspects. For you to come here is
      impossible, and too dreadful for us both. And I have no right to ask you
      to be furtive, I can't bear to think of you like that, and I can't bear it
      myself. I don't know what to do or say. Don't try to see me yet. I must
      have time, I must think."
     </p>
    <p>
      XIII
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Ercott was not a racing man, but he had in common with others of
      his countrymen a religious feeling in the matter of the Derby. His
      remembrances of it went back to early youth, for he had been born and
      brought up almost within sound of the coaching-road to Epsom. Every Derby
      and Oaks day he had gone out on his pony to watch the passing of the tall
      hats and feathers of the great, and the pot-hats and feathers of the
      lowly; and afterwards, in the fields at home, had ridden races with old
      Lindsay, finishing between a cow that judged and a clump of bulrushes
      representing the Grand Stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for one reason or another he had never seen the great race, and the
      notion that it was his duty to see it had now come to him. He proposed
      this to Mrs. Ercott with some diffidence. She read so many books -- he
      did not quite know whether she would approve. Finding that she did, he
      added casually:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we might take Olive."
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ercott answered dryly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know the House of Commons has a holiday?"
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I don't want that chap!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps," said Mrs. Ercott, "you would like Mark Lennan."
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel looked at her most dubiously. Dolly could talk of it as a
      tragedy, and a -- a grand passion, and yet make a suggestion like that!
      Then his wrinkles began slowly to come alive, and he gave her waist a
      squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ercott did not resist that treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take Olive alone," she said. "I don't really care to go."
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Colonel went to fetch his niece he found her ready, and very
      half-heartedly he asked for Cramier. It appeared she had not told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relieved, yet somewhat disconcerted, he murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He won't mind not going, I suppose?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "If he went, I should not."
     </p>
    <p>
      At this quiet answer the Colonel was beset again by all his fears. He put
      his white 'topper' down, and took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," he said, "I don't want to intrude upon your feelings; but -- but
      is there anything I can do? It's dreadful to see things going unhappily
      with you!" He felt his hand being lifted, her face pressed against it;
      and, suffering acutely, with his other hand, cased in a bright new glove,
      he smoothed her arm. "We'll have a jolly good day, sweetheart," he said,
      "and forget all about it."
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave the hand a kiss and turned away. And the Colonel vowed to himself
      that she should not be unhappy -- lovely creature that she was, so
      delicate, and straight, and fine in her pearly frock. And he pulled
      himself together, brushing his white 'topper' vigorously with his sleeve,
      forgetting that this kind of hat has no nap.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he was tenderness itself on the journey down, satisfying all her
      wants before she had them, telling her stories of Indian life, and
      consulting her carefully as to which horse they should back. There was the
      Duke's, of course, but there was another animal that appealed to him
      greatly. His friend Tabor had given him the tip -- Tabor, who had the
      best Arabs in all India -- and at a nice price. A man who practically
      never gambled, the Colonel liked to feel that his fancy would bring him in
      something really substantial -- if it won; the idea that it could lose
      not really troubling him. However, they would see it in the paddock, and
      judge for themselves. The paddock was the place, away from all the dust
      and racket -- Olive would enjoy the paddock! Once on the course, they
      neglected the first race; it was more important, the Colonel thought, that
      they should lunch. He wanted to see more colour in her cheeks, wanted to
      see her laugh. He had an invitation to his old regiment's drag, where the
      champagne was sure to be good. And he was so proud of her -- would not
      have missed those young fellows' admiration of her for the world; though
      to take a lady amongst them was, in fact, against the rules. It was not,
      then, till the second race was due to start that they made their way into
      the paddock. Here the Derby horses were being led solemnly, attended each
      by a little posse of persons, looking up their legs and down their ribs to
      see whether they were worthy of support, together with a few who liked to
      see a whole horse at a time. Presently they found the animal which had
      been recommended to the Colonel. It was a chestnut, with a starred
      forehead, parading in a far corner. The Colonel, who really loved a horse,
      was deep in admiration. He liked its head and he liked its hocks; above
      all, he liked its eye. A fine creature, all sense and fire -- perhaps
      just a little straight in the shoulder for coming down the hill! And in
      the midst of his examination he found himself staring at his niece. What
      breeding the child showed, with her delicate arched brows, little ears,
      and fine, close nostrils; and the way she moved -- so sure and springy.
      She was too pretty to suffer! A shame! If she hadn't been so pretty that
      young fellow wouldn't have fallen in love with her. If she weren't so
      pretty -- that husband of hers wouldn't -- ! And the Colonel dropped
      his gaze, startled by the discovery he had stumbled on. If she hadn't been
      so pretty! Was that the meaning of it all? The cynicism of his own
      reflection struck him between wind and water. And yet something in himself
      seemed to confirm it somehow. What then? Was he to let them tear her in
      two between them, destroying her, because she was so pretty? And somehow
      this discovery of his -- that passion springs from worship of beauty
      and warmth, of form and colour -- disturbed him horribly, for he had no
      habit of philosophy. The thought seemed to him strangely crude, even
      immoral. That she should be thus between two ravening desires -- a bird
      between two hawks, a fruit between two mouths! It was a way of looking at
      things that had never before occurred to him. The idea of a husband
      clutching at his wife, the idea of that young man who looked so gentle,
      swooping down on her; and the idea that if she faded, lost her looks, went
      off, their greed, indeed, any man's, would die away -- all these
      horrible ideas hurt him the more for the remarkable suddenness with which
      they had come to him. A tragic business! Dolly had said so. Queer and
      quick -- were women! But his resolution that the day was to be jolly
      soon recurred to him, and he hastily resumed inspection of his fancy.
      Perhaps they ought to have a ten-pound note on it, and they had better get
      back to the Stand! And as they went the Colonel saw, standing beneath a
      tree at a little distance, a young man that he could have sworn was
      Lennan. Not likely for an artist chap to be down here! But it WAS
      undoubtedly young Lennan, brushed-up, in a top-hat. Fortunately, however,
      his face was not turned in their direction. He said nothing to Olive, not
      wishing -- especially after those unpleasant thoughts -- to take
      responsibility, and he kept her moving towards the gate, congratulating
      himself that his eyes had been so sharp. In the crush there he was
      separated from her a little, but she was soon beside him again; and more
      than ever he congratulated himself that nothing had occurred to upset her
      and spoil the day. Her cheeks were warm enough now, her dark eyes glowing.
      She was excited no doubt by thoughts of the race, and of the 'tenner' he
      was going to put on for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recounted the matter afterwards to Mrs. Ercott. "That chestnut Tabor
      put me on to finished nowhere -- couldn't get down the hill -- knew
      it wouldn't the moment I set eyes on it. But the child enjoyed herself.
      Wish you'd been there, my dear!" Of his deeper thoughts and of that
      glimpse of young Lennan he did not speak, for on the way home an ugly
      suspicion had attacked him. Had the young fellow, after all, seen and
      managed to get close to her in the crush at the paddock gateway?
    </p>
    <p>
      XIV
    </p>
    <p>
      That letter of hers fanned the flame in Lennan as nothing had yet fanned
      it. Earthiness! Was it earthiness to love as he did? If so, then not for
      all the world would he be otherwise than earthy. In the shock of reading
      it, he crossed his Rubicon, and burned his boats behind him. No more did
      the pale ghost, chivalrous devotion, haunt him. He knew now that he could
      not stop short. Since she asked him, he must not, of course, try to see
      her just yet. But when he did, then he would fight for his life; the
      thought that she might be meaning to slip away from him was too utterly
      unbearable. But she could not be meaning that! She would never be so
      cruel! Ah! she would -- she must come to him in the end! The world,
      life itself, would be well lost for love of her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus resolved, he was even able to work again; and all that Tuesday he
      modelled at a big version of the fantastic, bull-like figure he had
      conceived after the Colonel left him up on the hillside at Beaulieu. He
      worked at it with a sort of evil joy. Into this creature he would put the
      spirit of possession that held her from him. And while his fingers forced
      the clay, he felt as if he had Cramier's neck within his grip. Yet, now
      that he had resolved to take her if he could, he had not quite the same
      hatred. After all, this man loved her too, could not help it that she
      loathed him; could not help it that he had the disposition of her, body
      and soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      June had come in with skies of a blue that not even London glare and dust
      could pale. In every square and park and patch of green the air simmered
      with life and with the music of birds swaying on little boughs. Piano
      organs in the streets were no longer wistful for the South; lovers already
      sat in the shade of trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      To remain indoors, when he was not working, was sheer torture; for he
      could not read, and had lost all interest in the little excitements,
      amusements, occupations that go to make up the normal life of man. Every
      outer thing seemed to have dropped off, shrivelled, leaving him just a
      condition of the spirit, a state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying awake he would think of things in the past, and they would mean
      nothing -- all dissolved and dispersed by the heat of this feeling in
      him. Indeed, his sense of isolation was so strong that he could not even
      believe that he had lived through the facts which his memory apprehended.
      He had become one burning mood -- that, and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be out, especially amongst trees, was the only solace.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he sat for a long time that evening under a large lime-tree on a knoll
      above the Serpentine. There was very little breeze, just enough to keep
      alive a kind of whispering. What if men and women, when they had lived
      their gusty lives, became trees! What if someone who had burned and ached
      were now spreading over him this leafy peace -- this blue-black shadow
      against the stars? Or were the stars, perhaps, the souls of men and women
      escaped for ever from love and longing? He broke off a branch of the lime
      and drew it across his face. It was not yet in flower, but it smelled
      lemony and fresh even here in London. If only for a moment he could desert
      his own heart, and rest with the trees and stars!
    </p>
    <p>
      No further letter came from her next morning, and he soon lost his power
      to work. It was Derby Day. He determined to go down. Perhaps she would be
      there. Even if she were not, he might find some little distraction in the
      crowd and the horses. He had seen her in the paddock long before the
      Colonel's sharp eyes detected him; and, following in the crush, managed to
      touch her hand in the crowded gateway, and whisper: "To-morrow, the
      National Gallery, at four o'clock -- by the Bacchus and Ariadne. For
      God's sake!" Her gloved hand pressed his hard; and she was gone. He stayed
      in the paddock, too happy almost to breathe....
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, while waiting before that picture, he looked at it with wonder.
      For there seemed his own passion transfigured in the darkening
      star-crowned sky, and the eyes of the leaping god. In spirit, was he not
      always rushing to her like that? Minutes passed, and she did not come.
      What should he do if she failed him? Surely die of disappointment and
      despair.... He had little enough experience as yet of the toughness of the
      human heart; how life bruises and crushes, yet leaves it beating.... Then,
      from an unlikely quarter, he saw her coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked in silence down to the quiet rooms where the Turner
      watercolours hung. No one, save two Frenchmen and an old official, watched
      them passing slowly before those little pictures, till they came to the
      end wall, and, unseen, unheard by any but her, he could begin!
    </p>
    <p>
      The arguments he had so carefully rehearsed were all forgotten; nothing
      left but an incoherent pleading. Life without her was not life; and they
      had only one life for love -- one summer. It was all dark where she was
      not -- the very sun itself was dark. Better to die than to live such
      false, broken lives, apart from each other. Better to die at once than to
      live wanting each other, longing and longing, and watching each other's
      sorrow. And all for the sake of what? It maddened, killed him, to think of
      that man touching her when he knew she did but hate him. It shamed all
      manhood; it could not be good to help such things to be. A vow when the
      spirit of it was gone was only superstition; it was wicked to waste one's
      life for the sake of that. Society -- she knew, she must know -- only
      cared for the forms, the outsides of things. And what did it matter what
      Society thought? It had no soul, no feeling, nothing. And if it were said
      they ought to sacrifice themselves for the sake of others, to make things
      happier in the world, she must know that was only true when love was light
      and selfish; but not when people loved as they did, with all their hearts
      and souls, so that they would die for each other any minute, so that
      without each other there was no meaning in anything. It would not help a
      single soul, for them to murder their love and all the happiness of their
      lives; to go on in a sort of living death. Even if it were wrong, he would
      rather do that wrong, and take the consequences! But it was not, it COULD
      not be wrong, when they felt like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time that he was pouring forth those supplications, his eyes
      searched and searched her face. But there only came from her: "I don't
      know -- I can't tell -- if only I knew!" And then he was silent,
      stricken to the heart; till, at a look or a touch from her, he would break
      out again: "You do love me -- you do; then what does anything else
      matter?"
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it went on and on that summer afternoon, in the deserted room meant
      for such other things, where the two Frenchmen were too sympathetic, and
      the old official too drowsy, to come. Then it all narrowed to one fierce,
      insistent question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it -- WHAT is it you're afraid of?"
     </p>
    <p>
      But to that, too, he got only the one mournful answer, paralyzing in its
      fateful monotony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know -- I can't tell!"
     </p>
    <p>
      It was awful to go on thus beating against this uncanny, dark, shadowy
      resistance; these unreal doubts and dreads, that by their very dumbness
      were becoming real to him, too. If only she could tell him what she
      feared! It could not be poverty -- that was not like her -- besides,
      he had enough for both. It could not be loss of a social position, which
      was but irksome to her! Surely it was not fear that he would cease to love
      her! What was it? In God's name -- what?
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow -- she had told him -- she was to go down, alone, to the
      river-house; would she not come now, this very minute, to him instead? And
      they would start off -- that night, back to the South where their love
      had flowered. But again it was: "I can't! I don't know -- I must have
      time!" And yet her eyes had that brooding love-light. How COULD she hold
      back and waver? But, utterly exhausted, he did not plead again; did not
      even resist when she said: "You must go, now; and leave me to get back! I
      will write. Perhaps -- soon -- I shall know." He begged for, and
      took one kiss; then, passing the old official, went quickly up and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      XV
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached his rooms overcome by a lassitude that was not, however, quite
      despair. He had made his effort, failed -- but there was still within
      him the unconquerable hope of the passionate lover.... As well try to
      extinguish in full June the beating of the heart of summer; deny to the
      flowers their deepening hues, or to winged life its slumbrous buzzing, as
      stifle in such a lover his conviction of fulfilment....
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay down on a couch, and there stayed a long time quite still, his
      forehead pressed against the wall. His will was already beginning to
      recover for a fresh attempt. It was merciful that she was going away from
      Cramier, going to where he had in fancy watched her feed her doves. No
      laws, no fears, not even her commands could stop his fancy from conjuring
      her up by day and night. He had but to close his eyes, and she was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ring at the bell, repeated several times, roused him at last to go to
      the door. His caller was Robert Cramier. And at sight of him, all Lennan's
      lethargy gave place to a steely feeling. What had brought him here? Had he
      been spying on his wife? The old longing for physical combat came over
      him. Cramier was perhaps fifteen years his senior, but taller, heavier,
      thicker. Chances, then, were pretty equal!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you come in?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks."
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice had in it the same mockery as on Sunday; and it shot through him
      that Cramier had thought to find his wife here. If so, he did not betray
      it by any crude look round. He came in with his deliberate step, light and
      well-poised for so big a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So this," he said, "is where you produce your masterpieces! Anything
      great since you came back?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan lifted the cloths from the half-modelled figure of his bull-man. He
      felt malicious pleasure in doing that. Would Cramier recognize himself in
      this creature with the horn-like ears, and great bossed forehead? If this
      man who had her happiness beneath his heel had come here to mock, he
      should at all events get what he had come to give. And he waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. You are giving the poor brute horns!"
     </p>
    <p>
      If Cramier had seen, he had dared to add a touch of cynical humour, which
      the sculptor himself had never thought of. And this even evoked in the
      young man a kind of admiring compunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those are not horns," he said gently; "only ears."
     </p>
    <p>
      Cramier lifted a hand and touched the edge of his own ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite like that, are they -- human ears? But I suppose you would
      call this symbolic. What, if I may ask, does it represent?"
     </p>
    <p>
      All the softness in Lennan vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can't gather that from looking, it must be a failure."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. If I am right, you want something for it to tread on, don't
      you, to get your full effect?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan touched the base of the clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The broken curve here" -- then, with sudden disgust at this fencing,
      was silent. What had the man come for? He must want something. And, as if
      answering, Cramier said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To pass to another subject -- you see a good deal of my wife. I just
      wanted to tell you that I don't very much care that you should. It is as
      well to be quite frank, I think."
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that not," he said, "perhaps rather a matter for HER decision?"
     </p>
    <p>
      That heavy figure -- those threatening eyes! The whole thing was like a
      dream come true!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not feel it so. I am not one of those who let things drift. Please
      understand me. You come between us at your peril."
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan kept silence for a moment, then he said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can one come between two people who have ceased to have anything in
      common?"
     </p>
    <p>
      The veins in Cramier's forehead were swollen, his face and neck had grown
      crimson. And Lennan thought with strange elation: Now he's going to hit
      me! He could hardly keep his hands from shooting out and seizing in
      advance that great strong neck. If he could strangle, and have done with
      him!
    </p>
    <p>
      But, quite suddenly, Cramier turned on his heel. "I have warned you," he
      said, and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lennan took a long breath. So! That was over, and he knew where he was. If
      Cramier had struck out, he would surely have seized his neck and held on
      till life was gone. Nothing should have shaken him off. In fancy he could
      see himself swaying, writhing, reeling, battered about by those heavy
      fists, but always with his hands on the thick neck, squeezing out its
      life. He could feel, absolutely feel, the last reel and stagger of that
      great bulk crashing down, dragging him with it, till it lay upturned,
      still. He covered his eyes with his hands.... Thank God! The fellow had
      not hit out!
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the door, opened it, and stood leaning against the door-post.
      All was still and drowsy out there in that quiet backwater of a street.
      Not a soul in sight! How still, for London! Only the birds. In a
      neighbouring studio someone was playing Chopin. Queer! He had almost
      forgotten there was such a thing as Chopin. A mazurka! Spinning like some
      top thing, round and round -- weird little tune!... Well, and what now?
      Only one thing certain. Sooner give up life than give her up! Far sooner!
      Love her, achieve her -- or give up everything, and drown to that tune
      going on and on, that little dancing dirge of summer!
    </p>
    <p>
      XVI
    </p>
    <p>
      At her cottage Olive stood often by the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      What lay beneath all that bright water -- what strange, deep, swaying,
      life so far below the ruffling of wind, and the shadows of the willow
      trees? Was love down there, too? Love between sentient things, where it
      was almost dark; or had all passion climbed up to rustle with the reeds,
      and float with the water-flowers in the sunlight? Was there colour? Or had
      colour been drowned? No scent and no music; but movement there would be,
      for all the dim groping things bending one way to the current -- movement,
      no less than in the aspen-leaves, never quite still, and the winged droves
      of the clouds. And if it were dark down there, it was dark, too, above the
      water; and hearts ached, and eyes just as much searched for that which did
      not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      To watch it always flowing by to the sea; never looking back, never
      swaying this way or that; drifting along, quiet as Fate -- dark, or
      glamorous with the gold and moonlight of these beautiful days and nights,
      when every flower in her garden, in the fields, and along the river banks,
      was full of sweet life; when dog-roses starred the lanes, and in the wood
      the bracken was nearly a foot high.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not alone there, though she would much rather have been; two days
      after she left London her Uncle and Aunt had joined her. It was from
      Cramier they had received their invitation. He himself had not yet been
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night, having parted from Mrs. Ercott and gone up the wide shallow
      stairs to her room, she would sit down at the window to write to Lennan,
      one candle beside her -- one pale flame for comrade, as it might be his
      spirit. Every evening she poured out to him her thoughts, and ended
      always: "Have patience!" She was still waiting for courage to pass that
      dark hedge of impalpable doubts and fears and scruples, of a dread that
      she could not make articulate even to herself. Having finished, she would
      lean out into the night. The Colonel, his black figure cloaked against the
      dew, would be pacing up and down the lawn, with his good-night cigar,
      whose fiery spark she could just discern; and, beyond, her ghostly
      dove-house; and, beyond, the river -- flowing. Then she would clasp
      herself close -- afraid to stretch out her arms, lest she should be
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each morning she rose early, dressed, and slipped away to the village to
      post her letter. From the woods across the river wild pigeons would be
      calling -- as though Love itself pleaded with her afresh each day. She
      was back well before breakfast, to go up to her room and come down again
      as if for the first time. The Colonel, meeting her on the stairs, or in
      the hall, would say: "Ah, my dear! just beaten you! Slept well?" And,
      while her lips touched his cheek, slanted at the proper angle for uncles,
      he never dreamed that she had been three miles already through the dew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that she was in the throes of an indecision, whose ending, one way or
      the other, must be so tremendous, now that she was in the very swirl, she
      let no sign at all escape her; the Colonel and even his wife were deceived
      into thinking that after all no great harm had been done. It was grateful
      to them to think so, because of that stewardship at Monte Carlo, of which
      they could not render too good account. The warm sleepy days, with a
      little croquet and a little paddling on the river, and much sitting out of
      doors, when the Colonel would read aloud from Tennyson, were very
      pleasant. To him -- if not to Mrs. Ercott -- it was especially jolly
      to be out of Town 'this confounded crowded time of year.' And so the days
      of early June went by, each finer than the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Cramier came down, without warning on a Friday evening. It was
      hot in London...the session dull.... The Jubilee turning everything upside
      down.... They were lucky to be out of Town!
    </p>
    <p>
      A silent dinner -- that!

      Mrs. Ercott noticed that he drank wine like water, and for minutes at a
      time fixed his eyes, that looked heavy as if he had not been sleeping, not
      on his wife's face but on her neck. If Olive really disliked and feared
      him -- as John would have it -- she disguised her feelings very
      well! For so pale a woman she was looking brilliant that night. The sun
      had caught her cheeks, perhaps. That black low-cut frock suited her, with
      old Milanese-point lace matching her skin so well, and one carnation, of
      darkest red, at her breast. Her eyes were really sometimes like black
      velvet. It suited pale women to have those eyes, that looked so black at
      night! She was talking, too, and laughing more than usual. One would have
      said: A wife delighted to welcome her husband! And yet there was something -- something
      in the air, in the feel of things -- the lowering fixity of that man's
      eyes, or -- thunder coming, after all this heat! Surely the night was
      unnaturally still and dark, hardly a breath of air, and so many moths out
      there, passing the beam of light, like little pale spirits crossing a
      river! Mrs. Ercott smiled, pleased at that image. Moths! Men were like
      moths; there were women from whom they could not keep away. Yes, there was
      something about Olive that drew men to her. Not meretricious -- to do
      her justice, not that at all; but something soft, and-fatal; like one of
      these candle-flames to the poor moths. John's eyes were never quite as she
      knew them when he was looking at Olive; and Robert Cramier's -- what a
      queer, drugged look they had! As for that other poor young fellow -- she
      had never forgotten his face when they came on him in the Park!
    </p>
    <p>
      And when after dinner they sat on the veranda, they were all more silent
      still, just watching, it seemed, the smoke of their cigarettes, rising
      quite straight, as though wind had been withdrawn from the world. The
      Colonel twice endeavoured to speak about the moon: It ought to be up by
      now! It was going to be full.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Cramier said: "Put on that scarf thing, Olive, and come round the
      garden with me."
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ercott admitted to herself now that what John said was true. Just one
      gleam of eyes, turned quickly this way and that, as a bird looks for
      escape; and then Olive had got up and quietly gone with him down the path,
      till their silent figures were lost to sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disturbed to the heart, Mrs. Ercott rose and went over to her husband's
      chair. He was frowning, and staring at his evening shoe balanced on a
      single toe. He looked up at her and put out his hand. Mrs. Ercott gave it
      a squeeze; she wanted comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's heavy to-night, Dolly. I don't like the feel of it."
     </p>
    <p>
      XVII
    </p>
    <p>
      They had passed without a single word spoken, down through the laurels and
      guelder roses to the river bank; then he had turned to the right, and gone
      along it under the dove-house, to the yew-trees. There he had stopped, in
      the pitch darkness of that foliage. It seemed to her dreadfully still; if
      only there had been the faintest breeze, the faintest lisping of reeds on
      the water, one bird to make a sound; but nothing, nothing save his
      breathing, deep, irregular, with a quiver in it. What had he brought her
      here for? To show her how utterly she was his? Was he never going to
      speak, never going to say whatever it was he had in mind to say? If only
      he would not touch her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he moved, and a stone dislodged fell with a splash into the water.
      She could not help a little gasp. How black the river looked! But slowly,
      beyond the dim shape of the giant poplar, a shiver of light stole outwards
      across the blackness from the far bank -- the moon, whose rim she could
      now see rising, of a thick gold like a coin, above the woods. Her heart
      went out to that warm light. At all events there was one friendly
      inhabitant of this darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she felt his hands on her waist. She did not move, her heart beat
      too furiously; but a sort of prayer fluttered up from it against her lips.
      In the grip of those heavy hands was such quivering force!
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice sounded very husky and strange: "Olive, this can't go on. I
      suffer. My God! I suffer!"
     </p>
    <p>
      A pang went through her, a sort of surprise. Suffer! She might wish him
      dead, but she did not want him to suffer -- God knew! And yet, gripped
      by those hands, she could not say: I am sorry!
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a sound that was almost a groan, and dropped on his knees. Feeling
      herself held fast, she tried to push his forehead back from her waist. It
      was fiery hot; and she heard him mutter: "Have mercy! Love me a little!"
       But the clutch of his hands, never still on the thin silk of her dress,
      turned her faint. She tried to writhe away, but could not; stood still
      again, and at last found her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy? Can I MAKE myself love? No one ever could since the world began.
      Please, please get up. Let me go!"
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was pulling her down to him so that she was forced on to her knees
      on the grass, with her face close to his. A low moaning was coming from
      him. It was horrible -- so horrible! And he went on pleading, the words
      all confused, not looking in her face. It seemed to her that it would
      never end, that she would never get free of that grip, away from that
      stammering, whispering voice. She stayed by instinct utterly still,
      closing her eyes. Then she felt his gaze for the first time that evening
      on her face, and realized that he had not dared to look until her eyes
      were closed, for fear of reading what was in them. She said very gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please let me go. I think I'm going to faint."
     </p>
    <p>
      He relaxed the grip of his arms; she sank down and stayed unmoving on the
      grass. After such utter stillness that she hardly knew whether he were
      there or not, she felt his hot hand on her bare shoulder. Was it all to
      begin again? She shrank down lower still, and a little moan escaped her.
      He let her go suddenly, and, when at last she looked up, was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got to her feet trembling, and moved quickly from under the yew-trees.
      She tried to think -- tried to understand exactly what this portended
      for her, for him, for her lover. But she could not. There was around her
      thoughts the same breathless darkness that brooded over this night. Ah!
      but to the night had been given that pale-gold moon-ray, to herself
      nothing, no faintest gleam; as well try to pierce below the dark surface
      of that water!
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed her hands over her face, and hair, and dress. How long had it
      lasted? How long had they been out here? And she began slowly moving back
      towards the house. Thank God! She had not yielded to fear or pity, not
      uttered falsities, not pretended she could love him, and betrayed her
      heart. That would have been the one unbearable thing to have been left
      remembering! She stood long looking down, as if trying to see the future
      in her dim flower-beds; then, bracing herself, hurried to the house. No
      one was on the veranda, no one in the drawing-room. She looked at the
      clock. Nearly eleven. Ringing for the servant to shut the windows, she
      stole up to her room. Had her husband gone away as he had come? Or would
      she presently again be face to face with that dread, the nerve of which
      never stopped aching now, dread of the night when he was near? She
      determined not to go to bed, and drawing a long chair to the window,
      wrapped herself in a gown, and lay back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flower from her dress, miraculously uncrushed in those dark minutes on
      the grass, she set in water beside her at the window -- Mark's
      favourite flower, he had once told her; it was a comfort, with its scent,
      and hue, and memory of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange that in her life, with all the faces seen, and people known, she
      had not loved one till she had met Lennan! She had even been sure that
      love would never come to her; had not wanted it -- very much; had
      thought to go on well enough, and pass out at the end, never having known,
      or much cared to know, full summer. Love had taken its revenge on her now
      for all slighted love offered her in the past; for the one hated love that
      had to-night been on its knees to her. They said it must always come once
      to every man and woman -- this witchery, this dark sweet feeling,
      springing up, who knew how or why? She had not believed, but now she knew.
      And whatever might be coming, she would not have this different. Since all
      things changed, she must change and get old and be no longer pretty for
      him to look at, but this in her heart could not change. She felt sure of
      that. It was as if something said: This is for ever, beyond life, beyond
      death, this is for ever! He will be dust, and you dust, but your love will
      live! Somewhere -- in the woods, among the flowers, or down in the dark
      water, it will haunt! For it only you have lived!... Then she noticed that
      a slender silvery-winged thing, unlike any moth she had ever seen, had
      settled on her gown, close to her neck. It seemed to be sleeping, so
      delicate and drowsy, having come in from the breathless dark, thinking,
      perhaps, that her whiteness was a light. What dim memory did it rouse;
      something of HIM, something HE had done -- in darkness, on a night like
      this. Ah, yes! that evening after Gorbio, the little owl-moth on her knee!
      He had touched her when he took that cosy wan velvet-eyed thing off her!
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned out for air. What a night! -- whose stars were hiding in the
      sheer heavy warmth; whose small, round, golden moon had no transparency! A
      night like a black pansy with a little gold heart. And silent! For, of the
      trees, that whispered so much at night, not even the aspens had voice. The
      unstirring air had a dream-solidity against her cheeks. But in all the
      stillness, what sentiency, what passion -- as in her heart! Could she
      not draw HIM to her from those woods, from that dark gleaming river, draw
      him from the flowers and trees and the passion-mood of the sky -- draw
      him up to her waiting here, so that she was no more this craving creature,
      but one with him and the night! And she let her head droop down on her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night long she stayed there at the window. Sometimes dozing in the
      chair; once waking with a start, fancying that her husband was bending
      over her. Had he been -- and stolen away? And the dawn came; dew-grey,
      filmy and wistful, woven round each black tree, and round the white
      dove-cot, and falling scarf-like along the river. And the chirrupings of
      birds stirred among leaves as yet invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slept then.
    </p>
    <p>
      XVIII
    </p>
    <p>
      When she awoke once more, in daylight, smiling, Cramier was standing
      beside her chair. His face, all dark and bitter, had the sodden look of a
      man very tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So!" he said: "Sleeping this way doesn't spoil your dreams. Don't let me
      disturb them. I am just going back to Town."
     </p>
    <p>
      Like a frightened bird, she stayed, not stirring, gazing at his back as he
      leaned in the window, till, turning round on her again, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But remember this: What I can't have, no one else shall! Do you
      understand? No one else!" And he bent down close, repeating: "Do you
      understand -- you bad wife!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Four years' submission to a touch she shrank from; one long effort not to
      shrink! Bad wife! Not if he killed her would she answer now!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you hear?" he said once more: "Make up your mind to that. I mean it."
     </p>
    <p>
      He had gripped the arms of her chair, till she could feel it quiver
      beneath her. Would he drive his fist into her face that she managed to
      keep still smiling? But there only passed into his eyes an expression
      which she could not read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "you know!" and walked heavily towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he had gone she sprang up: Yes, she was a bad wife! A wife who
      had reached the end of her tether. A wife who hated instead of loving. A
      wife in prison! Bad wife! Martyrdom, then, for the sake of a faith in her
      that was lost already, could be but folly. If she seemed bad and false to
      him, there was no longer reason to pretend to be otherwise. No longer
      would she, in the words of the old song: -- 'sit and sigh -- pulling
      bracken, pulling bracken.' No more would she starve for want of love, and
      watch the nights throb and ache, as last night had throbbed and ached,
      with the passion that she might not satisfy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while she was dressing she wondered why she did not look tired. To get
      out quickly! To send her lover word at once to hasten to her while it was
      safe -- that she might tell him she was coming to him out of prison!
      She would telegraph for him to come that evening with a boat, opposite the
      tall poplar. She and her Aunt and Uncle were to go to dinner at the
      Rectory, but she would plead headache at the last minute. When the Ercotts
      had gone she would slip out, and he and she would row over to the wood,
      and be together for two hours of happiness. And they must make a clear
      plan, too -- for to-morrow they would begin their life together. But it
      would not be safe to send that message from the village; she must go down
      and over the bridge to the post-office on the other side, where they did
      not know her. It was too late now before breakfast. Better after, when she
      could slip away, knowing for certain that her husband had gone. It would
      still not be too late for her telegram -- Lennan never left his rooms
      till the midday post which brought her letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      She finished dressing, and knowing that she must show no trace of her
      excitement, sat quite still for several minutes, forcing herself into
      languor. Then she went down. Her husband had breakfasted and gone. At
      everything she did, and every word she spoke, she was now smiling with a
      sort of wonder, as if she were watching a self, that she had abandoned
      like an old garment, perform for her amusement. It even gave her no
      feeling of remorse to think she was going to do what would be so painful
      to the good Colonel. He was dear to her -- but it did not matter. She
      was past all that. Nothing mattered -- nothing in the world! It amused
      her to believe that her Uncle and Aunt misread her last night's walk in
      the dark garden, misread her languor and serenity. And at the first moment
      possible she flew out, and slipped away under cover of the yew-trees
      towards the river. Passing the spot where her husband had dragged her down
      to him on her knees in the grass, she felt a sort of surprise that she
      could ever have been so terrified. What was he? The past -- nothing!
      And she flew on. She noted carefully the river bank opposite the tall
      poplar. It would be quite easy to get down from there into a boat. But
      they would not stay in that dark backwater. They would go over to the far
      side into those woods from which last night the moon had risen, those
      woods from which the pigeons mocked her every morning, those woods so full
      of summer. Coming back, no one would see her landing; for it would be
      pitch dark in the backwater. And, while she hurried, she looked back
      across her shoulder, marking where the water, entering, ceased to be
      bright. A dragon-fly brushed her cheek; she saw it vanish where the
      sunlight failed. How suddenly its happy flight was quenched in that dark
      shade, as a candle flame blown out. The tree growth there was too thick -- the
      queer stumps and snags had uncanny shapes, as of monstrous creatures,
      whose eyes seemed to peer out at you. She shivered. She had seen those
      monsters with their peering eyes somewhere. Ah! In her dream at Monte
      Carlo of that bull-face staring from the banks, while she drifted by,
      unable to cry out. No! The backwater was not a happy place -- they
      would not stay there a single minute. And more swiftly than ever she flew
      on along the path. Soon she had crossed the bridge, sent off her message,
      and returned. But there were ten hours to get through before eight
      o'clock, and she did not hurry now. She wanted this day of summer to
      herself alone, a day of dreaming till he came; this day for which all her
      life till now had been shaping her -- the day of love. Fate was very
      wonderful! If she had ever loved before; if she had known joy in her
      marriage -- she could never have been feeling what she was feeling now,
      what she well knew she would never feel again. She crossed a new-mown
      hayfield, and finding a bank, threw herself down on her back among its
      uncut grasses. Far away at the other end men were scything. It was all
      very beautiful -- the soft clouds floating, the clover-stalks pushing
      themselves against her palms, and stems of the tall couch grass cool to
      her cheeks; little blue butterflies; a lark, invisible; the scent of the
      ripe hay; and the gold-fairy arrows of the sun on her face and limbs. To
      grow and reach the hour of summer; all must do that! That was the meaning
      of Life! She had no more doubts and fears. She had no more dread, no
      bitterness, and no remorse for what she was going to do. She was doing it
      because she must.... As well might grass stay its ripening because it
      shall be cut down! She had, instead, a sense of something blessed and
      uplifting. Whatever Power had made her heart, had placed within it this
      love. Whatever it was, whoever it was, could not be angry with her!
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild bee settled on her arm, and she held it up between her and the sun,
      so that she might enjoy its dusky glamour. It would not sting her -- not
      to-day! The little blue butterflies, too, kept alighting on her, who lay
      there so still. And the love-songs of the wood-pigeons never ceased, nor
      the faint swish of scything.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she rose to make her way home. A telegram had come saying simply:
      "Yes." She read it with an unmoved face, having resorted again to her mask
      of languor. Toward tea-time she confessed to headache, and said she would
      lie down. Up there in her room she spent those three hours writing -- writing
      as best she could all she had passed through in thought and feeling,
      before making her decision. It seemed to her that she owed it to herself
      to tell her lover how she had come to what she had never thought to come
      to. She put what she had written in an envelope and sealed it. She would
      give it to him, that he might read and understand, when she had shown him
      with all of her how she loved him. It would pass the time for him, until
      to-morrow -- until they set out on their new life together. For
      to-night they would make their plans, and to-morrow start.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past seven she sent word that her headache was too bad to allow
      her to go out. This brought a visit from Mrs. Ercott: The Colonel and she
      were so distressed; but perhaps Olive was wise not to exert herself! And
      presently the Colonel himself spoke, lugubriously through the door: Not
      well enough to come? No fun without her! But she mustn't on any account
      strain herself! No, no!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart smote her at that. He was always so good to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, watching from the corridor, she saw them sally forth down the
      drive -- the Colonel a little in advance, carrying his wife's evening
      shoes. How nice he looked -- with his brown face, and his grey
      moustache; so upright, and concerned with what he had in hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no languor in her now. She had dressed in white, and now she
      took a blue silk cloak with a hood, and caught up the flower that had so
      miraculously survived last night's wearing and pinned it at her breast.
      Then making sure no servant was about, she slipped downstairs and out. It
      was just eight, and the sun still glistened on the dove-cot. She kept away
      from that lest the birds should come fluttering about her, and betray her
      by cooing. When she had nearly reached the tow-path, she stopped
      affrighted. Surely something had moved, something heavy, with a sound of
      broken branches. Was it the memory of last night come on her again; or,
      indeed, someone there? She walked back a few steps. Foolish alarm! In the
      meadow beyond a cow was brushing against the hedge. And, stealing along
      the grass, out on to the tow-path, she went swiftly towards the poplar.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIX
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred times in these days of her absence Lennan had been on the point
      of going down, against her orders, just to pass the house, just to feel
      himself within reach, to catch a glimpse of her, perhaps, from afar. If
      his body haunted London, his spirit had passed down on to that river where
      he had drifted once already, reconnoitring. A hundred times -- by day
      in fancy, and by night in dreams -- pulling himself along by the
      boughs, he stole down that dim backwater, till the dark yews and the white
      dove-cot came into view.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he thought now only of fulfilment. She was wasting cruelly away! Why
      should he leave her where she was? Leave her to profane herself and all
      womanhood in the arms of a man she hated?
    </p>
    <p>
      And on that day of mid-June, when he received her telegram, it was as if
      he had been handed the key of Paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would she -- could she mean to come away with him that very night? He
      would prepare for that at all events. He had so often in mind faced this
      crisis in his affairs, that now it only meant translating into action what
      had been carefully thought out. He packed, supplied himself liberally with
      money, and wrote a long letter to his guardian. It would hurt the old man -- Gordy
      was over seventy now -- but that could not be helped. He would not post
      it till he knew for certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      After telling how it had all come about, he went on thus: "I know that to
      many people, and perhaps to you, Gordy, it will seem very wrong, but it
      does not to me, and that is the simple truth. Everybody has his own views
      on such things, I suppose; and as I would not -- on my honour, Gordy -- ever
      have held or wished to hold, or ever will hold in marriage or out of
      marriage, any woman who does not love me, so I do not think it is acting
      as I would resent others acting towards me, to take away from such
      unhappiness this lady for whom I would die at any minute. I do not mean to
      say that pity has anything to do with it -- I thought so at first, but
      I know now that it is all swallowed up in the most mighty feeling I have
      ever had or ever shall have. I am not a bit afraid of conscience. If God
      is Universal Truth, He cannot look hardly upon us for being true to
      ourselves. And as to people, we shall just hold up our heads; I think that
      they generally take you at your own valuation. But, anyway, Society does
      not much matter. We shan't want those who don't want us -- you may be
      sure. I hope he will divorce her quickly -- there is nobody much to be
      hurt by that except you and Cis; but if he doesn't -- it can't be
      helped. I don't think she has anything; but with my six hundred, and what
      I can make, even if we have to live abroad, we shall be all right for
      money. You have been awfully good to me always, Gordy, and I am very
      grieved to hurt you, and still more sorry if you think I am being
      ungrateful; but when one feels as I do -- body and soul and spirit -- there
      isn't any question; there wouldn't be if death itself stood in the way. If
      you receive this, we shall be gone together; I will write to you from
      wherever we pitch our tent, and, of course, I shall write to Cicely. But
      will you please tell Mrs. Doone and Sylvia, and give them my love if they
      still care to have it. Good-bye, dear Gordy. I believe you would have done
      the same, if you had been I. Always your affectionate -- MARK."

      In all those preparations he forgot nothing, employing every minute of the
      few hours in a sort of methodic exaltation. The last thing before setting
      out he took the damp cloths off his 'bull-man.' Into the face of the
      monster there had come of late a hungry, yearning look. The artist in him
      had done his work that unconscious justice; against his will had set down
      the truth. And, wondering whether he would ever work at it again, he
      redamped the cloths and wrapped it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not go to her village, but to one five or six miles down the river -- it
      was safer, and the row would steady him. Hiring a skiff, he pulled up
      stream. He travelled very slowly to kill time, keeping under the far bank.
      And as he pulled, his very heart seemed parched with nervousness. Was it
      real that he was going to her, or only some fantastic trick of Fate, a
      dream from which he would wake to find himself alone again? He passed the
      dove-cot at last, and kept on till he could round into the backwater and
      steal up under cover to the poplar. He arrived a few minutes before eight
      o'clock, turned the boat round, and waited close beneath the bank, holding
      to a branch, and standing so that he could see the path. If a man could
      die from longing and anxiety, surely Lennan must have died then!
    </p>
    <p>
      All wind had failed, and the day was fallen into a wonderful still
      evening. Gnats were dancing in the sparse strips of sunlight that slanted
      across the dark water, now that the sun was low. From the fields, bereft
      of workers, came the scent of hay and the heavy scent of meadow-sweet; the
      musky odour of the backwater was confused with them into one brooding
      perfume. No one passed. And sounds were few and far to that wistful
      listener, for birds did not sing just there. How still and warm was the
      air, yet seemed to vibrate against his cheeks as though about to break
      into flame. That fancy came to him vividly while he stood waiting -- a
      vision of heat simmering in little pale red flames. On the thick reeds
      some large, slow, dusky flies were still feeding, and now and then a
      moorhen a few yards away splashed a little, or uttered a sharp, shrill
      note. When she came -- if she did come! -- they would not stay here,
      in this dark earthy backwater; he would take her over to the other side,
      away to the woods! But the minutes passed, and his heart sank. Then it
      leaped up. Someone was coming -- in white, with bare head, and
      something blue or black flung across her arm. It was she! No one else
      walked like that! She came very quickly. And he noticed that her hair
      looked like little wings on either side of her brow, as if her face were a
      white bird with dark wings, flying to love! Now she was close, so close
      that he could see her lips parted, and her eyes love-lighted -- like
      nothing in the world but darkness wild with dew and starlight. He reached
      up and lifted her down into the boat, and the scent of some flower pressed
      against his face seemed to pierce into him and reach his very heart,
      awakening the memory of something past, forgotten. Then, seizing the
      branches, snapping them in his haste, he dragged the skiff along through
      the sluggish water, the gnats dancing in his face. She seemed to know
      where he was taking her, and neither of them spoke a single word, while he
      pulled out into the open, and over to the far bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one field between them and the wood -- a field of young
      wheat, with a hedge of thorn and alder. And close to that hedge they set
      out, their hands clasped. They had nothing to say yet -- like children
      saving up. She had put on her cloak to hide her dress, and its silk
      swished against the silvery blades of the wheat. What had moved her to put
      on this blue cloak? Blue of the sky, and flowers, of birds' wings, and the
      black-burning blue of the night! The hue of all holy things! And how still
      it was in the late gleam of the sun! Not one little sound of beast or bird
      or tree; not one bee humming! And not much colour -- only the starry
      white hemlocks and globe-campion flowers, and the low-flying glamour of
      the last warm light on the wheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      XX
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . Now over wood and river the evening drew in fast. And first the
      swallows, that had looked as if they would never stay their hunting,
      ceased; and the light, that had seemed fastened above the world, for all
      its last brightenings, slowly fell wingless and dusky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon would not rise till ten! And all things waited. The creatures of
      night were slow to come forth after that long bright summer's day,
      watching for the shades of the trees to sink deeper and deeper into the
      now chalk-white water; watching for the chalk-white face of the sky to be
      masked with velvet. The very black-plumed trees themselves seemed to wait
      in suspense for the grape-bloom of night. All things stared, wan in that
      hour of passing day -- all things had eyes wistful and unblessed. In
      those moments glamour was so dead that it was as if meaning had abandoned
      the earth. But not for long. Winged with darkness, it stole back; not the
      soul of meaning that had gone, but a witch-like and brooding spirit
      harbouring in the black trees, in the high dark spears of the rushes, and
      on the grim-snouted snags that lurked along the river bank. Then the owls
      came out, and night-flying things. And in the wood there began a cruel
      bird-tragedy -- some dark pursuit in the twilight above the bracken;
      the piercing shrieks of a creature into whom talons have again and again
      gone home; and mingled with them, hoarse raging cries of triumph. Many
      minutes they lasted, those noises of the night, sound-emblems of all the
      cruelty in the heart of Nature; till at last death appeased that savagery.
      And any soul abroad, that pitied fugitives, might once more listen, and
      not weep....
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a nightingale began to give forth its long liquid gurgling; and a
      corn-crake churred in the young wheat. Again the night brooded, in the
      silent tops of the trees, in the more silent depths of the water. It sent
      out at long intervals a sigh or murmur, a tiny scuttling splash, an owl's
      hunting cry. And its breath was still hot and charged with heavy odour,
      for no dew was falling....
    </p>
    <p>
      XXI
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past ten when they came out from the wood. She had wanted to wait
      for the moon to rise; not a gold coin of a moon as last night, but ivory
      pale, and with a gleaming radiance level over the fern, and covering the
      lower boughs, as it were, with a drift of white blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the wicket gate they passed once more beside the moon-coloured
      wheat, which seemed of a different world from that world in which they had
      walked but an hour and a half ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in Lennan's heart was a feeling such as a man's heart can only know
      once in all his life -- such humble gratitude, and praise, and
      adoration of her who had given him her all. There should be nothing for
      her now but joy -- like the joy of this last hour. She should never
      know less happiness! And kneeling down before her at the water's edge he
      kissed her dress, and hands, and feet, which to-morrow would be his
      forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they got into the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile of the moonlight glided over each ripple, and reed, and closing
      water-lily; over her face, where the hood had fallen back from her
      loosened hair; over one hand trailing the water, and the other touching
      the flower at her breast; and, just above her breath, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Row, my dear love; it's late!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Dipping his sculls, he shot the skiff into the darkness of the
      backwater....
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened then he never knew, never clearly -- in all those after
      years. A vision of her white form risen to its feet, bending forward like
      a creature caught, that cannot tell which way to spring; a crashing shock,
      his head striking something hard! Nothingness! And then -- an awful,
      awful struggle with roots and weeds and slime, a desperate agony of
      groping in that pitchy blackness, among tree-stumps, in dead water that
      seemed to have no bottom -- he and that other, who had leaped at them
      in the dark with his boat, like a murdering beast; a nightmare search more
      horrible than words could tell, till in a patch of moonlight on the bank
      they laid her, who for all their efforts never stirred.... There she lay
      all white, and they two crouched at her head and feet -- like dark
      creatures of the woods and waters over that which with their hunting they
      had slain.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long they stayed there, not once looking at each other, not once
      speaking, not once ceasing to touch with their hands that dead thing -- he
      never knew. How long in the summer night, with its moonlight and its
      shadows quivering round them, and the night wind talking in the reeds!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the most enduring of all sentient things had moved in him again;
      so that he once more felt.... Never again to see those eyes that had loved
      him with their light! Never again to kiss her lips! Frozen -- like
      moonlight to the earth, with the flower still clinging at her breast.
      Thrown out on the bank like a plucked water-lily! Dead? No, no! Not dead!
      Alive in the night -- alive to him -- somewhere! Not on this dim
      bank, in this hideous backwater, with that dark dumb creature who had
      destroyed her! Out there on the river -- in the wood of their happiness -- somewhere
      alive!... And, staggering up past Cramier, who never moved, he got into
      his boat, and like one demented pulled out into the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once there in the tide, he fell huddled forward, motionless above his
      oars....
    </p>
    <p>
      And the moonlight flooded his dark skiff drifting down. And the moonlight
      effaced the ripples on the water that had stolen away her spirit. Her
      spirit mingled now with the white beauty and the shadows, for ever part of
      the stillness and the passion of a summer night; hovering, floating,
      listening to the rustle of the reeds, and the whispering of the woods; one
      with the endless dream -- that spirit passing out, as all might wish to
      pass, in the hour of happiness.

    <h2>
      PART III -- AUTUMN
    </h2>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      When on that November night Lennan stole to the open door of his
      dressing-room, and stood watching his wife asleep, Fate still waited for
      an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low fire was burning -- one of those fires that throw faint shadows
      everywhere, and once and again glow so that some object shines for a
      moment, some shape is clearly seen. The curtains were not quite drawn, and
      a plane-tree branch with leaves still hanging, which had kept them company
      all the fifteen years they had lived there, was moving darkly in the wind,
      now touching the glass with a frail tap, as though asking of him, who had
      been roaming in that wind so many hours, to let it in. Unfailing comrades -- London
      plane-trees!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not dared hope that Sylvia would be asleep. It was merciful that
      she was, whichever way the issue went -- that issue so cruel. Her face
      was turned towards the fire, and one hand rested beneath her cheek. So she
      often slept. Even when life seemed all at sea, its landmarks lost, one
      still did what was customary. Poor tender-hearted thing -- she had not
      slept since he told her, forty-eight hours, that seemed such years, ago!
      With her flaxen hair, and her touching candour, even in sleep, she looked
      like a girl lying there, not so greatly changed from what she had been
      that summer of Cicely's marriage down at Hayle. Her face had not grown old
      in all those twenty-eight years. There had been till now no special reason
      why it should. Thought, strong feeling, suffering, those were what changed
      faces; Sylvia had never thought very deeply, never suffered much, till
      now. And was it for him, who had been careful of her -- very careful on
      the whole, despite man's selfishness, despite her never having understood
      the depths of him -- was it for him of all people to hurt her so, to
      stamp her face with sorrow, perhaps destroy her utterly?
    </p>
    <p>
      He crept a little farther in and sat down in the arm-chair beyond the
      fire. What memories a fire gathered into it, with its flaky ashes, its
      little leaf-like flames, and that quiet glow and flicker! What tale of
      passions! How like to a fire was a man's heart! The first young fitful
      leapings, the sudden, fierce, mastering heat, the long, steady sober
      burning, and then -- that last flaming-up, that clutch back at its own
      vanished youth, the final eager flight of flame, before the ashes wintered
      it to nothing! Visions and memories he saw down in the fire, as only can
      be seen when a man's heart, by the agony of long struggle, has been
      stripped of skin, and quivers at every touch. Love! A strange haphazard
      thing was love -- so spun between ecstacy and torture! A thing
      insidious, irresponsible, desperate. A flying sweetness, more poignant
      than anything on earth, more dark in origin and destiny. A thing without
      reason or coherence. A man's love-life -- what say had he in the ebb
      and flow of it? No more than in the flights of autumn birds, swooping
      down, alighting here and there, passing on. The loves one left behind -- even
      in a life by no means vagabond in love, as men's lives went! The love that
      thought the Tyrol skies would fall if he were not first with a certain
      lady. The love whose star had caught in the hair of Sylvia, now lying
      there asleep. A so-called love -- that half-glamorous, yet sordid
      little meal of pleasure, which youth, however sensitive, must eat, it
      seems, some time or other with some young light of love -- a glimpse of
      life that beforehand had seemed much and had meant little, save to leave
      him disillusioned with himself and sorry for his partner. And then the
      love that he could not, even after twenty years, bear to remember; that
      all-devouring summer passion, which in one night had gained all and lost
      all terribly, leaving on his soul a scar that could never be quite healed,
      leaving his spirit always a little lonely, haunted by the sense of what
      might have been. Of his share in that night of tragedy -- that
      'terrible accident on the river' -- no one had ever dreamed. And then
      the long despair which had seemed the last death of love had slowly
      passed, and yet another love had been born -- or rather born again,
      pale, sober, but quite real; the fresh springing-up of a feeling long
      forgotten, of that protective devotion of his boyhood. He still remembered
      the expression on Sylvia's face when he passed her by chance in Oxford
      Street, soon after he came back from his four years of exile in the East
      and Rome -- that look, eager, yet reproachful, then stoically ironic,
      as if saying: 'Oh, no! after forgetting me four years and more -- you
      can't remember me now!' And when he spoke, the still more touching
      pleasure in her face. Then uncertain months, with a feeling of what the
      end would be; and then their marriage. Happy enough -- gentle, not very
      vivid, nor spiritually very intimate -- his work always secretly as
      remote from her as when she had thought to please him by putting jessamine
      stars on the heads of his beasts. A quiet successful union, not meaning,
      he had thought, so very much to him nor so very much to her -- until
      forty-eight hours ago he told her; and she had shrunk, and wilted, and
      gone all to pieces. And what was it he had told her?
    </p>
    <p>
      A long story -- that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting there by the fire, with nothing yet decided, he could see it all
      from the start, with its devilish, delicate intricacy, its subtle slow
      enchantment spinning itself out of him, out of his own state of mind and
      body, rather than out of the spell cast over him, as though a sort of
      fatal force, long dormant, were working up again to burst into dark
      flower....
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it had begun within him over a year ago, with a queer unhappy
      restlessness, a feeling that life was slipping, ebbing away within reach
      of him, and his arms never stretched out to arrest it. It had begun with a
      sort of long craving, stilled only when he was working hard -- a
      craving for he knew not what, an ache which was worst whenever the wind
      was soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said that about forty-five was a perilous age for a man -- especially
      for an artist. All the autumn of last year he had felt this vague misery
      rather badly. It had left him alone most of December and January, while he
      was working so hard at his group of lions; but the moment that was
      finished it had gripped him hard again. In those last days of January he
      well remembered wandering about in the parks day after day, trying to get
      away from it. Mild weather, with a scent in the wind! With what avidity he
      had watched children playing, the premature buds on the bushes, anything,
      everything young -- with what an ache, too, he had been conscious of
      innumerable lives being lived round him, and loves loved, and he outside,
      unable to know, to grasp, to gather them; and all the time the sands of
      his hourglass running out! A most absurd and unreasonable feeling for a
      man with everything he wanted, with work that he loved, quite enough
      money, and a wife so good as Sylvia -- a feeling that no Englishman of
      forty-six, in excellent health, ought for a moment to have been troubled
      with. A feeling such as, indeed, no Englishman ever admitted having -- so
      that there was not even, as yet, a Society for its suppression. For what
      was this disquiet feeling, but the sense that he had had his day, would
      never again know the stir and fearful joy of falling in love, but only
      just hanker after what was past and gone! Could anything be more
      reprehensible in a married man?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was -- yes -- the last day of January, when, returning from one
      of those restless rambles in Hyde Park, he met Dromore. Queer to recognize
      a man hardly seen since school-days. Yet unmistakably, Johnny Dromore,
      sauntering along the rails of Piccadilly on the Green Park side, with that
      slightly rolling gait of his thin, horseman's legs, his dandified hat a
      little to one side, those strange, chaffing, goggling eyes, that look, as
      if making a perpetual bet. Yes -- the very same teasing, now moody, now
      reckless, always astute Johnny Dromore, with a good heart beneath an
      outside that seemed ashamed of it. Truly to have shared a room at school -- to
      have been at College together, were links mysteriously indestructible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mark Lennan! By gum! haven't seen you for ages. Not since you turned out
      a full-blown -- what d'you call it? Awfully glad to meet you, old
      chap!" Here was the past indeed, long vanished in feeling and thought and
      all; and Lennan's head buzzed, trying to find some common interest with
      this hunting, racing man-about-town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny Dromore come to life again -- he whom the Machine had stamped
      with astute simplicity by the time he was twenty-two, and for ever after
      left untouched in thought and feeling -- Johnny Dromore, who would
      never pass beyond the philosophy that all was queer and freakish which had
      not to do with horses, women, wine, cigars, jokes, good-heartedness, and
      that perpetual bet; Johnny Dromore, who, somewhere in him, had a pocket of
      depth, a streak of hunger, that was not just Johnny Dromore.
    </p>
    <p>
      How queer was the sound of that jerky talk!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ever see old Fookes now? Been racin' at all? You live in Town?
      Remember good old Blenker?" And then silence, and then another spurt:
      "Ever go down to 'Bambury's?' Ever go racin'? . . . Come on up to my
      'digs.' You've got nothin' to do." No persuading Johnny Dromore that a
      'what d'you call it' could have anything to do. "Come on, old chap. I've
      got the hump. It's this damned east wind."
     </p>
    <p>
      Well he remembered it, when they shared a room at 'Bambury's' -- that
      hump of Johnny Dromore's, after some reckless spree or bout of teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And down that narrow bye-street of Piccadilly he had gone, and up into
      those 'digs' on the first floor, with their little dark hall, their Van
      Beers' drawing and Vanity Fair cartoons, and prints of racehorses, and of
      the old Nightgown Steeplechase; with the big chairs, and all the
      paraphernalia of Race Guides and race-glasses, fox-masks and stags'-horns,
      and hunting-whips. And yet, something that from the first moment struck
      him as not quite in keeping, foreign to the picture -- a little jumble
      of books, a vase of flowers, a grey kitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, old chap. What'll you drink?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Sunk into the recesses of a marvellous chair, with huge arms of tawny
      leather, he listened and spoke drowsily. 'Bambury's,' Oxford, Gordy's
      clubs -- dear old Gordy, gone now! -- things long passed by; they
      seemed all round him once again. And yet, always that vague sense,
      threading this resurrection, threading the smoke of their cigars, and
      Johnny Dromore's clipped talk -- of something that did not quite
      belong. Might it be, perhaps, that sepia drawing -- above the
      'Tantalus' on the oak sideboard at the far end -- of a woman's face
      gazing out into the room? Mysteriously unlike everything else, except the
      flowers, and this kitten that was pushing its furry little head against
      his hand. Odd how a single thing sometimes took possession of a room,
      however remote in spirit! It seemed to reach like a shadow over Dromore's
      outstretched limbs, and weathered, long-nosed face, behind his huge cigar;
      over the queer, solemn, chaffing eyes, with something brooding in the
      depths of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever get the hump? Bally awful, isn't it? It's getting old. We're bally
      old, you know, Lenny!" Ah! No one had called him 'Lenny' for twenty years.
      And it was true; they were unmentionably old.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When a fellow begins to feel old, you know, it's time he went broke -- or
      something; doesn't bear sittin' down and lookin' at. Come out to 'Monte'
      with me!"
     </p>
    <p>
      'Monte!' That old wound, never quite healed, started throbbing at the
      word, so that he could hardly speak his: "No, I don't care for 'Monte.'"
     </p>
    <p>
      And, at once, he saw Dromore's eyes probing, questioning:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You married?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Never thought of you as married!"
     </p>
    <p>
      So Dromore did think of him. Queer! He never thought of Johnny Dromore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Winter's bally awful, when you're not huntin'. You've changed a lot;
      should hardly have known you. Last time I saw you, you'd just come back
      from Rome or somewhere. What's it like bein' a -- a sculptor? Saw
      something of yours once. Ever do things of horses?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes; he had done a 'relief' of ponies only last year.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do women, too, I s'pose?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Not often."
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes goggled slightly. Quaint, that unholy interest! Just like boys,
      the Johnny Dromores -- would never grow up, no matter how life treated
      them. If Dromore spoke out his soul, as he used to speak it out at
      'Bambury's,' he would say: 'You get a pull there; you have a bally good
      time, I expect.' That was the way it took them; just a converse
      manifestation of the very same feeling towards Art that the pious
      Philistines had, with their deploring eyebrows and their 'peril to the
      soul.' Babes all! Not a glimmering of what Art meant -- of its effort,
      and its yearnings!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make money at it?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      Again that appreciative goggle, as who should say: 'Ho! there's more in
      this than I thought!'
    </p>
    <p>
      A long silence, then, in the dusk with the violet glimmer from outside the
      windows, the fire flickering in front of them, the grey kitten purring
      against his neck, the smoke of their cigars going up, and such a strange,
      dozing sense of rest, as he had not known for many days. And then -- something,
      someone at the door, over by the sideboard! And Dromore speaking in a
      queer voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, Nell! D'you know my daughter?"
     </p>
    <p>
      A hand took Lennan's, a hand that seemed to waver between the aplomb of a
      woman of the world, and a child's impulsive warmth. And a voice, young,
      clipped, clear, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How d'you do? She's rather sweet, isn't she -- my kitten?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Dromore turned the light up. A figure fairly tall, in a grey
      riding-habit, stupendously well cut; a face not quite so round as a
      child's nor so shaped as a woman's, blushing slightly, very calm; crinkly
      light-brown hair tied back with a black ribbon under a neat hat; and eyes
      like those eyes of Gainsborough's 'Perdita' -- slow, grey, mesmeric,
      with long lashes curling up, eyes that draw things to them, still
      innocent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just on the point of saying: "I thought you'd stepped out of that
      picture" -- he saw Dromore's face, and mumbled instead:
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it's YOUR kitten?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; she goes to everybody. Do you like Persians? She's all fur really.
      Feel!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Entering with his fingers the recesses of the kitten, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cats without fur are queer."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen one without fur?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes! In my profession we have to go below fur -- I'm a sculptor."
     </p>
    <p>
      "That must be awfully interesting."
     </p>
    <p>
      What a woman of the world! But what a child, too! And now he could see
      that the face in the sepia drawing was older altogether -- lips not so
      full, look not so innocent, cheeks not so round, and something sad and
      desperate about it -- a face that life had rudely touched. But the same
      eyes it had -- and what charm, for all its disillusionment, its air of
      a history! Then he noticed, fastened to the frame, on a thin rod, a
      dust-coloured curtain, drawn to one side. The self-possessed young voice
      was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you mind if I showed you my drawings? It would be awfully good of
      you. You could tell me about them." And with dismay he saw her open a
      portfolio. While he scrutinized those schoolgirl drawings, he could feel
      her looking at him, as animals do when they are making up their minds
      whether or no to like you; then she came and stood so close that her arm
      pressed his. He redoubled his efforts to find something good about the
      drawings. But in truth there was nothing good. And if, in other matters,
      he could lie well enough to save people's feelings, where Art was
      concerned he never could; so he merely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't been taught, you see."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Will you teach me?"
     </p>
    <p>
      But before he could answer, she was already effacing that naive question
      in her most grown-up manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I oughtn't to ask. It would bore you awfully."
     </p>
    <p>
      After that he vaguely remembered Dromore's asking if he ever rode in the
      Row; and those eyes of hers following him about; and her hand giving his
      another childish squeeze. Then he was on his way again down the
      dimly-lighted stairs, past an interminable array of Vanity Fair cartoons,
      out into the east wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the Green Park on his way home, was he more, or less, restless?
      Difficult to say. A little flattered, certainly, a little warmed; yet
      irritated, as always when he came into contact with people to whom the
      world of Art was such an amusing unreality. The notion of trying to show
      that child how to draw -- that feather-pate, with her riding and her
      kitten; and her 'Perdita' eyes! Quaint, how she had at once made friends
      with him! He was a little different, perhaps, from what she was accustomed
      to. And how daintily she spoke! A strange, attractive, almost lovely
      child! Certainly not more than seventeen -- and -- Johnny Dromore's
      daughter!
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was bitter, the lamps bright among the naked trees. Beautiful
      always -- London at night, even in January, even in an east wind, with
      a beauty he never tired of. Its great, dark, chiselled shapes, its
      gleaming lights, like droves of flying stars come to earth; and all warmed
      by the beat and stir of innumerable lives -- those lives that he ached
      so to know and to be part of.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told Sylvia of his encounter. Dromore! The name struck her. She had an
      old Irish song, 'The Castle of Dromore,' with a queer, haunting refrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It froze hard all the week, and he began a life-size group of their two
      sheep-dogs. Then a thaw set in with that first south-west wind, which
      brings each February a feeling of Spring such as is never again
      recaptured, and men's senses, like sleepy bees in the sun, go roving. It
      awakened in him more violently than ever the thirst to be living, knowing,
      loving -- the craving for something new. Not this, of course, took him
      back to Dromore's rooms; oh, no! just friendliness, since he had not even
      told his old room-mate where he lived, or said that his wife would be glad
      to make his acquaintance, if he cared to come round. For Johnny Dromore
      had assuredly not seemed too happy, under all his hard-bitten air. Yes! it
      was but friendly to go again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dromore was seated in his long arm-chair, a cigar between his lips, a
      pencil in his hand, a Ruff's Guide on his knee; beside him was a large
      green book. There was a festive air about him, very different from his
      spasmodic gloom of the other day; and he murmured without rising:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halo, old man! -- glad to see you. Take a pew. Look here! Agapemone -- which
      d'you think I ought to put her to -- San Diavolo or Ponte Canet? -- not
      more than four crosses of St. Paul. Goin' to get a real good one from her
      this time!"
     </p>
    <p>
      He, who had never heard these sainted names, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Ponte Canet, without doubt. But if you're working I'll come in
      another time."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Lord! no! Have a smoke. I'll just finish lookin' out their blood -- and
      take a pull."
     </p>
    <p>
      And so Lennan sat down to watch those researches, wreathed in cigar smoke
      and punctuated by muttered expletives. They were as sacred and absorbing,
      no doubt, as his own efforts to create in clay; for before Dromore's inner
      vision was the perfect racehorse -- he, too, was creating. Here was no
      mere dodge for making money, but a process hallowed by the peculiar
      sensation felt when one rubbed the palms of the hands together, the
      sensation that accompanied all creative achievement. Once only Dromore
      paused to turn his head and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bally hard, gettin' a taproot right!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Real Art! How well an artist knew that desperate search after the point of
      balance, the central rivet that must be found before a form would come to
      life.... And he noted that to-day there was no kitten, no flowers, no
      sense at all of an extraneous presence -- even the picture was
      curtained. Had the girl been just a dream -- a fancy conjured up by his
      craving after youth?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw that Dromore had dropped the large green book, and was
      standing before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nell took to you the other day. But you always were a lady's man.
      Remember the girl at Coaster's?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Coaster's tea-shop, where he would go every afternoon that he had money,
      just for the pleasure of looking shyly at a face. Something beautiful to
      look at -- nothing more! Johnny Dromore would no better understand that
      now than when they were at 'Bambury's.' Not the smallest good even trying
      to explain! He looked up at the goggling eyes; he heard the bantering
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say -- you ARE goin' grey. We're bally old, Lenny! A fellow gets old
      when he marries."
     </p>
    <p>
      And he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the way, I never knew that YOU had been."
     </p>
    <p>
      From Dromore's face the chaffing look went, like a candle-flame blown out;
      and a coppery flush spread over it. For some seconds he did not speak,
      then, jerking his head towards the picture, he muttered gruffly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never had the chance of marrying, there; Nell's 'outside.'"
     </p>
    <p>
      A sort of anger leaped in Lennan; why should Dromore speak that word as if
      he were ashamed of his own daughter? Just like his sort -- none so
      hidebound as men-about-town! Flotsam on the tide of other men's opinions;
      poor devils adrift, without the one true anchorage of their own real
      feelings! And doubtful whether Dromore would be pleased, or think him
      gushing, or even distrustful of his morality, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for that, it would only make any decent man or woman nicer to her.
      When is she going to let me teach her drawing?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Dromore crossed the room, drew back the curtain of the picture, and in a
      muffled voice, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God, Lenny! Life's unfair. Nell's coming killed her mother. I'd rather
      it had been me -- bar chaff! Women have no luck."
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan got up from his comfortable chair. For, startled out of the past,
      the memory of that summer night, when yet another woman had no luck, was
      flooding his heart with its black, inextinguishable grief. He said
      quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The past IS past, old man."
     </p>
    <p>
      Dromore drew the curtain again across the picture, and came back to the
      fire. And for a full minute he stared into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What am I to do with Nell? She's growing up."
     </p>
    <p>
      "What have you done with her so far?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "She's been at school. In the summer she goes to Ireland -- I've got a
      bit of an old place there. She'll be eighteen in July. I shall have to
      introduce her to women, and all that. It's the devil! How? Who?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan could only murmur: "My wife, for one."
     </p>
    <p>
      He took his leave soon after. Johnny Dromore! Bizarre guardian for that
      child! Queer life she must have of it, in that bachelor's den, surrounded
      by Ruff's Guides! What would become of her? Caught up by some young spark
      about town; married to him, no doubt -- her father would see to the
      thoroughness of that, his standard of respectability was evidently high!
      And after -- go the way, maybe, of her mother -- that poor thing in
      the picture with the alluring, desperate face. Well! It was no business of
      his!
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      No business of his! The merest sense of comradeship, then, took him once
      more to Dromore's after that disclosure, to prove that the word 'outside'
      had no significance save in his friend's own fancy; to assure him again
      that Sylvia would be very glad to welcome the child at any time she liked
      to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had told her of that little matter of Nell's birth, she had been
      silent a long minute, looking in his face, and then had said: "Poor child!
      I wonder if SHE knows! People are so unkind, even nowadays!" He could not
      himself think of anyone who would pay attention to such a thing, except to
      be kinder to the girl; but in such matters Sylvia was the better judge, in
      closer touch with general thought. She met people that he did not -- and
      of a more normal species.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather late when he got to Dromore's diggings on that third visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Dromore, sir," the man said -- he had one of those strictly
      confidential faces bestowed by an all-wise Providence on servants in the
      neighbourhood of Piccadilly -- "Mr. Dromore, sir, is not in. But he
      will be almost sure to be in to dress. Miss Nell is in, sir."
     </p>
    <p>
      And there she was, sitting at the table, pasting photographs into an album -- lonely
      young creature in that abode of male middle-age! Lennan stood, unheard,
      gazing at the back of her head, with its thick crinkly-brown hair tied
      back on her dark-red frock. And, to the confidential man's soft:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lennan, miss," he added a softer: "May I come in?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand into his with intense composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, do! if you don't mind the mess I'm making;" and, with a little
      squeeze of the tips of his fingers, added: "Would it bore you to see my
      photographs?"
     </p>
    <p>
      And down they sat together before the photographs -- snapshots of
      people with guns or fishing-rods, little groups of schoolgirls, kittens,
      Dromore and herself on horseback, and several of a young man with a broad,
      daring, rather good-looking face. "That's Oliver -- Oliver Dromore -- Dad's
      first cousin once removed. Rather nice, isn't he? Do you like his
      expression?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan did not know. Not her second cousin; her father's first cousin once
      removed! And again there leaped in him that unreasoning flame of indignant
      pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how about drawing? You haven't come to be taught yet."
     </p>
    <p>
      She went almost as red as her frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were only being polite. I oughtn't to have asked. Of
      course, I want to awfully -- only I know it'll bore you."
     </p>
    <p>
      "It won't at all."
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at that. What peculiar languorous eyes they were!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I come to-morrow, then?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Any day you like, between half-past twelve and one."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He took out a card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mark Lennan -- yes -- I like your name. I liked it the other day.
      It's awfully nice!"
     </p>
    <p>
      What was in a name that she should like him because of it? His fame as a
      sculptor -- such as it was -- could have nothing to do with that,
      for she would certainly not know of it. Ah! but there was a lot in a name -- for
      children. In his childhood what fascination there had been in the words
      macaroon, and Spaniard, and Carinola, and Aldebaran, and Mr. McCrae. For
      quite a week the whole world had been Mr. McCrae -- a most ordinary
      friend of Gordy's.
    </p>
    <p>
      By whatever fascination moved, she talked freely enough now -- of her
      school; of riding and motoring -- she seemed to love going very fast;
      about Newmarket -- which was 'perfect'; and theatres -- plays of the
      type that Johnny Dromore might be expected to approve; these together with
      'Hamlet' and 'King Lear' were all she had seen. Never was a girl so
      untouched by thought, or Art -- yet not stupid, having, seemingly, a
      certain natural good taste; only, nothing, evidently, had come her way.
      How could it -- 'Johnny Dromore duce, et auspice Johnny Dromore!' She
      had been taken, indeed, to the National Gallery while at school. And
      Lennan had a vision of eight or ten young maidens trailing round at the
      skirts of one old maiden, admiring Landseer's dogs, giggling faintly at
      Botticelli's angels, gaping, rustling, chattering like young birds in a
      shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with all her surroundings, this child of Johnny Dromoredom was as yet
      more innocent than cultured girls of the same age. If those grey, mesmeric
      eyes of hers followed him about, they did so frankly, unconsciously. There
      was no minx in her, so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour went by, and Dromore did not come. And the loneliness of this
      young creature in her incongruous abode began telling on Lennan's
      equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did she do in the evenings?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes I go to the theatre with Dad, generally I stay at home."
     </p>
    <p>
      "And then?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I just read, or talk French."
     </p>
    <p>
      "What? To yourself?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, or to Oliver sometimes, when he comes in."
     </p>
    <p>
      So Oliver came in!
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have you known Oliver?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! ever since I was a child."
     </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to say: And how long is that? But managed to refrain, and got up
      to go instead. She caught his sleeve and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not to go!" Saying that she looked as a dog will, going to bite in
      fun, her upper lip shortened above her small white teeth set fast on her
      lower lip, and her chin thrust a little forward. A glimpse of a wilful
      spirit! But as soon as he had smiled, and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! but I must, you see!" she at once regained her manners, only saying
      rather mournfully: "You don't call me by my name. Don't you like it?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Nell?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. It's really Eleanor, of course. DON'T you like it?"
     </p>
    <p>
      If he had detested the name, he could only have answered: "Very much."
     </p>
    <p>
      "I'm awfully glad! Good-bye."
     </p>
    <p>
      When he got out into the street, he felt terribly like a man who, instead
      of having had his sleeve touched, has had his heart plucked at. And that
      warm, bewildered feeling lasted him all the way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing for dinner, he looked at himself with unwonted attention. Yes,
      his dark hair was still thick, but going distinctly grey; there were very
      many lines about his eyes, too, and those eyes, still eager when they
      smiled, were particularly deepset, as if life had forced them back. His
      cheekbones were almost 'bopsies' now, and his cheeks very thin and dark,
      and his jaw looked too set and bony below the almost black moustache.
      Altogether a face that life had worn a good deal, with nothing for a child
      to take a fancy to and make friends with, that he could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia came in while he was thus taking stock of himself, bringing a
      freshly-opened flask of eau-de-Cologne. She was always bringing him
      something -- never was anyone so sweet in those ways. In that grey,
      low-cut frock, her white, still prettiness and pale-gold hair, so little
      touched by Time, only just fell short of real beauty for lack of a spice
      of depth and of incisiveness, just as her spirit lacked he knew not what
      of poignancy. He would not for the world have let her know that he ever
      felt that lack. If a man could not hide little rifts in the lute from one
      so good and humble and affectionate, he was not fit to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sang 'The Castle of Dromore' again that night with its queer haunting
      lilt. And when she had gone up, and he was smoking over the fire, the girl
      in her dark-red frock seemed to come, and sit opposite with her eyes fixed
      on his, just as she had been sitting while they talked. Dark red had
      suited her! Suited the look on her face when she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not to go!" Odd, indeed, if she had not some devil in her, with
      that parentage!
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day they had summoned him from the studio to see a peculiar
      phenomenon -- Johnny Dromore, very well groomed, talking to Sylvia with
      unnatural suavity, and carefully masking the goggle in his eyes! Mrs.
      Lennan ride? Ah! Too busy, of course. Helped Mark with his -- er -- No!
      Really! Read a lot, no doubt? Never had any time for readin' himself -- awful
      bore not having time to read! And Sylvia listening and smiling, very still
      and soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had Dromore come for? To spy out the land, discover why Lennan and
      his wife thought nothing of the word 'outside' -- whether, in fact,
      their household was respectable.... A man must always look twice at
      'what-d'you-call-ems,' even if they have shared his room at school!... To
      his credit, of course, to be so careful of his daughter, at the expense of
      time owed to the creation of the perfect racehorse! On the whole he seemed
      to be coming to the conclusion that they might be useful to Nell in the
      uncomfortable time at hand when she would have to go about; seemed even to
      be falling under the spell of Sylvia's transparent goodness -- abandoning
      his habitual vigilance against being scored off in life's perpetual bet;
      parting with his armour of chaff. Almost a relief, indeed, once out of
      Sylvia's presence, to see that familiar, unholy curiosity creeping back
      into his eyes, as though they were hoping against parental hope to find
      something -- er -- amusing somewhere about that mysterious Mecca of
      good times -- a 'what-d'you-call-it's' studio. Delicious to watch the
      conflict between relief and disappointment. Alas! no model -- not even
      a statue without clothes; nothing but portrait heads, casts of animals,
      and such-like sobrieties -- absolutely nothing that could bring a blush
      to the cheek of the young person, or a glow to the eyes of a Johnny
      Dromore.
    </p>
    <p>
      With what curious silence he walked round and round the group of
      sheep-dogs, inquiring into them with that long crinkled nose of his! With
      what curious suddenness, he said: "Damned good! You wouldn't do me one of
      Nell on horseback?" With what dubious watchfulness he listened to the
      answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might, perhaps, do a statuette of her; if I did, you should have a
      cast."
     </p>
    <p>
      Did he think that in some way he was being outmanoeuvered? For he remained
      some seconds in a sort of trance before muttering, as though clinching a
      bet:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done! And if you want to ride with her to get the hang of it, I can
      always mount you."
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone, Lennan remained staring at his unfinished sheep-dogs in
      the gathering dusk. Again that sense of irritation at contact with
      something strange, hostile, uncomprehending! Why let these Dromores into
      his life like this? He shut the studio, and went back to the drawing-room.
      Sylvia was sitting on the fender, gazing at the fire, and she edged along
      so as to rest against his knees. The light from a candle on her
      writing-table was shining on her hair, her cheek, and chin, that years had
      so little altered. A pretty picture she made, with just that candle flame,
      swaying there, burning slowly, surely down the pale wax -- candle
      flame, of all lifeless things most living, most like a spirit, so bland
      and vague, one would hardly have known it was fire at all. A drift of wind
      blew it this way and that: he got up to shut the window, and as he came
      back; Sylvia said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like Mr. Dromore. I think he's nicer than he looks."
     </p>
    <p>
      "He's asked me to make a statuette of his daughter on horseback."
     </p>
    <p>
      "And will you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know."
     </p>
    <p>
      "If she's really so pretty, you'd better."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty's hardly the word -- but she's not ordinary."
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned round, and looked up at him, and instinctively he felt that
      something difficult to answer was coming next.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mark."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "I wanted to ask you: Are you really happy nowadays?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Why not?"
     </p>
    <p>
      What else to be said? To speak of those feelings of the last few months -- those
      feelings so ridiculous to anyone who had them not -- would only disturb
      her horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And having received her answer, Sylvia turned back to the fire, resting
      silently against his knees....
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later the sheep-dogs suddenly abandoned the pose into which he
      had lured them with such difficulty, and made for the studio door. There
      in the street was Nell Dromore, mounted on a narrow little black horse
      with a white star, a white hoof, and devilish little goat's ears, pricked,
      and very close together at the tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dad said I had better ride round and show you Magpie. He's not very good
      at standing still. Are those your dogs? What darlings!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She had slipped her knee already from the pummel, and slid down; the
      sheep-dogs were instantly on their hind-feet, propping themselves against
      her waist. Lennan held the black horse -- a bizarre little beast, all
      fire and whipcord, with a skin like satin, liquid eyes, very straight
      hocks, and a thin bang-tail reaching down to them. The little creature had
      none of those commonplace good looks so discouraging to artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten its rider, till she looked up from the dogs, and said:
      "Do you like him? It IS nice of you to be going to do us."
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had ridden away, looking back until she turned the corner, he
      tried to lure the two dogs once more to their pose. But they would sit no
      more, going continually to the door, listening and sniffing; and
      everything felt disturbed and out of gear.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same afternoon at Sylvia's suggestion he went with her to call on the
      Dromores.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were being ushered in he heard a man's voice rather
      high-pitched speaking in some language not his own; then the girl:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Oliver. 'Dans l'amour il y a toujours un qui aime, et l'autre qui
      se laisse aimer.'"
     </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting in her father's chair, and on the window-sill they saw a
      young man lolling, who rose and stood stock-still, with an almost insolent
      expression on his broad, good-looking face. Lennan scrutinized him with
      interest -- about twenty-four he might be, rather dandified,
      clean-shaved, with crisp dark hair and wide-set hazel eyes, and, as in his
      photograph, a curious look of daring. His voice, when he vouchsafed a
      greeting, was rather high and not unpleasant, with a touch of lazy drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stayed but a few minutes, and going down those dimly lighted stairs
      again, Sylvia remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How prettily she said good-bye -- as if she were putting up her face
      to be kissed! I think she's lovely. So does that young man. They go well
      together."
     </p>
    <p>
      Rather abruptly Lennan answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I suppose they do."
     </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to them often after that, sometimes alone, twice with Johnny
      Dromore, sometimes with young Oliver, who, under Sylvia's spell, soon lost
      his stand-off air. And the statuette was begun. Then came Spring in
      earnest, and that real business of life -- the racing of horses 'on the
      flat,' when Johnny Dromore's genius was no longer hampered by the
      illegitimate risks of 'jumpin'.' He came to dine with them the day before
      the first Newmarket meeting. He had a soft spot for Sylvia, always saying
      to Lennan as he went away: "Charmin' woman -- your wife!" She, too, had
      a soft spot for him, having fathomed the utter helplessness of this
      worldling's wisdom, and thinking him pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he was gone that evening, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ought we to have Nell to stay with us while you're finishing her? She
      must be very lonely now her father's so much away."
     </p>
    <p>
      It was like Sylvia to think of that; but would it be pleasure or vexation
      to have in the house this child with her quaint grown-upness, her
      confiding ways, and those 'Perdita' eyes? In truth he did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to them with touching alacrity -- very like a dog, who, left
      at home when the family goes for a holiday, takes at once to those who
      make much of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she was no trouble, too well accustomed to amuse herself; and always
      quaint to watch, with her continual changes from child to woman of the
      world. A new sensation, this -- of a young creature in the house. Both
      he and Sylvia had wanted children, without luck. Twice illness had stood
      in the way. Was it, perhaps, just that little lack in her -- that lack
      of poignancy, which had prevented her from becoming a mother? An only
      child herself, she had no nieces or nephews; Cicely's boys had always been
      at school, and now were out in the world. Yes, a new sensation, and one in
      which Lennan's restless feelings seemed to merge and vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the hours when Nell sat to him, he purposely saw but little of
      her, leaving her to nestle under Sylvia's wing; and this she did, as if
      she never wanted to come out. Thus he preserved his amusement at her
      quaint warmths, and quainter calmness, his aesthetic pleasure in watching
      her, whose strange, half-hypnotized, half-hypnotic gaze, had a sort of
      dreamy and pathetic lovingness, as if she were brimful of affections that
      had no outlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning after 'sitting' she would stay an hour bent over her own
      drawing, which made practically no progress; and he would often catch her
      following his movements with those great eyes of hers, while the
      sheep-dogs would lie perfectly still at her feet, blinking horribly -- such
      was her attraction. His birds also, a jackdaw and an owl, who had the run
      of the studio, tolerated her as they tolerated no other female, save the
      housekeeper. The jackdaw would perch on her and peck her dress; but the
      owl merely engaged her in combats of mesmeric gazing, which never ended in
      victory for either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that she was with them, Oliver Dromore began to haunt the house,
      coming at all hours, on very transparent excuses. She behaved to him with
      extreme capriciousness, sometimes hardly speaking, sometimes treating him
      like a brother; and in spite of all his nonchalance, the poor youth would
      just sit glowering, or gazing out his adoration, according to her mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these July evenings Lennan remembered beyond all others. He had
      come, after a hard day's work, out from his studio into the courtyard
      garden to smoke a cigarette and feel the sun on his cheek before it sank
      behind the wall. A piano-organ far away was grinding out a waltz; and on
      an hydrangea tub, under the drawing-room window, he sat down to listen.
      Nothing was visible from there, save just the square patch of a quite blue
      sky, and one soft plume of smoke from his own kitchen chimney; nothing
      audible save that tune, and the never-ending street murmur. Twice birds
      flew across -- starlings. It was very peaceful, and his thoughts went
      floating like the smoke of his cigarette, to meet who-knew-what other
      thoughts -- for thoughts, no doubt, had little swift lives of their
      own; desired, found their mates, and, lightly blending, sent forth
      offspring. Why not? All things were possible in this wonder-house of a
      world. Even that waltz tune, floating away, would find some melody to wed,
      and twine with, and produce a fresh chord that might float in turn to
      catch the hum of a gnat or fly, and breed again. Queer -- how
      everything sought to entwine with something else! On one of the pinkish
      blooms of the hydrangea he noted a bee -- of all things, in this
      hidden-away garden of tiles and gravel and plants in tubs! The little
      furry, lonely thing was drowsily clinging there, as if it had forgotten
      what it had come for -- seduced, maybe, like himself, from labour by
      these last rays of the sun. Its wings, close-furled, were glistening; its
      eyes seemed closed. And the piano-organ played on, a tune of yearning,
      waiting, yearning....
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, through the window above his head, he heard Oliver Dromore -- a
      voice one could always tell, pitched high, with its slight drawl -- pleading,
      very softly at first, then insistent, imperious; and suddenly Nell's
      answering voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't, Oliver! I won't! I won't!"
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose to go out of earshot. Then a door slammed, and he saw her at the
      window above him, her waist on a level with his head; flushed, with her
      grey eyes ominously bright, her full lips parted. And he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Nell?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned down and caught his hand; her touch was fiery hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He kissed me! I won't let him -- I won't kiss him!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Through his head went a medley of sayings to soothe children that are
      hurt; but he felt unsteady, unlike himself. And suddenly she knelt, and
      put her hot forehead against his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if she had really been a little child, wanting the place kissed
      to make it well.
    </p>
    <p>
      VII
    </p>
    <p>
      After that strange outburst, Lennan considered long whether he should
      speak to Oliver. But what could he say, from what standpoint say it, and -- with
      that feeling? Or should he speak to Dromore? Not very easy to speak on
      such a subject to one off whose turf all spiritual matters were so
      permanently warned. Nor somehow could he bring himself to tell Sylvia; it
      would be like violating a confidence to speak of the child's outburst and
      that quivering moment, when she had kneeled and put her hot forehead to
      his lips for comfort. Such a disclosure was for Nell herself to make, if
      she so wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then young Oliver solved the difficulty by coming to the studio
      himself next day. He entered with 'Dromore' composure, very well groomed,
      in a silk hat, a cut-away black coat and charming lemon-coloured gloves;
      what, indeed, the youth did, besides belonging to the Yeomanry and hunting
      all the winter, seemed known only to himself. He made no excuse for
      interrupting Lennan, and for some time sat silently smoking his cigarette,
      and pulling the ears of the dogs. And Lennan worked on, waiting. There was
      always something attractive to him in this young man's broad, good-looking
      face, with its crisp dark hair, and half-insolent good humour, now so
      clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Oliver got up, and went over to the unfinished 'Girl on the Magpie
      Horse.' Turning to it so that his face could not be seen, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and Mrs. Lennan have been awfully kind to me; I behaved rather like a
      cad yesterday. I thought I'd better tell you. I want to marry Nell, you
      know."
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan was glad that the young man's face was so religiously averted. He
      let his hands come to anchor on what he was working at before he answered:
      "She's only a child, Oliver;" and then, watching his fingers making an
      inept movement with the clay, was astonished at himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll be eighteen this month," he heard Oliver say. "If she once gets
      out -- amongst people -- I don't know what I shall do. Old Johnny's
      no good to look after her."
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man's face was very red; he was forgetting to hide it now. Then
      it went white, and he said through clenched teeth: "She sends me mad! I
      don't know how not to -- If I don't get her, I shall shoot myself. I
      shall, you know -- I'm that sort. It's her eyes. They draw you right
      out of yourself -- and leave you -- " And from his gloved hand the
      smoked-out cigarette-end fell to the floor. "They say her mother was like
      that. Poor old Johnny! D'you think I've got a chance, Mr. Lennan? I don't
      mean now, this minute; I know she's too young."
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan forced himself to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say, my dear fellow, I dare say. Have you talked with my wife?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's so good -- I don't think she'd quite understand my sort of
      feeling."
     </p>
    <p>
      A queer little smile came up on Lennan's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, well!" he said, "you must give the child time. Perhaps when she comes
      back from Ireland, after the summer."
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man answered moodily:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I've got the run of that, you know. And I shan't be able to keep
      away." He took up his hat. "I suppose I oughtn't to have come and bored
      you about this, but Nell thinks such a lot of you; and, you being
      different to most people -- I thought you wouldn't mind." He turned
      again at the door. "It wasn't gas what I said just now -- about not
      getting her. Fellows say that sort of thing, but I mean it."
     </p>
    <p>
      He put on that shining hat and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lennan stood, staring at the statuette. So! Passion broke down even
      the defences of Dromoredom. Passion! Strange hearts it chose to bloom in!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Being different to most people -- I thought you wouldn't mind'! How
      had this youth known that Sylvia would not understand passion so out of
      hand as this? And what had made it clear that he (Lennan) would? Was
      there, then, something in his face? There must be! Even Johnny Dromore -- most
      reticent of creatures -- had confided to him that one hour of his
      astute existence, when the wind had swept him out to sea!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes! And that statuette would never be any good, try as he might. Oliver
      was right -- it was her eyes! How they had smoked -- in their
      childish anger -- if eyes could be said to smoke, and how they had
      drawn and pleaded when she put her face to his in her still more childish
      entreaty! If they were like this now, what would they be when the woman in
      her woke? Just as well not to think of her too much! Just as well to work,
      and take heed that he would soon be forty-seven! Just as well that next
      week she would be gone to Ireland!
    </p>
    <p>
      And the last evening before she went they took her to see "Carmen" at the
      Opera. He remembered that she wore a nearly high white frock, and a dark
      carnation in the ribbon tying her crinkly hair, that still hung loose. How
      wonderfully entranced she sat, drunk on that opera that he had seen a
      score of times; now touching his arm, now Sylvia's, whispering questions:
      "Who's that?" "What's coming now?" The Carmen roused her to adoration, but
      Don Jose was 'too fat in his funny little coat,' till, in the maddened
      jealousy of the last act, he rose superior. Then, quite lost in
      excitement, she clutched Lennan's arm; and her gasp, when Carmen at last
      fell dead, made all their neighbours jump. Her emotion was far more moving
      than that on the stage; he wanted badly to stroke, and comfort her and
      say: "There, there, my dear, it's only make-believe!" And, when it was
      over, and the excellent murdered lady and her poor fat little lover
      appeared before the curtain, finally forgetting that she was a woman of
      the world, she started forward in her seat and clapped, and clapped.
      Fortunate that Johnny Dromore was not there to see! But all things coming
      to an end, they had to get up and go. And, as they made their way out to
      the hall, Lennan felt a hot little finger crooked into his own, as if she
      simply must have something to squeeze. He really did not know what to do
      with it. She seemed to feel this half-heartedness, soon letting it go. All
      the way home in the cab she was silent. With that same abstraction she ate
      her sandwiches and drank her lemonade; took Sylvia's kiss, and, quite a
      woman of the world once more, begged that they would not get up to see her
      off -- for she was to go at seven in the morning, to catch the Irish
      mail. Then, holding out her hand to Lennan, she very gravely said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks most awfully for taking me to-night. Good-bye!"
     </p>
    <p>
      He stayed full half an hour at the window, smoking. No street lamp shone
      just there, and the night was velvety black above the plane-trees. At
      last, with a sigh, he shut up, and went tiptoe-ing upstairs in darkness.
      Suddenly in the corridor the white wall seemed to move at him. A warmth, a
      fragrance, a sound like a tiny sigh, and something soft was squeezed into
      his hand. Then the wall moved back, and he stood listening -- no sound,
      no anything! But in his dressing-room he looked at the soft thing in his
      hand. It was the carnation from her hair. What had possessed the child to
      give him that? Carmen! Ah! Carmen! And gazing at the flower, he held it
      away from him with a sort of terror; but its scent arose. And suddenly he
      thrust it, all fresh as it was, into a candle-flame, and held it, burning,
      writhing, till it blackened to velvet. Then his heart smote him for so
      cruel a deed. It was still beautiful, but its scent was gone. And turning
      to the window he flung it far out into the darkness.

    <p>
      Now that she was gone, it was curious how little they spoke of her,
      considering how long she had been with them. And they had from her but one
      letter written to Sylvia, very soon after she left, ending: "Dad sends his
      best respects, please; and with my love to you and Mr. Lennan, and all the
      beasts. -- NELL.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oliver is coming here next week. We are going to some races."
     </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult, of course, to speak of her, with that episode of the
      flower, too bizarre to be told -- the sort of thing Sylvia would see
      out of all proportion -- as, indeed, any woman might. Yet -- what
      had it really been, but the uncontrolled impulse of an emotional child
      longing to express feelings kindled by the excitement of that opera? What
      but a child's feathery warmth, one of those flying peeps at the mystery of
      passion that young things take? He could not give away that pretty
      foolishness. And because he would not give it away, he was more than
      usually affectionate to Sylvia.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had made no holiday plans, and he eagerly fell in with her suggestion
      that they should go down to Hayle. There, if anywhere, this curious
      restlessness would leave him. They had not been down to the old place for
      many years; indeed, since Gordy's death it was generally let.
    </p>
    <p>
      They left London late in August. The day was closing in when they arrived.
      Honeysuckle had long been improved away from that station paling, against
      which he had stood twenty-nine years ago, watching the train carrying Anna
      Stormer away. In the hired fly Sylvia pressed close to him, and held his
      hand beneath the ancient dust-rug. Both felt the same excitement at seeing
      again this old home. Not a single soul of the past days would be there now -- only
      the house and the trees, the owls and the stars; the river, park, and
      logan stone! It was dark when they arrived; just their bedroom and two
      sitting-rooms had been made ready, with fires burning, though it was still
      high summer. The same old execrable Heatherleys looked down from the black
      oak panellings. The same scent of apples and old mice clung here and there
      about the dark corridors with their unexpected stairways. It was all
      curiously unchanged, as old houses are when they are let furnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in the night he woke. Through the wide-open, uncurtained windows the
      night was simply alive with stars, such swarms of them swinging and
      trembling up there; and, far away, rose the melancholy, velvet-soft
      hooting of an owl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia's voice, close to him, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mark, that night when your star caught in my hair? Do you remember?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he remembered. And in his drowsy mind just roused from dreams, there
      turned and turned the queer nonsensical refrain: "I never -- never -- will
      desert Mr. Micawber...."
     </p>
    <p>
      A pleasant month that -- of reading, and walking with the dogs the
      country round, of lying out long hours amongst the boulders or along the
      river banks, watching beasts and birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old green-house temple of his early masterpieces was still
      extant, used now to protect watering pots. But no vestige of impulse
      towards work came to him down there. He was marking time; not restless,
      not bored, just waiting -- but for what, he had no notion. And Sylvia,
      at any rate, was happy, blooming in these old haunts, losing her fairness
      in the sun; even taking again to a sunbonnet, which made her look
      extraordinarily young. The trout that poor old Gordy had so harried were
      left undisturbed. No gun was fired; rabbits, pigeons, even the few
      partridges enjoyed those first days of autumn unmolested. The bracken and
      leaves turned very early, so that the park in the hazy September sunlight
      had an almost golden hue. A gentle mellowness reigned over all that
      holiday. And from Ireland came no further news, save one picture postcard
      with the words: "This is our house. -- NELL."
     </p>
    <p>
      In the last week of September they went back to London. And at once there
      began in him again that restless, unreasonable aching -- that sense of
      being drawn away out of himself; so that he once more took to walking the
      Park for hours, over grass already strewn with leaves, always looking -- craving -- and
      for what?
    </p>
    <p>
      At Dromore's the confidential man did not know when his master would be
      back; he had gone to Scotland with Miss Nell after the St. Leger. Was
      Lennan disappointed? Not so -- relieved, rather. But his ache was there
      all the time, feeding on its secrecy and loneliness, unmentionable feeling
      that it was. Why had he not realized long ago that youth was over, passion
      done with, autumn upon him? How never grasped the fact that 'Time steals
      away'? And, as before, the only refuge was in work. The sheep -- dogs
      and 'The Girl on the Magpie Horse' were finished. He began a fantastic
      'relief' -- a nymph peering from behind a rock, and a wild-eyed man
      creeping, through reeds, towards her. If he could put into the nymph's
      face something of this lure of Youth and Life and Love that was dragging
      at him, into the man's face the state of his own heart, it might lay that
      feeling to rest. Anything to get it out of himself! And he worked
      furiously, laboriously, all October, making no great progress.... What
      could he expect when Life was all the time knocking with that muffled
      tapping at his door?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the Tuesday, after the close of the last Newmarket meeting, and
      just getting dusk, when Life opened the door and walked in. She wore a
      dark-red dress, a new one, and surely her face -- her figure -- were
      very different from what he had remembered! They had quickened and become
      poignant. She was no longer a child -- that was at once plain. Cheeks,
      mouth, neck, waist -- all seemed fined, shaped; the crinkly,
      light-brown hair was coiled up now under a velvet cap; only the great grey
      eyes seemed quite the same. And at sight of her his heart gave a sort of
      dive and flight, as if all its vague and wistful sensations had found
      their goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in sudden agitation, he realized that his last moment with this girl -- now
      a child no longer -- had been a secret moment of warmth and of emotion;
      a moment which to her might have meant, in her might have bred, feelings
      that he had no inkling of. He tried to ignore that fighting and diving of
      his heart, held out his hand, and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Nell! Back at last! You've grown." Then, with a sensation of every
      limb gone weak, he felt her arms round his neck, and herself pressed
      against him. There was time for the thought to flash through him: This is
      terrible! He gave her a little convulsive squeeze -- could a man do
      less? -- then just managed to push her gently away, trying with all his
      might to think: She's a child! It's nothing more than after Carmen! She
      doesn't know what I am feeling! But he was conscious of a mad desire to
      clutch her to him. The touch of her had demolished all his vagueness, made
      things only too plain, set him on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said uncertainly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to the fire, my child, and tell me all about it."
     </p>
    <p>
      If he did not keep to the notion that she was just a child, his head would
      go. Perdita -- 'the lost one'! A good name for her, indeed, as she
      stood there, her eyes shining in the firelight -- more mesmeric than
      ever they had been! And, to get away from the lure of those eyes, he bent
      down and raked the grate, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen Sylvia?" But he knew that she had not, even before she gave
      that impatient shrug. Then he pulled himself together, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened to you, child?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not a child."
     </p>
    <p>
      "No, we've both grown older. I was forty-seven the other day."
     </p>
    <p>
      She caught his hand -- Heavens! how supple she was! -- and murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not old a bit; you're quite young." At his wits' end, with his
      heart thumping, but still keeping his eyes away from her, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Oliver?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped his hand at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oliver? I hate him!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Afraid to trust himself near her, he had begun walking up and down. And
      she stood, following him with her gaze -- the firelight playing on her
      red frock. What extraordinary stillness! What power she had developed in
      these few months! Had he let her see that he felt that power? And had all
      this come of one little moment in a dark corridor, of one flower pressed
      into his hand? Why had he not spoken to her roughly then -- told her
      she was a romantic little fool? God knew what thoughts she had been
      feeding on! But who could have supposed -- who dreamed -- ? And
      again he fixed his mind resolutely on that thought: She's a child -- only
      a child!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come!" he said: "tell me all about your time in Ireland?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! it was just dull -- it's all been dull away from you."
     </p>
    <p>
      It came out without hesitancy or shame, and he could only murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! you've missed your drawing!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Can I come to-morrow?"
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the moment to have said: No! You are a foolish child, and I an
      elderly idiot! But he had neither courage nor clearness of mind enough;
      nor -- the desire. And, without answering, he went towards the door to
      turn up the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! please don't! It's so nice like this!"
     </p>
    <p>
      The shadowy room, the bluish dusk painted on all the windows, the fitful
      shining of the fire, the pallor and darkness of the dim casts and bronzes,
      and that one glowing figure there before the hearth! And her voice, a
      little piteous, went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you glad I'm back? I can't see you properly out there."
     </p>
    <p>
      He went back into the glow, and she gave a little sigh of satisfaction.
      Then her calm young voice said, ever so distinctly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oliver wants me to marry him, and I won't, of course."
     </p>
    <p>
      He dared not say: Why not? He dared not say anything. It was too
      dangerous. And then followed those amazing words: "You know why, don't
      you? Of course you do."
     </p>
    <p>
      It was ridiculous, almost shameful to understand their meaning. And he
      stood, staring in front of him, without a word; humility, dismay, pride,
      and a sort of mad exultation, all mixed and seething within him in the
      queerest pudding of emotion. But all he said was:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, my child; we're neither of us quite ourselves to-night. Let's go to
      the drawing-room."
     </p>
    <p>
      IX
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the darkness and solitude of the studio, when she was gone, he sat
      down before the fire, his senses in a whirl. Why was he not just an
      ordinary animal of a man that could enjoy what the gods had sent? It was
      as if on a November day someone had pulled aside the sober curtains of the
      sky and there in a chink had been April standing -- thick white
      blossom, a purple cloud, a rainbow, grass vivid green, light flaring from
      one knew not where, and such a tingling passion of life on it all as made
      the heart stand still! This, then, was the marvellous, enchanting,
      maddening end of all that year of restlessness and wanting! This bit of
      Spring suddenly given to him in the midst of Autumn. Her lips, her eyes,
      her hair; her touching confidence; above all -- quite unbelievable -- her
      love. Not really love perhaps, just childish fancy. But on the wings of
      fancy this child would fly far, too far -- all wistfulness and warmth
      beneath that light veneer of absurd composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      To live again -- to plunge back into youth and beauty -- to feel
      Spring once more -- to lose the sense of all being over, save just the
      sober jogtrot of domestic bliss; to know, actually to know, ecstasy again,
      in the love of a girl; to rediscover all that youth yearns for, and feels,
      and hopes, and dreads, and loves. It was a prospect to turn the head even
      of a decent man....
    </p>
    <p>
      By just closing his eyes he could see her standing there with the
      firelight glow on her red frock; could feel again that marvellous thrill
      when she pressed herself against him in the half-innocent, seducing moment
      when she first came in; could feel again her eyes drawing -- drawing
      him! She was a witch, a grey-eyed, brown-haired witch -- even unto her
      love of red. She had the witch's power of lighting fever in the veins. And
      he simply wondered at himself, that he had not, as she stood there in the
      firelight, knelt, and put his arms round her and pressed his face against
      her waist. Why had he not? But he did not want to think; the moment
      thought began he knew he must be torn this way and that, tossed here and
      there between reason and desire, pity and passion. Every sense struggled
      to keep him wrapped in the warmth and intoxication of this discovery that
      he, in the full of Autumn, had awakened love in Spring. It was amazing
      that she could have this feeling; yet there was no mistake. Her manner to
      Sylvia just now had been almost dangerously changed; there had been a
      queer cold impatience in her look, frightening from one who but three
      months ago had been so affectionate. And, going away, she had whispered,
      with that old trembling-up at him, as if offering to be kissed: "I may
      come, mayn't I? And don't be angry with me, please; I can't help it." A
      monstrous thing at his age to let a young girl love him -- compromise
      her future! A monstrous thing by all the canons of virtue and gentility!
      And yet -- what future? -- with that nature -- those eyes -- that
      origin -- with that father, and that home? But he would not -- simply
      must not think!
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he showed the signs of thought, and badly; for after dinner
      Sylvia, putting her hand on his forehead, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're working too hard, Mark. You don't go out enough."
     </p>
    <p>
      He held those fingers fast. Sylvia! No, indeed he must not think! But he
      took advantage of her words, and said that he would go out and get some
      air.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked at a great pace -- to keep thought away -- till he reached
      the river close to Westminster, and, moved by sudden impulse, seeking
      perhaps an antidote, turned down into that little street under the big
      Wren church, where he had never been since the summer night when he lost
      what was then more to him than life. There SHE had lived; there was the
      house -- those windows which he had stolen past and gazed at with such
      distress and longing. Who lived there now? Once more he seemed to see that
      face out of the past, the dark hair, and dark soft eyes, and sweet
      gravity; and it did not reproach him. For this new feeling was not a love
      like that had been. Only once could a man feel the love that passed all
      things, the love before which the world was but a spark in a draught of
      wind; the love that, whatever dishonour, grief, and unrest it might come
      through, alone had in it the heart of peace and joy and honour. Fate had
      torn that love from him, nipped it off as a sharp wind nips off a perfect
      flower. This new feeling was but a fever, a passionate fancy, a grasping
      once more at Youth and Warmth. Ah, well! but it was real enough! And, in
      one of those moments when a man stands outside himself, seems to be lifted
      away and see his own life twirling, Lennan had a vision of a shadow driven
      here and there; a straw going round and round; a midge in the grip of a
      mad wind. Where was the home of this mighty secret feeling that sprang so
      suddenly out of the dark, and caught you by the throat? Why did it come
      now and not then, for this one and not that other? What did man know of
      it, save that it made him spin and hover -- like a moth intoxicated by
      a light, or a bee by some dark sweet flower; save that it made of him a
      distraught, humble, eager puppet of its fancy? Had it not once already
      driven him even to the edge of death; and must it now come on him again
      with its sweet madness, its drugging scent? What was it? Why was it? Why
      these passionate obsessions that could not decently be satisfied? Had
      civilization so outstripped man that his nature was cramped into shoes too
      small -- like the feet of a Chinese woman? What was it? Why was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      And faster than ever he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pall Mall brought him back to that counterfeit presentment of the real -- reality.
      There, in St. James's Street, was Johnny Dromore's Club; and, again moved
      by impulse, he pushed open its swing door. No need to ask; for there was
      Dromore in the hall, on his way from dinner to the card-room. The glossy
      tan of hard exercise and good living lay on his cheeks as thick as clouted
      cream. His eyes had the peculiar shine of superabundant vigour; a certain
      sub-festive air in face and voice and movements suggested that he was
      going to make a night of it. And the sardonic thought flashed through
      Lennan: Shall I tell him?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, old chap! Awfully glad to see you! What you doin' with yourself?
      Workin' hard? How's your wife? You been away? Been doin' anything great?"
       And then the question that would have given him his chance, if he had
      liked to be so cruel:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seen Nell?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she came round this afternoon."
     </p>
    <p>
      "What d'you think of her? Comin' on nicely, isn't she?"
     </p>
    <p>
      That old query, half furtive and half proud, as much as to say: 'I know
      she's not in the stud-book, but, d -- n it, I sired her!' And then the
      old sudden gloom, which lasted but a second, and gave way again to chaff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lennan stayed very few minutes. Never had he felt farther from his old
      school-chum.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. Whatever happened, Johnny Dromore must be left out. It was a position
      he had earned with his goggling eyes, and his astute philosophy; from it
      he should not be disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed along the railings of the Green Park. On the cold air of this
      last October night a thin haze hung, and the acrid fragrance from little
      bonfires of fallen leaves. What was there about that scent of burned-leaf
      smoke that had always moved him so? Symbol of parting! -- that most
      mournful thing in all the world. For what would even death be, but for
      parting? Sweet, long sleep, or new adventure. But, if a man loved others -- to
      leave them, or be left! Ah! and it was not death only that brought
      partings!
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to the opening of the street where Dromore lived. She would be
      there, sitting by the fire in the big chair, playing with her kitten,
      thinking, dreaming, and -- alone! He passed on at such a pace that
      people stared; till, turning the last corner for home, he ran almost into
      the arms of Oliver Dromore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was walking with unaccustomed indecision, his fur coat open,
      his opera-hat pushed up on his crisp hair. Dark under the eyes, he had not
      the proper gloss of a Dromore at this season of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lennan! I've just been round to you."
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lennan answered dazedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come in, or shall I walk your way a bit?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I'd rather -- out here, if you don't mind."
     </p>
    <p>
      So in silence they went back into the Square. And Oliver said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's get over by the rails."
     </p>
    <p>
      They crossed to the railings of the Square's dark garden, where nobody was
      passing. And with every step Lennan's humiliation grew. There was
      something false and undignified in walking with this young man who had
      once treated him as a father confessor to his love for Nell. And suddenly
      he perceived that they had made a complete circuit of the Square garden
      without speaking a single word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver turned his face away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember what I told you in the summer. Well, it's worse now. I've
      been going a mucker lately in all sorts of ways to try and get rid of it.
      But it's all no good. She's got me!"
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lennan thought: You're not alone in that! But he kept silence. His
      chief dread was of saying something that he would remember afterwards as
      the words of Judas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Oliver suddenly burst out:
    </p>

      "Why can't she care? I suppose I'm nothing much, but she's known me all
      her life, and she used to like me. There's something -- I can't make
      out. Could you do anything for me with her?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan pointed across the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In every other one of those houses, Oliver," he said, "there's probably
      some creature who can't make out why another creature doesn't care.
      Passion comes when it will, goes when it will; and we poor devils have no
      say in it."
     </p>
    <p>
      "What do you advise me, then?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Lennan had an almost overwhelming impulse to turn on his heel and leave
      the young man standing there. But he forced himself to look at his face,
      which even then had its attraction -- perhaps more so than ever, so
      pallid and desperate it was. And he said slowly, staring mentally at every
      word:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not up to giving you advice. The only thing I might say is: One does
      not press oneself where one isn't wanted; all the same -- who knows? So
      long as she feels you're there, waiting, she might turn to you at any
      moment. The more chivalrous you are, Oliver, the more patiently you wait,
      the better chance you have."
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver took those words of little comfort without flinching. "I see," he
      said. "Thanks! But, my God! it's hard. I never could wait." And with that
      epigram on himself, holding out his hand, he turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lennan went slowly home, trying to gauge exactly how anyone who knew all
      would judge him. It was a little difficult in this affair to keep a shred
      of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia had not gone up, and he saw her looking at him anxiously. The one
      strange comfort in all this was that his feeling for her, at any rate, had
      not changed. It seemed even to have deepened -- to be more real to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could he help staying awake that night? How could he help thinking,
      then? And long time he lay, staring at the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if thinking were any good for fever in the veins!
    </p>
    <p>
      X
    </p>
    <p>
      Passion never plays the game. It, at all events, is free from
      self-consciousness, and pride; from dignity, nerves, scruples, cant,
      moralities; from hypocrisies, and wisdom, and fears for pocket, and
      position in this world and the next. Well did the old painters limn it as
      an arrow or a wind! If it had not been as swift and darting, Earth must
      long ago have drifted through space untenanted -- to let....
    </p>
    <p>
      After that fevered night Lennan went to his studio at the usual hour and
      naturally did not do a stroke of work. He was even obliged to send away
      his model. The fellow had been his hairdresser, but, getting ill, and
      falling on dark days, one morning had come to the studio, to ask with
      manifest shame if his head were any good. After having tested his capacity
      for standing still, and giving him some introductions, Lennan had noted
      him down: "Five feet nine, good hair, lean face, something tortured and
      pathetic. Give him a turn if possible." The turn had come, and the poor
      man was posing in a painful attitude, talking, whenever permitted, of the
      way things had treated him, and the delights of cutting hair. This morning
      he took his departure with the simple pleasure of one fully paid for
      services not rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, walking up and down, up and down, the sculptor waited for Nell's
      knock. What would happen now? Thinking had made nothing clear. Here was
      offered what every warm-blooded man whose Spring is past desires -- youth
      and beauty, and in that youth a renewal of his own; what all men save
      hypocrites and Englishmen would even admit that they desired. And it was
      offered to one who had neither religious nor moral scruples, as they are
      commonly understood. In theory he could accept. In practice he did not as
      yet know what he could do. One thing only he had discovered during the
      night's reflections: That those who scouted belief in the principle of
      Liberty made no greater mistake than to suppose that Liberty was dangerous
      because it made a man a libertine. To those with any decency, the creed of
      Freedom was -- of all -- the most enchaining. Easy enough to break
      chains imposed by others, fling his cap over the windmill, and cry for the
      moment at least: I am unfettered, free! Hard, indeed, to say the same to
      his own unfettered Self! Yes, his own Self was in the judgment-seat; by
      his own verdict and decision he must abide. And though he ached for the
      sight of her, and his will seemed paralyzed -- many times already he
      had thought: It won't do! God help me!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then twelve o'clock had come, and she had not. Would 'The Girl on the
      Magpie Horse' be all he would see of her to-day -- that unsatisfying
      work, so cold, and devoid of witchery? Better have tried to paint her -- with
      a red flower in her hair, a pout on her lips, and her eyes fey, or
      languorous. Goya could have painted her!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, just as he had given her up, she came.
    </p>
    <p>
      After taking one look at his face, she slipped in ever so quietly, like a
      very good child.... Marvellous the instinct and finesse of the young when
      they are women!... Not a vestige in her of yesterday's seductive power;
      not a sign that there had been a yesterday at all -- just confiding,
      like a daughter. Sitting there, telling him about Ireland, showing him the
      little batch of drawings she had done while she was away. Had she brought
      them because she knew they would make him feel sorry for her? What could
      have been less dangerous, more appealing to the protective and paternal
      side of him than she was that morning; as if she only wanted what her
      father and her home could not give her -- only wanted to be a sort of
      daughter to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      She went away demurely, as she had come, refusing to stay to lunch,
      manifestly avoiding Sylvia. Only then he realized that she must have taken
      alarm from the look of strain on his face, been afraid that he would send
      her away; only then perceived that, with her appeal to his protection, she
      had been binding him closer, making it harder for him to break away and
      hurt her. And the fevered aching began again -- worse than ever -- the
      moment he lost sight of her. And more than ever he felt in the grip of
      something beyond his power to fight against; something that, however he
      swerved, and backed, and broke away, would close in on him, find means to
      bind him again hand and foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon Dromore's confidential man brought him a note. The
      fellow, with his cast-down eyes, and his well-parted hair, seemed to
      Lennan to be saying: "Yes, sir -- it is quite natural that you should
      take the note out of eyeshot, sir -- BUT I KNOW; fortunately, there is
      no necessity for alarm -- I am strictly confidential."
     </p>
    <p>
      And this was what the note contained:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You promised to ride with me once -- you DID promise, and you never
      have. Do please ride with me to-morrow; then you will get what you want
      for the statuette instead of being so cross with it. You can have Dad's
      horse -- he has gone to Newmarket again, and I'm so lonely. Please -- to-morrow,
      at half-past two -- starting from here.  -- NELL."
     </p>
    <p>
      To hesitate in view of those confidential eyes was not possible; it must
      be 'Yes' or 'No'; and if 'No,' it would only mean that she would come in
      the morning instead. So he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just say 'All right!'"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, sir." Then from the door: "Mr. Dromore will be away till
      Saturday, sir."
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, why had the fellow said that? Curious how this desperate secret
      feeling of his own made him see sinister meaning in this servant, in
      Oliver's visit of last night -- in everything. It was vile -- this
      suspiciousness! He could feel, almost see, himself deteriorating already,
      with this furtive feeling in his soul. It would soon be written on his
      face! But what was the use of troubling? What would come, would -- one
      way or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he remembered with a shock that it was the first of November -- Sylvia's
      birthday! He had never before forgotten it. In the disturbance of that
      discovery he was very near to going and pouring out to her the whole story
      of his feelings. A charming birthday present, that would make! Taking his
      hat, instead, he dashed round to the nearest flower shop. A Frenchwoman
      kept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had she?
    </p>
    <p>
      What did Monsieur desire? "Des oeillets rouges? J'en ai de bien beaux ce
      soir."
     </p>
    <p>
      No -- not those. White flowers!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Une belle azalee?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that would do -- to be sent at once -- at once!
    </p>
    <p>
      Next door was a jeweller's. He had never really known if Sylvia cared for
      jewels, since one day he happened to remark that they were vulgar. And
      feeling that he had fallen low indeed, to be trying to atone with some
      miserable gewgaw for never having thought of her all day, because he had
      been thinking of another, he went in and bought the only ornament whose
      ingredients did not make his gorge rise, two small pear-shaped black
      pearls, one at each end of a fine platinum chain. Coming out with it, he
      noticed over the street, in a clear sky fast deepening to indigo, the
      thinnest slip of a new moon, like a bright swallow, with wings bent back,
      flying towards the ground. That meant -- fine weather! If it could only
      be fine weather in his heart! And in order that the azalea might arrive
      first, he walked up and down the Square which he and Oliver had patrolled
      the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he went in, Sylvia was just placing the white azalea in the window of
      the drawing-room; and stealing up behind her he clasped the little necklet
      round her throat. She turned round and clung to him. He could feel that
      she was greatly moved. And remorse stirred and stirred in him that he was
      betraying her with his kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, even while he kissed her, he was hardening his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      XI
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, still following the lead of her words about fresh air and his
      tired look, he told her that he was going to ride, and did not say with
      whom. After applauding his resolution, she was silent for a little -- then
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you ride with Nell?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He had already so lost his dignity, that he hardly felt disgraced in
      answering:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might bore her!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no; it wouldn't bore her."
     </p>
    <p>
      Had she meant anything by that? And feeling as if he were fencing with his
      own soul, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, I will."
     </p>
    <p>
      He had perceived suddenly that he did not know his wife, having always
      till now believed that it was she who did not quite know him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had not been out at lunch-time, he would have lunched out himself -- afraid
      of his own face. For feverishness in sick persons mounts steadily with the
      approach of a certain hour. And surely his face, to anyone who could have
      seen him being conveyed to Piccadilly, would have suggested a fevered
      invalid rather than a healthy, middle-aged sculptor in a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horses were before the door -- the little magpie horse, and a
      thoroughbred bay mare, weeded from Dromore's racing stable. Nell, too, was
      standing ready, her cheeks very pink, and her eyes very bright. She did
      not wait for him to mount her, but took the aid of the confidential man.
      What was it that made her look so perfect on that little horse -- shape
      of limb, or something soft and fiery in her spirit that the little
      creature knew of?
    </p>
    <p>
      They started in silence, but as soon as the sound of hoofs died on the tan
      of Rotten Row, she turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was lovely of you to come! I thought you'd be afraid -- you ARE
      afraid of me."
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lennan thought: You're right!
    </p>
    <p>
      "But please don't look like yesterday. To-day's too heavenly. Oh! I love
      beautiful days, and I love riding, and -- " She broke off and looked at
      him. 'Why can't you just be nice to me' -- she seemed to be saying -- 'and
      love me as you ought!' That was her power -- the conviction that he
      did, and ought to love her; that she ought to and did love him. How
      simple!
    </p>
    <p>
      But riding, too, is a simple passion; and simple passions distract each
      other. It was a treat to be on that bay mare. Who so to be trusted to ride
      the best as Johnny Dromore?
    </p>
    <p>
      At the far end of the Row she cried out: "Let's go on to Richmond now,"
       and trotted off into the road, as if she knew she could do with him what
      she wished. And, following meekly, he asked himself: Why? What was there
      in her to make up to him for all that he was losing -- his power of
      work, his dignity, his self-respect? What was there? Just those eyes, and
      lips, and hair?
    </p>
    <p>
      And as if she knew what he was thinking, she looked round and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they jogged on over the Bridge and across Barnes Common into Richmond
      Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the moment they touched turf, with one look back at him, she was off.
      Had she all the time meant to give him this breakneck chase -- or had
      the loveliness of that Autumn day gone to her head -- blue sky and
      coppery flames of bracken in the sun, and the beech leaves and the oak
      leaves; pure Highland colouring come South for once.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in the first burst he had tested the mare's wind, this chase of her,
      indeed, was sheer delight. Through glades, over fallen tree-trunks, in
      bracken up to the hocks, out across the open, past a herd of amazed and
      solemn deer, over rotten ground all rabbit-burrows, till just as he
      thought he was up to her, she slipped away by a quick turn round trees.
      Mischief incarnate, but something deeper than mischief, too! He came up
      with her at last, and leaned over to seize her rein. With a cut of her
      whip that missed his hand by a bare inch, and a wrench, she made him shoot
      past, wheeled in her tracks, and was off again like an arrow, back amongst
      the trees -- lying right forward under the boughs, along the neck of
      her little horse. Then out from amongst the trees she shot downhill. Right
      down she went, full tilt, and after her went Lennan, lying back, and
      expecting the bay mare to come down at every stride. This was her idea of
      fun! She switched round at the bottom and went galloping along the foot of
      the hill; and he thought: Now I've got her! She could not break back up
      that hill, and there was no other cover for fully half a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw, not thirty yards in front, an old sandpit; and Great God! she
      was going straight at it! And shouting frantically, he reined his mare
      outwards. But she only raised her whip, cut the magpie horse over the
      flank, and rode right on. He saw that little demon gather its feet and
      spring -- down, down, saw him pitch, struggle, sink -- and she,
      flung forward, roll over and lie on her back. He felt nothing at the
      moment, only had that fixed vision of a yellow patch of sand, the blue
      sky, a rook flying, and her face upturned. But when he came on her she was
      on her feet, holding the bridle of her dazed horse. No sooner did he touch
      her, than she sank down. Her eyes were closed, but he could feel that she
      had not fainted; and he just held her, and kept pressing his lips to her
      eyes and forehead. Suddenly she let her head fall back, and her lips met
      his. Then opening her eyes, she said: "I'm not hurt, only -- funny. Has
      Magpie cut his knees?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Not quite knowing what he did, he got up to look. The little horse was
      cropping at some grass, unharmed -- the sand and fern had saved his
      knees. And the languid voice behind him said: "It's all right -- you
      can leave the horses. They'll come when I call."
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that he knew she was unhurt, he felt angry. Why had she behaved in
      this mad way -- given him this fearful shock? But in that same languid
      voice she went on: "Don't be cross with me. I thought at first I'd pull
      up, but then I thought: 'If I jump he can't help being nice' -- so I
      did -- Don't leave off loving me because I'm not hurt, please."
     </p>
    <p>
      Terribly moved, he sat down beside her, took her hands in his, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nell! Nell! it's all wrong -- it's madness!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Don't think about it! I don't want you to think -- only to love
      me."
     </p>
    <p>
      "My child, you don't know what love is!"
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer she only flung her arms round his neck; then, since he held
      back from kissing her, let them fall again, and jumped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. But I love you. You can think of THAT -- you can't prevent
      me!" And without waiting for help, she mounted the magpie horse from the
      sand-heap where they had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very sober that ride home! The horses, as if ashamed of their mad chase,
      were edging close to each other, so that now and then his arm would touch
      her shoulder. He asked her once what she had felt while she was jumping.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only to be sure my foot was free. It was rather horrid coming down,
      thinking of Magpie's knees;" and touching the little horse's goat-like
      ears, she added softly: "Poor dear! He'll be stiff to-morrow."
     </p>
    <p>
      She was again only the confiding, rather drowsy, child. Or was it that the
      fierceness of those past moments had killed his power of feeling? An
      almost dreamy hour -- with the sun going down, the lamps being lighted
      one by one -- and a sort of sweet oblivion over everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door, where the groom was waiting, Lennan would have said good-bye,
      but she whispered: "Oh, no, please! I AM tired now -- you might help me
      up a little."
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, half carrying her, he mounted past the Vanity Fair cartoons, and
      through the corridor with the red paper and the Van Beers' drawings, into
      the room where he had first seen her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once settled back in Dromore's great chair, with the purring kitten curled
      up on her neck, she murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it nice? You can make tea; and we'll have hot buttered toast."
     </p>
    <p>
      And so Lennan stayed, while the confidential man brought tea and toast;
      and, never once looking at them, seemed to know all that had passed, all
      that might be to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they were alone again, and, gazing down at her stretched out in that
      great chair, Lennan thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God that I'm tired too -- body and soul!"
     </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly she looked up at him, and pointing to the picture that to-day
      had no curtain drawn, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I'm like her? I made Oliver tell me about -- myself this
      summer. That's why you needn't bother. It doesn't matter what happens to
      me, you see. And I don't care -- because you can love me, without
      feeling bad about it. And you will, won't you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, with her eyes still on his face, she went on quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only we won't talk about that now, will we? It's too cosy. I AM nice and
      tired. Do smoke!"
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lennan's fingers trembled so that he could hardly light that
      cigarette. And, watching them, she said: "Please give me one. Dad doesn't
      like my smoking."
     </p>
    <p>
      The virtue of Johnny Dromore! Yes! It would always be by proxy! And he
      muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you think he would like to know about this afternoon, Nell?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care." Then peering up through the kitten's fur she murmured:
      "Oliver wants me to go to a dance on Saturday -- it's for a charity.
      Shall I?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; why not?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Will YOU come?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do! You must! It's my very first, you know. I've got an extra
      ticket."
     </p>
    <p>
      And against his will, his judgment -- everything, Lennan answered:
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      She clapped her hands, and the kitten crawled down to her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got up to go, she did not move, but just looked up at him; and how
      he got away he did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stopping his cab a little short of home, he ran, for he felt cold and
      stiff, and letting himself in with his latch-key, went straight to the
      drawing-room. The door was ajar, and Sylvia standing at the window. He
      heard her sigh; and his heart smote him. Very still, and slender, and
      lonely she looked out there, with the light shining on her fair hair so
      that it seemed almost white. Then she turned and saw him. He noticed her
      throat working with the effort she made not to show him anything, and he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely you haven't been anxious! Nell had a bit of a fall -- jumping
      into a sandpit. She's quite mad sometimes. I stayed to tea with her -- just
      to make sure she wasn't really hurt." But as he spoke he loathed himself;
      his voice sounded so false.
    </p>
    <p>
      She only answered: "It's all right, dear," but he saw that she kept her
      eyes -- those blue, too true eyes -- averted, even when she kissed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so began another evening and night and morning of fever, subterfuge,
      wariness, aching. A round of half-ecstatic torment, out of which he seemed
      no more able to break than a man can break through the walls of a cell....
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it live but a day in the sun, though it drown in tenebrous night,
      the dark flower of passion will have its hour....
    </p>
    <p>
      XII
    </p>
    <p>
      To deceive undoubtedly requires a course of training. And, unversed in
      this art, Lennan was fast finding it intolerable to scheme and watch
      himself, and mislead one who had looked up to him ever since they were
      children. Yet, all the time, he had a feeling that, since he alone knew
      all the circumstances of his case, he alone was entitled to blame or to
      excuse himself. The glib judgments that moralists would pass upon his
      conduct could be nothing but the imbecilities of smug and pharisaic fools -- of
      those not under this drugging spell -- of such as had not blood enough,
      perhaps, ever to fall beneath it!
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the ride Nell had not come, and he had no word from her. Was
      she, then, hurt, after all? She had lain back very inertly in that chair!
      And Sylvia never asked if he knew how the girl was after her fall, nor
      offered to send round to inquire. Did she not wish to speak of her, or had
      she simply -- not believed? When there was so much he could not talk of
      it seemed hard that just what happened to be true should be distrusted.
      She had not yet, indeed, by a single word suggested that she felt he was
      deceiving her, but at heart he knew that she was not deceived.... Those
      feelers of a woman who loves -- can anything check their delicate
      apprehension? . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards evening, the longing to see the girl -- a sensation as if she
      were calling him to come to her -- became almost insupportable; yet,
      whatever excuse he gave, he felt that Sylvia would know where he was
      going. He sat on one side of the fire, she on the other, and they both
      read books; the only strange thing about their reading was, that neither
      of them ever turned a leaf. It was 'Don Quixote' he read, the page which
      had these words: "Let Altisidora weep or sing, still I am Dulcinea's and
      hers alone, dead or alive, dutiful and unchanged, in spite of all the
      necromantic powers in the world." And so the evening passed. When she went
      up to bed, he was very near to stealing out, driving up to the Dromores'
      door, and inquiring of the confidential man; but the thought of the
      confounded fellow's eyes was too much for him, and he held out. He took up
      Sylvia's book, De Maupassant's 'Fort comme la mort' -- open at the page
      where the poor woman finds that her lover has passed away from her to her
      own daughter. And as he read, the tears rolled down his cheek. Sylvia!
      Sylvia! Were not his old favourite words from that old favourite book
      still true? "Dulcinea del Toboso is the most beautiful woman in the world,
      and I the most unfortunate knight upon the earth. It were unjust that such
      perfection should suffer through my weakness. No, pierce my body with your
      lance, knight, and let my life expire with my honour...." Why could he not
      wrench this feeling from his heart, banish this girl from his eyes? Why
      could he not be wholly true to her who was and always had been wholly true
      to him? Horrible -- this will-less, nerveless feeling, this paralysis,
      as if he were a puppet moved by a cruel hand. And, as once before, it
      seemed to him that the girl was sitting there in Sylvia's chair in her
      dark red frock, with her eyes fixed on him. Uncannily vivid -- that
      impression!... A man could not go on long with his head in Chancery like
      this, without becoming crazed!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was growing dusk on Saturday afternoon when he gave up that intolerable
      waiting and opened the studio door to go to Nell. It was now just two days
      since he had seen or heard of her. She had spoken of a dance for that very
      night -- of his going to it. She MUST be ill!
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had not taken six steps when he saw her coming. She had on a grey
      furry scarf, hiding her mouth, making her look much older. The moment the
      door was shut she threw it off, went to the hearth, drew up a little
      stool, and, holding her hands out to the fire, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you thought about me? Have you thought enough now?"
     </p>
    <p>
      And he answered: "Yes, I've thought, but I'm no nearer."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Nobody need ever know you love me. And if they did, I wouldn't
      care."
     </p>
    <p>
      Simple! How simple! Glorious, egoistic youth!
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not speak of Sylvia to this child -- speak of his married
      life, hitherto so dignified, so almost sacred. It was impossible. Then he
      heard her say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be wrong to love YOU! I don't care if it is wrong," and saw her
      lips quivering, and her eyes suddenly piteous and scared, as if for the
      first time she doubted of the issue. Here was fresh torment! To watch an
      unhappy child. And what was the use of even trying to make clear to her -- on
      the very threshold of life -- the hopeless maze that he was wandering
      in! What chance of making her understand the marsh of mud and tangled
      weeds he must drag through to reach her. "Nobody need know." So simple!
      What of his heart and his wife's heart? And, pointing to his new work -- the
      first man bewitched by the first nymph -- he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at this, Nell! That nymph is you; and this man is me." She got up,
      and came to look. And while she was gazing he greedily drank her in. What
      a strange mixture of innocence and sorcery! What a wonderful young
      creature to bring to full knowledge of love within his arms! And he said:
      "You had better understand what you are to me -- all that I shall never
      know again; there it is in that nymph's face. Oh, no! not YOUR face. And
      there am I struggling through slime to reach you -- not MY face, of
      course."
     </p>
    <p>
      She said: "Poor face!" then covered her own. Was she going to cry, and
      torture him still more? But, instead, she only murmured: "But you HAVE
      reached me!" swayed towards him, and put her lips to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave way then. From that too stormy kiss of his she drew back for a
      second, then, as if afraid of her own recoil, snuggled close again. But
      the instinctive shrinking of innocence had been enough for Lennan -- he
      dropped his arms and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must go, child."
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word she picked up her fur, put it on, and stood waiting for him
      to speak. Then, as he did not, she held out something white. It was the
      card for the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said you were coming?"
     </p>
    <p>
      And he nodded. Her eyes and lips smiled at him; she opened the door, and,
      still with that slow, happy smile, went out....
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he would be coming; wherever she was, whenever she wanted him!...
    </p>
    <p>
      His blood on fire, heedless of everything but to rush after happiness,
      Lennan spent those hours before the dance. He had told Sylvia that he
      would be dining at his Club -- a set of rooms owned by a small coterie
      of artists in Chelsea. He had taken this precaution, feeling that he could
      not sit through dinner opposite her and then go out to that dance -- and
      Nell! He had spoken of a guest at the Club, to account for evening dress -- another
      lie, but what did it matter? He was lying all the time, if not in words,
      in action -- must lie, indeed, to save her suffering!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped at the Frenchwoman's flower shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Que desirez-vous, monsieur? Des oeillets rouges -- j'en ai de bien
      beaux, ce soir."
     </p>
    <p>
      Des oeillets rouges? Yes, those to-night! To this address. No green with
      them; no card!
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange the feeling -- with the die once cast for love -- of
      rushing, of watching his own self being left behind!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Brompton Road, outside a little restaurant, a thin musician was
      playing on a violin. Ah! and he knew this place; he would go in there, not
      to the Club -- and the fiddler should have all he had to spare, for
      playing those tunes of love. He turned in. He had not been there since the
      day before that night on the river, twenty years ago. Never since; and yet
      it was not changed. The same tarnished gilt, and smell of cooking; the
      same macaroni in the same tomato sauce; the same Chianti flasks; the same
      staring, light-blue walls wreathed with pink flowers. Only the waiter
      different -- hollow-cheeked, patient, dark of eye. He, too, should be
      well tipped! And that poor, over-hatted lady, eating her frugal meal -- to
      her, at all events, a look of kindness. For all desperate creatures he
      must feel, this desperate night! And suddenly he thought of Oliver.
      Another desperate one! What should he say to Oliver at this dance -- he,
      aged forty-seven, coming there without his wife! Some imbecility, such as:
      'Watching the human form divine in motion,' 'Catching sidelights on Nell
      for the statuette' -- some cant; it did not matter! The wine was drawn,
      and he must drink!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still early when he left the restaurant -- a dry night, very
      calm, not cold. When had he danced last? With Olive Cramier, before he
      knew he loved her. Well, THAT memory could not be broken, for he would not
      dance to-night! Just watch, sit with the girl a few minutes, feel her hand
      cling to his, see her eyes turned back to him; and -- come away! And
      then -- the future! For the wine was drawn! The leaf of a plane-tree,
      fluttering down, caught on his sleeve. Autumn would soon be gone, and
      after Autumn -- only Winter! She would have done with him long before
      he came to Winter. Nature would see to it that Youth called for her, and
      carried her away. Nature in her courses! But just to cheat Nature for a
      little while! To cheat Nature -- what greater happiness!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the place with red-striped awning, carriages driving away,
      loiterers watching. He turned in with a beating heart. Was he before her?
      How would she come to this first dance? With Oliver alone? Or had some
      chaperon been found? To have come because she -- this child so lovely,
      born 'outside' -- might have need of chaperonage, would have been some
      comfort to dignity, so wistful, so lost as his. But, alas! he knew he was
      only there because he could not keep away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Already they were dancing in the hall upstairs; but not she, yet; and he
      stood leaning against the wall where she must pass. Lonely and out of
      place he felt; as if everyone must know why he was there. People stared,
      and he heard a girl ask: "Who's that against the wall with the hair and
      dark moustache?" -- and her partner murmuring his answer, and her voice
      again: "Yes, he looks as if he were seeing sand and lions." For whom,
      then, did they take him? Thank heaven! They were all the usual sort. There
      would be no one that he knew. Suppose Johnny Dromore himself came with
      Nell! He was to be back on Saturday! What could he say, then? How meet
      those doubting, knowing eyes, goggling with the fixed philosophy that a
      man has but one use for woman? God! and it would be true! For a moment he
      was on the point of getting his coat and hat, and sneaking away. That
      would mean not seeing her till Monday; and he stood his ground. But after
      to-night there must be no more such risks -- their meetings must be
      wisely planned, must sink underground. And then he saw her at the foot of
      the stairs in a dress of a shell-pink colour, with one of his flowers in
      her light-brown hair and the others tied to the handle of a tiny fan. How
      self-possessed she looked, as if this were indeed her native element -- her
      neck and arms bare, her cheeks a deep soft pink, her eyes quickly turning
      here and there. She began mounting the stairs, and saw him. Was ever
      anything so lovely as she looked just then? Behind her he marked Oliver,
      and a tall girl with red hair, and another young man. He moved
      deliberately to the top of the stairs on the wall side, so that from
      behind they should not see her face when she greeted him. She put the
      little fan with the flowers to her lips; and, holding out her hand, said,
      quick and low:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fourth, it's a polka; we'll sit out, won't we?"
     </p>
    <p>
      Then swaying a little, so that her hair and the flower in it almost
      touched his face, she passed, and there in her stead stood Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lennan had expected one of his old insolent looks, but the young man's
      face was eager and quite friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was awfully good of you to come, Mr. Lennan. Is Mrs. Lennan -- "
     </p>
    <p>
      And Lennan murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "She wasn't able; she's not quite -- " and could have sunk into the
      shining floor. Youth with its touching confidence, its eager trust! This
      was the way he was fulfilling his duty towards Youth!
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had passed into the ballroom he went back to his position
      against the wall. They were dancing Number Three; his time of waiting,
      then, was drawing to a close. From where he stood he could not see the
      dancers -- no use to watch her go round in someone else's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a true waltz -- some French or Spanish pavement song played in
      waltz time; bizarre, pathetic, whirling after its own happiness. That
      chase for happiness! Well, life, with all its prizes and its
      possibilities, had nothing that quite satisfied -- save just the
      fleeting moments of passion! Nothing else quite poignant enough to be
      called pure joy! Or so it seemed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waltz was over. He could see her now, on a rout seat against the wall
      with the other young man, turning her eyes constantly as if to make sure
      that he was still standing there. What subtle fuel was always being added
      to the fire by that flattery of her inexplicable adoration -- of those
      eyes that dragged him to her, yet humbly followed him, too! Five times
      while she sat there he saw the red-haired girl or Oliver bring men up; saw
      youths cast longing glances; saw girls watching her with cold
      appraisement, or with a touching, frank delight. From the moment that she
      came in, there had been, in her father's phrase, 'only one in it.' And she
      could pass all this by, and still want him. Incredible!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first notes of the polka he went to her. It was she who found their
      place of refuge -- a little alcove behind two palm-plants. But sitting
      there, he realized, as never before, that there was no spiritual communion
      between him and this child. She could tell him her troubles or her joys;
      he could soothe or sympathize; but never would the gap between their
      natures and their ages be crossed. His happiness was only in the sight and
      touch of her. But that, God knew, was happiness enough -- a feverish,
      craving joy, like an overtired man's thirst, growing with the drink on
      which it tries to slake itself. Sitting there, in the scent of those
      flowers and of some sweet essence in her hair, with her fingers touching
      his, and her eyes seeking his, he tried loyally not to think of himself,
      to grasp her sensations at this her first dance, and just help her to
      enjoyment. But he could not -- paralyzed, made drunk by that insensate
      longing to take her in his arms and crush her to him as he had those few
      hours back. He could see her expanding like a flower, in all this light,
      and motion, and intoxicating admiration round her. What business had he in
      her life, with his dark hunger after secret hours; he -- a coin worn
      thin already -- a destroyer of the freshness and the glamour of her
      youth and beauty!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, holding up the flowers, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you give me these because of the one I gave you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do with that?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Burned it."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! but why?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Because you are a witch -- and witches must be burned with all their
      flowers."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to burn me?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand on her cool arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Feel! The flames are lighted."
     </p>
    <p>
      "You may! I don't care!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his hand and laid her cheek against it; yet, to the music, which
      had begun again, the tip of her shoe was already beating time. And he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to be dancing, child."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! Only it's a pity you don't want to."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! Do you understand that it must all be secret -- underground?"
     </p>
    <p>
      She covered his lips with the fan, and said: "You're not to think; you're
      not to think -- never! When can I come?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I must find the best way. Not to-morrow. Nobody must know, Nell -- for
      your sake -- for hers -- nobody!"
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, and repeated with a soft, mysterious wisdom: "Nobody." And
      then, aloud: "Here's Oliver! It was awfully good of you to come.
      Good-night!"
     </p>
    <p>
      And as, on Oliver's arm, she left their little refuge, she looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lingered -- to watch her through this one dance. How they made all
      the other couples sink into insignificance, with that something in them
      both that was better than mere good looks -- that something not outre
      or eccentric, but poignant, wayward. They went well together, those two
      Dromores -- his dark head and her fair head; his clear, brown, daring
      eyes, and her grey, languorous, mesmeric eyes. Ah! Master Oliver was happy
      now, with her so close to him! It was not jealousy that Lennan felt. Not
      quite -- one did not feel jealous of the young; something very deep -- pride,
      sense of proportion, who knew what -- prevented that. She, too, looked
      happy, as if her soul were dancing, vibrating with the music and the scent
      of the flowers. He waited for her to come round once more, to get for a
      last time that flying glance turned back; then found his coat and hat and
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIII
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, he walked a few steps, then stood looking back at the windows of
      the hall through some trees, the shadows of whose trunks, in the light of
      a street lamp, were spilled out along the ground like the splines of a
      fan. A church clock struck eleven. For hours yet she would be there, going
      round and round in the arms of Youth! Try as he might he could never
      recapture for himself the look that Oliver's face had worn -- the look
      that was the symbol of so much more than he himself could give her. Why
      had she come into his life -- to her undoing, and his own? And the
      bizarre thought came to him: If she were dead should I really care? Should
      I not be almost glad? If she were dead her witchery would be dead, and I
      could stand up straight again and look people in the face! What was this
      power that played with men, darted into them, twisted their hearts to
      rags; this power that had looked through her eyes when she put her fan,
      with his flowers, to her lips?
    </p>
    <p>
      The thrumming of the music ceased; he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must have been nearly twelve when he reached home. Now, once more,
      would begin the gruesome process of deception -- flinching of soul, and
      brazening of visage. It would be better when the whole thievish business
      was irretrievably begun and ordered in its secret courses!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no light in the drawing-room, save just the glow of the fire. If
      only Sylvia might have gone to bed! Then he saw her, sitting motionless
      out there by the uncurtained window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went over to her, and began his hateful formula:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid you've been lonely. I had to stay rather late. A dull
      evening." And, since she did not move or answer, but just sat there very
      still and white, he forced himself to go close, bend down to her, touch
      her cheek; even to kneel beside her. She looked round then; her face was
      quiet enough, but her eyes were strangely eager. With a pitiful little
      smile she broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mark! What is it -- what is it? Anything is better than this!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the smile, perhaps her voice or eyes -- but something
      gave way in Lennan. Secrecy, precaution went by the board. Bowing his head
      against her breast, he poured it all out, while they clung, clutched
      together in the half dark like two frightened children. Only when he had
      finished did he realize that if she had pushed him away, refused to let
      him touch her, it would have been far less piteous, far easier to bear,
      than her wan face and her hands clutching him, and her words: "I never
      thought -- you and I -- oh! Mark -- you and I -- " The trust
      in their life together, in himself, that those words revealed! Yet, not
      greater than he had had -- still had! She could not understand -- he
      had known that she could never understand; it was why he had fought so for
      secrecy, all through. She was taking it as if she had lost everything; and
      in his mind she had lost nothing. This passion, this craving for Youth and
      Life, this madness -- call it what one would -- was something quite
      apart, not touching his love and need of her. If she would only believe
      that! Over and over he repeated it; over and over again perceived that she
      could not take it in. The only thing she saw was that his love had gone
      from her to another -- though that was not true! Suddenly she broke out
      of his arms, pushing him from her, and cried: "That girl -- hateful,
      horrible, false!" Never had he seen her look like this, with flaming spots
      in her white cheeks, soft lips and chin distorted, blue eyes flaming,
      breast heaving, as if each breath were drawn from lungs that received no
      air. And then, as quickly, the fire went out of her; she sank down on the
      sofa; covering her face with her arms, rocking to and fro. She did not
      cry, but a little moan came from her now and then. And each one of those
      sounds was to Lennan like the cry of something he was murdering. At last
      he went and sat down on the sofa by her and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sylvia! Sylvia! Don't! oh! don't!" And she was silent, ceasing to rock
      herself; letting him smooth and stroke her. But her face she kept hidden,
      and only once she spoke, so low that he could hardly hear: "I can't -- I
      won't keep you from her." And with the awful feeling that no words could
      reach or soothe the wound in that tender heart, he could only go on
      stroking and kissing her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was atrocious -- horrible -- this that he had done! God knew that
      he had not sought it -- the thing had come on him. Surely even in her
      misery she could see that! Deep down beneath his grief and self-hatred, he
      knew, what neither she nor anyone else could know -- that he could not
      have prevented this feeling, which went back to days before he ever saw
      the girl -- that no man could have stopped that feeling in himself.
      This craving and roving was as much part of him as his eyes and hands, as
      overwhelming and natural a longing as his hunger for work, or his need of
      the peace that Sylvia gave, and alone could give him. That was the tragedy -- it
      was all sunk and rooted in the very nature of a man. Since the girl had
      come into their lives he was no more unfaithful to his wife in thought
      than he had been before. If only she could look into him, see him exactly
      as he was, as, without part or lot in the process, he had been made -- then
      she would understand, and even might not suffer; but she could not, and he
      could never make it plain. And solemnly, desperately, with a weary feeling
      of the futility of words, he went on trying: Could she not see? It was all
      a thing outside him -- a craving, a chase after beauty and life, after
      his own youth! At that word she looked at him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think I don't want my youth back?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a woman to feel that her beauty -- the brightness of her hair and
      eyes, the grace and suppleness of her limbs -- were slipping from her
      and from the man she loved! Was there anything more bitter? -- or any
      more sacred duty than not to add to that bitterness, not to push her with
      suffering into old age, but to help keep the star of her faith in her
      charm intact!
    </p>
    <p>
      Man and woman -- they both wanted youth again; she, that she might give
      it all to him; he, because it would help him towards something -- new!
      Just that world of difference!
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, dear, let's try and sleep."
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not once said that he could give it up. The words would not pass
      his lips, though he knew she must be conscious that he had not said them,
      must be longing to hear them. All he had been able to say was:
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long as you want me, you shall never lose me... and, I will never keep
      anything from you again."
     </p>
    <p>
      Up in their room she lay hour after hour in his arms, quite unresentful,
      but without life in her, and with eyes that, when his lips touched them,
      were always wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a maze was a man's heart, wherein he must lose himself every minute!
      What involved and intricate turnings and turnings on itself; what fugitive
      replacement of emotion by emotion! What strife between pities and
      passions; what longing for peace! . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      And in his feverish exhaustion, which was almost sleep, Lennan hardly knew
      whether it was the thrum of music or Sylvia's moaning that he heard; her
      body or Nell's within his arms....
    </p>
    <p>
      But life had to be lived, a face preserved against the world, engagements
      kept. And the nightmare went on for both of them, under the calm surface
      of an ordinary Sunday. They were like people walking at the edge of a high
      cliff, not knowing from step to step whether they would fall; or like
      swimmers struggling for issue out of a dark whirlpool.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon they went together to a concert; it was just something to
      do -- something that saved them for an hour or two from the possibility
      of speaking on the one subject left to them. The ship had gone down, and
      they were clutching at anything that for a moment would help to keep them
      above water.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening some people came to supper; a writer and two painters, with
      their wives. A grim evening -- never more so than when the conversation
      turned on that perennial theme -- the freedom, spiritual, mental,
      physical, requisite for those who practise Art. All the stale arguments
      were brought forth, and had to be joined in with unmoved faces. And for
      all their talk of freedom, Lennan could see the volte-face his friends
      would be making, if they only knew. It was not 'the thing' to seduce young
      girls -- as if, forsooth, there were freedom in doing only what people
      thought 'the thing'! Their cant about the free artist spirit experiencing
      everything, would wither the moment it came up against a canon of 'good
      form,' so that in truth it was no freer than the bourgeois spirit, with
      its conventions; or the priest spirit, with its cry of 'Sin!' No, no! To
      resist -- if resistance were possible to this dragging power -- maxims
      of 'good form,' dogmas of religion and morality, were no help -- nothing
      was any help, but some feeling stronger than passion itself. Sylvia's
      face, forced to smile! -- that, indeed was a reason why they should
      condemn him! None of their doctrines about freedom could explain that away -- the
      harm, the death that came to a man's soul when he made a loving, faithful
      creature suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they were gone at last -- with their "Thanks so much!" and their
      "Delightful evening!"
     </p>
    <p>
      And those two were face to face for another night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that it must begin all over again -- inevitable, after the stab
      of that wretched argument plunged into their hearts and turned and turned
      all the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't, I mustn't keep you starved, and spoil your work. Don't think of
      me, Mark! I can bear it!"
     </p>
    <p>
      And then a breakdown worse than the night before. What genius, what sheer
      genius Nature had for torturing her creatures! If anyone had told him,
      even so little as a week ago, that he could have caused such suffering to
      Sylvia -- Sylvia, whom as a child with wide blue eyes and a blue bow on
      her flaxen head he had guarded across fields full of imaginary bulls;
      Sylvia, in whose hair his star had caught; Sylvia, who day and night for
      fifteen years had been his devoted wife; whom he loved and still admired -- he
      would have given him the lie direct. It would have seemed incredible,
      monstrous, silly. Had all married men and women such things to go through -- was
      this but a very usual crossing of the desert? Or was it, once for all,
      shipwreck? death -- unholy, violent death -- in a storm of sand?
    </p>
    <p>
      Another night of misery, and no answer to that question yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had told her that he would not see Nell again without first letting her
      know. So, when morning came, he simply wrote the words: "Don't come
      today!" -- showed them to Sylvia, and sent them by a servant to
      Dromore's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hard to describe the bitterness with which he entered his studio that
      morning. In all this chaos, what of his work? Could he ever have peace of
      mind for it again? Those people last night had talked of 'inspiration of
      passion, of experience.' In pleading with her he had used the words
      himself. She -- poor soul! -- had but repeated them, trying to
      endure them, to believe them true. And were they true? Again no answer, or
      certainly none that he could give. To have had the waters broken up; to be
      plunged into emotion; to feel desperately, instead of stagnating -- some
      day he might be grateful -- who knew? Some day there might be fair
      country again beyond this desert, where he could work even better than
      before. But just now, as well expect creative work from a condemned man.
      It seemed to him that he was equally destroyed whether he gave Nell up,
      and with her, once for all, that roving, seeking instinct, which ought,
      forsooth, to have been satisfied, and was not; or whether he took Nell,
      knowing that in doing so he was torturing a woman dear to him! That was as
      far as he could see to-day. What he would come to see in time God only
      knew! But: 'Freedom of the Spirit!' That was a phrase of bitter irony
      indeed! And, there, with his work all round him, like a man tied hand and
      foot, he was swept by such a feeling of exasperated rage as he had never
      known. Women! These women! Only let him be free of both, of all women, and
      the passions and pities they aroused, so that his brain and his hands
      might live and work again! They should not strangle, they should not
      destroy him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, even in his rage, he knew that flight from them both could
      never help him. One way or the other the thing would have to be fought
      through. If it had been a straight fight even; a clear issue between
      passion and pity! But both he loved, and both he pitied. There was nothing
      straight and clear about it anywhere; it was all too deeply rooted in full
      human nature. And the appalling sense of rushing ceaselessly from barrier
      to barrier began really to affect his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, he had now and then a lucid interval of a few minutes, when the
      ingenious nature of his own torments struck him as supremely interesting
      and queer; but this was not precisely a relief, for it only meant, as in
      prolonged toothache, that his power of feeling had for a moment ceased. A
      very pretty little hell indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      All day he had the premonition, amounting to certainty, that Nell would
      take alarm at those three words he had sent her, and come in spite of
      them. And yet, what else could he have written? Nothing save what must
      have alarmed her more, or plunged him deeper. He had the feeling that she
      could follow his moods, that her eyes could see him everywhere, as a cat's
      eyes can see in darkness. That feeling had been with him, more or less,
      ever since the last evening of October, the evening she came back from her
      summer -- grown-up. How long ago? Only six days -- was it possible?
      Ah, yes! She knew when her spell was weakening, when the current wanted,
      as it were, renewing. And about six o'clock -- dusk already -- without
      the least surprise, with only a sort of empty quivering, he heard her
      knock. And just behind the closed door, as near as he could get to her, he
      stood, holding his breath. He had given his word to Sylvia -- of his
      own accord had given it. Through the thin wood of the old door he could
      hear the faint shuffle of her feet on the pavement, moved a few inches
      this way and that, as though supplicating the inexorable silence. He
      seemed to see her head, bent a little forward listening. Three times she
      knocked, and each time Lennan writhed. It was so cruel! With that
      seeing-sense of hers she must know he was there; his very silence would be
      telling her -- for his silence had its voice, its pitiful breathless
      sound. Then, quite distinctly, he heard her sigh, and her footsteps move
      away; and covering his face with his hands he rushed to and fro in the
      studio, like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sound of her any more! Gone! It was unbearable; and, seizing his hat,
      he ran out. Which way? At random he ran towards the Square. There she was,
      over by the railings; languidly, irresolutely moving towards home.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIV
    </p>
    <p>
      But now that she was within reach, he wavered; he had given his word -- was
      he going to break it? Then she turned, and saw him; and he could not go
      back. In the biting easterly wind her face looked small, and pinched, and
      cold, but her eyes only the larger, the more full of witchery, as if
      beseeching him not to be angry, not to send her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had to come; I got frightened. Why did you write such a tiny little
      note?"
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to make his voice sound quiet and ordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be brave, Nell. I have had to tell her."
     </p>
    <p>
      She clutched at his arm; then drew herself up, and said in her clear,
      clipped voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I suppose she hates me, then!"
     </p>
    <p>
      "She is terribly unhappy."
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked a minute, that might have been an hour, without a word; not
      round the Square, as he had walked with Oliver, but away from the house.
      At last she said in a half-choked voice: "I only want a little bit of
      you."
     </p>
    <p>
      And he answered dully: "In love, there are no little bits -- no
      standing still."
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly, he felt her hand in his, the fingers lacing, twining
      restlessly amongst his own; and again the half-choked voice said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you WILL let me see you sometimes! You must!"
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardest of all to stand against was this pathetic, clinging, frightened
      child. And, not knowing very clearly what he said, he murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes -- yes; it'll be all right. Be brave -- you must be brave,
      Nell. It'll all come right."
     </p>
    <p>
      But she only answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! I'm not brave. I shall do something."
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face looked just as when she had ridden at that gravel pit. Loving,
      wild, undisciplined, without resource of any kind -- what might she not
      do? Why could he not stir without bringing disaster upon one or other? And
      between these two, suffering so because of him, he felt as if he had lost
      his own existence. In quest of happiness, he had come to that!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oliver asked me again at the dance on Saturday. He said you had told him
      to be patient. Did you?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
     </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
     </p>
    <p>
      "I was sorry for him."
     </p>
    <p>
      She let his hand go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you would like me to marry him."
     </p>
    <p>
      Very clearly he saw those two going round and round over the shining
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be better, Nell."
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a little sound -- of anger or dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't REALLY want me, then?"
     </p>
    <p>
      That was his chance. But with her arm touching his, her face so pale and
      desperate, and those maddening eyes turned to him, he could not tell that
      lie, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes -- I want you, God knows!"
     </p>
    <p>
      At that a sigh of content escaped her, as if she were saying to herself:
      'If he wants me he will not let me go.' Strange little tribute to her
      faith in love and her own youth!
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come somehow to Pall Mall by now. And scared to find himself so
      deep in the hunting-ground of the Dromores, Lennan turned hastily towards
      St. James's Park, that they might cross it in the dark, round to
      Piccadilly. To be thus slinking out of the world's sight with the daughter
      of his old room-mate -- of all men in the world the last perhaps that
      he should do this to! A nice treacherous business! But the thing men
      called honour -- what was it, when her eyes were looking at him and her
      shoulder touching his?
    </p>
    <p>
      Since he had spoken those words, "Yes, I want you," she had been silent -- fearful
      perhaps to let other words destroy their comfort. But near the gate by
      Hyde Park Corner she put her hand again into his, and again her voice, so
      clear, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to hurt anybody, but you WILL let me come sometimes -- you
      will let me see you -- you won't leave me all alone, thinking that I'll
      never see you again?"
     </p>
    <p>
      And once more, without knowing what he answered, Lennan murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! It'll be all right, dear -- it'll all come right. It must -- and
      shall."
     </p>
    <p>
      Again her fingers twined amongst his, like a child's. She seemed to have a
      wonderful knowledge of the exact thing to say and do to keep him helpless.
      And she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't try to love you -- it isn't wrong to love -- it wouldn't
      hurt her. I only want a little of your love."
     </p>
    <p>
      A little -- always a little! But he was solely bent on comforting her
      now. To think of her going home, and sitting lonely, frightened, and
      unhappy, all the evening, was dreadful. And holding her fingers tight, he
      kept on murmuring words of would-be comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw that they were out in Piccadilly. How far dared he go with her
      along the railings before he said good-bye? A man was coming towards them,
      just where he had met Dromore that first fatal afternoon nine months ago;
      a man with a slight lurch in his walk and a tall, shining hat a little on
      one side. But thank Heaven! -- it was not Dromore -- only one
      somewhat like him, who in passing stared sphinx-like at Nell. And Lennan
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must go home now, child; we mustn't be seen together."
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he thought she was going to break down, refuse to leave him.
      Then she threw up her head, and for a second stood like that, quite
      motionless, looking in his face. Suddenly stripping off her glove, she
      thrust her warm, clinging hand into his. Her lips smiled faintly, tears
      stood in her eyes; then she drew her hand away and plunged into the
      traffic. He saw her turn the corner of her street and disappear. And with
      the warmth of that passionate little hand still stinging his palm, he
      almost ran towards Hyde Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking no heed of direction, he launched himself into its dark space,
      deserted in this cold, homeless wind, that had little sound and no scent,
      travelling its remorseless road under the grey-black sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark firmament and keen cold air suited one who had little need of
      aids to emotion -- one who had, indeed, but the single wish to get rid,
      if he only could, of the terrible sensation in his head, that bruised,
      battered, imprisoned feeling of a man who paces his cell -- never,
      never to get out at either end. Without thought or intention he drove his
      legs along; not running, because he knew that he would have to stop the
      sooner. Alas! what more comic spectacle for the eyes of a good citizen
      than this married man of middle age, striding for hours over those dry,
      dark, empty pastures -- hunted by passion and by pity, so that he knew
      not even whether he had dined! But no good citizen was abroad of an autumn
      night in a bitter easterly wind. The trees were the sole witnesses of this
      grim exercise -- the trees, resigning to the cold blast their crinkled
      leaves that fluttered past him, just a little lighter than the darkness.
      Here and there his feet rustled in the drifts, waiting their turn to serve
      the little bonfires, whose scent still clung in the air. A desperate walk,
      in this heart of London -- round and round, up and down, hour after
      hour, keeping always in the dark; not a star in the sky, not a human being
      spoken to or even clearly seen, not a bird or beast; just the gleam of the
      lights far away, and the hoarse muttering of the traffic! A walk as lonely
      as the voyage of the human soul is lonely from birth to death with nothing
      to guide it but the flickering glow from its own frail spirit lighted it
      knows not where....
    </p>
    <p>
      And, so tired that he could hardly move his legs, but free at last of that
      awful feeling in his head -- free for the first time for days and days -- Lennan
      came out of the Park at the gate where he had gone in, and walked towards
      his home, certain that tonight, one way or the other, it would be
      decided....
    </p>
    <p>
      XV
    </p>
    <p>
      This then -- this long trouble of body and of spirit -- was what he
      remembered, sitting in the armchair beyond his bedroom fire, watching the
      glow, and Sylvia sleeping there exhausted, while the dark plane-tree
      leaves tap-tapped at the window in the autumn wind; watching, with the
      uncanny certainty that, he would not pass the limits of this night without
      having made at last a decision that would not alter. For even conflict
      wears itself out; even indecision has this measure set to its miserable
      powers of torture, that any issue in the end is better than the hell of
      indecision itself. Once or twice in those last days even death had seemed
      to him quite tolerable; but now that his head was clear and he had come to
      grips, death passed out of his mind like the shadow that it was. Nothing
      so simple, extravagant, and vain could serve him. Other issues had
      reality; death -- none. To leave Sylvia, and take this young love away;
      there was reality in that, but it had always faded as soon as it shaped
      itself; and now once more it faded. To put such a public and terrible
      affront on a tender wife whom he loved, do her to death, as it were,
      before the world's eyes -- and then, ever remorseful, grow old while
      the girl was still young? He could not. If Sylvia had not loved him, yes;
      or, even if he had not loved her; or if, again, though loving him she had
      stood upon her rights -- in any of those events he might have done it.
      But to leave her whom he did love, and who had said to him so generously:
      "I will not hamper you -- go to her" -- would be a black atrocity.
      Every memory, from their boy-and-girl lovering to the desperate clinging
      of her arms these last two nights -- memory with its innumerable
      tentacles, the invincible strength of its countless threads, bound him to
      her too fast. What then? Must it come, after all, to giving up the girl?
      And sitting there, by that warm fire, he shivered. How desolate,
      sacrilegious, wasteful to throw love away; to turn from the most precious
      of all gifts; to drop and break that vase! There was not too much love in
      the world, nor too much warmth and beauty -- not, anyway, for those
      whose sands were running out, whose blood would soon be cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could Sylvia not let him keep both her love and the girl's? Could she not
      bear that? She had said she could; but her face, her eyes, her voice gave
      her the lie, so that every time he heard her his heart turned sick with
      pity. This, then, was the real issue. Could he accept from her such a
      sacrifice, exact a daily misery, see her droop and fade beneath it? Could
      he bear his own happiness at such a cost? Would it be happiness at all? He
      got up from the chair and crept towards her. She looked very fragile
      sleeping there! The darkness below her closed eyelids showed cruelly on
      that too fair skin; and in her flax-coloured hair he saw what he had never
      noticed -- a few strands of white. Her softly opened lips, almost
      colourless, quivered with her uneven breathing; and now and again a little
      feverish shiver passed up as from her heart. All soft and fragile! Not
      much life, not much strength; youth and beauty slipping! To know that he
      who should be her champion against age and time would day by day be
      placing one more mark upon her face, one more sorrow in her heart! That he
      should do this -- they both going down the years together!
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stood there holding his breath, bending to look at her, that
      slurring swish of the plane-tree branch, flung against and against the
      window by the autumn wind, seemed filling the whole world. Then her lips
      moved in one of those little, soft hurrying whispers that unhappy dreamers
      utter, the words all blurred with their wistful rushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he thought: I, who believe in bravery and kindness; I, who hate
      cruelty -- if I do this cruel thing, what shall I have to live for; how
      shall I work; how bear myself? If I do it, I am lost -- an outcast from
      my own faith -- a renegade from all that I believe in.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, kneeling there close to that face so sad and lonely, that heart so
      beaten even in its sleep, he knew that he could not do it -- knew it
      with sudden certainty, and a curious sense of peace. Over! -- the long
      struggle -- over at last! Youth with youth, summer to summer, falling
      leaf with falling leaf! And behind him the fire flickered, and the
      plane-tree leaves tap-tapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and crept away stealthily downstairs into the drawing-room, and
      through the window at the far end out into the courtyard, where he had sat
      that day by the hydrangea, listening to the piano-organ. Very dark and
      cold and eerie it was there, and he hurried across to his studio. There,
      too, it was cold, and dark, and eerie, with its ghostly plaster presences,
      stale scent of cigarettes, and just one glowing ember of the fire he had
      left when he rushed out after Nell -- those seven hours ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went first to the bureau, turned up its lamp, and taking out some
      sheets of paper, marked on them directions for his various works; for the
      statuette of Nell, he noted that it should be taken with his compliments
      to Mr. Dromore. He wrote a letter to his banker directing money to be sent
      to Rome, and to his solicitor telling him to let the house. He wrote
      quickly. If Sylvia woke, and found him still away, what might she not
      think? He took a last sheet. Did it matter what he wrote, what deliberate
      lie, if it helped Nell over the first shock?
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR NELL,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I write this hastily in the early hours, to say that we are called out to
      Italy to my only sister, who is very ill. We leave by the first morning
      boat, and may be away some time. I will write again. Don't fret, and God
      bless you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. L."
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not see very well as he wrote. Poor, loving, desperate child!
      Well, she had youth and strength, and would soon have -- Oliver! And he
      took yet another sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "DEAR OLIVER,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife and I are obliged to go post-haste to Italy. I watched you both
      at the dance the other night. Be very gentle with Nell; and -- good
      luck to you! But don't say again that I told you to be patient; it is
      hardly the way to make her love you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. LENNAN."
     </p>
    <p>
      That, then, was all -- yes, all! He turned out the little lamp, and
      groped towards the hearth. But one thing left. To say good-bye! To her,
      and Youth, and Passion! -- to the only salve for the aching that Spring
      and Beauty bring -- the aching for the wild, the passionate, the new,
      that never quite dies in a man's heart. Ah! well, sooner or later, all men
      had to say good-bye to that. All men -- all men!
    </p>
    <p>
      He crouched down before the hearth. There was no warmth in that
      fast-blackening ember, but it still glowed like a dark-red flower. And
      while it lived he crouched there, as though it were that to which he was
      saying good-bye. And on the door he heard the girl's ghostly knocking. And
      beside him -- a ghost among the ghostly presences -- she stood.
      Slowly the glow blackened, till the last spark had faded out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then by the glimmer of the night he found his way back, softly as he had
      come, to his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sylvia was still sleeping; and, to watch for her to wake, he sat down
      again by the fire, in silence only stirred by the frail tap-tapping of
      those autumn leaves, and the little catch in her breathing now and then.
      It was less troubled than when he had bent over her before, as though in
      her sleep she knew. He must not miss the moment of her waking, must be
      beside her before she came to full consciousness, to say: "There, there!
      It's all over; we are going away at once -- at once." To be ready to
      offer that quick solace, before she had time to plunge back into her
      sorrow, was an island in this black sea of night, a single little refuge
      point for his bereaved and naked being. Something to do -- something
      fixed, real, certain. And yet another long hour before her waking, he sat
      forward in the chair, with that wistful eagerness, his eyes fixed on her
      face, staring through it at some vision, some faint, glimmering light -- far
      out there beyond -- as a traveller watches a star....

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
