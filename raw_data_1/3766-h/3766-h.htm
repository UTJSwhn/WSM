   &ldquo;We have been compelled to see what was weak in democracy as well as
   what was strong. We have begun obscurely to recognize that things
   do not go of themselves, and that popular government is not in
   itself a panacea, is no better than any other form except as the
   virtue and wisdom of the people make it so, and that when men
   undertake to do their own kingship, they enter upon, the dangers and
   responsibilities as well as the privileges of the function. Above
   all, it looks as if we were on the way to be persuaded that no
   government can be carried on by declamation.&rdquo;

                 &mdash;JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      First I am to write a love-story of long ago, of a time some little while
      after General Jackson had got into the White House and had shown the world
      what a real democracy was. The Era of the first six Presidents had closed,
      and a new Era had begun. I am speaking of political Eras. Certain
      gentlemen, with a pious belief in democracy, but with a firmer
      determination to get on top, arose,&mdash;and got in top. So many of these
      gentlemen arose in the different states, and they were so clever, and they
      found so many chinks in the Constitution to crawl through and steal the
      people's chestnuts, that the Era may be called the Boss-Era. After the
      Boss came along certain Things without souls, but of many minds, and found
      more chinks in the Constitution: bigger chinks, for the Things were
      bigger, and they stole more chestnuts. But I am getting far ahead of my
      love-story&mdash;and of my book.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader is warned that this first love-story will, in a few chapters,
      come to an end: and not to a happy end&mdash;otherwise there would be no
      book. Lest he should throw the book away when he arrives at this page, it
      is only fair to tell him that there is another and a much longer love
      story later on, if he will only continue to read, in which, it is hoped,
      he may not be disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hills seem to leap up against the sky as I describe that region where
      Cynthia Ware was born, and the very old country names help to summon up
      the picture. Coniston Mountain, called by some the Blue Mountain, clad in
      Hercynian forests, ten good miles in length, north and south, with its
      notch road that winds over the saddle behind the withers of it. Coniston
      Water, that oozes out from under the loam in a hundred places, on the
      eastern slope, gathers into a rushing stream to cleave the very granite,
      flows southward around the south end of Coniston Mountain, and having
      turned the mills at Brampton, idles through meadows westward in its own
      green valley until it comes to Harwich, where it works again and tumbles
      into a river. Brampton and Harwich are rivals, but Coniston Water gives of
      its power impartially to each. From the little farm clearings on the
      western slope of Coniston Mountain you can sweep the broad valley of a
      certain broad river where grew (and grow still) the giant pines that gave
      many a mast to King George's navy as tribute for the land. And beyond that
      river rises beautiful Farewell Mountain of many colors, now sapphire, now
      amethyst, its crest rimmed about at evening with saffron flame; and,
      beyond Farewell, the emerald billows of the western peaks catching the
      level light. A dozen little brooks are born high among the western spruces
      on Coniston to score deep, cool valleys in their way through Clovelly
      township to the broad music of the water and fresh river-valleys full of
      the music of the water and fresh with the odor of the ferns.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this day the railroad has not reached Coniston Village&mdash;nay, nor
      Coniston Flat, four miles nearer Brampton. The village lies on its own
      little shelf under the forest-clad slope of the mountain, and in the midst
      of its dozen houses is the green triangle where the militia used to drill
      on June days. At one end of the triangle is the great pine mast that
      graced no frigate of George's, but flew the stars and stripes on many a
      liberty day. Across the road is Jonah Winch's store, with a platform so
      high that a man may step off his horse directly on to it; with its
      checker-paned windows, with its dark interior smelling of coffee and
      apples and molasses, yes, and of Endea rum&mdash;for this was before the
      days of the revivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      How those checker-paned windows bring back the picture of that village
      green! The meeting-house has them, lantern-like, wide and high, in three
      sashes&mdash;white meeting-house, seat alike of government and religion,
      with its terraced steeple, with its classic porches north and south.
      Behind it is the long shed, and in front, rising out of the milkweed and
      the flowering thistle, the horse block of the first meeting-house, where
      many a pillion has left its burden in times bygone. Honest Jock Hallowell
      built that second meeting-house&mdash;was, indeed, still building it at
      the time of which we write. He had hewn every beam and king post in it,
      and set every plate and slip. And Jock Hallowell is the man who,
      unwittingly starts this chronicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, on one of those madcap April days of that Coniston country, Jock
      descended from his work on the steeple to perceive the ungainly figure of
      Jethro Bass coming toward him across the green. Jethro was about thirty
      years of age, and he wore a coonskin cap even in those days, and trousers
      tacked into his boots. He carried his big head bent forward, a little to
      one aide, and was not, at first sight, a prepossessing-looking person. As
      our story largely concerns him and we must get started somehow, it may as
      well be to fix a little attention on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigho!&rdquo; said Jock, rubbing his hands on his leather apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how be you, Jock?&rdquo; said Jethro, stopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heigho!&rdquo; cried Jock, &ldquo;what's this game of fox and geese you're a-playin'
      among the farmers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-callate to git the steeple done before frost?&rdquo; inquired Jethro, without
      so much as a smile. &ldquo;B-build it tight, Jock&mdash;b-build it tight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess he'll build his'n tight, whatever it is,&rdquo; said Jock, looking after
      him as Jethro made his way to the little tannery near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it be known that there was such a thing as social rank in Coniston;
      and something which, for the sake of an advantageous parallel, we may call
      an Established Church. Coniston was a Congregational town still, and the
      deacons and dignitaries of that church were likewise the pillars of the
      state. Not many years before the time of which we write actual
      disestablishment had occurred, when the town ceased&mdash;as a town&mdash;to
      pay the salary of Priest Ware, as the minister was called. The father of
      Jethro Bass, Nathan the currier, had once, in a youthful lapse, permitted
      a Baptist preacher to immerse him in Coniston Water. This had been the
      extent of Nathan's religion; Jethro had none at all, and was, for this and
      other reasons, somewhere near the bottom of the social scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fox and geese!&rdquo; repeated Jock, with his eyes still on Jethro's retreating
      back. The builder of the meetinghouse rubbed a great, brown arm, scratched
      his head, and turned and came face to face with Cynthia Ware, in a poke
      bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrast is a favorite trick of authors, and no greater contrast is to be
      had in Coniston than that between Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass. In the
      first place; Cynthia was the minister's daughter, and twenty-one. I can
      summon her now under the great maples of the village street, a virginal
      figure, gray eyes that kindled the face shaded by the poke bonnet, and up
      you went above the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about fox and geese, Jock?&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass,&rdquo; said Jock, who, by reason of his ability, was a privileged
      character. &ldquo;Mark my words, Cynthy, Jethro Bass is an all-fired sight
      smarter that folks in this town think he be. They don't take notice of
      him, because he don't say much, and stutters. He hain't be'n eddicated a
      great deal, but I wouldn't be afeard to warrant he'd make a racket in the
      world some of these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jock Hallowell!&rdquo; cried Cynthia, the gray beginning to dance, &ldquo;I suppose
      you think Jethro's going to be President.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jock, &ldquo;you can laugh. Ever talked with Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've hardly spoken two words to him in my life,&rdquo; she replied. And it was
      true, although the little white parsonage was scarce two hundred yards
      from the tannery house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro's never ailed much,&rdquo; Jock remarked, having reference to Cynthia's
      proclivities for visiting the sick. &ldquo;I've seed a good many different men
      in my time, and I tell you, Cynthia Ware, that Jethro's got a kind of
      power you don't often come acrost. Folks don't suspicion it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself, Cynthia was impressed by the ring of sincerity in the
      builder's voice. Now that she thought of it, there was rugged power in
      Jethro's face, especially when he took off the coonskin cap. She always
      nodded a greeting when she saw him in the tannery yard or on the road, and
      sometimes he nodded back, but oftener he had not appeared to see her. She
      had thought this failure to nod stupidity, but it might after all be
      abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think he has ability?&rdquo; she asked, picking flowers from a
      bunch of arbutus she held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's rich, for one thing,&rdquo; said Jock. He had not intended a dissertation
      on Jethro Bass, but he felt bound to defend his statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, he hain't poor. He's got as many as thirty mortgages round among the
      farmers&mdash;some on land, and some on cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he make the money?&rdquo; demanded Cynthia, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hides an' wool an' bark&mdash;turned 'em over an' swep' in. Gits a load,
      and Lyman Hull drives him down to Boston with that six-hoss team. Lyman
      gits drunk, Jethro keeps sober and saves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jock began to fashion some wooden pegs with his adze, for nails were
      scarce in those days. Still Cynthia lingered, picking flowers from the
      bunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you mean by 'fox and geese' Jock?&rdquo; she said presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jock laughed. He did not belong to the Establishment, but was a
      Universalist; politically he admired General Jackson. &ldquo;What'd you say if
      Jethro was Chairman of the next Board of Selectmen?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder Cynthia gasped. Jethro Bass, Chairman of the Board, in the
      honored seat of Deacon Moses Hatch, the perquisite of the church in
      Coniston! The idea was heresy. As a matter of fact, Jock himself uttered
      it as a playful exaggeration. Certain nonconformist farmers, of whom there
      were not a few in the town, had come into Jonah Winch's store that
      morning; and Jabez Miller, who lived on the north slope, had taken away
      the breath of the orthodox by suggesting that Jethro Bass be nominated for
      town office. Jock Hallowell had paused once or twice on his work on the
      steeple to look across the tree-tops at Coniston shouldering the sky. He
      had been putting two and two together, and now he was merely making five
      out of it, instead of four. He remembered that Jethro Bass had for some
      years been journeying through the town, baying his hides and wool, and
      collecting the interest on his mortgages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia would have liked to reprove Jock Hallowell, and tell him there
      were some subjects which should not be joked about. Jethro Bass, Chairman
      of the Board of Selectmen!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here comes, young Moses, I do believe,&rdquo; said Jock, gathering his
      pegs into his apron and preparing to ascend once more. &ldquo;Callated he'd
      spring up pretty soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jock, you do talk foolishly for a man who is able to build a church,&rdquo;
       said Cynthia, as she walked away. The young Moses referred to was Moses
      Hatch, Junior, son of the pillar of the Church and State, and it was an
      open secret that he was madly in love with Cynthia. Let it be said of him
      that he was a steady-going young man, and that he sighed for the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moses,&rdquo; said the girl, when they came in sight of the elms that, shaded
      the gable of the parsonage, &ldquo;what do you think of Jethro Bass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass!&rdquo; exclaimed honest Moses, &ldquo;whatever put him into your head,
      Cynthy?&rdquo; Had she mentioned perhaps, any other young man in Coniston, Moses
      would have been eaten with jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jock was joking about him. What do you think of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never thought one way or t'other,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Jethro never had much to
      do with the boys. He's always in that tannery, or out buyin' of hides. He
      does make a sharp bargain when he buys a hide. We always goes shares on
      our'n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was not only the minister's daughter,&mdash;distinction enough,&mdash;her
      reputation for learning was spread through the country roundabout, and at
      the age of twenty she had had an offer to teach school in Harwich. Once a
      week in summer she went to Brampton, to the Social library there, and sat
      at the feet of that Miss Lucretia Penniman of whom Brampton has ever been
      so proud&mdash;Lucretia Penniman, one of the first to sound the clarion
      note for the intellectual independence of American women; who wrote the
      &ldquo;Hymn to Coniston&rdquo;; who, to the awe of her townspeople, went out into the
      great world and became editress of a famous woman's journal, and knew
      Longfellow and Hawthorne and Bryant. Miss Lucretia it was who started the
      Brampton Social Library, and filled it with such books as both sexes might
      read with profit. Never was there a stricter index than hers. Cynthia,
      Miss Lucretia loved, and the training of that mind was the pleasantest
      task of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity as a factor has never, perhaps, been given its proper weight by
      philosophers. Besides being fatal to a certain domestic animal, as an
      instigating force it has brought joy and sorrow into the lives of men and
      women, and made and marred careers. And curiosity now laid hold of Cynthia
      Ware. Why in the world she should ever have been curious about Jethro Bass
      is a mystery to many, for the two of them were as far apart as the poles.
      Cynthia, of all people, took to watching the tanner's son, and listening
      to the brief colloquies he had with other men at Jonah Winch's store, when
      she went there to buy things for the parsonage; and it seemed to her that
      Jock had not been altogether wrong, and that there was in the man an
      indefinable but very compelling force. And when a woman begins to admit
      that a man has force, her curiosity usually increases. On one or two of
      these occasions Cynthia had been startled to find his eyes fixed upon her,
      and though the feeling she had was closely akin to fear, she found
      something distinctly pleasurable in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      May came, and the pools dried up, the orchards were pink and white, the
      birches and the maples were all yellow-green on the mountain sides against
      the dark pines, and Cynthia was driving the minister's gig to Brampton.
      Ahead of her, in the canon made by the road between the great woods,
      strode an uncouth but powerful figure&mdash;coonskin cap, homespun
      breeches tucked into boots, and all. The gig slowed down, and Cynthia
      began to tremble with that same delightful fear. She knew it must be
      wicked, because she liked it so much. Unaccountable thing! She felt all
      akin to the nature about her, and her blood was coursing as the sap rushes
      through a tree. She would not speak to him; of that she was sure, and
      equally sure that he would not speak to her. The horse was walking now,
      and suddenly Jethro Bass faced around, and her heart stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how be you, Cynthy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thrush in the woods began to sing a hymn, and they listened. After that
      a silence, save for the notes of answering birds quickened by the song,
      the minister's horse nibbling at the bushes. Cynthia herself could not
      have explained why she lingered. Suddenly he shot a question at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where be you goin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Brampton, to get Miss Lucretia to change this book,&rdquo; and she held it
      up from her lap. It was a very large book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wh-what's it about,&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Napoleon Bonaparte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a very strong man. He began life poor and unknown, and fought his
      way upward until he conquered the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-conquered the world, did you say? Conquered the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess there's somethin' wrong about that book&mdash;somethin' wrong.
      Conquer the United States?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia smiled. She herself did not realize that we were not a part of the
      world, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He conquered Europe; where all the kings and queens are, and became a
      king himself&mdash;an emperor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to-know!&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;You said he was a poor boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you read the book, Jethro?&rdquo; Cynthia answered. &ldquo;I am sure I can
      get Miss Lucretia to let you have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know as I'd understand it,&rdquo; he demurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll try to explain what you don't understand,&rdquo; said Cynthia, and her
      heart gave a bound at the very idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will You?&rdquo; he said, looking at her eagerly. &ldquo;Will you? You mean it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she answered, and blushed, not knowing why. &ldquo;I-I must be
      going,&rdquo; and she gathered up the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will you give it to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stop at the tannery when I come back from Brampton,&rdquo; she said, and
      drove on. Once she gave a fleeting glance over her shoulder, and he was
      still standing where she had left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she returned, in the yellow afternoon light that flowed over wood and
      pasture, he came out of the tannery door. Jake Wheeler or Speedy Bates,
      the journeyman tailoress, from whom little escaped, could not have said it
      was by design&mdash;thought nothing, indeed, of that part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I live!&rdquo; cried Speedy from the window to Aunt Lucy Prescott in the
      bed, &ldquo;if Cynthy ain't givin' him a book as big as the Bible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Lucy hoped, first, that it was the Bible, and second, that Jethro
      would read it. Aunt Lucy, and Established Church Coniston in general,
      believed in snatching brands from the burning, and who so deft as Cynthia
      at this kind of snatching! So Cynthia herself was a hypocrite for once,
      and did not know it. At that time Jethro's sins were mostly of omission.
      As far as rum was concerned, he was a creature after Aunt Lucy's own
      heart, for he never touched it: true, gaunt Deacon Ira Perkins,
      tithing-man, had once chided him for breaking the Sabbath&mdash;shooting
      at a fox.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to the book. As long as he lived, Jethro looked back to the joy
      of the monumental task of mastering its contents. In his mind, Napoleon
      became a rough Yankee general; of the cities, villages, and fortress he
      formed as accurate a picture as a resident of Venice from Marco Polo's
      account of Tartary. Jethro had learned to read, after a fashion, to write,
      add, multiply, and divide. He knew that George Washington and certain
      barefooted companions had forced a proud Britain to her knees, and much of
      the warring in the book took color from Captain Timothy Prescott's stories
      of General Stark and his campaigns, heard at Jonah Winch's store. What
      Paris looked like, or Berlin, or the Hospice of St. Bernard&mdash;though
      imaged by a winter Coniston&mdash;troubled Jethro not at all; the thing
      that stuck in his mind was that Napoleon&mdash;for a considerable time, at
      least&mdash;compelled men to do his bidding. Constitutions crumble before
      the Strong. Not that Jethro philosophized about constitutions. Existing
      conditions presented themselves, and it occurred to him that there were
      crevices in the town system, and ways into power through the crevices for
      men clever enough to find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later, and in these same great woods on the way to Brampton,
      Cynthia overtook him once more. It was characteristic of him that he
      plunged at once into the subject uppermost in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a very big place, this Corsica&mdash;not a very big place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little island in the Mediterranean,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum. Country folks, the Bonapartes&mdash;country folks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you might call them so,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They were poor, and lived
      out of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was a smart man. But he found things goin' his way. Didn't have to
      move 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at first;&rdquo; she admitted; &ldquo;but he had to move mountains later. How far
      have you read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing that helped him,&rdquo; said Jethro, in indirect answer to this
      question, &ldquo;he got a smart woman for his wife&mdash;a smart woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia looked down at the reins in her lap, and she felt again that
      wicked stirring within her,&mdash;incredible stirring of minister's
      daughter for tanner's son. Coniston believes, and always will believe,
      that the social bars are strong enough. So Cynthia looked down at the
      reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Josephine!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I always wish he had not cast her off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-cast her off?&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;Cast her off! Why did he do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a while, when he got to be Emperor, he needed a wife who would be
      more useful to him. Josephine had become a drag. He cared more about
      getting on in the world than he did about his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro looked away contemplatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa-wahn't the woman to blame any?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read the book, and you'll see,&rdquo; retorted Cynthia, flicking her horse,
      which started at all gaits down the road. Jethro stood in his tracks,
      staring, but this time he did not see her face above the hood of the gig.
      Presently he trudged on, head downward, pondering upon another problem
      than Napoleon's. Cynthia, at length, arrived in Brampton Street, in a
      humor that puzzled the good Miss Lucretia sorely.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sun had dropped behind the mountain, leaving Coniston in amethystine
      shadow, and the last bee had flown homeward from the apple blossoms in
      front of Aunt Lucy Prescott's window, before Cynthia returned. Aunt Lucy
      was Cynthia's grandmother, and eighty-nine years of age. Still she sat in
      her window beside the lilac bush, lost in memories of a stout, rosy lass
      who had followed a stalwart husband up a broad river into the wilderness
      some seventy years agone in Indian days&mdash;Weathersfield Massacre days.
      That lass was Aunt Lucy herself, and in just such a May had Timothy's axe
      rung through the Coniston forest and reared the log cabin, where six of
      her children were born. Likewise in review passed the lonely months when
      Timothy was fighting behind his rugged General Stark for that privilege
      more desirable to his kind than life&mdash;self government. Timothy
      Prescott would pull the forelock to no man, would have such God-fearing
      persons as he chose make his laws for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honest Captain Timothy and his Stark heroes, Aunt Lucy and her memories,
      have long gone to rest. Little did they dream of the nation we have lived
      to see, straining at her constitution like a great ship at anchor in a
      gale, with funnels belching forth smoke, and a new race of men thronging
      her decks for the mastery. Coniston is there still behind its mountain,
      with its rusty firelocks and its hillside graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, driving back from Brampton in the gig, smiled at Aunt Lucy in the
      window, but she did not so much as glance at the tannery house farther on.
      The tannery house, be it known, was the cottage where Jethro dwelt, and
      which had belonged to Nathan, his father; and the tannery sheds were at
      some distance behind it, nearer Coniston Water. Cynthia did not glance at
      the tannery house, for a wave of orthodox indignation had swept over her:
      at any rate, we may call it so. In other words, she was angry with
      herself: pitied and scorned herself, if the truth be told, for her actions&mdash;an
      inevitable mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the minister's barn under the elms on the hill Cynthia pulled
      the harness from the tired horse with an energy that betokened activity of
      mind. She was not one who shrank from self-knowledge, and the question put
      itself to her, &ldquo;Whither was this matter tending?&rdquo; The fire that is in
      strong men has ever been a lure to women; and many, meaning to play with
      it, have been burnt thereby since the world began. But to turn the fire to
      some use, to make the world better for it or stranger for it, that were an
      achievement indeed! The horse munching his hay, Cynthia lingered as the
      light fainted above the ridge, with the thought that this might be woman's
      province, and Miss Lucretia Penniman might go on leading her women
      regiments to no avail. Nevertheless she was angry with Jethro, not because
      of what he had said, but because of what he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day is Sunday, and there is mild excitement in Coniston. For
      Jethro Bass, still with the coonskin cap, but in a brass-buttoned coat
      secretly purchased in Brampton, appeared at meeting! It made no difference
      that he entered quietly, and sat in the rear slip, orthodox Coniston knew
      that he was behind them: good Mr. Ware knew it, and changed a little his
      prayers and sermon: Cynthia knew it, grew hot and cold by turns under her
      poke bonnet. Was he not her brand, and would she not get the credit of
      snatching him? How willingly, then, would she have given up that credit to
      the many who coveted it&mdash;if it were a credit. Was Jethro at meeting
      for any religious purpose?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro's importance to Coniston lay in his soul, and that soul was
      numbered at present ninety and ninth. When the meeting was over, Aunt Lucy
      Prescott hobbled out at an amazing pace to advise him to read chapter
      seven of Matthew, but he had vanished: via the horse sheds; if she had
      known it, and along Coniston Water to the house by the tannery, where he
      drew breath in a state of mind not to be depicted. He had gazed at the
      back of Cynthia's poke bonnet for two hours, but he had an uneasy feeling
      that he would have to pay a price.
    </p>
    <p>
      The price was paid, in part, during the next six days. To do Jethro's
      importance absolute justice, he did inspire fear among his contemporaries,
      and young men and women did not say much to his face; what they did say
      gave them little satisfaction. Grim Deacon Ira stopped him as he was going
      to buy hides, and would have prayed over him if Jethro had waited; dear
      Aunt Lucy did pray, but in private. In six days orthodox Coniston came to
      the conclusion that this ninety and ninth soul were better left to her who
      had snatched it, Cynthia Ware.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Cynthia, nothing was farther from her mind. Unchristian as was the
      thought, if this thing she had awakened could only have been put back to
      sleep again, she would have thought herself happy. But would she have been
      happy? When Moses Hatch congratulated her, with more humor than sincerity,
      he received the greatest scare of his life. Yet in those days she welcomed
      Moses's society as she never had before; and Coniston, including Moses
      himself, began thinking of a wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Saturday came, and no Cynthia went to Brampton. Jethro may or may
      not have been on the road. Sunday, and there was Jethro on the back seat
      in the meetinghouse: Sunday noon, over his frugal dinner, the minister
      mildly remonstrates with Cynthia for neglecting one who has shown signs of
      grace, citing certain failures of others of his congregation: Cynthia
      turns scarlet, leaving the minister puzzled and a little uneasy: Monday,
      Miss Lucretia Penniman, alarmed, comes to Coniston to inquire after
      Cynthia's health: Cynthia drives back with her as far as Four Corners,
      talking literature and the advancement of woman; returns on foot, thinking
      of something else, when she discerns a figure seated on a log by the
      roadside, bent as in meditation. There was no going back the thing to do
      was to come on, as unconcernedly as possible, not noticing anything,&mdash;which
      Cynthia did, not without a little inward palpitating and curiosity, for
      which she hated herself and looked the sterner. The figure unfolded
      itself, like a Jack from a box.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say the woman wahn't any to blame&mdash;wahn't any to blame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poke bonnet turned away. The shoulders under it began to shake, and
      presently the astonished Jethro heard what seemed to be faint peals of
      laughter. Suddenly she turned around to him, all trace of laughter gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you read the book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;so I am. Hain't come to this casting-off yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn't look ahead to find out?&rdquo; This with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of readin' a book in that fashion. I'll come to it in time&mdash;g-guess
      it won't run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia stared at him, perhaps with a new interest at this plodding
      determination. She was not quite sure that she ought to stand talking to
      him a third time in these woods, especially if the subject of conversation
      were not, as Coniston thought, the salvation of his soul. But she stayed.
      Here was a woman who could be dealt with by no known rules, who did not
      even deign to notice a week of marked coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro,&rdquo; she said, with a terrifying sternness, &ldquo;I am going to ask you a
      question, and you must answer me truthfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess I won't find any trouble about that,&rdquo; said Jethro, apparently not
      in the least terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to tell me why you are going to meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To see you,&rdquo; said Jethro, promptly, &ldquo;to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know that that is wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-hadn't thought much about it,&rdquo; answered Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you should think about it. People don't go to meeting to&mdash;to
      look at other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought they did,&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;W-why do they wear their best clothes&mdash;why
      do they wear their best clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To honor God,&rdquo; said Cynthia, with a shade lacking in the conviction, for
      she added hurriedly: &ldquo;It isn't right for you to go to church to see&mdash;anybody.
      You go there to hear the Scriptures expounded, and to have your sins
      forgiven. Because I lent you that book, and you come to meeting, people
      think I'm converting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you be,&rdquo; replied Jethro, and this time it was he who smiled, &ldquo;so you
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia turned away, her lips pressed together: How to deal with such a
      man! Wondrous notes broke on the stillness, the thrush was singing his
      hymn again, only now it seemed a paean. High in the azure a hawk wheeled,
      and floated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't you see I was very angry with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-saw you was goin' with Moses Hatch more than common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia drew breath sharply. This was audacity&mdash;and yet she liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very fond of Moses,&rdquo; she said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always was charitable, Cynthy,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I been charitable to you?&rdquo; she retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess it has be'n charity,&rdquo; said Jethro. He looked down at her
      solemnly, thoughtfully, no trace of anger in his face, turned, and without
      another word strode off in the direction of Coniston Flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left a tumultuous Cynthia, amazement and repentance struggling with
      anger, which forbade her calling him back: pride in her answering to pride
      in him, and she rejoicing fiercely that he had pride. Had he but known it,
      every step he took away from her that evening was a step in advance, and
      she gloried in the fact that he did not once look back. As she walked
      toward Coniston, the thought came to her that she was rid of the thing she
      had stirred up, perhaps forever, and the thrush burst into his song once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, after Cynthia's candle had gone out, when the minister sat on
      his doorsteps looking at the glory of the moon on the mountain forest, he
      was startled by the sight of a figure slowly climbing toward him up the
      slope. A second glance told him that it was Jethro's. Vaguely troubled, he
      watched his approach; for good Priest Ware, while able to obey one-half
      the scriptural injunction, had not the wisdom of the serpent, and women,
      as typified by Cynthia, were a continual puzzle to him. That very evening,
      Moses Hatch had called, had been received with more favor than usual, and
      suddenly packed off about his business. Seated in the moonlight, the
      minister wondered vaguely whether Jethro Bass were troubling the girl. And
      now Jethro stood before him, holding out a book. Rising, Mr. Ware bade him
      good evening, mildly and cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-come to leave this book for Cynthy,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ware took it, mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you finished it?&rdquo; he asked kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I want,&rdquo; replied Jethro, &ldquo;all I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and went down the slope. Twice the words rose to the minister's
      lips to call him back, and were suppressed. Yet what to say to him if he
      came? Mr. Ware sat down again, sadly wondering why Jethro Bass should be
      so difficult to talk to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parsonage was of only one story, with a steep, sloping roof. On the
      left of the doorway was Cynthia's room, and the minister imagined he heard
      a faint, rustling noise at her window. Presently he arose, barred the
      door; could be heard moving around in his room for a while, and after that
      all was silence save for the mournful crying of a whippoorwill in the
      woods. Then a door opened softly, a white vision stole into the little
      entry lighted by the fan-window, above, seized the book and stole back.
      Had the minister been a prying man about his household, he would have
      noticed next day that Cynthia's candle was burned down to the socket. He
      saw nothing of the kind: he saw, in fact, that his daughter flitted about
      the house singing, and he went out into the sun to drop potatoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had he reached the barn than this singing ceased. But how was
      Mr. Ware to know that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice Cynthia, during the week that followed, got halfway down the slope
      of the parsonage hill, the book under her arm, on her way to the tannery;
      twice went back, tears of humiliation and self-pity in her eyes at the
      thought that she should make advances to a man, and that man the tanner's
      son. Her household work done, a longing for further motion seized her, and
      she walked out under the maples of the village street. Let it be
      understood that Coniston was a village, by courtesy, and its shaded road a
      street. Suddenly, there was the tannery, Jethro standing in front of it,
      contemplative. Did he see her? Would he come to her? Cynthia, seized by a
      panic of shame, flew into Aunt Lucy Prescott's, sat through half an hour
      of torture while Aunt Lucy talked of redemption of sinners, during ten
      minutes of which Jethro stood, still contemplative. What tumult was in his
      breast, or whether there was any tumult, Cynthia knew not. He went into
      the tannery again, and though she saw him twice later in the week, he gave
      no sign of seeing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday Cynthia bought a new bonnet in Brampton; Sunday morning put it
      on, suddenly remembered that one went to church to honor God, and wore her
      old one; walked to meeting in a flutter of expectancy not to be denied,
      and would have looked around had that not been a cardinal sin in Coniston.
      No Jethro! General opinion (had she waited to hear it among the horse
      sheds or on the green), that Jethro's soul had slid back into the murky
      regions, from which it were folly for even Cynthia to try to drag it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      To prove that Jethro's soul had not slid back into the murky regions, and
      that it was still indulging in flights, it is necessary to follow him (for
      a very short space) to Boston. Jethro himself went in Lyman Hull's
      six-horse team with a load of his own merchandise&mdash;hides that he had
      tanned, and other country produce. And they did not go by the way of Truro
      Pass to the Capital, but took the state turnpike over the ranges, where
      you can see for miles and miles and miles on a clear summer day across the
      trembling floors of the forest tops to lonely sentinel mountains fourscore
      miles away.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one takes the state turnpike nowadays except crazy tourists who are
      willing to risk their necks and their horses' legs for the sake of
      scenery. The tough little Morgans of that time, which kept their feet like
      cats, have all but disappeared, but there were places on that road where
      Lyman Hull put the shoes under his wheels for four miles at a stretch. He
      was not a companion many people would have chosen with whom to enjoy the
      beauties of such a trip, and nearly everybody in Coniston was afraid of
      him. Jethro Bass would sit silent on the seat for hours and&mdash;it is a
      fact to be noted that when he told Lyman to do a thing, Lyman did it; not,
      perhaps, without cursing and grumbling. Lyman was a profane and wicked man&mdash;drover,
      farmer, trader, anything. He had a cider mill on his farm on the south
      slopes of Coniston which Mr. Ware had mentioned in his sermons, and which
      was the resort of the ungodly. The cider was not so good as Squire
      Northcutt's, but cheaper. Jethro was not afraid of Lyman, and he had a
      mortgage on the six-horse team, and on the farm and the cider mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      After six days, Jethro and Lyman drove over Charlestown bridge and into
      the crooked streets of Boston, and at length arrived at a drover's hotel,
      or lodging-house that did not, we may be sure, front on Mount Vernon
      Street or face the Mall. Lyman proceeded to get drunk, and Jethro to sell
      the hides and other merchandise which Lyman had hauled for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a young man in Boston, when Jethro arrived in Lyman Hull's team,
      named William Wetherell. By extraordinary circumstances he and another
      connected with him are to take no small part in this story, which is a
      sufficient excuse for his introduction. His father had been a prosperous
      Portsmouth merchant in the West India trade, a man of many attainments,
      who had failed and died of a broken heart; and William, at two and twenty,
      was a clerk in the little jewellery shop of Mr. Judson in Cornhill.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell had literary aspirations, and sat from morning till
      night behind the counter, reading and dreaming: dreaming that he was to be
      an Irving or a Walter Scott, and yet the sum total of his works in after
      years consisted of some letters to the Newcastle Guardian, and a beginning
      of the Town History of Coniston!
    </p>
    <p>
      William had a contempt for the awkward young countryman who suddenly
      loomed up before him that summer's morning across the counter. But a
      moment before the clerk had been in a place where he would fain have
      lingered&mdash;a city where blue waters flow swiftly between white palaces
      toward the sunrise.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And I have fitted up some chambers there
     Looking toward the golden Eastern air,
     And level with the living winds, which flow
     Like waves above the living waves below.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Little did William Wetherell guess, when he glanced up at the intruder,
      that he was looking upon one of the forces of his own life! The countryman
      wore a blue swallow tail coat (fashioned by the hand of Speedy Bates), a
      neck-cloth, a coonskin cap, and his trousers were tucked into rawhide
      boots. He did not seem a promising customer for expensive jewellery, and
      the literary clerk did not rise, but merely closed his book with his thumb
      in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-sell things here,&rdquo; asked the countryman, &ldquo;s-sell things here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Occasionally, when folks have money to buy them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name's Jethro Bass,&rdquo; said the countryman, &ldquo;Jethro Bass from Coniston.
      Ever hear of Coniston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Wetherell never had, but many years afterward he remembered his
      name, heaven knows why. Jethro Bass! Perhaps it had a strange ring to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-folks told me to be careful,&rdquo; was Jethro's next remark. He did not look
      at the clerk, but kept his eyes fixed on the things within the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody ought to have come with you,&rdquo; said the clerk, with a smile of
      superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't know much about city ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the clerk, beginning to be amused, &ldquo;a man has to keep his
      wits about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even then Jethro spared him a look, but continued to study the contents of
      the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you, Mr. Bass? We have some really good things here.
      For example, this Swiss watch, which I will sell you cheap, for one
      hundred and fifty dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred and fifty dollars&mdash;er&mdash;one hundred and fifty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell nodded. Still the countryman did not look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-folks told me to be careful,&rdquo; he repeated without a smile. He was
      looking at the lockets, and finally pointed a large finger at one of them&mdash;the
      most expensive, by the way. &ldquo;W-what d'ye get for that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty dollars,&rdquo; the clerk promptly replied. Thirty was nearer the price,
      but what did it matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how much for that?&rdquo; he said, pointing to another. The clerk told him.
      He inquired about them all, deliberately repeating the sums, considering
      with so well-feigned an air of a purchaser that Mr. Wetherell began to
      take a real joy in the situation. For trade was slack in August, and
      diversion scarce. Finally he commanded that the case be put on the top of
      the counter, and Wetherell humored him. Whereupon he picked up the locket
      he had first chosen. It looked very delicate in his huge, rough hand, and
      Wetherell was surprised that the eyes of Mr. Bass had been caught by the
      most expensive, for it was far from being the showiest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-twenty dollars?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may as well call it that,&rdquo; laughed Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not too good for Cynthy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing's too good for Cynthy,&rdquo; answered Mr. Wetherell, mockingly, little
      knowing how he might come to mean it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass paid no attention to this speech. Pulling a great cowhide
      wallet from his pocket, still holding the locket in his hand, to the
      amazement of the clerk he counted out twenty dollars and laid them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess I'll take that one, g-guess I'll take that one,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he looked at Mr. Wetherell for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; cried the clerk, more alarmed than he cared to show, &ldquo;that's not
      the price. Did you think I could sell it for that price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-wahn't that the price you fixed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You simpleton!&rdquo; retorted Wetherell, with a conviction now that he was
      calling him the wrong name. &ldquo;Give me back the locket, and you shall have
      your money, again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-wahn't that the price you fixed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess I'll keep the locket&mdash;g-guess I'll keep the locket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell looked at him aghast, and there was no doubt about his
      determination. With a sinking heart the clerk realized that he should have
      to make good to Mr. Judson the seven odd dollars of difference, and then
      he lost his head. Slipping round the counter to the door of the shop, he
      turned the key, thrust it in his pocket, and faced Mr. Bass again&mdash;from
      behind the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't leave this shop,&rdquo; cried the clerk, &ldquo;until you give me back that
      locket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass turned. A bench ran along the farther wall, and there he
      planted himself without a word, while the clerk stared at him,&mdash;with
      what feelings of uneasiness I shall not attempt to describe,&mdash;for the
      customer was plainly determined to wait until hunger should drive one of
      them forth. The minutes passed, and Wetherell began to hate him. Then some
      one tried the door, peered in through the glass, perceived Jethro, shook
      the knob, knocked violently, all to no purpose. Jethro seemed lost in a
      reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This has gone far enough,&rdquo; said the clerk, trying to keep his voice from
      shaking &ldquo;it is beyond a joke. Give me back the locket.&rdquo; And he tendered
      Jethro the money again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-wahn't that the price you fixed?&rdquo; asked Jethro, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell choked. The man outside shook the door again, and people on the
      sidewalk stopped, and presently against the window panes a sea of curious
      faces gazed in upon them. Mr. Bass's thoughts apparently were fixed on
      Eternity&mdash;he looked neither at the people nor at Wetherell. And then,
      the crowd parting as for one in authority, as in a bad dream the clerk saw
      his employer, Mr. Judson, courteously pushing away the customer at the
      door who would not be denied. Another moment, and Mr. Judson had gained
      admittance with his private key, and stood on the threshold staring at
      clerk and customer. Jethro gave no sign that the situation had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William,&rdquo; said Mr. Judson, in a dangerously quiet voice, &ldquo;perhaps you can
      explain this extraordinary state of affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can, sir,&rdquo; William cried. &ldquo;This gentleman&rdquo; (the word stuck in his
      throat), &ldquo;this gentleman came in here to examine lockets which I had no
      reason to believe he would buy. I admit my fault, sir. He asked the price
      of the most expensive, and I told him twenty dollars, merely for a jest,
      sir.&rdquo; William hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mr. Judson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After pricing every locket in the case, he seized the first one, handed
      me twenty dollars, and now refuses to give it up, although he knows the
      price is twenty-seven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I locked the door, sir. He sat down there, and hasn't moved since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Judson looked again at Mr. Bass; this time with unmistakable interest.
      The other customer began to laugh, and the crowd was pressing in, and Mr.
      Judson turned and shut the door in their faces. All this time Mr. Bass had
      not moved, not so much as to lift his head or shift one of his great
      cowhide boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; demanded Mr. Judson, &ldquo;what have you to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-nothin'. G-guess I'll keep the locket. I've, paid for it&mdash;I've
      paid for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are aware, my friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Judson, &ldquo;that my clerk has given
      you the wrong price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess that's his lookout.&rdquo; He still sat there, doggedly unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bull would have seemed more at home in a china shop than Jethro Bass in
      a jewellery store. But Mr. Judson himself was a man out of the ordinary,
      and instead of getting angry he began to be more interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took you for a greenhorn, did he?&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-folks told me to be careful&mdash;to be careful,&rdquo; said Mr. Bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Judson laughed. It was all the more disconcerting to William
      Wetherell, because his employer laughed rarely. He laid his hand on
      Jethro's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might have spared himself the trouble, my young friend,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
      didn't expect to find a greenhorn behind a jewellery counter, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-surprised me some,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Judson laughed again, all the while looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to let you keep the locket,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because it will teach
      my greenhorn a lesson. William, do you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; William said, and his face was very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bass rose solemnly, apparently unmoved by his triumph in a somewhat
      remarkable transaction, and William long remembered how he towered over
      all of them. He held the locket out to Mr. Judson, who stared at it,
      astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; said that gentleman; &ldquo;you don't want it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I'll have it marked,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;ef it don't cost extry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marked!&rdquo; gasped Mr. Judson, &ldquo;marked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef it don't cost extry,&rdquo; Jethro repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll&mdash;&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Judson, and suddenly recalled the fact
      that he was a church member. &ldquo;What inscription do you wish put into it?&rdquo;
       he asked, recovering himself with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro thrust his hand into his pocket, and again the cowhide wallet came
      out. He tendered Mr. Judson a somewhat soiled piece of paper, and Mr.
      Judson read:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Cynthy, from Jethro&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy,&rdquo; Mr. Judson repeated, in a tremulous voice, &ldquo;Cynthy, not
      Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how is it written,&rdquo; said Jethro, leaning over it, &ldquo;h-how is it
      written?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy,&rdquo; answered Mr. Judson, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then make it Cynthy&mdash;make it Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy it shall be,&rdquo; said Mr. Judson, with conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When'll you have it done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; replied Mr. Judson, with a twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;to-night, as a
      special favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time&mdash;w-what time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven o'clock, sir. May I send it to your hotel? The Tremont House, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I-I'll call,&rdquo; said Jethro, so solemnly that Mr. Judson kept his laughter
      until he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the door they watched him silently as he strode across the street and
      turned the corner. Then Mr. Judson turned. &ldquo;That man will make his mark,
      William,&rdquo; he said; and added thoughtfully, &ldquo;but whether for good or evil,
      I know not.&rdquo;

    <p>
      What Cynthia may have thought or felt during Jethro's absence in Boston,
      and for some months thereafter, she kept to herself. Honest Moses Hatch
      pursued his courting untroubled, and never knew that he had a rival. Moses
      would as soon have questioned the seasons or the weather as Cynthia's
      changes of moods,&mdash;which were indeed the weather for him, and when
      storms came he sat with his back to them, waiting for the sunshine. He had
      long ceased proposing marriage, in the firm belief that Cynthia would set
      the day in her own good time. Thereby he was saved much suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer flew on apace, for Coniston. Fragrant hay was cut on hillsides
      won from rock and forest, and Coniston Water sang a gentler melody&mdash;save
      when the clouds floated among the spruces on the mountain and the rain
      beat on the shingles. During the still days before the turn of the year,&mdash;days
      of bending fruit boughs, crab-apples glistening red in the soft sunlight,&mdash;rumor
      came from Brampton to wrinkle the forehead of Moses Hatch as he worked
      among his father's orchards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumor was of a Mr. Isaac Dudley Worthington, a name destined to make
      much rumor before it was to be carved on the marble. Isaac D. Worthington,
      indeed, might by a stretch of the imagination be called the pioneer of all
      the genus to be known in the future as City Folks, who were, two
      generations later, to invade the country like a devouring army of locusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time a stranger in Brampton was enough to set the town agog. But a
      young man of three and twenty, with an independent income of four hundred
      dollars a year!&mdash;or any income at all not derived from his own labor&mdash;was
      unheard of. It is said that when the stage from over Truro Gap arrived in
      Brampton Street a hundred eyes gazed at him unseen, from various ambushes,
      and followed him up the walk to Silas Wheelock's, where he was to board.
      In half an hour Brampton knew the essentials of Isaac Worthington's story,
      and Sam Price was on his way with it to Coniston for distribution at Jonah
      Winch's store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Worthington was from Boston&mdash;no less; slim, pale, medium
      height, but with an alert look, and a high-bridged nose. But his clothes!
      Sam Price's vocabulary was insufficient here, they were cut in such a way,
      and Mr. Worthington was downright distinguished-looking under his gray
      beaver. Why had he come to Brampton? demanded Deacon Ira Perkins. Sam had
      saved this for the last. Young Mr. Worthington was threatened with
      consumption, and had been sent to live with his distant relative, Silas
      Wheelock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of a gentleman of leisure&mdash;although threatened with
      consumption&mdash;became an all-absorbing topic in two villages and three
      hamlets, and more than one swain, hitherto successful, felt the wind blow
      colder. But in a fortnight it was known that a petticoat did not make
      Isaac Worthington even turn his head. Curiosity centred on Silas
      Wheelock's barn, where Mr. Worthington had fitted up a shop, and,
      presently various strange models of contrivances began to take shape
      there. What these were, Silas himself knew not; and the gentleman of
      leisure was, alas! close-mouthed. When he was not sawing and hammering and
      planing, he took long walks up and down Coniston Water, and was surprised
      deep in thought at several places.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nathan Bass's story-and-a-half house, devoid of paint, faced the road, and
      behind it was the shed, or barn, that served as the tannery, and between
      the tannery and Coniston Water were the vats. The rain flew in silvery
      spray, and the drops shone like jewels on the coat of a young man who
      stood looking in at the tannery door. Young Jake Wheeler, son of the
      village spendthrift, was driving a lean white horse round in a ring: to
      the horse was attached a beam, and on the beam a huge round stone rolled
      on a circular oak platform. Jethro Bass, who was engaged in pushing
      hemlock bark under the stone to be crushed, straightened. Of the three,
      the horse had seen the visitor first, and stopped in his tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro!&rdquo; whispered Jake, tingling with an excitement that was but
      natural. Jethro had begun to sweep the finer pieces of bark toward the
      centre. &ldquo;It's the city man, walked up here from Brampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed Mr. Worthington, slightly more sunburned and less
      citified-looking than on his arrival, and he wore a woollen cap of
      Brampton make. Even then, despite his wavy hair and delicate appearance,
      Isaac Worthington had the hawk-like look which became famous in later
      years, and at length he approached Jethro and fixed his eye upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of slow work, isn't it?&rdquo; remarked Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white horse was the only one to break the silence that followed, by
      sneezing with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the tannery business in these parts?&rdquo; essayed Mr. Worthington
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinkin' of it?&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;T-thinkin' of it, be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mr. Worthington, hastily. &ldquo;If I were,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I'd put
      in new machinery. That horse and stone is primitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of machinery would you put in?&rdquo; asked Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; answered Worthington, &ldquo;that will interest you. All New Englanders
      are naturally progressive, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what was it you took?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was merely remarking on the enterprise of New Englanders,&rdquo; said
      Worthington, flushing. &ldquo;On my journey up here, beside the Merrimac, I had
      the opportunity to inspect the new steam-boiler, the falling-mill, the
      splitting machine, and other remarkable improvements. In fact, these
      suggested one or two little things to me, which might be of interest to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;they might, and then again they mightn't. Guess it
      depends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends!&rdquo; exclaimed the man of leisure, &ldquo;depends on what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how much you know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Worthington, instead of being justly indignant, laughed and
      settled himself comfortably on a pile of bark. He thought Jethro a
      character, and he was not mistaken. On the other hand, Mr. Worthington
      displayed a knowledge of the falling-mill and splitting-machine and the
      process of tanneries in general that was surprising. Jethro, had Mr.
      Worthington but known it, was more interested in animate machines: more
      interested in Mr. Worthington than the falling-mill or, indeed, the
      tannery business.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the visitor fell silent, his sense of superiority suddenly gone.
      Others had had this same feeling with Jethro, even the minister; but the
      man of leisure (who was nothing of the sort) merely felt a kind of
      bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Callatin' to live in Brampton&mdash;be you?&rdquo; asked Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am living there now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-callatin' to set up a mill some day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington fairly leaped off the bark pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guesswork,&rdquo; said Jethro, starting to shovel again, &ldquo;g-guesswork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To take a walk in the wild, to come upon a bumpkin in cowhide boots
      crushing bark, to have him read within twenty minutes a cherished and
      well-hidden ambition which Brampton had not discovered in a month (and did
      not discover for many years) was sufficiently startling. Well might Mr.
      Worthington tremble for his other ambitions, and they were many.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro stepped out, passing Mr. Worthington as though he had already
      forgotten that gentleman's existence, and seized an armful of bark that
      lay under cover of a lean-to. Just then, heralded by a brightening of the
      western sky, a girl appeared down the road, her head bent a little as in
      thought, and if she saw the group by the tannery house she gave no sign.
      Two of them stared at her&mdash;Jake Wheeler and Mr. Worthington. Suddenly
      Jake, implike, turned and stared at Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy Ware, the minister's daughter,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't I seen her in Brampton?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Worthington, little
      thinking of the consequences of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you have,&rdquo; answered Jake. &ldquo;Cynthy goes to the Social Library, to
      git books. She knows more'n the minister himself, a sight more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does the minister live?&rdquo; asked Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jake pulled him by the sleeve toward the road, and pointed to the low
      gable of the little parsonage under the elms on the hill beyond the
      meeting-house. The visitor gave a short glance at it, swung around and
      gave a longer glance at the figure disappearing in the other direction. He
      did not suspect that Jake was what is now called a news agency. Then Mr.
      Worthington turned to Jethro, who was stooping over the bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you come to Brampton, call and see me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You'll find me at
      Silas Wheelock's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got no answer, but apparently expected none, and he started off down
      the Brampton road in the direction Cynthia had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes another,&rdquo; said Jake, significantly, &ldquo;and Speedy Bates says he
      never looks at wimmen. Godfrey, I wish I could see Moses now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington had not been quite ingenuous with Jake. To tell the truth,
      he had made the acquaintance of the Social Library and Miss Lucretia, and
      that lady had sung the praises of her favorite. Once out of sight of
      Jethro, Mr. Worthington quickened his steps, passed the store, where he
      was remarked by two of Jonah's customers, and his blood leaped when he saw
      the girl in front of him, walking faster now. Yes, it is a fact that Isaac
      Worthington's blood once leaped. He kept on, but when near her had a spasm
      of fright to make his teeth fairly chatter, and than another spasm
      followed, for Cynthia had turned around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do Mr. Worthington?&rdquo; she said, dropping him a little courtesy.
      Mr. Worthington stopped in his tracks, and it was some time before he
      remembered to take off his woollen cap and sweep the mud with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know my name!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is known from Tarleton Four Corners to Harwich,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;all
      that distance. To tell the truth,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;those are the boundaries of
      my world.&rdquo; And Mr. Worthington being still silent, &ldquo;How do you like being
      a big frog in a little pond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were your pond, Miss Cynthia,&rdquo; he responded gallantly, &ldquo;I should be
      content to be a little frog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I don't believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not subtle flattery, but the truth&mdash;Mr. Worthington would
      never be content to be a little anything. So he had been judged twice in
      an afternoon, once by Jethro and again by Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you believe me?&rdquo; he asked ecstatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman's instinct, Mr. Worthington, has very little reason in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear, Miss Cynthia,&rdquo; he said gallantly, &ldquo;that your instinct is
      fortified by learning, since Miss Penniman tells me that you are quite
      capable of taking a school in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should be doubly sure of your character,&rdquo; she retorted with a
      twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell my fortune?&rdquo; he said gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on such a slight acquaintance,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Good-by, Mr.
      Worthington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall see you in Brampton,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I&mdash;I have seen you in
      Brampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer this confession, but left him, and presently
      disappeared beyond the triangle of the green, while Mr. Worthington
      pursued his way to Brampton by the road,&mdash;his thoughts that evening
      not on waterfalls or machinery. As for Cynthia's conduct, I do not defend
      or explain it, for I have found out that the best and wisest of women can
      at times be coquettish.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that meeting which shook the serenity of poor Moses, and he learned
      of it when he went to Jonah Winch's store an hour later. An hour later,
      indeed, Coniston was discussing the man of leisure in a new light. It was
      possible that Cynthia might take him, and Deacon Ira Perkins made a note
      the next time he went to Brampton to question Silas Wheelock on Mr.
      Worthington's origin, habits, and orthodoxy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia troubled herself very little about any of these. Scarcely any
      purpose in the world is single, but she had had a purpose in talking to
      Mr. Worthington, besides the pleasure it gave her. And the next Saturday,
      when she rode off to Brampton, some one looked through the cracks in the
      tannery shed and saw that she wore her new bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is scarcely a pleasanter place in the world than Brampton Street on
      a summer's day. Down the length of it runs a wide green, shaded by
      spreading trees, and on either side, tree-shaded, too, and each in its own
      little plot, gabled houses of that simple, graceful architecture of our
      forefathers. Some of these had fluted pilasters and cornices, the envy of
      many a modern architect, and fan-shaped windows in dormer and doorway. And
      there was the church, then new, that still stands to the glory of its
      builders; with terraced steeple and pillared porch and the widest of
      checker-paned sashes to let in the light on high-backed pews and gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The celebrated Social Library, halfway up the street, occupied part of
      Miss Lucretia's little house; or, it might better be said, Miss Lucretia
      boarded with the Social Library. There Cynthia hitched her horse, gave
      greeting to Mr. Ezra Graves and others who paused, and, before she was
      fairly in the door, was clasped in Miss Lucretia's arms. There were new
      books to be discussed, arrived by the stage the day before; but scarce
      half an hour had passed before Cynthia started guiltily at a timid knock,
      and Miss Lucretia rose briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be Ezra Graves come for the Gibbon,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He's early.&rdquo; And
      she went to the door. Cynthia thought it was not Ezra. Then came Miss
      Lucretia's voice from the entry:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Worthington! Have you read the Last of the Mohicans already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There he stood, indeed, the man of leisure, and to-day he wore his beaver
      hat. No, he had not yet read the 'Last of the Mohicans.' There were things
      in it that Mr. Worthington would like to discuss with Miss Penniman. Was
      it not a social library? At this juncture there came a giggle from within
      that made him turn scarlet, and he scarcely heard Miss Lucretia offering
      to discuss the whole range of letters. Enter Mr. Worthington, bows
      profoundly to Miss Lucretia's guest, his beaver in his hand, and the
      discussion begins, Cynthia taking no part in it. Strangely enough, Mr.
      Worthington's remarks on American Indians are not only intelligent, but
      interesting. The clock strikes four, Miss Lucretia starts up, suddenly
      remembering that she has promised to read to an invalid, and with many
      regrets from Mr. Worthington, she departs. Then he sits down again,
      twirling his beaver, while Cynthia looks at him in quiet amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall walk to Coniston again, next week,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an energetic man!&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to have my fortune told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear that you walk a great deal,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;up and down Coniston
      Water. I shall begin to think you romantic, Mr. Worthington&mdash;perhaps
      a poet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't walk up and down Coniston Water for that reason,&rdquo; he answered
      earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might I be so bold as to ask the reason?&rdquo; she ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great men have their weaknesses. And many, close-mouthed with their own
      sex, will tell their cherished hopes to a woman, if their interests are
      engaged. With a bas-relief of Isaac Worthington in the town library to-day
      (his own library), and a full-length portrait of him in the capitol of the
      state, who shall deny this title to greatness?
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned a little toward her, his face illumined by his subject, which
      was himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will confide in you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that some day I shall build here in
      Brampton a woollen mill which will be the best of its kind. If I gain
      money, it will not be to hoard it or to waste it. I shall try to make the
      town better for it, and the state, and I shall try to elevate my
      neighbors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia could not deny that these were laudable ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something tells me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that I shall succeed. And that is why
      I walk on Coniston Water&mdash;to choose the best site for a dam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am honored by your secret, but I feel that the responsibility you
      repose in me is too great,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can think of none in whom I would rather confide,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And am I the only one in all Brampton, Harwich, and Coniston who knows
      this?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only one of importance,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;This week, when I went to
      Coniston, I had a strange experience. I left the brook at a tannery, and a
      most singular fellow was in the shed shovelling bark. I tried to get him
      to talk, and told him about some new tanning machinery I had seen.
      Suddenly he turned on me and asked me if I was 'callatin' to set up a
      mill.' He gave me a queer feeling. Do you have many such odd characters in
      Coniston, Miss Cynthia? You're not going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia had risen, and all of the laugher was gone from her eyes. What had
      happened to make her grow suddenly grave, Isaac Worthington never knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to get my father's supper,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, rose, puzzled and disconcerted at this change in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may I not come to Coniston?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father and I should be glad to see you, Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; she
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He untied her horse and essayed one more topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are taking a very big book,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I look at the title?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She showed it to him in silence. It was the &ldquo;Life of Napoleon Bonaparte.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Isaac Worthington came to Coniston not once, but many times, before the
      snow fell; and afterward, too, in Silas Wheelock's yellow sleigh through
      the great drifts under the pines, the chestnut Morgan trotting to one side
      in the tracks. On one of these excursions he fell in with that singular
      character of a bumpkin who had interested him on his first visit, in
      coonskin cap and overcoat and mittens. Jethro Bass was plodding in the
      same direction, and Isaac Worthington, out of the goodness of his heart,
      invited him into the sleigh. He was scarcely prepared for the bumpkin's
      curt refusal, but put it down to native boorishness, and thought no more
      about it then.
    </p>
    <p>
      What troubled Mr. Worthington infinitely more was the progress of his
      suit; for it had become a snit, though progress is a wrong word to use in
      connection with it. So far had he got,&mdash;not a great distance,&mdash;and
      then came to what he at length discovered was a wall, and apparently
      impenetrable. He was not even allowed to look over it. Cynthia was kind,
      engaging; even mirthful, at times, save when he approached it; and he
      became convinced that a certain sorrow lay in the forbidden ground. The
      nearest he had come to it was when he mentioned again, by accident, that
      life of Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Cynthia would accept him, nobody doubted for an instant. It would be
      madness not to. He was orthodox, so Deacon Ira had discovered, of good
      habits, and there was the princely four hundred a year&mdash;almost a
      minister's salary! Little people guessed that there was no love-making&mdash;only
      endless discussions of books beside the great centre chimney, and
      discussions of Isaac Worthington's career.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a fact&mdash;for future consideration&mdash;that Isaac Worthington
      proposed to Cynthia Ware, although neither Speedy Bates nor Deacon Ira
      Perkins heard him do so. It had been very carefully prepared, that speech,
      and was a model of proposals for the rising young men of all time. Mr.
      Worthington preferred to offer himself for what he was going to be&mdash;not
      for what he was. He tendered to Cynthia a note for a large amount, payable
      in some twenty years, with interest. The astonishing thing to record is
      that in twenty years he could have more than paid the note, although he
      could not have foreseen at that time the Worthington Free Library and the
      Truro Railroad, and the stained-glass window in the church and the great
      marble monument on the hill&mdash;to another woman. All of these things,
      and more, Cynthia might have had if she had only accepted that promise to
      pay! But she did not accept it. He was a trifle more robust than when he
      came to Brampton in the summer, but perhaps she doubted his promise to
      pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have been guessed, although the language we have used has been
      purposely delicate, that Cynthia was already in love with&mdash;somebody
      else. Shame of shames and horror of horrors&mdash;with Jethro Bass! With
      Strength, in the crudest form in which it is created, perhaps, but yet
      with Strength. The strength might gradually and eventually be refined.
      Such was her hope, when she had any. It is hard, looking back upon that
      virginal and cultured Cynthia, to be convinced that she could have loved
      passionately, and such a man! But love she did, and passionately, too, and
      hated herself for it, and prayed and struggled to cast out what she
      believed, at times, to be a devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient allegory of Cupid and the arrows has never been improved upon:
      of Cupid, who should never in the world have been trusted with a weapon,
      who defies all game laws, who shoots people in the bushes and innocent
      bystanders generally, the weak and the helpless and the strong and
      self-confident! There is no more reason in it than that. He shot Cynthia
      Ware, and what she suffered in secret Coniston never guessed. What
      parallels in history shall I quote to bring home the enormity of such a
      mesalliance? Orthodox Coniston would have gone into sackcloth and ashes,&mdash;was
      soon to go into these, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not trying to keep the lovers apart for any mere purposes of fiction,&mdash;this
      is a true chronicle, and they stayed apart most of that winter. Jethro
      went about his daily tasks, which were now become manifold, and he wore
      the locket on its little chain himself. He did not think that Cynthia
      loved him&mdash;yet, but he had the effrontery to believe that she might,
      some day; and he was content to wait. He saw that she avoided him, and he
      was too proud to go to the parsonage and so incur ridicule and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro was content to wait. That is a clew to his character throughout his
      life. He would wait for his love, he would wait for his hate: he had
      waited ten years before putting into practice the first step of a little
      scheme which he had been gradually developing during that time, for which
      he had been amassing money, and the life of Napoleon Bonaparte, by the
      way, had given him some valuable ideas. Jethro, as well as Isaac D.
      Worthington, had ambitions, although no one in Coniston had hitherto
      guessed them except Jock Hallowell&mdash;and Cynthia Ware, after her
      curiosity had been aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as Isaac D. Worthington did not dream of the Truro Railroad and of an
      era in the haze of futurity, it did not occur to Jethro Bass that his
      ambitions tended to the making of another era that was at hand. Makers of
      eras are too busy thinking about themselves and like immediate matters to
      worry about history. Jethro never heard the expression about &ldquo;cracks in
      the Constitution,&rdquo; and would not have known what it meant,&mdash;he merely
      had the desire to get on top. But with Established Church Coniston tight
      in the saddle (in the person of Moses Hatch, Senior), how was he to do it?
    </p>
    <p>
      As the winter wore on, and March town meeting approached, strange rumors
      of a Democratic ticket began to drift into Jonah Winch's store,&mdash;a
      Democratic ticket headed by Fletcher Bartlett, of all men, as chairman of
      the board. Moses laughed when he first heard of it, for Fletcher was an
      easy-going farmer of the Methodist persuasion who was always in debt, and
      the other members of the ticket, so far as Moses could learn of it&mdash;were
      remarkable neither for orthodoxy or solidity. The rumors persisted, and
      still Moses laughed, for the senior selectman was a big man with flesh on
      him, who could laugh with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moses,&rdquo; said Deacon Lysander Richardson as they stood on the platform of
      the store one sunny Saturday in February, &ldquo;somebody's put Fletcher up to
      this. He hain't got sense enough to act that independent all by himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You be always croakin', Lysander,&rdquo; answered Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia Ware, who had come to the store for buttons for Speedy Bates, who
      was making a new coat for the minister, heard these remarks, and stood
      thoughtfully staring at the blue coat-tails of the elders. A brass button
      was gone from Deacon Lysander's, and she wanted to sew it on. Suddenly she
      looked up, and saw Jock Hallowell standing beside her. Jock winked&mdash;and
      Cynthia blushed and hurried homeward without a word. She remembered,
      vividly enough, what Jack had told her the spring before, and several
      times during the week that followed she thought of waylaying him and
      asking what he knew. But she could not summon the courage. As a matter of
      fact, Jock knew nothing, but he had a theory. He was a strange man, Jock,
      who whistled all day on roof and steeple and meddled with nobody's
      business, as a rule. What had impelled him to talk to Cynthia in the way
      he had must remain a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the disquieting rumors continued to come in. Jabez Miller, on
      the north slope, had told Samuel Todd, who told Ephraim Williams, that he
      was going to vote for Fletcher. Moses Hatch hitched up his team and went
      out to see Jabez, spent an hour in general conversation, and then plumped
      the question, taking, as he said, that means of finding out. Jabez hemmed
      and hawed, said his farm was mortgaged; spoke at some length about the
      American citizen, however humble, having a right to vote as he chose. A
      most unusual line for Jabez, and the whole matter very mysterious and not
      a little ominous. Moses drove homeward that sparkling day, shutting his
      eyes to the glare of the ice crystals on the pines, and thinking
      profoundly. He made other excursions, enough to satisfy himself that this
      disease, so new and unheard of (the right of the unfit to hold office),
      actually existed. Where the germ began that caused it, Moses knew no
      better than the deacon, since those who were suspected of leanings toward
      Fletcher Bartlett were strangely secretive. The practical result of Moses'
      profound thought was a meeting, in his own house, without respect to
      party, Democrats and Whigs alike, opened by a prayer from the minister
      himself. The meeting, after a futile session, broke up dismally. Sedition
      and conspiracy existed; a chief offender and master mind there was,
      somewhere. But who was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Mr. Ware went home, troubled in spirit, shaking his head. He had a
      cold, and was not so strong as he used to be, and should not have gone to
      the meeting at all. At supper, Cynthia listened with her eyes on her plate
      while he told her of the affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody's behind this, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's the most astonishing
      thing in my experience that we cannot discover who has incited them. All
      the unattached people in the town seem to have been organized.&rdquo; Mr. Ware
      was wont to speak with moderation even at his own table. He said
      unattached&mdash;not ungodly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia kept her eyes on her plate, but she felt as though her body were
      afire. Little did the minister imagine, as he went off to write his
      sermon, that his daughter might have given him the clew to the mystery.
      Yes, Cynthia guessed; and she could not read that evening because of the
      tumult of her thoughts. What was her duty in the matter? To tell her
      father her suspicions? They were only suspicions, after all, and she could
      make no accusations. And Jethro! Although she condemned him, there was
      something in the situation that appealed to a most reprehensible sense of
      humor. Cynthia caught herself smiling once or twice, and knew that it was
      wicked. She excused Jethro, and told herself that, with his lack of
      training, he could know no better. Then an idea came to her, and the very
      boldness of it made her grow hot again. She would appeal to him tell him
      that that power he had over other men could be put to better and finer
      uses. She would appeal to him, and he would abandon the matter. That the
      man loved her with the whole of his rude strength she was sure, and that
      knowledge had been the only salve to her shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far we have only suspicions ourselves; and, strange to relate, if we go
      around Coniston with Jethro behind his little red Morgan, we shall come
      back with nothing but&mdash;suspicions. They will amount to convictions,
      yet we cannot prove them. The reader very naturally demands some specific
      information&mdash;how did Jethro do it? I confess that I can only indicate
      in a very general way: I can prove nothing. Nobody ever could prove
      anything against Jethro Bass. Bring the following evidence before any
      grand jury in the country, and see if they don't throw it out of court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro in the course of his weekly round of strictly business visits
      throughout the town, drives into Samuel Todd's farmyard, and hitches on
      the sunny side of the red barns. The town of Coniston, it must be
      explained for the benefit of those who do not understand the word &ldquo;town&rdquo;
       in the New England senses was a tract of country about ten miles by ten,
      the most thickly settled portion of which was the village of Coniston,
      consisting of twelve houses. Jethro drives into the barnyard, and Samuel
      Todd comes out. He is a little man, and has a habit of rubbing the sharp
      ridge of his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you, Jethro?&rdquo; says Samuel. &ldquo;Killed the brindle Thursday. Finest
      hide you ever seed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-goin' to town meetin' Tuesday&mdash;g-goin' to town meetin' Tuesday&mdash;Sam'l?&rdquo;
       says Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was callatin' to, Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Democrat&mdash;hain't ye&mdash;Democrat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Callate to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much store do ye set by that hide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samuel rubs his nose. Then he names a price that the hide might fetch,
      under favorable circumstances, in Boston&mdash;Jethro does not wince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who d'ye callate to vote for, Sam'l?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Samuel rubs his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heerd they was a-goin' to put up Fletcher and Amos Cuthbert, an' Sam
      Price for Moderator.&rdquo; (What a convenient word is they when used
      politically!) &ldquo;Hain't made up my mind, clear,&rdquo; says Samuel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-comin' by the tannery after town meetin'?&rdquo; inquired Jethro, casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know but what I kin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-fetch the hide&mdash;f-fetch the hide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jethro drives off, with Samuel looking after him, rubbing his nose.
      &ldquo;No bill,&rdquo; says the jury&mdash;if you can get Samuel into court. But you
      can't. Even Moses Hatch can get nothing out of Samuel, who then talks
      Jacksonian principles and the nights of an American citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us pursue this matter a little farther, and form a committee of
      investigation. Where did Mr. Todd learn anything about Jacksonian
      principles? From Mr. Samuel Price, whom they have spoken of for Moderator.
      And where did Mr. Price learn of these principles? Any one in Coniston
      will tell you that Mr. Price makes a specialty of orators and oratory; and
      will hold forth at the drop of a hat in Jonah Winch's store or anywhere
      else. Who is Mr. Price? He is a tall, sallow young man of eight and
      twenty, with a wedge-shaped face, a bachelor and a Methodist, who farms in
      a small way on the southern slope, and saves his money. He has become
      almost insupportable since they have named him for Moderator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Get Mr. Sam Price into court. Here is a man who assuredly knows who they
      are: if we are, not much mistaken, he is their mouthpiece. Get, an eel
      into court. There is only one man in town who can hold an eel, and he
      isn't on the jury. Mr. Price will talk plentifully, in his nasal way; but
      he won't tell you anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price has been nominated to fill Deacon Lysander Richardson's shoes in
      the following manner: One day in the late autumn a man in a coonskin cap
      stops beside Mr. Price's woodpile, where Mr. Price has been chopping wood,
      pausing occasionally to stare off through the purple haze at the south
      shoulder of Coniston Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you, Jethro?&rdquo; says Mr. Price, nasally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-Democrats are talkin' some of namin' you Moderator next meetin',&rdquo; says
      the man in the coonskin cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to know!&rdquo; ejaculates Mr. Price, dropping the axe and straightening
      up in amazement. For Mr. Price's ambition soared no higher, and he had
      made no secret of it. &ldquo;Wal! Whar'd you hear that, Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-heerd it round&mdash;some. D-Democrat&mdash;hain't you&mdash;Democrat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always callate to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J-Jacksonian Democrat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence for a while, that Mr. Price may feel the gavel in his hand, which
      he does.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know somewhat about Jacksonian principles, don't ye&mdash;know somewhat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Callate to,&rdquo; says Mr. Price, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-talk 'em up, Sam&mdash;t-talk 'em up. C-canvass, Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words of brotherly advice Mr. Bass went off down the road, and
      Mr. Price chopped no more wood that night; but repeated to himself many
      times in his nasal voice, &ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; In the course of the next few
      weeks various gentlemen mentioned to Mr. Price that he had been spoken of
      for Moderator, and he became acquainted with the names of the other
      candidates on the same mysterious ticket who were mentioned. Whereupon he
      girded up his loins and went forth and preached the word of Jacksonian
      Democracy in all the farmhouses roundabout, with such effect that Samuel
      Todd and others were able to talk with some fluency about the rights of
      American citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Question before the Committee, undisposed of: Who nominated Samuel Price
      for Moderator? Samuel Price gives the evidence, tells the court he does
      not know, and is duly cautioned and excused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us call, next, Mr. Eben Williams, if we can. Moses Hatch, Senior, has
      already interrogated him with all the authority of the law and the church,
      for Mr. Williams is orthodox, though the deacons have to remind him of his
      duty once in a while. Eben is timid, and replies to us, as to Moses, that
      he has heard of the Democratic ticket, and callates that Fletcher
      Bartlett, who has always been the leader of the Democratic party, has
      named the ticket. He did not mention Jethro Bass to Deacon Hatch. Why
      should he? What has Jethro Bass got to do with politics?
    </p>
    <p>
      Eben lives on a southern spur, next to Amos Cuthbert, where you can look
      off for forty miles across the billowy mountains of the west. From no spot
      in Coniston town is the sunset so fine on distant Farewell Mountain, and
      Eben's sheep feed on pastures where only mountain-bred sheep can cling and
      thrive. Coniston, be it known, at this time is one of the famous wool
      towns of New England: before the industry went West, with other
      industries. But Eben Williams's sheep do not wholly belong to him they are
      mortgaged&mdash;and Eben's farm is mortgaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass&mdash;Eben testifies to us&mdash;is in the habit of visiting
      him once a month, perhaps, when he goes to Amos Cuthbert's. Just friendly
      calls. Is it not a fact that Jethro Bass holds his mortgage? Yes, for
      eight hundred dollars. How long has he held that mortgage? About a year
      and a half. Has the interest been paid promptly? Well, the fact is that
      Eben hasn't paid any interest yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let us take the concrete incident. Before that hypocritical thaw early
      in February, Jethro called upon Amos Cuthbert&mdash;not so surly then as
      he has since become&mdash;and talked about buying his wool when it should
      be duly cut, and permitted Amos to talk about the position of second
      selectman, for which some person or persons unknown to the jury had
      nominated him. On his way down to the Four Corners, Jethro had merely
      pulled up his sleigh before Eben Williams's house, which stood behind a
      huge snow bank and practically on the road. Eben appeared at the door, a
      little dishevelled in hair and beard, for he had been sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you, Jethro?&rdquo; he said nervously. Jethro nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weather looks a mite soft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About that interest,&rdquo; said Eben, plunging into the dread subject, &ldquo;don't
      know as I'm ready this month after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-goin' to town meetin', Eben?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wahn't callatin' to,&rdquo; answered Eben.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-goin' to town meetin', Eben?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eben, puzzled and dismayed, ran his hand through his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wahn't callatin' to&mdash;but I kin&mdash;I kin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-Democrat&mdash;hain't ye&mdash;D-Democrat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kin be,&rdquo; said Eben. Then he looked at Jethro and added in a startled
      voice, &ldquo;Don't know but what I be&mdash;Yes, I guess I be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-heerd the ticket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Eben had heard the ticket. What man had not. Some one has been most
      industrious, and most disinterested, in distributing that ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't a mite of hurry about the interest right now&mdash;right now,&rdquo;
       said Jethro. &ldquo;M-may be along the third week in March&mdash;may be&mdash;c-can
      t tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Jethro clucked to his horse, and drove away. Eben Williams went back
      into his house and sat down with his head in his hands. In about two
      hours, when his wife called him to fetch water, he set down the pail on
      the snow and stared across the next ridge at the eastern horizon,
      whitening after the sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third week in March was the week after town meeting!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-may be&mdash;c-can't tell,&rdquo; repeated Eben to himself, unconsciously
      imitating Jethro's stutter. &ldquo;Godfrey, I'll hev to git that ticket straight
      from Amos.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, we may have our suspicions. But how can we get a bill on this
      evidence? There are some thirty other individuals in Coniston whose
      mortgages Jethro holds, from a horse to a house and farm. It is not likely
      that they will tell Beacon Hatch, or us; that they are going to town
      meeting and vote for that fatherless ticket because Jethro Bass wishes
      them to do so. And Jethro has never said that he wishes them to. If so,
      where are your witnesses? Have we not come back to our starting-point,
      even as Moses Hatch drove around in a circle.. And we have the advantage
      over Moses, for we suspect somebody, and he did not know whom to suspect.
      Certainly not Jethro Bass, the man that lived under his nose and never
      said anything&mdash;and had no right to. Jethro Bass had never taken any
      active part in politics, though some folks had heard, in his rounds on
      business, that he had discussed them, and had spread the news of the
      infamous ticket without a parent. So much was spoken of at the meeting
      over which Priest Ware prayed. It was even declared that, being a
      Democrat, Jethro might have influenced some of those under obligations to
      him. Sam Price was at last fixed upon as the malefactor, though people
      agreed that they had not given him credit for so much sense, and
      Jacksonian principles became as much abhorred by the orthodox as the
      spotted fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can call a host of other witnesses if we like, among them cranky,
      happy-go-lucky Fletcher Bartlett, who has led forlorn hopes in former
      years. Court proceedings make tiresome reading, and if those who have been
      over ours have not arrived at some notion of the simple and innocent
      method of the new Era of politics note dawning&mdash;they never will.
      Nothing proved. But here is part of the ticket which nobody started:&mdash;
    </p>

      The notes are mine, not Moses's. Strange that they didn't occur to Moses.
      What a wealthy man has our hero become at thirty-one! Jethro Bass was rich
      beyond the dreams of avarice&mdash;for Coniston. Truth compels me to admit
      that the sum total of all his mortgages did not amount to nine thousand
      &ldquo;dollars&rdquo;; but that was a large sum of money for Coniston in those days,
      and even now. Nathan Bass had been a saving man, and had left to his son
      one-half of this fortune. If thrift and the ability to gain wealth be
      qualities for a hero, Jethro had them&mdash;in those days.

    <p>
      The Sunday before March meeting, it blew bitter cold, and Priest Ware,
      preaching in mittens, denounced sedition in general. Underneath him, on
      the first landing of the high pulpit, the deacons sat with knitted brows,
      and the key-note from Isaiah Prescott's pitch pipe sounded like mournful
      echo of the mournful wind without.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday was ushered in with that sleet storm to which the almanacs still
      refer, and another scarcely less important event occurred that day which
      we shall have to pass by for the present; on Tuesday, the sleet still
      raging, came the historic town meeting. Deacon Moses Hatch, his chores
      done and his breakfast and prayers completed, fought his way with his head
      down through a white waste to the meeting-house door, and unlocked it, and
      shivered as he made the fire. It was certainly not good election weather,
      thought Moses, and others of the orthodox persuasion, high in office, were
      of the same opinion as they stood with parted coat tails before the stove.
      Whoever had stirred up and organized the hordes, whoever was the author of
      that ticket of the discontented, had not counted upon the sleet.
      Heaven-sent sleet, said Deacon Ira Perkins, and would not speak to his son
      Chester, who sat down just then in one of the rear slips. Chester had
      become an agitator, a Jacksonian Democrat, and an outcast, to be prayed
      for but not spoken to.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall leave them their peace of mind for half an hour more, those
      stanch old deacons and selectmen, who did their duty by their
      fellow-citizens as they saw it and took no man's bidding. They could not
      see the trackless roads over the hills, now becoming tracked, and the bent
      figures driving doggedly against the storm, each impelled by a motive:
      each motive strengthened by a master mind until it had become imperative.
      Some, like Eben Williams behind his rickety horse, came through fear;
      others through ambition; others were actuated by both; and still others
      were stung by the pain of the sleet to a still greater jealousy and envy,
      and the remembrance of those who had been in power. I must not omit the
      conscientious Jacksonians who were misguided enough to believe in such a
      ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sheds were not large enough to hold the teams that day. Jethro's barn
      and tannery were full, and many other barns in the village. And now the
      peace of mind of the orthodox is a thing of the past. Deacon Lysander
      Richardson, the moderator, sits aghast in his high place as they come
      trooping in, men who have not been to town meeting for ten years. Deacon
      Lysander, with his white band of whiskers that goes around his neck like a
      sixteenth-century ruff under his chin, will soon be a memory. Now enters
      one, if Deacon Lysander had known it symbolic of the new Era. One who,
      though his large head is bent, towers over most of the men who make way
      for him in the aisle, nodding but not speaking, and takes his place in the
      chair under the platform on the right of the meeting-pause under one of
      the high, three-part windows. That chair was always his in future years,
      and there he sat afterward, silent, apparently taking no part. But not a
      man dropped a ballot into the box whom Jethro Bass did not see and mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, when the meeting-house is crowded as it has never been before,
      when Jonah Winch has arranged his dinner booth in the corner, Deacon
      Lysander raps for order and the minister prays. They proceed, first, to
      elect a representative to the General Court. The Jacksonians do not
      contest that seat,&mdash;this year,&mdash;and Isaiah Prescott, fourteenth
      child of Timothy, the Stark hero, father of a young Ephraim whom we shall
      hear from later, is elected. And now! Now for a sensation, now for
      disorder and misrule!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; says Deacon Lysander, &ldquo;you will prepare your ballots for the
      choice of the first Selectman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Whigs have theirs written out, Deacon Moses Hatch. But who has written
      out these others that are being so assiduously passed around? Sam Price,
      perhaps, for he is passing them most assiduously. And what name is written
      on them? Fletcher Bartlett, of course; that was on the ticket. Somebody is
      tricked again. That is not the name on the ticket. Look over Sara Price's
      shoulder and you will see the name&mdash;Jethro Bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      It bursts from the lips of Fletcher Bartlett himself&mdash;of Fletcher,
      inflammable as gunpowder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I withdraw as your candidate, and nominate a better and an
      abler man,&mdash;Jethro Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass for Chairman of the Selectmen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cry is taken up all over the meeting-house, and rises high above the
      hiss of the sleet on the great windows. Somebody's got on the stove, to
      add to the confusion and horror. The only man in the whole place who is
      not excited is Jethro Bass himself, who sits in his chair regardless of
      those pressing around him. Many years afterward he confessed to some one
      that he was surprised&mdash;and this is true. Fletcher Bartlett had
      surprised and tricked him, but was forgiven. Forty men are howling at the
      moderator, who is pounding on the table with a blacksmith's blows. Squire
      Asa Northcutt, with his arms fanning like a windmill from the edge of the
      platform, at length shouts down everybody else&mdash;down to a hum. Some
      listen to him: hear the words &ldquo;infamous outrage&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;if Jethro Bass is
      elected Selectman, Coniston will never be able to hold up her head among
      her sister towns for very shame.&rdquo; (Momentary blank, for somebody has got
      on the stove again, a scuffle going on there.) &ldquo;I see it all now,&rdquo; says
      the Squire&mdash;(marvel of perspicacity!) &ldquo;Jethro Bass has debased and
      debauched this town&mdash;&rdquo; (blank again, and the squire points a finger
      of rage and scorn at the unmoved offender in the chair) &ldquo;he has bought and
      intimidated men to do his bidding. He has sinned against heaven, and
      against the spirit of that most immortal of documents&mdash;&rdquo; (Blank
      again. Most unfortunate blank, for this is becoming oratory, but somebody
      from below has seized the squire by the leg.) Squire Northcutt is too
      dignified and elderly a person to descend to rough and tumble, but he did
      get his leg liberated and kicked Fletcher Bartlett in the face. Oh,
      Coniston, that such scenes should take place in your town meeting! By this
      time another is orating, Mr. Sam Price, Jackson Democrat. There was no
      shorthand reporter in Coniston in those days, and it is just as well,
      perhaps, that the accusations and recriminations should sink into
      oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, by mighty efforts of the peace loving in both parties, something
      like order is restored, the ballots are in the box, and Deacon Lysander is
      counting them: not like another moderator I have heard of, who spilled the
      votes on the floor until his own man was elected. No. Had they registered
      his own death sentence, the deacon would have counted them straight, and
      needed no town clerk to verify his figures. But when he came to pronounce
      the vote, shame and sorrow and mortification overcame him. Coniston, his
      native town, which he had served and revered, was dishonored, and it was
      for him, Lysander Richardson, to proclaim her disgrace. The deacon choked,
      and tears of bitterness stood in his eyes, and there came a silence only
      broken by the surging of the sleet as he rapped on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-five votes have been cast for Jethro Bass&mdash;sixty-three for
      Moses Hatch. Necessary for a choice, seventy&mdash;and Jethro Bass is
      elected senior Selectman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon sat down, and men say that a great sob shook him, while
      Jacksonian Democracy went wild&mdash;not looking into future years to see
      what they were going wild about. Jethro Bass Chairman of the Board of
      Selectmen, in the honored place of Deacon Moses Hatch! Bourbon royalists
      never looked with greater abhorrence on the Corsican adventurer and
      usurper of the throne than did the orthodox in Coniston on this tanner,
      who had earned no right to aspire to any distinction, and who by his wiles
      had acquired the highest office in the town government. Fletcher Bartlett
      in, as a leader of the irresponsible opposition, would have been calamity
      enough. But Jethro Bass!
    </p>
    <p>
      This man whom they had despised was the master mind who had organized and
      marshalled the loose vote, was the author of that ticket, who sat in his
      corner unmoved alike by the congratulations of his friends and the
      maledictions of his enemies; who rose to take his oath of office as
      unconcerned as though the house were empty, albeit Deacon Lysander could
      scarcely get the words out. And then Jethro sat down again in his chair&mdash;not
      to leave it for six and thirty years. From this time forth that chair
      became a seat of power, and of dominion over a state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that Jock Hallowell's prophecy, so lightly uttered, came to
      pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the remainder of that Jacksonian ticket was elected, down to the very
      hog-reeves, and amid what turmoil of the Democracy and bitterness of
      spirit of the orthodox, I need not recount. There is no moral to the
      story, alas&mdash;it was one of those things which inscrutable heaven
      permitted to be done. After that dark town-meeting day some of those stern
      old fathers became broken men, and it is said in Coniston that this
      calamity to righteous government, and not the storm, gave to Priest Ware
      his death-stroke.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      And now we must go back for a chapter&mdash;a very short chapter&mdash;to
      the day before that town meeting which had so momentous an influence upon
      the history of Coniston and of the state. That Monday, too, it will be
      remembered, dawned in storm, the sleet hissing in the wide throats of the
      centre-chimneys, and bearing down great boughs of trees until they broke
      in agony. Dusk came early, and howling darkness that hid a muffled figure
      on the ice-bound road staring at the yellow cracks in the tannery door.
      Presently the figure crossed the yard; the door, flying open, released a
      shaft of light that shot across the white ground, revealed a face beneath
      a hood to him who stood within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She darted swiftly past him, seizing the door and drawing it closed after
      her. A lantern hung on the central post and flung its rays upon his face.
      Her own, mercifully, was in the shadow, and burning now with a shame that
      was insupportable. Now that she was there, beside him, her strength failed
      her, and her courage&mdash;courage that she had been storing for this
      dread undertaking throughout the whole of that dreadful day. Now that she
      was there, she would have given her life to have been able to retrace her
      steps, to lose herself in the wild, dark places of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy!&rdquo; His voice betrayed the passion which her presence had quickened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words she would have spoken would not come. She could think of nothing
      but that she was alone with him, and in bodily terror of him. She turned
      to the door again, to grasp the wooden latch; but he barred the way, and
      she fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I did not mean to come. Do you hear?&mdash;let me
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To her amazement he stepped aside&mdash;a most unaccountable action for
      him. More unaccountable still, she did not move, now that she was free,
      but stood poised for flight, held by she knew not what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-go if you've a mind to, Cynthy&mdash;if you've a mind to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've come to say something to you,&rdquo; she faltered. It was not, at all the
      way she had pictured herself as saying it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-haven't took' Moses&mdash;have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do you think I came here to speak of such a thing as
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-haven't took&mdash;Moses, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was trembling, and yet she could almost have smiled at this
      well-remembered trick of pertinacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, and immediately hated herself for answering him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-haven't took that Worthington cuss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was jealous!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't come to discuss Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks say it's only a matter of time,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Made up your mind to
      take him, Cynthy? M-made up your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've no right to talk to me in this way,&rdquo; she said, and added, the
      words seeming to slip of themselves from her lips, &ldquo;Why do you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'm&mdash;interested,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't shown it,&rdquo; she flashed back, forgetting the place, and the
      storm, and her errand even, forgetting that Jake Wheeler, or any one in
      Coniston, might come and surprise her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a step toward her, and she retreated. The light struck her face,
      and he bent over her as though searching it for a sign. The cape on her
      shoulders rose and fell as she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Twahn't charity, Cynthy&mdash;was it? 'Twahn't charity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you who called it such,&rdquo; she answered, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sleet-charged gust hurled itself against the door, and the lantern
      flickered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wahn't it charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was friendship, Jethro. You ought to have known that, and you should
      not have brought back the book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friendship,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;y-you said friendship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-meant friendship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia, but more faintly, and yet with a certain delicious
      fright as she glanced at him shyly. Surely there had never been a stranger
      man! Now he was apparently in a revery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess it's because I'm not good enough to be anything more,&rdquo; he
      remarked suddenly. &ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not tried even to be a friend,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how about Worthington?&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;Just friends with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't talk about Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; cried Cynthia, desperately, and
      retreated toward the lantern again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J-just friends with Worthington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asked, her words barely heard above the gust, &ldquo;why do you want
      to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came after her. It was as if she had summoned some unseen,
      uncontrollable power, only to be appalled by it, and the mountain-storm
      without seemed the symbol of it. His very voice seemed to partake of its
      strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you'd took him, I'd have killed him. Cynthy, I love
      you&mdash;I want you to be my woman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her, struggling wildly, terror-stricken, in his arms, beat down
      her hands, flung back her hood, and kissed her forehead&mdash;her hair,
      blown by the wind&mdash;her lips. In that moment she felt the mystery of
      heaven and hell, of all kinds of power. In that moment she was like a seed
      flying in the storm above the mountain spruces whither, she knew not,
      cared not. There was one thought that drifted across the chaos like a blue
      light of the spirit: Could she control the storm? Could she say whither
      the winds might blow, where the seed might be planted? Then she found
      herself listening, struggling no longer, for he held her powerless.
      Strangest of all, most hopeful of all, his own mind was working, though
      his soul rocked with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy&mdash;ever since we stopped that day on the road in Northcutt's
      woods, I've thought of nothin' but to marry you&mdash;m-marry you. Then
      you give me that book&mdash;I hain't had much education, but it come
      across me if you was to help me that way&mdash;And when I seed you with
      Worthington, I could have killed him easy as breakin' bark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She struggled free and leaped away from him, panting, while he tore open
      his coat and drew forth something which gleamed in the lantern's rays&mdash;a
      silver locket. Cynthia scarcely saw it. Her blood was throbbing in her
      temples, she could not reason, but she knew that the appeal for the sake
      of which she had stooped must be delivered now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you know why I came here&mdash;why I came to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No. W&mdash;wanted me, didn't you? Wanted me&mdash;I
      wanted you, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would never have come to you for that,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L-love me, Cynthy&mdash;love me, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How could he ask, seeing that she had been in his arms, and had not fled?
      And yet she must go through with what she had come to do, at any cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro, I have come to speak to you about the town meeting tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He halted as though he had been struck, his hand tightening over the
      locket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-town meetin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. All this new organization is your doing,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Do you think
      that I am foolish enough to believe that Fletcher Bartlett or Sam Price
      planned this thing? No, Jethro. I know who has done it, and I could have
      told them if they had asked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, and the light of a new admiration was in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knowed it&mdash;did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, a little defiantly, &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how'd you know it&mdash;how'd you know it, Cynthy?&rdquo; How did she know
      it, indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed it,&rdquo; said Cynthia, desperately, &ldquo;knowing you, I guessed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-always thought you was smart, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, did you do this thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th-thought you knowed it&mdash;th-thought you knowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that these men are doing your bidding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't you guessin' a little mite too much; Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you told me just now that&mdash;that you loved me.
      Don't touch me!&rdquo; she cried, when he would have taken her in his arms
      again. &ldquo;If you love me, you will tell me why you have done such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What instinct there was in the man which forbade him speaking out to her,
      I know not. I do believe that he would have confessed, if he could. Isaac
      Worthington had been impelled to reveal his plans and aspirations, but
      Jethro Bass was as powerless in this supreme moment of his life as was
      Coniston Mountain to move the granite on which it stood. Cynthia's heart
      sank, and a note of passionate appeal came into her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jethro!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;this is not the way to use your power, to compel
      men like Eben Williams and Samuel Todd and&mdash;and Lyman Hull, who is a
      drunkard and a vagabond, to come in and vote for those who are not fit to
      hold office.&rdquo; She was using the minister's own arguments. &ldquo;We have always
      had clean men, and honorable and good men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak, but dropped his hands to his sides. His thoughts were
      not to be fathomed, yet Cynthia took the movement for silent confession,&mdash;which
      it was not, and stood appalled at the very magnitude of his
      accomplishment, astonished at the secrecy he had maintained. She had heard
      that his name had been mentioned in the meeting at the house of Moses
      Hatch as having taken part in the matter, and she guessed something of
      certain of his methods. But she had felt his force, and knew that this was
      not the only secret of his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      What might he not aspire to, if properly guided? No, she did not believe
      him to be, unscrupulous&mdash;but merely ignorant: a man who was capable
      of such love as she felt was in him, a man whom she could love, could not
      mean to be unscrupulous. Defence of him leaped to her own lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not know what you were doing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was sure of it, or I
      would not have come to you. Oh, Jethro! you must stop it&mdash;you must
      prevent this election.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes met his, her own pleading, and the very wind without seemed to
      pause for his answer. But what she asked was impossible. That wind which
      he himself had loosed, which was to topple over institutions, was rising,
      and he could no more have stopped it then than he could have hushed the
      storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not do what I ask&mdash;now?&rdquo; she said, very slowly. Then her
      voice failed her, she drew her hands together, and it was as if her heart
      had ceased to beat. Sorrow and anger and fierce shame overwhelmed her, and
      she turned from him in silence and went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy,&rdquo; he cried hoarsely, &ldquo;Cynthy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must never speak to me again,&rdquo; she said, and was gone into the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she had failed. But she did not know that she had left something
      behind which he treasured as long as he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring, when the new leaves were green on the slopes of Coniston,
      Priest Ware ended a life of faithful service. The high pulpit, taken from
      the old meeting house, and the cricket on which he used to stand and the
      Bible from which he used to preach have remained objects of veneration in
      Coniston to this day. A fortnight later many tearful faces gazed after the
      Truro coach as it galloped out of Brampton in a cloud of dust, and one
      there was watching unseen from the spruces on the hill, who saw within it
      a girl dressed in black, dry-eyed, staring from the window.

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Out of the stump of a blasted tree in the Coniston woods a flower will
      sometimes grow, and even so the story which I have now to tell springs
      from the love of Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass. The flower, when it came to
      bloom, was fair in life, and I hope that in these pages it will not lose
      too much of its beauty and sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while we are going to gallop through the years as before we
      have ambled through the days, although the reader's breath may be taken
      away in the process. How Cynthia Ware went over the Truro Pass to Boston,
      and how she became a teacher in a high school there;&mdash;largely through
      the kindness of that Miss Lucretia Penniman of whom we have spoken, who
      wrote in Cynthia's behalf to certain friends she had in that city; how she
      met one William Wetherell, no longer a clerk in Mr. Judson's jewellery
      shop, but a newspaper man with I know not what ambitions&mdash;and
      limitations in strength of body and will; how, many, many years afterward,
      she nursed him tenderly through a sickness and&mdash;married him, is all
      told in a paragraph. Marry him she did, to take care of him, and told him
      so. She made no secret of the maternal in this love.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, the summer after their marriage, they were walking in the
      Mall under the great elms that border the Common on the Tremont Street
      side. They often used to wander there, talking of the books he was to
      write when strength should come and a little leisure, and sometimes their
      glances would linger longingly on Colonnade Row that Bulfinch built across
      the way, where dwelt the rich and powerful of the city&mdash;and yet he
      would not have exchanged their lot for his. Could he have earned with his
      own hands such a house, and sit Cynthia there in glory, what happiness!
      But, I stray.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were walking in the twilight, for the sun had sunk all red in the
      marshes of the Charles, when there chanced along a certain Mr. Judson, a
      jeweller, taking the air likewise. So there came into Wetherell's mind
      that amusing adventure with the country lad and the locket. His name, by
      reason of some strange quality in it, he had never forgotten, and suddenly
      he recalled that the place the countryman had come from was Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; said her husband, when Mr. Judson was gone, &ldquo;did you know any
      one in Coniston named Jethro Bass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him. And, thinking she had not heard, he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo; she said, in a low tone, without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her the story. Not until the end of it did the significance of the
      name engraved come to him&mdash;Cynthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy, from Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it might have been you!&rdquo; he said jestingly. &ldquo;Was he an admirer of
      yours, Cynthia, that strange, uncouth countryman? Did he give you the
      locket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;he never did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell glanced at her in surprise, and saw that her lip was quivering,
      that tears were on her lashes. She laid her hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William,&rdquo; she said, drawing him to a bench, &ldquo;come, let us sit down, and I
      will tell you the story of Jethro Bass. We have been happy together, you
      and I, for I have found peace with you. I have tried to be honest with
      you, William, and I will always be so. I told you before we were married
      that I loved another man. I have tried to forget him, but as God is my
      judge, I cannot. I believe I shall love him until I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat in the summer twilight, until darkness fell, and the lights
      gleamed through the leaves, and a deep, cool breath coming up from the sea
      stirred the leaves above their heads. That she should have loved Jethro
      seemed as strange to her as to him, and yet Wetherell was to feel the
      irresistible force of him. Hers was not a love that she chose, or would
      have chosen, but something elemental that cried out from the man to her,
      and drew her. Something that had in it now, as of yore, much of pain and
      even terror, but drew her. Strangest of all was that William Wetherell
      understood and was not jealous of this thing: which leads us to believe
      that some essence of virility was lacking in him, some substance that
      makes the fighters and conquerors in this world. In such mood he listened
      to the story of Jethro Bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear husband,&rdquo; said Cynthia, when she had finished, her hand
      tightening over his, &ldquo;I have never told you this for fear that it might
      trouble you as it has troubled me. I have found in your love sanctuary;
      and all that remains of myself I have given to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found a weakling to protect, and an invalid to nurse,&rdquo; he
      answered. &ldquo;To have your compassion, Cynthia, is all I crave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they lived through the happiest and swiftest years of his life, working
      side by side, sharing this strange secret between them. And after that
      night Cynthia talked to him often of Coniston, until he came to know the
      mountain that lay along the western sky, and the sweet hillsides by
      Coniston Water under the blue haze of autumn, aye, and clothed in the
      colors of spring, the bright blossoms of thorn and apple against the
      tender green of the woods and fields. So he grew to love the simple people
      there, but little did he foresee that he was to end his life among them!
    </p>
    <p>
      But so it came to pass, she was taken from him, who had been the one joy
      and inspiration of his weary days, and he was driven, wandering, into
      unfrequented streets that he might not recall, the places where she had
      once trod, and through the wakeful nights her voice haunted him,&mdash;its
      laughter, its sweet notes of seriousness; little ways and manners of her
      look came to twist his heart, and he prayed God to take him, too, until it
      seemed that Cynthia frowned upon him for his weakness. One mild Sunday
      afternoon, he took little Cynthia by the hand and led her, toddling, out
      into the sunny Common, where he used to walk with her mother, and the
      infant prattle seemed to bring&mdash;at last a strange peace to his
      storm-tossed soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years these Sunday walks in the Common were Wetherell's greatest
      pleasure and solace, and it seemed as though little Cynthia had come into
      the world with an instinct, as it were, of her mission that lent to her
      infant words a sweet gravity and weight. Many people used to stop and
      speak to the child, among them a great physician whom they grew to know.
      He was, there every Sunday, and at length it came to be a habit with him
      to sit down on the bench and take Cynthia on his knee, and his stern face
      would soften as he talked to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday when Cynthia was eight years old he missed them, and the next,
      and at dusk he strode into their little lodging behind the hill and up to
      the bedside. He glanced at Wetherell, patting Cynthia on the head the
      while, and bade her cheerily to go out of the room. But she held tight
      hold of her father's hand and looked up at the doctor bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am taking care of my father,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you shall, little woman,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I would that we had such
      nurses as you at the hospital. Why didn't you send for me at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless her good sense;&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;she has more than you,
      Wetherell. Why didn't you take her advice? If your father does not do as I
      tell him, he will be a very sick man indeed. He must go into the country
      and stay there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must live, Doctor,&rdquo; said William Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked at Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not live if you stay here,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he will go,&rdquo; said Cynthia, so quietly that he gave her another look,
      strange and tender and comprehending. He, sat and talked of many things:
      of the great war that was agonizing the nation; of the strong man who,
      harassed and suffering himself, was striving to guide it, likening Lincoln
      unto a physician. So the doctor was wont to take the minds of patients
      from themselves. And before he left he gave poor Wetherell a fortnight to
      decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he lay on his back in that room among the chimney tops trying vainly to
      solve the problem of how he was to earn his salt in the country, a visitor
      was climbing the last steep flight of stairs. That visitor was none other
      than Sergeant Ephraim Prescott, son of Isaiah of the pitch-pipe, and own
      cousin of Cynthia Ware's. Sergeant Ephraim was just home from the war and
      still clad in blue, and he walked with a slight limp by reason of a bullet
      he had got in the Wilderness, and he had such an honest, genial face that
      little Cynthia was on his knee in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you, Will? Kind of poorly, I callate. So Cynthy's b'en took,&rdquo; he
      said sadly. &ldquo;Always thought a sight of Cynthy. Little Cynthy favors her
      some. Yes, thought I'd drop in and see how you be on my way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sergeant Ephraim had much to say about the great war, and about Coniston.
      True to the instincts of the blood of the Stark hero, he had left the
      plough and the furrow' at the first call, forty years of age though he
      was. But it had been otherwise with many in Coniston and Brampton and
      Harwich. Some of these, when the drafting came, had fled in bands to the
      mountain and defied capture. Mr. Dudley Worthington, now a mill owner, had
      found a substitute; Heth Sutton of Clovelly had been drafted and had
      driven over the mountain to implore Jethro Bass abjectly to get him out of
      it. In short, many funny things had happened&mdash;funny things to
      Sergeant Ephraim, but not at all to William Wetherell, who sympathized
      with Heth in his panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Jethro Bass has become a great man,&rdquo; said Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great!&rdquo; Ephraim ejaculated. &ldquo;Guess he's the biggest man in the state
      to-day. Queer how he got his power began twenty-four years ago when I
      wahn't but twenty. I call that town meetin' to mind as if 'twas yesterday
      never was such an upset. Jethro's be'n first Selectman ever sense, though
      he turned Republican in '60. Old folks don't fancy Jethro's kind of
      politics much, but times change. Jethro saved my life, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saved your life!&rdquo; exclaimed Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got me a furlough,&rdquo; said Ephraim. &ldquo;Guess I would have died in the
      hospital if he hadn't got it so all-fired quick, and he druv down to
      Brampton to fetch me back. You'd have thought I was General Grant the way
      folks treated me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went back to the war after your leg healed?&rdquo; Wetherell asked, in
      wondering admiration of the man's courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ephraim, simply, &ldquo;the other boys was gettin' full of bullets
      and dysentery, and it didn't seem just right. The leg troubles me some on
      wet days, but not to amount to much. You hain't thinkin' of dyin'
      yourself, be ye, William?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William was thinking very seriously of it, but it was Cynthia who spoke,
      and startled them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor says he will die if he doesn't go to the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somethin' like consumption, William?&rdquo; asked Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the doctor said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I callated,&rdquo; said Ephraim. &ldquo;Come back to Coniston with me; there
      hain't a healthier place in New England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I support myself in Coniston?&rdquo; Wetherell asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim ruminated. Suddenly he stuck his hand into the bosom of his blue
      coat, and his face lighted and even gushed as he drew out a crumpled
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't take much gumption to run a store, does it, William? Guess you
      could run a store, couldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would try anything,&rdquo; said Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ephraim' &ldquo;there's the store at Coniston. With folks goin'
      West, and all that, nobody seems to want it much.&rdquo; He looked at the
      letter. &ldquo;Lem Hallowell' says there hain't nobody to take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jonah Winch's!&rdquo; exclaimed Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jonah made it go, but that was before all this hullabaloo about
      Temperance Cadets and what not. Jonah sold good rum, but now you can't get
      nothin' in Coniston but hard cider and potato whiskey. Still, it's the
      place for somebody without much get-up,&rdquo; and he eyed his cousin by
      marriage. &ldquo;Better come and try it, William.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So much for dreams! Instead of a successor to Irving and Emerson, William
      Wetherell became a successor to Jonah Winch.
    </p>
    <p>
      That journey to Coniston was full of wonder to Cynthia, and of wonder and
      sadness to Wetherell, for it was the way his other Cynthia had come to
      Boston. From the state capital the railroad followed the same deep valley
      as the old coach road, but ended at Truro, and then they took stage over
      Truro Pass for Brampton, where honest Ephraim awaited them and their
      slender luggage with a team. Brampton, with its wide-shadowed green, and
      terrace-steepled church; home once of the Social Library and Lucretia
      Penniman, now famous; home now of Isaac Dudley Worthington, whose great
      mills the stage driver had pointed out to them on Coniston Water as they
      entered the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a drive through the cool evening to Coniston, Ephraim showing
      them landmarks. There was Deacon Lysander's house, where little Rias
      Richardson lived now; and on that slope and hidden in its forest nook,
      among the birches and briers, the little schoolhouse where Cynthia had
      learned to spell; here, where the road made an aisle in the woods, she had
      met Jethro. The choir of the birds was singing an evening anthem now as
      then, to the lower notes of Coniston Water, and the moist, hothouse
      fragrance of the ferns rose from the deep places.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they came suddenly upon the little hamlet of Coniston itself.
      There was the flagpole and the triangular green, scene of many a muster;
      Jonah Winch's store, with its horse block and checker-paned windows, just
      as Jonah had left it; Nathan Bass's tannery shed, now weather-stained and
      neglected, for Jethro lived on Thousand Acre Hill now; the Prescott house,
      home of the Stark hero, where Ephraim lived, &ldquo;innocent of paint&rdquo; (as one
      of Coniston's sons has put it), &ldquo;innocent of paint as a Coniston maiden's
      face&rdquo;; the white meeting-house, where Priest Ware had preached&mdash;and
      the parsonage. Cynthia and Wetherell loitered in front of it, while the
      blue shadow of the mountain deepened into night, until Mr. Satterlee, the
      minister, found them there, and they went in and stood reverently in the
      little chamber on the right of the door, which had been Cynthia's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long Wetherell lay awake that night, in his room at the gable-end over the
      store, listening to the rustling of the great oak beside the windows, to
      the whippoorwills calling across Coniston Water. But at last a peace
      descended upon him, and he slept: yes, and awoke with the same sense of
      peace at little Cynthia's touch, to go out into the cool morning, when the
      mountain side was in myriad sheens of green under the rising sun. Behind
      the store was an old-fashioned garden, set about by a neat stone wall,
      hidden here and there by the masses of lilac and currant bushes, and at
      the south of it was a great rose-covered boulder of granite. And beyond,
      through the foliage of the willows and the low apple trees which Jonah
      Winch had set out, Coniston Water gleamed and tumbled. Under an arching
      elm near the house was the well, stone-rimmed, with its long pole and
      crotch, and bucket all green with the damp moss which clung to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim Prescott had been right when he had declared that it did not take
      much gumption to keep store in Coniston. William Wetherell merely assumed
      certain obligations at the Brampton bank, and Lem Hallowell, Jock's son,
      who now drove the Brampton stage, brought the goods to the door. Little
      Rias Richardson was willing to come in, and help move the barrels, and on
      such occasions wore carpet slippers to save his shoes. William still had
      time for his books; in that Coniston air he began to feel stronger, and to
      wonder whether he might not be a Washington Irving yet. And yet he had one
      worry and one fear, and both of these concerned one man,&mdash;Jethro
      Bass. Him, by her own confession, Cynthia Ware had loved to her dying day,
      hating herself for it: and he, William Wetherell, had married this woman
      whom Jethro had loved so violently, and must always love&mdash;so
      Wetherell thought: that was the worry. How would Jethro treat him? that
      was the fear. William Wetherell was not the most courageous man in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass had not been in Coniston since William's arrival. No need to
      ask where he was. Jake Wheeler, Jethro's lieutenant in Coniston, gave
      William a glowing account of that Throne Room in the Pelican Hotel at the
      capital, from whence Jethro ruled the state during the sessions of the
      General Court. This legislature sat to him as a sort of advisory committee
      of three hundred and fifty: an expensive advisory committee to the people,
      relic of an obsolete form of government. Many stories of the now
      all-powerful Jethro William heard from the little coterie which made their
      headquarters in his store&mdash;stories of how those methods of which we
      have read were gradually spread over other towns and other counties. Not
      that Jethro held mortgages in these towns and counties, but the local
      lieutenants did, and bowed to him as an overlord. There were funny
      stories, and grim stories of vengeance which William Wetherell heard and
      trembled at. Might not Jethro wish to take vengeance upon him?
    </p>
    <p>
      One story he did not hear, because no one in Coniston knew it. No one knew
      that Cynthia Ware and Jethro Bass had ever loved each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, toward the end of June, it was noised about that the great man
      was coming home for a few days. One beautiful afternoon William Wetherell
      stood on the platform of the store, looking off at Coniston, talking to
      Moses Hatch&mdash;young Moses, who is father of six children now and has
      forgotten Cynthia Ware. Old Moses sleeps on the hillside, let us hope in
      the peace of the orthodox and the righteous. A cloud of dust arose above
      the road to the southward, and out of it came a country wagon drawn by a
      fat horse, and in the wagon the strangest couple Wetherell had ever seen.
      The little woman who sat retiringly at one end of the seat was all in
      brilliant colors from bonnet to flounce, like a paroquet, red and green
      predominating. The man, big in build, large-headed, wore an old-fashioned
      blue swallow-tailed coat with brass buttons, a stock, and coonskin hat,
      though it was summer, and the thumping of William Wetherell's heart told
      him that this was Jethro Bass. He nodded briefly at Moses Hatch, who
      greeted him with genial obsequiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Legislatur' through?&rdquo; shouted Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great man shook his head and drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Jethro Bass ever been a member of the Legislature?&rdquo; asked the
      storekeeper, for the sake of something to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never would take any office but Chairman of the Selectmen,&rdquo; answered
      Moses, who apparently bore no ill will for his father's sake. &ldquo;Jethro kind
      of fathers the Legislatur', I guess, though I don't take much stock in
      politics. Goes down sessions to see that they don't get too gumptious and
      kick off the swaddlin' clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;was that his wife?&rdquo; Wetherell asked, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Listy, they call her. Nobody ever knew how he come to marry her.
      Jethro went up to Wisdom once, in the centre of the state, and come back
      with her. Funny place to bring a wife from&mdash;Wisdom! Funnier place to
      bring Listy from. He loads her down with them ribbons and gewgaws&mdash;all
      the shades of the rainbow! Says he wants her to be the best-dressed woman
      in the state. Callate she is,&rdquo; added Moses, with conviction. &ldquo;Listy's a
      fine woman, but all she knows is enough to say, 'Yes, Jethro,' and 'No,
      Jethro.'&mdash;Guess that's all Jethro wants in a wife; but he certainly
      is good to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why has he come back before the Legislature's over?&rdquo; said Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cuttin' of his farms. Always comes back hayin' time. That's the way
      Jethro spends the money he makes in politics, and he hain't no more of a
      farmer than&mdash;&rdquo; Moses looked at Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than I'm a storekeeper,&rdquo; said the latter, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than I'm a lawyer,&rdquo; said Moses, politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted at this moment by the appearance of Jake Wheeler and
      Sam Price, who came gaping out of the darkness of the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that Jethro, Mose?&rdquo; demanded Jake. &ldquo;Guess we'll go along up and see
      if there's any orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the humblest of God's critturs has their uses,&rdquo; Moses remarked
      contemplatively, as he watched the retreating figures of Sam and Jake.
      &ldquo;Leastwise that's Jethro's philosophy. When you come to know him, you'll
      notice how much those fellers walk like him. Never seed a man who had so
      many imitators. Some of,'em's took to talkie' like him, even to
      stutterin'. Bijah Bixby, over to Clovelly, comes pretty nigh it, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moses loaded his sugar and beans into his wagon, and drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      An air of suppressed excitement seemed to pervade those who came that
      afternoon to the store to trade and talk&mdash;mostly to talk. After such
      purchases as they could remember were made, they lingered on the barrels
      and on the stoop, in the hope of seeing Jethro, whose habit; it was,
      apparently, to come down and dispense such news as he thought fit for
      circulation. That Wetherell shared this excitement, too, he could not
      deny, but for a different cause. At last, when the shadows of the big
      trees had crept across the green, he came, the customers flocking to the
      porch to greet him, Wetherell standing curiously behind them in the door.
      Heedless of the dust, he strode down the road with the awkward gait that
      was all his own, kicking up his heels behind. And behind him, heels
      kicking up likewise, followed Jake and Sam, Jethro apparently oblivious of
      their presence. A modest silence was maintained from the stoop, broken at
      length by Lem Hallowell, who (men said) was an exact reproduction of Jock,
      the meeting-house builder. Lem alone was not abashed in the presence of
      greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you, Jethro?&rdquo; he said heartily. &ldquo;Air the Legislatur' behavin'
      themselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-bout as common,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely nothing very profound in this remark, but received as though it
      were Solomon's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be prepared for a change in Jethro, after the galloping years. He is now
      fifty-seven, but he might be any age. He is still smooth-shaven, his skin
      is clear, and his eye is bright, for he lives largely on bread and milk,
      and eschews stimulants. But the lines in his face have deepened and his
      big features seem to have grown bigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who be you thinkin' of for next governor, Jethro?&rdquo; queries Rias
      Richardson, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say Alvy Hopkins of Gosport is willin' to pay for it,&rdquo; said Chester
      Perkins, sarcastically. Chester; we fear, is a born agitator, fated to
      remain always in opposition. He is still a Democrat, and Jethro, as is
      well known, has extended the mortgage so as to include Chester's farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't give a Red Brook Seedling for Alvy,&rdquo; ejaculated the nasal Mr.
      Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't like Red Brook Seedlings, Sam? D-don't like 'em?&rdquo; said Jethro. He
      had parted his blue coat tails and seated himself on the stoop, his long
      legs hanging over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never seed a man who had a good word to say for 'em,&rdquo; said Mr. Price,
      with less conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done well on mine,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;d-done well. I was satisfied with my
      Red Brook Seedlings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price's sallow face looked as if he would have contradicted another
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was that, Jethro?&rdquo; piped up Jake Wheeler, voicing the general desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro looked off into the blue space beyond the mountain line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-got mine when they first come round&mdash;seed cost me considerable.
      Raised more than a hundred bushels L-Listy put some of 'em on the table&mdash;t-then
      gave some to my old hoss Tom. Tom said: 'Hain't I always been a good
      beast, Jethro? Hain't I carried you faithful, summer and winter, for a
      good many years? And now you give me Red Brook Seedlings?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here everybody laughed, and stopped abruptly, for Jethro still looked
      contemplative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give some of 'em to the hogs. W-wouldn't touch 'em. H-had over a hundred
      bushels on hand&mdash;n-new variety. W-what's that feller's name down to
      Ayer, Massachusetts, deals in all kinds of seeds? Ellett&mdash;that's it.
      Wrote to Ellet, said I had a hundred bushels of Red Brooks to sell, as
      fine a lookin' potato as I had in my cellar. Made up my mind to take what
      he offered, if it was only five cents. He wrote back a dollar a bushel.
      I-I was always satisfied with my Red Brook Seedlings, Sam. But I never
      raised any more&mdash;n-never raised any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Uproarious laughter greeted the end of this story, and continued in fits
      as some humorous point recurred to one or the other of the listeners.
      William Wetherell perceived that the conversation, for the moment at
      least, was safely away from politics, and in that dubious state where it
      was difficult to reopen. This was perhaps what Jethro wanted. Even Jake
      Wheeler was tongue-tied, and Jethro appeared to be lost in reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant a diversion occurred&mdash;a trifling diversion, so it
      seemed at the time. Around the corner of the store, her cheeks flushed and
      her dark hair flying, ran little Cynthia, her hands, browned already by
      the Coniston sun, filled with wild strawberries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what I've found, Daddy!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;see what I've found!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass started, and flung back his head like a man who has heard a
      voice from another world, and then he looked at the child with a kind of
      stupefaction. The cry, died on Cynthia's lips, and she stopped, gazing up
      at him with wonder in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-found strawberries?&rdquo; said Jethro, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered. She was very grave and serious now, as was her manner
      in dealing with people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-show 'em to me,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia went to him, without embarrassment, and put her hand on his knee.
      Not once had he taken his eyes from her face. He put out his own hand with
      an awkward, shy movement, picked a strawberry from her fingers, and thrust
      it in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; said Jethro, gravely. &ldquo;Er&mdash;what's your name, little gal&mdash;what's
      your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;Cynthia?&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;Cynthia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er-er, Cynthia&mdash;not Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over her and lowered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-may I call you Cynthy&mdash;Cynthy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, looking up to her father and then glancing
      shyly at Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were on the mountain, and he seemed to have forgotten her until
      she reached out to him, timidly, another strawberry. He seized her little
      hand instead and held it between his own&mdash;much to the astonishment of
      his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose little gal be you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's Will Wetherell's daughter,&rdquo; said Lem Hallowell. &ldquo;He's took on the
      store. Will,&rdquo; he added, turning to Wetherell, &ldquo;let me make you acquainted
      with Jethro Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro rose slowly, and towered above Wetherell on the stoop. There was an
      inscrutable look in his black eyes, as of one who sees without being seen.
      Did he know who William Wetherell was? If so, he gave no sign, and took
      Wetherell's hand limply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will's kinder hipped on book-l'arnin',&rdquo; Lemuel continued kindly. &ldquo;Come
      here to keep store for his health. Guess you may have heerd, Jethro, that
      Will married Cynthy Ware. You call Cynthy to mind, don't ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass dropped Wetherell's hand, but answered nothing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week passed, and Jethro did not appear in the village, report having it
      that he was cutting his farms on Thousand Acre Hill. When Jethro was
      farming,&mdash;so it was said,&mdash;he would not stop to talk politics
      even with the President of the United States were that dignitary to lean
      over his pasture fence and beckon to him. On a sultry Friday morning, when
      William Wetherell was seated at Jonah Winch's desk in the cool recesses of
      the store slowly and painfully going over certain troublesome accounts
      which seemed hopeless, he was thrown into a panic by the sight of one
      staring at him from the far side of a counter. History sometimes reverses
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for you&mdash;Mr. Bass?&rdquo; asked the storekeeper, rather
      weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just stepped in&mdash;stepped in,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;W-where's Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was in the garden&mdash;shall I get her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, parting his coat tails and seating himself on the counter.
      &ldquo;Go on figurin', don't mind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thing was manifestly impossible. Perhaps Wetherell indicated as much
      by his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like storekeepin'?&rdquo; Jethro asked presently, perceiving that he did not
      continue his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man must live, Mr. Bass,&rdquo; said Wetherell; &ldquo;I had to leave the city for
      my health. I began life keeping store,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but I little thought I
      should end it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given to book-l'arnin' then, wahn't you?&rdquo; Jethro remarked. He did not
      smile, but stared at the square of light that was the doorway, &ldquo;Judson's
      jewellery store, wahn't it? Judson's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Judson's,&rdquo; Wetherell answered, as soon as he recovered from his
      amazement. There was no telling from Jethro's manner whether he were enemy
      or friend; whether he bore the storekeeper a grudge for having attained to
      a happiness that had not been his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't made a great deal out of life, hev you? N-not a great deal?&rdquo;
       Jethro observed at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell flushed, although Jethro had merely stated a truth which had
      often occurred to the storekeeper himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't given to all of us to find Rome in brick and leave it in
      marble,&rdquo; he replied a little sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass looked at him quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er-what's that?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;F-found Rome in brick, left it in marble.
      Fine thought.&rdquo; He ruminated a little. &ldquo;Never writ anything&mdash;did you&mdash;never
      writ anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing worth publishing,&rdquo; answered poor William Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J-just dreamed'&mdash;dreamed and kept store. S&mdash;something to have
      dreamed&mdash;eh&mdash;something to have dreamed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell forgot his uneasiness in the unexpected turn the conversation
      had taken. It seemed very strange to him that he was at last face to face
      again wish the man whom Cynthia Ware had never been able to drive from her
      heart. Would, he mention her? Had he continued to love her, in spite of
      the woman he had married and adorned? Wetherell asked himself these
      questions before he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more to have accomplished,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-something to have dreamed,&rdquo; repeated Jethro, rising slowly from the
      counter. He went toward the doorway that led into the garden, and there he
      halted and stood listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-Cynthy!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;C-Cynthy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell dropped his pen at the sound of the name on Jethro's lips. But
      it was little Cynthia he was calling little Cynthia in the garden. The
      child came at his voice, and stood looking up at him silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how old be you, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L-like the country, Cynthy&mdash;like the country better than the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And country folks? L&mdash;like country folks better than city folks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know many city folks,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;I liked the old doctor who
      sent Daddy up here ever so much, and I liked Mrs. Darwin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mis' Darwin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She kept the house we lived in. She used to give me cookies,&rdquo; said
      Cynthia, &ldquo;and bread to feed the pigeons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pigeons? F-folks keep pigeons in the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Cynthia, laughing at such an idea; &ldquo;the pigeons came on the
      roof under our window, and they used to fly right up on the window-sill
      and feed out of my hand. They kept me company while Daddy, was away,
      working. On Sundays we used to go into the Common and feed them, before
      Daddy got sick. The Common was something like the country, only not half
      as nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-couldn't pick flowers in the Common and go barefoot&mdash;e&mdash;couldn't
      go barefoot, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Cynthia, laughing again at his sober face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-couldn't dig up the Common and plant flowers&mdash;could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you couldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P-plant 'em out there?&rdquo; asked Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; cried Cynthia; &ldquo;I'll show you.&rdquo; She hesitated a moment, and
      then thrust her hand into his. &ldquo;Do you want to see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I do,&rdquo; said he, energetically, and she led him into the garden,
      pointing out with pride the rows of sweet peas and pansies, which she had
      made herself. Impelled by a strange curiosity, William Wetherell went to
      the door and watched them. There was a look on the face of Jethro Bass
      that was new to it as he listened to the child talk of the wondrous things
      around them that summer's day,&mdash;the flowers and the bees and the
      brook (they must go down and stand on the brink of it), and the songs of
      the vireo and the hermit thrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't lonely here, Cynthy&mdash;hain't lonely here?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the country,&rdquo; said Cynthia. Suddenly she lifted her eyes to his
      with a questioning look. &ldquo;Are you lonely, sometimes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not with you, Cynthy&mdash;not with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By all of which it will be seen that the acquaintance was progressing.
      They sat down for a while on the old millstone that formed the step, and
      there discussed Cynthia's tastes. She was too old for dolls, Jethro
      supposed. Yes, Cynthia was too old for dolls. She did not say so, but the
      only doll she had ever owned had become insipid when the delight of such a
      reality as taking care of a helpless father had been thrust upon her.
      Books, suggested Jethro. Books she had known from her earliest infancy:
      they had been piled around that bedroom over the roof. Books and book lore
      and the command of the English tongue were William Wetherell's only
      legacies to his daughter, and many an evening that spring she had read him
      to sleep from classic volumes of prose and poetry I hesitate to name, for
      fear you will think her precocious. They went across the green to Cousin
      Ephraim Prescott's harness shop, where Jethro had tied his horse, and it
      was settled that Cynthia liked books.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning following this extraordinary conversation, Jethro Bass and
      his wife departed for the state capital. Listy was bedecked in amazing
      greens and yellows, and Jethro drove, looking neither to the right nor
      left, his coat tails hanging down behind the seat, the reins lying slack
      across the plump quarters of his horse&mdash;the same fat Tom who, by the
      way, had so indignantly spurned the Iced Brook Seedlings. And Jake Wheeler
      went along to bring back the team from Brampton. To such base uses are
      political lieutenants sometimes put, although fate would have told you it
      was an honor, and he came back to the store that evening fairly bristling
      with political secrets which he could not be induced to impart.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening a fortnight later, while the lieutenant was holding forth in
      commendably general terms on the politics of the state to a speechless if
      not wholly admiring audience, a bomb burst in their midst. William
      Wetherell did not know that it was a periodical bomb, like those flung at
      regular intervals from the Union mortars into Vicksburg. These bombs, at
      any rate, never failed to cause consternation and fright in Coniston,
      although they never did any harm. One thing noticeable, they were always
      fired in Jethro's absence. And the bombardier was always Chester Perkins,
      son of the most unbending and rigorous of tithing-men, but Chester
      resembled his father in no particular save that he, too, was a deacon and
      a pillar of the church. Deacon Ira had been tall and gaunt and sunken and
      uncommunicative. Chester was stout, and said to perspire even in winter,
      apoplectic, irascible, talkative, and still, as has been said, a Democrat.
      He drove up to the store this evening to the not inappropriate rumble of
      distant thunder, and he stood up in his wagon in front of the gathering
      and shook his fist in Jake Wheeler's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This town's tired of puttin' up with a King,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Yes, King-=I
      said it, and I don't care who hears me. It's time to stop this one-man
      rule. You kin go and tell him I said it, Jake Wheeler, if you've a mind
      to. I guess there's plenty who'll do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An uneasy silence followed&mdash;the silence which cries treason louder
      than any voice. Some shifted uneasily, and spat, and Jake Wheeler thrust
      his hands in his pockets and walked away, as much as to say that it was
      treason even to listen to such talk. Lem Hallowell seemed unperturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the rampage agin, Chet?&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd ought to know better, Lem,&rdquo; cried the enraged Chester; &ldquo;hain't the
      hull road by the Four Corners ready to drop into the brook? What be you
      a-goin' to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll show you when I git to it,&rdquo; answered Lem, quietly. And, show them he
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git to it!&rdquo; shouted Chester, scornfully, &ldquo;I'll git to it. I'll tell you
      right now I'm a candidate for the Chairman of the Selectmen, if town
      meetin' is eight months away. An', Sam Price, I'll expect the Democrats to
      git into line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this ultimatum Chester drove away as rapidly as he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; said Sam Price, an exclamation peculiarly suited to his
      voice. But nevertheless Sam might be counted on in each of these little
      rebellions. He, too, had remained steadfast to Jacksonian principles, and
      he had never forgiven Jethro about a little matter of a state office which
      he (Sam) had failed to obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he went to bed Jake Wheeler had written a letter which he sent off
      to the state capital by the stage the next morning. In it he indicted no
      less than twenty of his fellow-townsmen for treason; and he also thought
      it wise to send over to Clovelly for Bijah Bixby, a lieutenant in that
      section, to come and look over the ground and ascertain by his well-known
      methods how far the treason had eaten into the body politic. Such was
      Jake's ordinary procedure when the bombs were fired, for Mr. Wheeler was
      nothing if not cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three mornings later, a little after seven o'clock, when the storekeeper
      and his small daughter were preparing to go to Brampton upon a very
      troublesome errand, Chester Perkins appeared again. It is always easy to
      stir up dissatisfaction among the ne'er-do-wells (Jethro had once done it
      himself), and during the three days which had elapsed since Chester had
      flung down the gauntlet there had been more or less of downright treason
      heard in the store. William Wetherell, who had perplexities of his own,
      had done his best to keep out of the discussions that had raged on his
      cracker boxes and barrels, for his head was a jumble of figures which
      would not come right. And now as he stood there in the freshness of the
      early summer morning, waiting for Lem Hallowell's stage, poor Wetherell's
      heart was very heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will Wetherell,&rdquo; said Chester, &ldquo;you be a gentleman and a student, hain't
      you? Read history, hain't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read some,&rdquo; said William Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I callate that a man of parts,&rdquo; said Chester, &ldquo;such as you be, will help
      us agin corruption and a dictator. I'm a-countin' on you, Will Wetherell.
      You've got the store, and you kin tell the boys the difference between
      right and wrong. They'll listen to you, because you're eddicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about politics,&rdquo; answered Wetherell, with an
      appealing glance at the silent group,&mdash;group that was always there.
      Rias Richardson, who had donned the carpet slippers preparatory to tending
      store for the day, shuffled inside. Deacon Lysander, his father, would not
      have done so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know somethin' about history and the Constitootion, don't ye?&rdquo;
       demanded Chester, truculently. &ldquo;N'Jethro Bass don't hold your mortgage,
      does he? Bank in Brampton holds it&mdash;hain't that so? You hain't afeard
      of Jethro like the rest on 'em, be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what right you have to talk to me that way, Mr. Perkins,&rdquo;
       said Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right? Jethro holds my mortgage&mdash;the hull town knows it-and he
      kin close me out to-morrow if he's a mind to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Chester Perkins,&rdquo; Lem Hallowell interposed, as he drove up with
      the stage, &ldquo;what kind of free principles be you preachin'? You'd ought to
      know better'n coerce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What be you a-goin' to do about that Four Corners road?&rdquo; Chester cried to
      the stage driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give 'em till to-morrow night to fix it,&rdquo; said Lem. &ldquo;Git in, Will.
      Cynthy's over to the harness shop with Eph. We'll stop as we go 'long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give 'em till to-morrow night!&rdquo; Chester shouted after them. &ldquo;What you
      goin' to do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lem did not answer this inquiry. He stopped at the harness shop, where
      Ephraim came limping out and lifted Cynthia to the seat beside her father,
      and they joggled off to Brampton. The dew still lay in myriad drops on the
      red herd's-grass, turning it to lavender in the morning sun, and the heavy
      scent of the wet ferns hung in the forest. Lem whistled, and joked with
      little Cynthia, and gave her the reins to drive, and of last they came in
      sight of Brampton Street, with its terrace-steepled church and line of
      wagons hitched to the common rail, for it was market day. Father and
      daughter walked up and down, hand in hand, under the great trees, and then
      they went to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a brick building on a corner opposite the common, imposing for
      Brampton, and very imposing to Wetherell. It seemed like a tomb as he
      entered its door, Cynthia clutching his fingers, and never but once in his
      life had he been so near to leaving all hope behind. He waited patiently
      by the barred windows until the clerk, who was counting bills, chose to
      look up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to draw money?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words seemed charged with irony. William Wetherell told him,
      falteringly, his name and business, and he thought the man looked at him
      compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to see Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he hasn't gone to the
      mills yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dudley Worthington?&rdquo; exclaimed Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The teller smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He's the president of this bank.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened a door in the partition, and leaving Cynthia dangling her feet
      from a chair, Wetherell was ushered, not without trepidation, into the
      great man's office, and found himself at last in the presence of Mr. Isaac
      D. Worthington, who used to wander up and down Coniston Water searching
      for a mill site.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat behind a table covered with green leather, on which papers were
      laid with elaborate neatness, and he wore a double-breasted skirted coat
      of black, with braided lapels, a dark purple blanket cravat with a large
      red cameo pin. And Mr. Worthington's features harmonized perfectly with
      this costume&mdash;those of a successful, ambitious man who followed
      custom and convention blindly; clean-shaven, save for reddish chops, blue
      eyes of extreme keenness, and thin-upped mouth which had been tightening
      year by year as the output of the Worthington Minx increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he said sharply, &ldquo;what can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am William Wetherell, the storekeeper at Coniston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the Wetherell who married Cynthia Ware!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, Mr. Worthington did not say that. He did not know that Cynthia Ware
      was married, or alive or dead, and&mdash;let it be confessed at once&mdash;he
      did not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what he did say:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wetherell&mdash;Wetherell. Oh, yes, you've come about that note&mdash;the
      mortgage on the store at Coniston.&rdquo; He stared at William Wetherell,
      drummed with his fingers on the table, and smiled slightly. &ldquo;I am happy to
      say that the Brampton Bank does not own this note any longer. If we did,&mdash;merely
      as a matter of business, you understand&rdquo; (he coughed),&mdash;&ldquo;we should
      have had to foreclose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't own the note!&rdquo; exclaimed Wetherell. &ldquo;Who does own it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sold it a little while ago&mdash;since you asked for the extension&mdash;to
      Jethro Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass!&rdquo; Wetherell's feet seemed to give way under him, and he sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass is a little quixotic&mdash;that is a charitable way to put it&mdash;quixotic.
      He does&mdash;strange things like this once in awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The storekeeper found no words to answer, but sat mutely staring at him.
      Mr. Worthington coughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear to be an educated man. Haven't I heard some story of your
      giving up other pursuits in Boston to come up here for your health?
      Certainly I place you now. I confess to a little interest in literature
      myself&mdash;in libraries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his stupefaction at the news he had just received, Wetherell
      thought of Mr. Worthington's beaver hat, and of that gentleman's first
      interest in libraries, for Cynthia had told the story to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perhaps an open secret,&rdquo; continued Mr. Worthington, &ldquo;that in the
      near future I intend to establish a free library in Brampton. I feel it my
      duty to do all I can for the town where I have made my success, and there
      is nothing which induces more to the popular welfare than a good library.&rdquo;
       Whereupon he shot at Wetherell another of his keen looks. &ldquo;I do not talk
      this way ordinarily to my customers, Mr. Wetherell,&rdquo; he began; &ldquo;but you
      interest me, and I am going to tell you something in confidence. I am sure
      it will not be betrayed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the bewildered storekeeper, who was in no condition to
      listen to confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went quietly to the door, opened it, looked out, and closed it softly.
      Then he looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a care of this man Bass,&rdquo; he said, in a lower voice. &ldquo;He began many
      years ago by debauching the liberties of that little town of Coniston, and
      since then he has gradually debauched the whole state, judges and all. If
      I have a case to try&rdquo; (he spoke now with more intensity and bitterness),
      &ldquo;concerning my mills, or my bank, before I get through I find that rascal
      mixed up in it somewhere, and unless I arrange matters with him, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused abruptly, his eyes going out of the window, pointing with a long
      finger at a grizzled man crossing the street with a yellow and red horse
      blanket thrown over his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That man, Judge Baker, holding court in this town now, Bass owns body and
      soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the horse blanket?&rdquo; Wetherell queried, irresistibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dudley Worthington did not smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my advice, Mr. Wetherell, and pay off that note somehow.&rdquo; An odor of
      the stable pervaded the room, and a great unkempt grizzled head and
      shoulders, horse blanket and all, were stuck into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mornin', Dudley,&rdquo; said the head, &ldquo;busy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right in, Judge,&rdquo; answered Mr. Worthington. &ldquo;Never too busy to see
      you.&rdquo; The head disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take my advice, Mr. Wetherell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the storekeeper went into the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments he stood dazed by what he had heard, the query ringing in
      his head: Why had Jethro Bass bought that note? Did he think that the
      storekeeper at Coniston would be of use to him, politically? The words
      Chester Perkins had spoken that morning came back to Wetherell as he stood
      in the door. And how was he to meet Jethro Bass again with no money to pay
      even the interest on the note? Then suddenly he missed Cynthia, hurried
      out, and spied her under the trees on the common so deep in conversation
      with a boy that she did not perceive him until he spoke to her. The boy
      looked up, smiling frankly at something Cynthia had said to him. He had
      honest, humorous eyes, and a browned, freckled face, and was, perhaps, two
      years older than Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; said Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's face was flushed, and she was plainly vexed about something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave her a whistle,&rdquo; said the boy, with a little laugh of vexation,
      &ldquo;and now she says she won't take it because I owned up I made it for
      another girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia held it out to him, not deigning to appeal her ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take it back,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want you to have it,&rdquo; said the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't be right for me to take it when you made it for somebody
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After all, people with consciences are born, not made. But this was a
      finer distinction that the boy had ever met with in his experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know you when I made the whistle,&rdquo; he objected, puzzled and
      downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't make any difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you better than the other girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to,&rdquo; retorted the casuist; &ldquo;you've known her longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't make any difference,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;there are lots of
      people I don't like I have always known. This girl doesn't live in
      Brampton, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo; demanded Cynthia,&mdash;which was a step backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the state capital. Her name's Janet Duncan. There, do you believe me
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell had heard of Janet Duncan's father, Alexander Duncan,
      who had the reputation of being the richest man in the state. And he began
      to wonder who the boy could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said Cynthia; &ldquo;but as long as you made it for her, it's
      hers. Will you take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, determinedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered Cynthia. She laid down the whistle beside him on the
      rail, and went off a little distance and seated herself on a bench. The
      boy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that girl,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;the rest of 'em take everything I give
      'em, and ask for more. She's prettier'n any of 'em, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; Wetherell asked him, curiously, forgetting his own
      troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob Worthington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the son of Dudley Worthington&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody asks me that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I'm tired of it. When I grow up,
      they'll have to stop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you should be proud of your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am proud of him, everybody's proud of him, Brampton's proud of him&mdash;he's
      proud of himself. That's enough, ain't it?&rdquo; He eyed Wetherell somewhat
      defiantly, then his glance wandered to Cynthia, and he walked over to her.
      He threw himself down on the grass in front of her, and lay looking up at
      her solemnly. For a while she continued to stare inflexibly at the line of
      market wagons, and then she burst into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought you wouldn't hold out forever,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's because you're so foolish,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;that's why I laughed.&rdquo;
       Then she grew sober again and held out her hand to him. &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go back to my father. I&mdash;I think he doesn't feel very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next time I'll make a whistle for you,&rdquo; he called after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And give it to somebody else,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hold of her father's hand by that, but he caught up with her, very
      red in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that isn't true,&rdquo; he cried angrily, and taking his way across
      Brampton Street, turned, and stood staring after them until they were out
      of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like him, Daddy?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell did not answer. He had other things to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your trouble feel any better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some, Cynthia. But you mustn't think about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy, why don't you ask Uncle Jethro to help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the name Wetherell started as if he had had a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What put him into your head, Cynthia?&rdquo; he asked sharply. &ldquo;Why do you call
      him 'Uncle Jethro'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he asked me to. Because he likes me, and I like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The whole thing was a riddle he could not solve&mdash;one that was best
      left alone. They had agreed to walk back the ten miles to Coniston, to
      save the money that dinner at the hotel would cost. And so they started,
      Cynthia flitting hither and thither along the roadside, picking the
      stately purple iris flowers in the marshy places, while Wetherell
      pondered.

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      When William Wetherell and Cynthia had reached the last turn in the road
      in Northcutt's woods, quarter of a mile from Coniston, they met the nasal
      Mr. Samuel Price driving silently in the other direction. The word
      &ldquo;silently&rdquo; is used deliberately, because to Mr. Price appertained a
      certain ghostlike quality of flitting, and to Mr. Price's horse and wagon
      likewise. He drew up for a brief moment when he saw Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't hurry back if I was you, Will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price leaned out of the wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bije has come over from Clovelly to spy around a little mite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was evident from Mr. Price's manner that he regarded the storekeeper as
      a member of the reform party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say, Daddy?&rdquo; asked Cynthia, as Wetherell stood staring after
      the flitting buggy in bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't the faintest idea, Cynthia,&rdquo; answered her father, and they
      walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know who 'Bije' is?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;and I don't care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was almost criminal ignorance for a man who lived in that part of the
      country not to know Bijah Bixby of Clovelly, who was paying a little
      social visit to Coniston that day on his way home from the state capital,&mdash;tending,
      as it were, Jethro's flock. Still, Wetherell must be excused because he
      was an impractical literary man with troubles of his own. But how shall we
      chronicle Bijah's rank and precedence in the Jethro army, in which there
      are neither shoulder-straps nor annual registers? To designate him as the
      Chamberlain of that hill Rajah, the Honorable Heth Sutton, would not be
      far out of the way. The Honorable Heth, whom we all know and whom we shall
      see presently, is the man of substance and of broad acres in Clovelly:
      Bijah merely owns certain mortgages in that town, but he had created the
      Honorable Heth (politically) as surely as certain prime ministers we could
      name have created their sovereigns. The Honorable Heth was Bijah's
      creation, and a grand creation he was, as no one will doubt when they see
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bijah&mdash;as he will not hesitate to tell you&mdash;took Heth down in
      his pocket to the Legislature, and has more than once delivered him, in
      certain blocks of five and ten, and four and twenty, for certain
      considerations. The ancient Song of Sixpence applies to Bijah, but his
      pocket was generally full of proxies instead of rye, and the Honorable
      Heth was frequently one of the four and twenty blackbirds. In short, Bijah
      was the working bee, and the Honorable Heth the ornamental drone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know why I have dwelt so long on such a minor character as Bijah,
      except that the man fascinates me. Of all the lieutenants in the state,
      his manners bore the closest resemblance to those of Jethro Bass. When he
      walked behind Jethro in the corridors of the Pelican, kicking up his heels
      behind, he might have been taken for Jethro's shadow. He was of a good
      height and size, smooth-shaven, with little eyes that kindled, and his
      mouth moved not at all when he spoke: unlike Jethro, he &ldquo;used&rdquo; tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Bijah had driven into Coniston village and hitched his wagon to the
      rail, he went direct to the store. Chester Perkins and others were
      watching him with various emotions from the stoop, and Bijah took a seat
      in the midst of them, characteristically engaging in conversation without
      the usual conventional forms of greeting, as if he had been there all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how much did you git for your wool, Chester&mdash;h-how much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you hain't here to talk about wool, Bije,&rdquo; said Chester, red with
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of neglectin' the farm lately, I hear,&rdquo; observed Bijah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass sent you up to find out how much I was neglectin' it,&rdquo;
       retorted Chester, throwing all caution to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinkin' of upsettin' Jethro, be you? Thinkin' of upsettin' Jethro?&rdquo;
       remarked Bije, in a genial tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks in Clovelly hain't got nothin' to do with it, if I am,&rdquo; said
      Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leetle early for campaignin', Chester, leetle early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do our campaignin' when we're a mind to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bijah looked around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's funny. I could have took oath I seed Rias Richardson here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a deep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Sam Price,&rdquo; continued Bijah, in pretended astonishment, &ldquo;wahn't he
      settin' on the edge of the stoop when I drove up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another silence, broken only by the enraged breathing of Chester, who was
      unable to retort. Moses Hatch laughed. The discreet departure of these
      gentlemen certainly had its comical side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rias as indoostrious as ever, Mose?&rdquo; inquired Bijah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has his busy times,&rdquo; said Mose, grinning broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you've got the boys with their backs up, Chester,&rdquo; said Bijah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of us are sick of tyranny,&rdquo; cried Chester; &ldquo;you kin tell that to
      Jethro Bass when you go back, if he's got time to listen to you buyin' and
      sellin' out of railroads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear Jethro's got the Grand Gulf Road in his pocket to do as he's a mind
      to with,&rdquo; said Moses, with a view to drawing Bijah out. But the remark had
      exactly the opposite effect, Bijah screwing up his face into an expression
      of extraordinary secrecy and cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did you git out of it, Bije?&rdquo; demanded Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't looked through my clothes yet,&rdquo; said Bijah, his face screwed up
      tighter than ever. &ldquo;N-never look through my clothes till I git home,
      Chester, it hain't safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It has become painfully evident that Mr. Bixby is that rare type of man
      who can sit down under the enemy's ramparts and smoke him out. It was a
      rule of Jethro's code either to make an effective departure or else to
      remain and compel the other man to make an ineffective departure. Lem
      Hallowell might have coped with him; but the stage was late, and after
      some scratching of heads and delving for effectual banter (through which
      Mr. Bixby sat genial and unconcerned), Chester's followers took their
      leave, each choosing his own pretext.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime William Wetherell had entered the store by the back door&mdash;unperceived,
      as he hoped. He had a vehement desire to be left in peace, and to avoid
      politics and political discussions forever&mdash;vain desire for the
      storekeeper of Coniston. Mr. Wetherell entered the store, and to take his
      mind from his troubles, he picked up a copy of Byron: gradually the
      conversation on the stoop died away, and just as he was beginning to
      congratulate himself and enjoy the book, he had an unpleasant sensation of
      some one approaching him measuredly. Wetherell did not move; indeed, he
      felt that he could not&mdash;he was as though charmed to the spot. He
      could have cried aloud, but the store was empty, and there was no one to
      hear him. Mr. Bixby did not speak until he was within a foot of his
      victim's ear. His voice was very nasal, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wetherell, hain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The victim nodded helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to see you a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where can we talk private?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bixby, looking around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no one here,&rdquo; Wetherell answered. &ldquo;What do you wish to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the boys was to see me speakin' to you, they might git suspicious&mdash;you
      understand,&rdquo; he confided, his manner conveying a hint that they shared
      some common policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't meddle with politics,&rdquo; said Wetherell, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; answered Bijah, coming even closer. &ldquo;I knowed you was a
      level-headed man, moment I set eyes on you. Made up my mind I'd have a
      little talk in private with you&mdash;you understand. The boys hain't got
      no reason to suspicion you care anything about politics, have they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't pay no attention to what they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I can't help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ex'actly! You hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I couldn't help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want you should vote right when the time comes,&rdquo; said Bijah. &ldquo;D-don't
      want to see such an intelligent man go wrong an' be sorry for it&mdash;you
      understand. Chester Perkins is hare-brained. Jethro Bass runs things in
      this state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bixby&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; said Bijah, screwing up his face. &ldquo;Guess your watch is
      a-comin' out.&rdquo; He tucked it back caressingly, and started for the door&mdash;the
      back door. Involuntarily Wetherell put his hand to his pocket, felt
      something crackle under it, and drew the something out. To his amazement
      it was a ten-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he cried so sharply in his fright that Mr. Bixby, turned around.
      Wetherell ran after him. &ldquo;Take this back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you got me,&rdquo; said Bijah. &ldquo;W-what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This money is yours,&rdquo; cried Wetherell, so loudly that Bijah started and
      glanced at the front of the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you made some mistake,&rdquo; he said, staring at the storekeeper with
      such amazing innocence that he began to doubt his senses, and clutched the
      bill to see if it was real.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I had no money in my pocket,&rdquo; said Wetherell, perplexedly. And then,
      gaining, indignation, &ldquo;Take this to the man who sent you, and give it back
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bijah merely whispered caressingly in his ear, &ldquo;Nobody sent me,&mdash;you
      understand,&mdash;nobody sent me,&rdquo; and was gone. Wetherell stood for a
      moment, dazed by the man's audacity, and then, hurrying to the front
      stoop, the money still in his hand, he perceived Mr. Bixby in the sunlit
      road walking, Jethro-fashion, toward Ephraim Prescott's harness shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Daddy,&rdquo; said Cynthia, coming in from the garden, &ldquo;where did you get
      all that money? Your troubles must feel better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not mine,&rdquo; said Wetherell, starting. And then, quivering with anger
      and mortification, he sank down on the stoop to debate what he should do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it somebody else's?&rdquo; asked the child, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why don't you give it back to them, Daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How was Wetherell to know, in his fright, that Mr. Bixby had for once
      indulged in an overabundance of zeal in Jethro's behalf? He went to the
      door, laughter came to him across the green from the harness shop, and his
      eye following the sound, fastened on Bijah seated comfortably in the midst
      of the group there. Bitterly the storekeeper comprehended that, had he
      possessed courage, he would have marched straight after Mr. Bixby and
      confronted him before them all with the charge of bribery. The blood
      throbbed in his temples, and yet he sat there, trembling, despising
      himself, repeating that he might have had the courage if Jethro Bass had
      not bought the mortgage. The fear of the man had entered the storekeeper's
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it belong to that man over there?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take it to him, Daddy,&rdquo; and she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; Wetherell answered nervously, glancing at the group. He went
      into the store, addressed an envelope to &ldquo;Mr. Bijah Bixby of Clovelly,&rdquo;
       and gave it to Cynthia. &ldquo;When he comes back for his wagon, hand it to
      him,&rdquo; he said, feeling that he would rather, at that moment, face the
      devil himself than Mr. Bixby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, Cynthia gave Mr. Bixby the envelope as he unhitched
      his horse; and so deftly did Bijah slip it into his pocket, that he must
      certainly have misjudged its contents. None of the loungers at Ephraim's
      remarked the transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Jethro had indeed instructed Bijah to look after his flock at Coniston,
      it was an ill-conditioned move, and some of the flock resented it when
      they were quite sure that Bijah was climbing the notch road toward
      Clovelly. The discussion (from which the storekeeper was providentially
      omitted) was in full swing when the stage arrived, and Lem Hallowell's
      voice silenced the uproar. It was Lem's boast that he never had been and
      never would be a politician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you folks quit railin' against Jethro and do somethin'?&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Bije turns up here, and you all scatter like a flock of crows. I'm
      tired of makin' complaints about that Brampton road, and to-day the hull
      side of it give way, and put me in the ditch. Sure as the sun rises
      to-morrow, I'm goin' to make trouble for Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What be you a-goin' to do, Lem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indict the town,&rdquo; replied Lem, vigorously. &ldquo;Who is the town? Jethro,
      hain't he? Who has charge of the highways? Jethro Bass, Chairman of the
      Selectmen. I've spoke to him, time and agin, about that piece, and he
      hain't done nothin'. To-night I go to Harwich and git the court to app'int
      an agent to repair that road, and the town'll hev to pay the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boldness of Lem's intention for the moment took away their breaths,
      and then the awe-stricken hush which followed his declaration was broken
      by the sound of Chester's fist hammering on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the sperrit,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I'll go along with you, Lem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you won't,&rdquo; said Lem, &ldquo;you'll stay right whar you be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chester wants to git credit for the move,&rdquo; suggested Sam Price, slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a lie, Sam Price,&rdquo; shouted Chester. &ldquo;What made you sneak off when
      Bije Bixby come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't sneak off,&rdquo; retorted Sam, indignantly, through his nose; &ldquo;forgot
      them eggs I left to home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said Lem, with a wink at Moses Hatch, &ldquo;you hitch up your hoss and
      fetch me over to Harwich to git that indictment. Might git a chance to see
      that lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, now, I wish I could, Lem, but my hoss is stun lame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a roar of laughter, during which Sam tried to look unconcerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe Rias'll take me over,&rdquo; said Lem, soberly. &ldquo;You hitch up, Rias?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone,&rdquo; said Joe Northcutt, &ldquo;slid out the door when you was speakin'
      to Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't none of you folks got spunk enough to carry me over to see the
      jedge?&rdquo; demanded Lem; &ldquo;my horses ain't fit to travel to-night.&rdquo; Another
      silence followed, and Lem laughed contemptuously but good-naturedly, and
      turned on his heel. &ldquo;Guess I'll walk, then,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You kin have my white hoss, Lem,&rdquo; said Moses Hatch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Lem; &ldquo;I'll come round and hitch up soon's I git my
      supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, when Cynthia and her father and Millicent Skinner&mdash;who
      condescended to assist in the work and cooking of Mr. Wetherell's
      household&mdash;were seated at supper in the little kitchen behind the
      store, the head and shoulders of the stage-driver were thrust in at the
      window, his face shining from its evening application of soap and water.
      He was making eyes at Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to go to Harwich, Will?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      William set his cup down quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hain't afeard, be you?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Most folks that hasn't went
      West or died is afeard of Jethro Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daddy isn't afraid of him, and I'm not,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, Cynthy,&rdquo; said Lem, leaning over and giving a tug to the
      pigtail that hung down her back; &ldquo;there hain't nothin' to be afeard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him,&rdquo; said Cynthia; &ldquo;he's very good to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stick to him, Cynthy,&rdquo; said the stage driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready, Will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may readily be surmised that Mr. Wetherell did not particularly wish to
      make this excursion, the avowed object of which was to get Mr. Bass into
      trouble. But he went, and presently he found himself jogging along on the
      mountain road to Harwich. From the crest of Town's End ridge they looked
      upon the western peaks tossing beneath a golden sky. The spell of the
      evening's beauty seemed to have fallen on them both, and for a long time
      Lem spoke not a word, and nodded smilingly but absently to the greetings
      that came from the farm doorways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you acted sensible. There's no mite of use of
      your gettin' mixed up in politics. You're too good for 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too good!&rdquo; exclaimed the storekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're eddicated,&rdquo; Lem replied, with a tactful attempt to cover up a
      deficiency; &ldquo;you're a gentleman, ef you do keep store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel apparently thought that gentlemen and politics were contradictions.
      He began to whistle, while Wetherell sat and wondered that any one could
      be so care-free on such a mission. The day faded, and went out, and the
      lights of Harwich twinkled in the valley. Wetherell was almost tempted to
      mention his trouble to this man, as he had been to Ephraim: the fear that
      each might think he wished to borrow money held him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro's all right,&rdquo; Lem remarked, &ldquo;but if he neglects the road, he's got
      to stand for it, same's any other. I writ him twice to the capital, and
      give him fair warning afore he went. He knows I hain't doin' of it for
      politics. I've often thought,&rdquo; Lem continued, &ldquo;that ef some smart, good
      woman could have got hold of him when he was young, it would have made a
      big difference. What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you room enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I've got the hull seat,&rdquo; said Lem. &ldquo;As I was sayin', if some able
      woman had married Jethro and made him look at things a little mite
      different, he would have b'en a big man. He has all the earmarks. Why,
      when he comes back to Coniston, them fellers'll hunt their holes like
      rabbits, mark my words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't think what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand he holds the mortgages of some of them,&rdquo; said Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn't blame him a great deal ef he did git tired and sell Chester out
      soon. This thing happens regular as leap year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass doesn't seem to frighten you,&rdquo; said the storekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Lem, &ldquo;I hain't afeard of him, that's so. For the life of me,
      I can't help likin' him, though he does things that I wouldn't do for all
      the power in Christendom. Here's Jedge Parkinson's house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell remained in the wagon while Lemuel went in to transact his
      business. The judge's house, outlined in the starlight, was a modest
      dwelling with a little porch and clambering vines, set back in its own
      garden behind a picket fence. Presently, from the direction of the lines
      of light in the shutters, came the sound of voices, Lem's deep and
      insistent, and another, pitched in a high nasal key, deprecatory and
      protesting. There was still another, a harsh one that growled something
      unintelligible, and Wetherell guessed, from the fragments which he heard,
      that the judge before sitting down to his duty was trying to dissuade the
      stage driver from a step that was foolhardy. He guessed likewise that Lem
      was not to be dissuaded. At length a silence followed, then the door swung
      open, and three figures came down the illuminated path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like to make you acquainted with Jedge Abner Parkinson, Mr. Wetherell,
      and Jim Irving. Jim's the sheriff of Truro County, and I guess the jedge
      don't need any recommendation as a lawyer from me. You won't mind stayin'
      awhile with the jedge while Jim and I go down town with the team? You're
      both literary folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell followed the judge into the house. He was sallow, tall and spare
      and stooping, clean-shaven, with a hooked nose and bright eyes&mdash;the
      face of an able and adroit man, and he wore the long black coat of the
      politician-lawyer. The room was filled with books, and from these Judge
      Parkinson immediately took his cue, probably through a fear that Wetherell
      might begin on the subject of Lemuel's errand. However, it instantly
      became plain that the judge was a true book lover, and despite the fact
      that Lem's visit had disturbed him not a little, he soon grew animated in
      a discussion on the merits of Sir Walter Scott, paced the room, pitched
      his nasal voice higher and higher, covered his table with volumes of that
      author to illustrate his meaning. Neither of them heard a knock, and they
      both stared dumfounded at the man who filled the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jethro Bass!
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the room with characteristic unconcern, as if he had just left
      it on a trivial errand, and without a &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Good
      evening,&rdquo; parted his coat tails, and sat down in the judge's armchair. The
      judge dropped the volume of Scott on the desk, and as for Wetherell, he
      realized for once the full meaning of the biblical expression of a man's
      tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth; the gleam of one of Jethro's
      brass buttons caught his eye and held it fascinated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Literary talk, Judge?&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;D-don't mind me&mdash;go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought you were at the capital,&rdquo; said the judge, reclaiming some of his
      self-possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good many folks thought so,&rdquo; answered Jethro, &ldquo;g-good many folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no conceivable answer to this, so the judge sat down with an
      affectation of ease. He was a man on whom dignity lay heavily, and was not
      a little ruffled because Wetherell had been a witness of his discomfiture.
      He leaned back in his chair, then leaned forward, stretching his neck and
      clearing his throat, a position in which he bore a ludicrous resemblance
      to a turkey gobbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most through the Legislature?&rdquo; inquired the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bout as common,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, and, forgetful for the moment of his own
      predicament, Wetherell found a fearful fascination in watching the
      contortions of the victim whose punishment was to precede his. It had been
      one of the delights of Louis XI to contemplate the movements of a certain
      churchman whom he had had put in a cage, and some inkling of the pleasure
      to be derived from this pastime of tyrants dawned on Wetherell. Perhaps
      the judge, too, thought of this as he looked at &ldquo;Quentin Durward&rdquo; on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just sayin' to Lem Hallowell,&rdquo; began the judge, at last, &ldquo;that I
      thought he was a little mite hasty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;indicted us, Judge?&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge and Wetherell heard the question with different emotions. Mr.
      Parkinson did not seem astonished at the miracle which had put Jethro in
      possession of this information, but heaved a long sigh of relief, as a man
      will when the worst has at length arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to, Jethro&mdash;couldn't help it. I tried to get Hallowell to wait
      till you come back and talk it over friendly, but he wouldn't listen; said
      the road was dangerous, and that he'd spoken about it too often. He said
      he hadn't anything against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't come in to complain,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;didn't come in to complain.
      Road is out of repair. W-what's the next move?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Jethro&mdash;I swan I'm sorry.&rdquo; He cleared his throat. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
       he continued in his judicial manner, &ldquo;the court has got to appoint an
      agent to repair that road, the agent will present the bill, and the town
      will have to pay the bill&mdash;whatever it is. It's too bad, Jethro, that
      you have allowed this to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you've got to app'int an agent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I'm sorry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you app'inted one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-got any candidates?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge scratched his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know as I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-any legal objection to my bein' app'inted?&rdquo; asked Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge looked at him and gasped. But the look was an involuntary
      tribute of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly, &ldquo;I don't know as there is, Jethro. No,
      there's no legal objection to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-any other kind of objection?&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge appeared to reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I don't know as there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, is there?&rdquo; said Jethro, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the judge, with the finality of a decision. A smile seemed to
      be pulling at the corners of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm a candidate,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you tell me, Jethro, that you want me to appoint you agent to fix that
      road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I-I'm a candidate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the judge, rising, &ldquo;I'll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; said Jethro, sitting still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send the papers over to you within two or three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-ought to be done right away, Judge. Road's in bad shape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll send the papers over to you to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long&mdash;would it take to make out that app'intment&mdash;how
      long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't take but a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll wait,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to take the appointment along with you to-night?&rdquo; asked the
      judge, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess that's about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without a word the judge went over to his table, and for a while the
      silence was broken only by the scratching of his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;interested in roads,&mdash;Will,&mdash;interested in roads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge stopped writing to listen, since it was now the turn of the
      other victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly,&rdquo; answered Mr. Wetherell, whose throat was dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-come over for the drive&mdash;c-come over for the drive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the storekeeper, rather faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how's Cynthy?&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storekeeper was too astonished to answer. At that moment there was a
      heavy step in the doorway, and Lem Hallowell entered the room. He took one
      long look at Jethro and bent over and slapped his hand on his knee, and
      burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So here you be!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;By Godfrey! ef you don't beat all outdoors,
      Jethro. Wal, I got ahead of ye for once, but you can't say I didn't warn
      ye. Come purty nigh bustin' the stage on that road today, and now I'm
      a-goin' to hev an agent app'inted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-who's the agent?&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll git one. Might app'int Will, there, only he don't seem to want to
      get mixed up in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's the agent,&rdquo; cried the judge, holding out the appointment to
      Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wh-what?&rdquo; ejaculated Lem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro took the appointment, and put it in his cowhide wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be you the agent?&rdquo; demanded the amazed stage driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-callate to be,&rdquo; said Jethro, and without a smile or another word to any
      one he walked out into the night, and after various exclamations of
      astonishment and admiration, the stage driver followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one, indeed, could have enjoyed this unexpected coup of Jethro's more
      than Lem himself, and many times on their drive homeward he burst into
      loud and unexpected fits of laughter at the sublime conception of the
      Chairman of the Selectmen being himself appointed road agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;don't you tell this to a soul. We'll have some fun out
      of some of the boys to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The storekeeper promised, but he had an unpleasant presentiment that he
      himself might be one of the boys in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you suppose Jethro Bass knew you were going to indict the town?&rdquo;
       he asked of the stage driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lem burst into fresh peals of laughter; but this was something which he
      did not attempt to answer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      It so happened that there was a certain spinster whom Sam Price had been
      trying to make up his mind to marry for ten years or more, and it was that
      gentleman's habit to spend at least one day in the month in Harwich for
      the purpose of paying his respects. In spite of the fact that his horse
      had been &ldquo;stun lame&rdquo; the night before, Mr. Price was able to start for
      Harwich, via Brampton, very early the next morning. He was driving along
      through Northcutt's woods with one leg hanging over the wheel, humming
      through his nose what we may suppose to have been a love-ditty, and
      letting his imagination run riot about the lady in question, when he
      nearly fell out of his wagon. The cause of this was the sight of fat Tom
      coming around a corner, with Jethro Bass behind him. Lem Hallowell and the
      storekeeper had kept their secret so well that Sam, if he was thinking
      about Jethro at all, believed him at that moment to be seated in the
      Throne Room at the Pelican House, in the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Price, however, was one of an adaptable nature, and by the time he had
      pulled up beside Jethro he had recovered sufficiently to make a few
      remarks on farming subjects, and finally to express a polite surprise at
      Jethro's return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you come a little mite late, hain't you, Jethro?&rdquo; he asked finally,
      with all of the indifference he could assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how's that, Sam&mdash;how's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad,&mdash;I swan it is,&mdash;but Lem Hallowell rode over to
      Harwich last night and indicted the town for that piece of road by the
      Four Corners. Took Will Wetherell along with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't say so!&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I callate he done it,&rdquo; responded Sam, pulling a long face. &ldquo;The court'll
      hev to send an agent to do the job, and I guess you'll hev to foot the
      bill, Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-court'll hev to app'int an agent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I callate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;you a candidate&mdash;Sam&mdash;you a candidate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know but what I be,&rdquo; answered the usually wary Mr. Price.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-goin' to Harwich&mdash;hain't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe I be, and mebbe I hain't,&rdquo; said Sam, not able to repress a
      self-conscious snicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-might as well be you as anybody, Sam,&rdquo; said Jethro, as he drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not strange that the idea, thus planted, should grow in Mr. Price's
      favor as he proceeded. He had been surprised at Jethro's complaisance, and
      he wondered whether, after all, he had done well to help Chester stir
      people up at this time. When he reached Harwich, instead of presenting
      himself promptly at the spinster's house, he went first to the office of
      Judge Parkinson, as became a prudent man of affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps there is no need to go into the details of Mr. Price's
      discomfiture on the occasion of this interview. The judge was by nature of
      a sour disposition, but he haw-hawed so loudly as he explained to Mr.
      Price the identity of the road agent that the judge of probate in the next
      office thought his colleague had gone mad. Afterward Mr. Price stood for
      some time in the entry, where no one could see him, scratching his head
      and repeating his favorite exclamation, &ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; It has been
      ascertained that he omitted to pay his respects to the spinster on that
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cyamon Johnson carried the story back to Coniston, where it had the effect
      of eliminating Mr. Price from local politics for some time to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same morning Chester Perkins was seen by many driving wildly about
      from farm to farm, supposedly haranguing his supporters to make a final
      stand against the tyrant, but by noon it was observed by those naturalists
      who were watching him that his activity had ceased. Chester arrived at
      dinner time at Joe Northcutt's, whose land bordered on the piece of road
      which had caused so much trouble, and Joe and half a dozen others had been
      at work there all morning under the road agent whom Judge Parkinson had
      appointed. Now Mrs. Northcutt was Chester's sister, a woman who in
      addition to other qualities possessed the only sense of humor in the
      family. She ushered the unsuspecting Chester into the kitchen, and there,
      seated beside Joe and sipping a saucer of very hot coffee, was Jethro Bass
      himself. Chester halted in the doorway, his face brick-red, words utterly
      failing him, while Joe sat horror-stricken, holding aloft on his fork a
      smoking potato. Jethro continued to sip his coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-busy times, Chester,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;b-busy times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Chester choked. Where were the burning words of denunciation which came so
      easily to his tongue on other occasions? It is difficult to denounce a man
      who insists upon drinking coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set right down, Chester,&rdquo; said Mrs. Northcutt, behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chester sat down, and to this day he cannot account for that action. Once
      seated, habit asserted itself; and he attacked the boiled dinner with a
      ferocity which should have been exercised against Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the stores down to the capital is finer than ever, Mr. Bass,&rdquo;
       remarked Mrs. Northcutt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-so, Mis' Northcutt, so-so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there ten years ago,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Northcutt, with a sigh of
      reminiscence, &ldquo;and I never see such fine silks and bonnets in my life. Now
      I've often wanted to ask you, did you buy that bonnet with the trembly jet
      things for Mis' Bass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That bonnet come out full better'n I expected,&rdquo; answered Jethro,
      modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have got taste in wimmin's fixin's, Mr. Bass. Strange? Now I wouldn't
      let Joe choose my things for worlds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the dinner progressed, Joe with his eyes on his plate, Chester silent,
      but bursting with anger and resentment, until at last Jethro pushed back
      his chair, and said good day to Mrs. Northcutt and walked out. Chester got
      up instantly and went after him, and Joe, full of forebodings, followed
      his brother-in-law! Jethro was standing calmly on the grass plot,
      whittling a toothpick. Chester stared at him a moment, and then strode off
      toward the barn, unhitched his horse and jumped in his wagon. Something
      prompted him to take another look at Jethro, who was still whittling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-carry me down to the road, Chester&mdash;c-carry me down to the road?&rdquo;
       said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Northcutt's knees gave way under him, and he sat down on a sugar
      kettle. Chester tightened up his reins so suddenly that his horse reared,
      while Jethro calmly climbed into the seat beside him and they drove off.
      It was some time before Joe had recovered sufficiently to arise and repair
      to the scene of operations on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Joe who brought the astounding news to the store that evening.
      Chester was Jethro's own candidate for senior Selectman! Jethro himself
      had said so, that he would be happy to abdicate in Chester's favor, and
      make it unanimous&mdash;Chester having been a candidate so many times, and
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar's Chester?&rdquo; said Lem Hallowell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe pulled a long face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just come from his house, and he hain't done a lick of work sence noon
      time. Jest sets in a corner&mdash;won't talk, won't eat&mdash;jest sets
      thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lem sat down on the counter and laughed until he was forced to brush the
      tears from his cheeks at the idea of Chester Perkins being Jethro's
      candidate. Where was reform now? If Chester were elected, it would be in
      the eyes of the world as Jethro's man. No wonder he sat in a corner and
      refused to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you'll ketch it next, Will, for goin' over to Harwich with Lem,&rdquo;
       Joe remarked playfully to the storekeeper, as he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      These various occurrences certainly did not tend to allay the uneasiness
      of Mr. Wetherell. The next afternoon, at a time when a slack trade was
      slackest, he had taken his chair out under the apple tree and was sitting
      with that same volume of Byron in his lap&mdash;but he was not reading.
      The humorous aspects of the doings of Mr. Bass did not particularly appeal
      to him now; and he was, in truth, beginning to hate this man whom the
      fates had so persistently intruded into his life. William Wetherell was
      not, it may have been gathered, what may be called vindictive. He was a
      sensitive, conscientious person whose life should have been in the vale;
      and yet at that moment he had a fierce desire to confront Jethro Bass and&mdash;and
      destroy him. Yes, he felt equal to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shocks are not very beneficial to sensitive natures. William Wetherell
      looked up, and there was Jethro Bass on the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-great resource&mdash;readin'&mdash;great resource,&rdquo; he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner Jethro snuffed out utterly that passion to destroy, and
      another sensation took its place&mdash;a sensation which made it very
      difficult for William Wetherell to speak, but he managed to reply that
      reading had been a great resource to him. Jethro had a parcel in his hand,
      and he laid it down on the step beside him; and he seemed, for once in his
      life, to be in a mood for conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's hard for me to read a book,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I own to it&mdash;it's a
      little mite hard. H-hev to kind of spell it out in places. Hain't had much
      time for readin'. But it's kind of pleasant to l'arn what other folks has
      done in the world by pickin' up a book. T-takes your mind off things&mdash;don't
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell felt like saying that his reading had not been able to do that
      lately. Then he made the plunge, and shuddered as he made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass&mdash;I&mdash;I have been waiting to speak to you about that
      mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he answered, without moving his head, &ldquo;er&mdash;about the
      mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington told me that you had bought it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did&mdash;yes, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you will have to foreclose,&rdquo; said Wetherell; &ldquo;I cannot
      reasonably ask you to defer the payments any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I foreclose it, what will you do?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but one answer&mdash;Wetherell would have to go back to the city
      and face the consequences. He had not the strength to earn his bread on a
      farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'd a b'en in any hurry for the money&mdash;g-guess I'd a notified
      you,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better foreclose, Mr. Bass,&rdquo; Wetherell answered; &ldquo;I can't
      hold out any hopes to you that it will ever be possible for me to pay it
      off. It's only fair to tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with what seemed a suspicion of a smile, &ldquo;I don't know
      but what that's about as honest an answer as I ever got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you do it?&rdquo; Wetherell cried, suddenly goaded by another fear;
      &ldquo;why did you buy that mortgage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this did not shake his composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-have a little habit of collectin' 'em,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;same as you do
      books. G-guess some of 'em hain't as valuable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell was beginning to think that Jethro knew something also
      of such refinements of cruelty as were practised by Caligula. He drew
      forth his cowhide wallet and produced from it a folded piece of newspaper
      which must, Wetherell felt sure, contain the mortgage in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one power I always wished I had,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;the power to make
      folks see some things as I see 'em. I was acrost the Water to-night, on my
      hill farm, when the sun set, and the sky up thar above the mountain was
      all golden bars, and the river all a-flamin' purple, just as if it had
      been dyed by some of them Greek gods you're readin' about. Now if I could
      put them things on paper, I wouldn't care a haycock to be President. No,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The storekeeper's amazement as he listened to this speech may be imagined.
      Was this Jethro Bass? If so, here was a side of him the existence of which
      no one suspected. Wetherell forgot the matter in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you put that on paper?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro smiled, and made a deprecating motion with his thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes when I hain't busy, I drop into the state library at the
      capital and enjoy myself. It's like goin' to another world without any
      folks to bother you. Er&mdash;er&mdash;there's books I'd like to talk to
      you about&mdash;sometime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought you told me you didn't read much, Mr. Bass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made no direct reply, but unfolded the newspaper in his hand, and then
      Wetherell saw that it was only a clipping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-happened to run across this in a newspaper&mdash;if this hain't this
      county, I wahn't born and raised here. If it hain't Coniston Mountain
      about seven o'clock of a June evening, I never saw Coniston Mountain. Er&mdash;listen
      to this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon he read, with a feeling which Wetherell had not supposed he
      possessed, an extract: and as the storekeeper listened his blood began to
      run wildly. At length Jethro put down the paper without glancing at his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's somethin' about that that fetches you spinnin' through the air,&rdquo;
       he said slowly. &ldquo;Sh-showed it to Jim Willard, editor of the Newcastle
      Guardian. Er&mdash;what do you think he said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Wetherell, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willard said, 'Bass, w-wish you'd find me that man. I'll give him five
      dollars every week for a letter like that&mdash;er&mdash;five dollars a
      week.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, folded up the paper again and put it in his pocket, took out a
      card and handed it to Wetherell.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        James G. Willard, Editor.
         Newcastle Guardian.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's his address,&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;Er&mdash;guess you'll know what to do
      with it. Er&mdash;five dollars a week&mdash;five dollars a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know I wrote this article?&rdquo; said Wetherell, as the card
      trembled between his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;K-knowed the place was Coniston seen from the 'east, knowed there wahn't
      any one is Brampton or Harwich could have done it&mdash;g-guessed the rest&mdash;guessed
      the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell could only stare at him like a man who, with the halter about
      his neck, has been suddenly reprieved. But Jethro Bass did not appear to
      be waiting for thanks. He cleared his throat, and had Wetherell not been
      in such a condition himself, he would actually have suspected him of
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Wetherell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-won't say nothin' about the mortgage&mdash;p-pay it when you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This roused the storekeeper to a burst of protest, but he stemmed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't got the money, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I needed money, d'ye suppose I'd bought the mortgage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the still bewildered Wetherell, &ldquo;of course not.&rdquo; There he
      stuck, that other suspicion of political coercion suddenly rising
      uppermost. Could this be what the man meant? Wetherell put his hand to his
      head, but he did not dare to ask the question. Then Jethro Bass fixed his
      eyes upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't never mixed any in politics&mdash;hev you n-never mixed any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell's heart sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't&mdash;take my advice&mdash;d-don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried the storekeeper, so loudly that he frightened himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't,&rdquo; repeated Jethro, imperturbably.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence, the storekeeper being unable to speak. Coniston
      Water, at the foot of the garden, sang the same song, but it seemed to
      Wetherell to have changed its note from sorrow to joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-hear things, don't you&mdash;hear things in the store?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't hear 'em. Keep out of politics, Will, s-stick to store-keepin' and&mdash;and
      literature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro got to his feet and turned his back on the storekeeper and picked
      up the parcel he had brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-Cynthy well?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I'll call her,&rdquo; said Wetherell, huskily. &ldquo;She&mdash;she was down
      by the brook when you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jethro Bass did not wait. He took his parcel and strode down to
      Coniston Water, and there he found Cynthia seated on a rock with her toes
      in a pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you, Cynthy?&rdquo; said he, looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm well, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;R-remembered what I told you to call me, hev you,&rdquo; said Jethro, plainly
      pleased. &ldquo;Th-that's right. Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia looked up at him inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-said you liked books&mdash;didn't you? S-said you liked books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; she replied simply, &ldquo;very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He undid the wrapping of the parcel, and there lay disclosed a book with a
      very gorgeous cover. He thrust it into the child's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's 'Robinson Crusoe'!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and gave a little shiver of
      delight that made ripples in the pool. Then she opened it&mdash;not
      without awe, for William Wetherell's hooks were not clothed in this
      magnificent manner. &ldquo;It's full of pictures,&rdquo; cried Cynthia. &ldquo;See, there he
      is making a ship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-you read it, Cynthy?&rdquo; asked Jethro, a little anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Cynthia hadn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L-like it, Cynthy&mdash;l-like it?&rdquo; said he, not quite so anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia looked up at him with a puzzled expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-fetched it up from the capital for you, Cynthy&mdash;for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange thrill ran through Jethro Bass as he gazed upon the wonder and
      delight in the face of the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-fetched it for you, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Cynthia sat very still, and then she slowly closed the book
      and stared at the cover again, Jethro looking down at her the while. To
      tell the truth, she found it difficult to express the emotions which the
      event had summoned up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you&mdash;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro, however, understood. He had, indeed, never failed to understand
      her from the beginning. He parted his coat tails and sat down on the rock
      beside her, and very gently opened the book again, to the first chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-goin' to read it, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, and trembled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;read it to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Cynthia read &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe&rdquo; to him while the summer afternoon wore
      away, and the shadows across the pool grew longer and longer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thus William Wetherell became established in Coniston, and was started at
      last&mdash;poor man&mdash;upon a life that was fairly tranquil. Lem
      Hallowell had once covered him with blushes by unfolding a newspaper in
      the store and reading an editorial beginning: &ldquo;We publish today a new and
      attractive feature of the Guardian, a weekly contribution from a
      correspondent whose modesty is to be compared only with his genius as a
      writer. We are confident that the readers of our Raper will appreciate the
      letter in another column signed 'W. W.'&rdquo; And from that day William was
      accorded much of the deference due to a litterateur which the fates had
      hitherto denied him. Indeed, during the six years which we are about to
      skip over so lightly, he became a marked man in Coniston, and it was voted
      in towns meeting that he be intrusted with that most important of literary
      labors, the Town History of Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this period, too, there sprang up the strangest of intimacies
      between him and Jethro Bass. Surely no more dissimilar men than these have
      ever been friends, and that the friendship was sometimes misjudged was one
      of the clouds on William Wetherell's horizon. As the years went on he was
      still unable to pay off the mortgage; and sometimes, indeed, he could not
      even meet the interest, in spite of the princely sum he received from Mr.
      Willard of the Guardian. This was one of the clouds on Jethro's horizon,
      too, if men had but known it, and he took such moneys as Wetherell
      insisted upon giving him grudgingly enough. It is needless to say that he
      refrained from making use of Mr. Wetherell politically, although no poorer
      vessel for political purposes was ever constructed. It is quite as
      needless to say, perhaps, that Chester Perkins never got to be Chairman of
      the Board of Selectmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Aunt Listy died, Jethro was more than ever to be found, when in
      Coniston, in the garden or the kitchen behind the store. Yes, Aunt Listy
      is dead. She has flitted through these pages as she flitted through life
      itself, arrayed by Jethro like the rainbow, and quite as shadowy and
      unreal. There is no politician of a certain age in the state who does not
      remember her walking, clad in dragon-fly colors, through the streets of
      the capital on Jethro's arm, or descending the stairs of the Pelican House
      to supper. None of Jethro's detractors may say that he ever failed in
      kindness to her, and he loved her as much as was in his heart to love any
      woman after Cynthia Ware. As for Aunt Listy, she never seemed to feel any
      resentment against the child Jethro brought so frequently to Thousand Acre
      Hill. Poor Aunt Listy! some people used to wonder whether she ever felt
      any emotion at all. But I believe that she did, in her own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a well-known fact that Mr. Bijah Bixby came over from Clovelly, to
      request the place of superintendent of the funeral, a position which had
      already been filled. A special office, too, was created on this occasion
      for an old supporter of Jethro's, Senator Peleg Hartington of Brampton. He
      was made chairman of the bearers, of whom Ephraim Prescott was one.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, as we have said, Jethro was more than ever at the store&mdash;or
      rather in that domestic domain behind it which Wetherell and Cynthia
      shared with Miss Millicent Skinner. Moses Hatch was wont to ask Cynthia
      how her daddies were. It was he who used to clear out the road to the
      little schoolhouse among the birches when the snow almost buried the
      little village, and on sparkling mornings after the storms his oxen would
      stop to breathe in front of the store, a cluster of laughing children
      clinging to the snow-plough and tumbling over good-natured Moses in their
      frolics. Cynthia became a country girl, and grew long and lithe of limb,
      and weather-burnt, and acquired an endurance that spoke wonders for the
      life-giving air of Coniston. But she was a serious child, and Wetherell
      and Jethro sometimes wondered whether she was ever a child at all. When
      Eben Hatch fell from the lumber pile on the ice, it was she who bound the
      cut in his head; and when Tom Richardson unexpectedly embraced the
      schoolhouse stove, Cynthia, not Miss Rebecca Northcutt, took charge of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps inevitable, with such a helpless father, that the girl
      should grow up with a sense of responsibility, being what she was. Did
      William Wetherell go to Brampton, Cynthia examined his apparel, and he was
      marched shamefacedly back to his room to change; did he read too late at
      night, some unseen messenger summoned her out of her sleep, and he was
      packed off to bed. Miss Millicent Skinner, too, was in a like mysterious
      way compelled to abdicate her high place in favor of Cynthia, and
      Wetherell was utterly unable to explain how this miracle was accomplished.
      Not only did Millicent learn to cook, but Cynthia, at the age of fourteen,
      had taught her. Some wit once suggested that the national arms of the
      United States should contain the emblem of crossed frying-pans, and
      Millicent was in this respect a true American. When Wetherell began to
      suffer from her pies and doughnuts, the revolution took place&mdash;without
      stampeding, or recriminations, or trouble of any kind. One evening he
      discovered Cynthia, decked in an apron, bending over the stove, and
      Millicent looking on with an expression that was (for Millicent) benign.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was to some extent explained, a few days later, when Wetherell found
      himself gazing across the counter at the motherly figure of Mrs. Moses
      Hatch, who held the well-deserved honor of being the best cook in
      Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't had so much stomach trouble lately, Will?&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, surprised; &ldquo;Cynthia is learning to cook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess she is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Moses. &ldquo;That gal is worth any seven grown-up
      women in town. And she was four nights settin' in my kitchen before I
      knowed what she was up to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you taught her, Amanda?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I taught her some. She callated that Milly was killin' you, and I guess
      she was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During her school days, Jethro used frequently to find himself in front of
      the schoolhouse when the children came trooping out&mdash;quite by
      accident, of course. Winter or summer, when he went away on his periodical
      trips, he never came back without a little remembrance in his carpet bag,
      usually a book, on the subject of which he had spent hours in conference
      with the librarian at the state library at the capital. But in June of the
      year when Cynthia was fifteen, Jethro yielded to that passion which was
      one of the man's strangest characteristics, and appeared one evening in
      the garden behind the store with a bundle which certainly did not contain
      a book. With all the gravity of a ceremony he took off the paper, and held
      up in relief against the astonished Cynthia a length of cardinal cloth.
      William Wetherell, who was looking out of the window, drew his breath, and
      even Jethro drew back with an exclamation at the change wrought in her.
      But Cynthia snatched the roll from his hand and wound it up with a
      feminine deftness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wh-what's the matter, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't wear that, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-can't wear it! Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia sat down on the grassy mound under the apple tree and clasped her
      hands across her knees. She looked up at him and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see that I couldn't wear it, Uncle Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Ch-change it if you've a mind to hev green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, and smiled at him a little sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-took me a full hour to choose that, Cynthy,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;H-had to go to
      Boston so I got it there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was, indeed, grievously disappointed at this reception of his gift, and
      he stood eying the cardinal cloth very mournfully as it lay on the paper.
      Cynthia, remorseful, reached up and seized his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down here, Uncle Jethro.&rdquo; He sat down on the mound beside her, very
      much perplexed. She still held his hand in hers. &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said
      slowly, &ldquo;you mustn't think I'm not grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I don't think that, Cynthy. I know you be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am grateful&mdash;I'm very grateful for everything you give me,
      although I should love you just as much if you didn't give me anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was striving very hard not to offend him, for in some ways he was as
      sensitive as Wetherell himself. Even Coniston folk had laughed at the
      idiosyncrasy which Jethro had of dressing his wife in brilliant colors,
      and the girl knew this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-got it for you to wear to Brampton on the Fourth of July, Cynthy,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro, I couldn't wear that to Brampton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd look like a queen,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm not a queen,&rdquo; objected Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather hev somethin' else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, looking at him suddenly with the gleam of laughter in her
      eyes, although she was on the verge of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wh-what?&rdquo; Jethro demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Cynthia, demurely gazing down at her ankles, &ldquo;shoes and
      stockings.&rdquo; The barefooted days had long gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro laughed. Perhaps some inkling of her reasons came to him, for he
      had a strange and intuitive understanding of her. At any rate, he accepted
      her decision with a meekness which would have astonished many people who
      knew only that side of him which he showed to the world. Gently she
      released her hand, and folded up the bundle again and gave it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-better keep it&mdash;hadn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you keep it. And I will wear it for you when I am rich, Uncle
      Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro did keep it, and in due time the cardinal cloth had its uses. But
      Cynthia did not wear it on the Fourth of July.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a great day for Brampton, being not only the nation's birthday,
      but the hundredth year since the adventurous little band of settlers from
      Connecticut had first gazed upon Coniston Water at that place. Early in
      the morning wagon loads began to pour into Brampton Street from Harwich,
      from Coniston, from Tarleton Four Corners, and even from distant Clovelly,
      and Brampton was banner-hung for the occasion&mdash;flags across the
      stores, across the dwellings, and draped along the whole breadth of the
      meeting-house; but for sheer splendor the newly built mansion of Isaac D.
      Worthington outshone them all. Although its owner was a professed believer
      in republican simplicity, no such edifice ornamented any town to the west
      of the state capital. Small wonder that the way in front of it was blocked
      by a crowd lost in admiration of its Gothic proportions! It stands to-day
      one of many monuments to its builder, with its windows of one pane
      (unheard-of magnificence), its tower of stone, its porch with pointed
      arches and scroll-work. No fence divides its grounds from the public walk,
      and on the smooth-shaven lawn between the ornamental flower beds and the
      walk stand two stern mastiffs of iron, emblematic of the solidity and
      power of their owner. It was as much to see this house as to hear the
      oratory that the countryside flocked to Brampton that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the day before Cynthia and Milly, and many another housewife, had been
      making wonderful things for the dinners they were to bring, and stowing
      them in the great basket ready for the early morning start. At six o'clock
      Jethro's three-seated farm wagon was in front of the store. Cousin Ephraim
      Prescott, in a blue suit and an army felt hat with a cord, got up behind,
      a little stiffly by reason of that Wilderness bullet; and there were also
      William Wetherell and Lem Hallowell, his honest face shining, and Sue, his
      wife, and young Sue and Jock and Lilian, all a-quiver with excitement in
      their Sunday best.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as they drove away there trotted up behind them Moses and Amandy
      Hatch, with their farm team, and all the little Hatches,&mdash;Eben and
      George and Judy and Liza. As they jogged along they drank in the fragrance
      of the dew-washed meadows and the pines, and a great blue heron stood
      knee-deep on the far side of Deacon Lysander's old mill-pond, watching
      them philosophically as they passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was eight o'clock when they got into the press of Brampton Street, and
      there was a hush as they made their way slowly through the throng, and
      many a stare at the curious figure in the old-fashioned blue swallowtail
      and brass buttons and tall hat, driving the farm wagon. Husbands pointed
      him out to their wives, young men to sisters and sweethearts, some openly,
      some discreetly. &ldquo;There goes Jethro Bass,&rdquo; and some were bold enough to
      say, &ldquo;Howdy, Jethro?&rdquo; Jake Wheeler was to be observed in the crowd ahead
      of them, hurried for once out of his Jethro step, actually running toward
      the tavern, lest such a one arrive unheralded. Commotion is perceived on
      the tavern porch,&mdash;Mr. Sherman, the proprietor, bustling out, Jake
      Wheeler beside him; a chorus of &ldquo;How be you, Jethros?&rdquo; from the more
      courageous there,&mdash;but the farm team jogs on, leaving a discomfited
      gathering, into the side street, up an alley, and into the cool,
      ammonia-reeking sheds of lank Jim Sanborn's livery stable. No
      obsequiousness from lank Jim, who has the traces slipped and the reins
      festooned from the bits almost before Jethro has lifted Cynthia to the
      floor. Jethro, walking between Cynthia and her father, led the way,
      Ephraim, Lem, and Sue Hallowell following, the children, in unwonted shoes
      and stockings, bringing up the rear. The people parted, and presently they
      found themselves opposite the new-scrolled band stand among the trees,
      where the Harwich band in glittering gold and red had just been installed.
      The leader; catching sight of Jethro's party, and of Ephraim's corded army
      hat, made a bow, waved his baton, and they struck up &ldquo;Marching through
      Georgia.&rdquo; It was, of course, not dignified to cheer, but I think that the
      blood of every man and woman and child ran faster with the music, and so
      many of them looked at Cousin Ephraim that he slipped away behind the line
      of wagons. So the day began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest to think of bein' that rich, Will!&rdquo; exclaimed Amanda Hatch to the
      storekeeper, as they stood in the little group which had gathered in front
      of the first citizen's new mansion. &ldquo;I own it scares me. Think how much
      that house must hev cost, and even them dogs,&rdquo; said Amanda, staring at the
      mastiffs with awe. &ldquo;They tell me he has a grand piano from New York, and
      guests from Boston railroad presidents. I call Isaac Worthington to mind
      when he wahn't but a slip of a boy with a cough, runnin' after Cynthy
      Ware.&rdquo; She glanced down at Cynthia with something of compassion. &ldquo;Just to
      think, child, he might have be'n your father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad he isn't,&rdquo; said Cynthia, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; replied the good-natured and well-intentioned
      Amanda, &ldquo;I'd sooner have your father than Isaac Worthington. But I was
      only thinkin' how nice it would be to be rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then one of the glass-panelled doors of this house opened, and a
      good-looking lad of seventeen came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Bob Worthington,&rdquo; said Amanda, determined that they should miss
      nothing. &ldquo;My! it wahn't but the other day when he put on long pants. It
      won't be a great while before he'll go into the mills and git all that
      money. Guess he'll marry some city person. He'd ought to take you,
      Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want him,&rdquo; said Cynthia, the color flaming into her cheeks. And
      she went off across the green in search of Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a laugh from the honest country folk who had listened. Bob
      Worthington came to the edge of the porch and stood there, frankly
      scanning the crowd, with an entire lack of self-consciousness. Some of
      them shifted nervously, with the New Englander's dislike of being caught
      in the act of sight-seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world is he starin' at me for?&rdquo; said Amanda, backing behind
      the bulkier form of her husband. &ldquo;As I live, I believe he's comin' here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Worthington was, indeed, descending the steps and walking across
      the lawn toward them, nodding and smiling to acquaintances as he passed.
      To Wetherell's astonishment he made directly for the place where he was
      standing and held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Wetherell?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps you don't remember me,&mdash;Bob
      Worthington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say that I should have known you,&rdquo; answered the storekeeper. They
      were all absurdly silent, thinking of nothing to say and admiring the boy
      because he was at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you have a good seat at the exercises,&rdquo; he said, pressing
      Wetherell's hand again, and before he could thank him, Bob was off in the
      direction of the band stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; remarked Amanda, &ldquo;he ain't much like his dad. You'd never
      catch Isaac Worthington bein' that common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there came another interruption for William Wetherell, who was
      startled by the sound of a voice in his ear&mdash;a nasal voice that awoke
      unpleasant recollections. He turned to confront, within the distance of
      eight inches, the face of Mr. Bijah Bixby of Clovelly screwed up into a
      greeting. The storekeeper had met Mr. Bixby several times since that first
      memorable meeting, and on each occasion, as now, his hand had made an
      involuntary movement to his watch pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't seed you for some time, Will,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Bixby; &ldquo;goin' over to
      the exercises? We'll move along that way,&rdquo; and he thrust his hand under
      Mr. Wetherell's elbow. &ldquo;Whar's Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's here somewhere,&rdquo; answered the storekeeper, helplessly, moving along
      in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keepin' out of sight, you understand,&rdquo; said Bijah, with a knowing wink,
      as much as to say that Mr. Wetherell was by this time a past master in
      Jethro tactics. Mr. Bixby could never disabuse his mind of a certain
      interpretation which he put on the storekeeper's intimacy with Jethro.
      &ldquo;You done well to git in with him, Will. Didn't think you had it in you
      when I first looked you over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wetherell wished to make an indignant denial, but he didn't know
      exactly how to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smartest man in the United States of America&mdash;guess you know that,&rdquo;
       Mr. Bixby continued amiably. &ldquo;They can't git at him unless he wants 'em
      to. There's a railroad president at Isaac Worthington's who'd like to git
      at him to-day,&mdash;guess you know that,&mdash;Steve Merrill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wetherell didn't know, but he was given no time to say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steve Merrill, of the Grand Gulf and Northern. He hain't here to see
      Worthington; he's here to see Jethro, when Jethro's a mind to. Guess you
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about it,&rdquo; answered Wetherell, shortly. Mr. Bixby gave him
      a look of infinite admiration, as though he could not have pursued any
      more admirable line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Steve Merrill better'n I know you,&rdquo; said Mr. Bixby, &ldquo;and he knows
      me. Whenever he sees me at the state capital he says, 'How be you, Bije?'
      just as natural as if I was a railroad president, and slaps me on the
      back. When be you goin' to the capital, Will? You'd ought to come down and
      be thar with the boys on this Truro Bill. You could reach some on 'em the
      rest of us couldn't git at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell avoided a reply to this very pointed inquiry by escaping
      into the meeting-house, where he found Jethro and Cynthia and Ephraim
      already seated halfway up the aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the platform, behind a bank of flowers, are the velvet covered chairs
      which contain the dignitaries of the occasion. The chief of these is, of
      course, Mr. Isaac Worthington, the one with the hawk-like look, sitting
      next to the Rev. Mr. Sweet, who is rather pudgy by contrast. On the other
      side of Mr. Sweet, next to the parlor organ and the quartette, is the
      genial little railroad president Mr. Merrill, batting the flies which
      assail the unprotected crown of his head, and smiling benignly on the
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his eye becomes fixed, and he waves a fat hand vigorously at
      Jethro, who answers the salute with a nod of unwonted cordiality for him.
      Then comes a hush, and the exercises begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a prayer, of course, by the Rev. Mr. Sweet, and a rendering of
      &ldquo;My Country&rdquo; and &ldquo;I would not Change my Lot,&rdquo; and other choice selections
      by the quartette; and an original poem recited with much feeling by a lady
      admirer of Miss Lucretia Penniman, and the &ldquo;Hymn to Coniston&rdquo; declaimed by
      Mr. Gamaliel Ives, president of the Brampton Literary Club. But the
      crowning event is, of course, the oration by Mr. Isaac D. Worthington, the
      first citizen, who is introduced under that title by the chairman of the
      day; and as the benefactor of Brampton, who has bestowed upon the town the
      magnificent gift which was dedicated such a short time ago, the
      Worthington Free Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Isaac D. Worthington stood erect beside the table, his hand thrust
      into the opening of his coat, and spoke at the rate of one hundred and
      eight words a minute, for exactly one hour. He sketched with much skill
      the creed of the men who had fought their way through the forests to build
      their homes by Coniston Water, who had left their clearings to risk their
      lives behind Stark and Ethan Allen for that creed; he paid a graceful
      tribute to the veterans of the Civil War, scattered among his hearers&mdash;a
      tribute, by the way, which for some reason made Ephraim very indignant.
      Mr. Worthington went on to outline the duty of citizens of the present
      day, as he conceived it, and in this connection referred, with becoming
      modesty, to the Worthington Free Library. He had made his money in
      Brampton, and it was but right that he should spend it for the benefit of
      the people of Brampton. The library, continued Mr. Worthington when the
      applause was over, had been the dream of a certain delicate youth who had
      come, many years ago, to Brampton for his health. (It is a curious fact,
      by the way, that Mr. Worthington seldom recalled the delicate youth now,
      except upon public occasions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the dream of that youth had been to benefit in some way that
      community in which circumstances had decreed that he should live, and in
      this connection it might not be out of place to mention a bill then before
      the Legislature of the state, now in session. If the bill became a law,
      the greatest modern factor of prosperity, the railroad, would come to
      Brampton. The speaker was interrupted here by more applause. Mr.
      Worthington did not deem it dignified or necessary to state that the
      railroad to which he referred was the Truro Railroad; and that he, as the
      largest stockholder, might indirectly share that prosperity with Brampton.
      That would be wandering too far, from his subject, which, it will be
      recalled, was civic duties. He took a glass of water, and went on to
      declare that he feared&mdash;sadly feared&mdash;that the ballot was not
      held as sacred as it had once been. He asked the people of Brampton, and
      of the state, to stop and consider who in these days made the laws and
      granted the franchises. Whereupon he shook his head very slowly and sadly,
      as much as to imply that, if the Truro Bill did not pass, the corruption
      of the ballot was to blame. No, Mr. Worthington could think of no better
      subject on this Birthday of Independence than a recapitulation of the
      creed of our forefathers, from which we had so far wandered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the first citizen, as became him, had delivered the first reform
      speech ever heard in Brampton, and the sensation which it created was
      quite commensurate to the occasion. The presence in the audience of Jethro
      Bass, at whom many believed the remarks to have been aimed, added no
      little poignancy to that sensation, although Jethro gave no outward signs
      of the terror and remorse by which he must have been struck while
      listening to Mr. Worthington's ruminations of the corruption of the
      ballot. Apparently unconscious of the eyes upon him, he walked out of the
      meeting-house with Cynthia by his side, and they stood waiting for
      Wetherell and Ephraim under the maple tree there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The be-ribboned members of the Independence Day committee were now on the
      steps, and behind them came Isaac Worthington and Mr. Merrill. The people,
      scenting a dramatic situation, lingered. Would the mill owner speak to the
      boss? The mill owner, with a glance at the boss, did nothing of the kind,
      but immediately began to talk rapidly to Mr. Merrill. That gentleman,
      however, would not be talked to, but came running over to Jethro and
      seized his hand, leaving Mr. Worthington to walk on by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro,&rdquo; cried the little railroad president, &ldquo;upon my word. Well, well.
      And Miss Jethro,&rdquo; he took off his hat to Cynthia, &ldquo;well, well. Didn't know
      you had a girl, Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-wish she was mine, Steve,&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;She's a good deal to me as it
      is. Hain't you, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill, staring at her, &ldquo;you'll have to look out
      for her some day&mdash;keep the boys away from her&mdash;eh? Upon my word!
      Well, Jethro,&rdquo; said he, with a twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;are you goin' to
      reform? I'll bet you've got an annual over my road in your pocket right
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enjoy the speech-makin', Steve?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bass, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill winked at Jethro, and laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep the boys away from her, Jethro,&rdquo; he repeated, laying his hand on the
      shoulder of the lad who stood beside him. &ldquo;It's a good thing Bob's going
      off to Harvard this fall. Seems to me I heard about some cutting up at
      Andover&mdash;eh, Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob grinned, showing a line of very white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill took Jethro by the arm and led him off a little distance,
      having a message of some importance to give him, the purport of which will
      appear later. And Cynthia and Bob were left face to face. Of course Bob
      could have gone on, if he had wished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't remember me, do you?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do now,&rdquo; said Cynthia, looking at him rather timidly through her
      lashes. Her face was hot, and she had been, very uncomfortable during Mr.
      Merrill's remarks. Furthermore, Bob had not taken his eyes off her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remembered you right away,&rdquo; he said reproachfully; &ldquo;I saw you in front
      of the house this morning, and you ran away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't runaway,&rdquo; replied Cynthia, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looked like it, to me,&rdquo; said Bob.. &ldquo;I suppose you were afraid I was
      going to give you anther whistle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia bit her lip, and then she laughed. Then she looked around to see
      where Jethro was, and discovered that they were alone in front of the
      meeting-house. Ephraim and her father had passed on while Mr. Merrill was
      talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; asked Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid they've gone,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;I ought to be going after them.
      They'll miss me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, they won't,&rdquo; said Bob, easily, &ldquo;let's sit down under the tree.
      They'll come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon he sat down under the maple. But Cynthia remained standing,
      ready to fly. She had an idea that it was wrong to stay&mdash;which made
      it all the more delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down&mdash;Cynthia,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced down at him, startled. He was sitting, with his legs crossed,
      looking up at her intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that name,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I like it better than any girl's name I
      know. Do be good-natured and sit down.&rdquo; And he patted the ground close
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shy laughed again. The laugh had in it an exquisite note of shyness, which
      he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want me to sit down?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you talk to me standing up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I could,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;but&mdash;I shouldn't be able to say such
      nice things to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The corners of her mouth trembled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whose loss would that be?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob Worthington was surprised at this retort, and correspondingly
      delighted. He had not expected it in a country storekeeper's daughter, and
      he stared at Cynthia so frankly that she blushed again, and turned away.
      He was a young man who, it may be surmised, had had some experience with
      the other sex at Andover and elsewhere. He had not spent all of his life
      in Brampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've often thought of you since that day when you wouldn't take the
      whistle,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm laughing at you,&rdquo; said Cynthia, leaning against the tree, with her
      hands behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been laughing at me ever since you've stood there,&rdquo; he said,
      aggrieved that his declarations should not betaken more seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you thought about me?&rdquo; she demanded. She was really beginning
      to enjoy this episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and hesitated&mdash;and broke down and laughed&mdash;Cynthia
      laughed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you what I didn't think,&rdquo; said Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Cynthia, falling into the trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think you'd be so&mdash;so good-looking,&rdquo; said he, quite boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I didn't think you'd be so rude,&rdquo; responded Cynthia. But though she
      blushed again, she was not exactly displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do this afternoon?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Let's go for a
      walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going back to Coniston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go for a walk now,&rdquo; said he, springing to his feet. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia looked at him and shook her head smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's Uncle Jethro&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro!&rdquo; exclaimed Bob, &ldquo;is he your uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not really. But he's just the same. He's very good to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether he'd mind if I called him Uncle Jethro, too,&rdquo; said Bob,
      and Cynthia laughed at the notion. This young man was certainly very
      comical, and very frank. &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I'll come to see you some
      day in Coniston.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      That evening, after Cynthia had gone to bed, William Wetherell sat down at
      Jonah Winch's desk in the rear of the store to gaze at a blank sheet of
      paper until the Muses chose to send him subject matter for his weekly
      letter to the Guardian. The window was open, and the cool airs from the
      mountain spruces mingled with the odors of corn meal and kerosene and
      calico print. Jethro Bass, who had supped with the storekeeper, sat in the
      wooden armchair silent, with his head bent. Sometimes he would sit there
      by the hour while Wetherell wrote or read, and take his departure when he
      was so moved without saying good night. Presently Jethro lifted his chin,
      and dropped it again; there was a sound of wheels without, and, after an
      interval, a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell dropped his pen with a start of surprise, as it was late
      for a visitor in Coniston. He glanced at Jethro, who did not move, and
      then he went to the door and shot back the great forged bolt of it, and
      stared out. On the edge of the porch stood a tallish man in a
      double-breasted frock coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington!&rdquo; exclaimed the storekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington coughed and pulled at one of his mutton-chop whiskers, and
      seemed about to step off the porch again. It was, indeed, the first
      citizen and reformer of Brampton. No wonder William Wetherell was
      mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything for you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Have you missed your way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell thought he heard him muttering, &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; and then he was
      startled by another voice in his ear. It was Jethro who was standing
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess he hain't missed his way a great deal. Er&mdash;come in&mdash;come
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington took a couple of steps forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood that you were to be alone,&rdquo; he remarked, addressing Jethro
      with an attempted severity of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't say so&mdash;d-didn't say so, did I?&rdquo; answered Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, &ldquo;any other time will do for this little
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;good night,&rdquo; said Jethro, shortly, and there was the suspicion
      of a gleam in his eye as Mr. Worthington turned away. The mill-owner, in
      fact, did not get any farther than the edge of the porch before he wheeled
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The affair which I have to discuss with you is of a private nature, Mr.
      Bass,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I callated,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have the place to yourselves, gentlemen,&rdquo; Wetherell put in
      uneasily, and then Mr. Worthington came as far as the door, where he stood
      looking at the storekeeper with scant friendliness. Jethro turned to
      Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a politician, Will?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a business man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ever tell folks what you hear other people say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; the storekeeper answered; &ldquo;I'm not interested in other
      people's business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;Guess you'd better stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't care to stay,&rdquo; Wetherell objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay to oblige me&mdash;stay to oblige me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, if you put it that way,&rdquo; Wetherell said, beginning to get some
      amusement out of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know what Jethro's object was in this matter; perhaps others
      may guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington, who had stood by with ill-disguised impatience during
      this colloquy, note broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is most unusual, Mr. Bass, to have a third person present at a
      conference in which he has no manner of concern. I think on the whole,
      since you have insisted upon my coming to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-hain't insisted that I know of,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, &ldquo;never mind that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would be better for me to come to you some other time, when
      you are alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Wetherell had shut the door, and they had gradually walked
      to the rear of the store. Jethro parted his coat tails, and sat down again
      in the armchair. Wetherell, not wishing to be intrusive, went to his desk
      again, leaving the first citizen standing among the barrels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what other time?&rdquo; Jethro asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any other time,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow night?&rdquo; suggested Mr. Worthington, striving to hide his
      annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-busy to-morrow night,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that what I have to talk to you about is of the utmost
      importance,&rdquo; said Worthington. &ldquo;Let us say Saturday night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-busy Saturday night,&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;Meet you to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noon,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Mr. Worthington, dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Band stand in Brampton Street,&rdquo; said Jethro, and the storekeeper was fain
      to bend over his desk to conceal his laughter, busying himself with his
      books. Mr. Worthington sat down with as much dignity as he could muster on
      one of Jonah's old chairs, and Jonah Winch's clock ticked and ticked, and
      Wetherell's pen scratched and scratched on his weekly letter to Mr.
      Willard, although he knew that he was writing the sheerest nonsense. As a
      matter of fact, he tore up the sheets the next morning without reading
      them. Mr. Worthington unbuttoned his coat, fumbled in his pocket, and
      pulled out two cigars, one of which he pushed toward Jethro, who shook his
      head. Mr. Worthington lighted his cigar and cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have observed, Mr. Bass,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this is a rapidly
      growing section of the state&mdash;that the people hereabouts are every
      day demanding modern and efficient means of communication with the outside
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Struck you as a mill owner, has it?&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not care to emphasize my private interests,&rdquo; answered Mr.
      Worthington, at last appearing to get into his stride again. &ldquo;I wish to
      put the matter on broader grounds. Men like you and me ought not to be so
      much concerned with our own affairs as with those of the population
      amongst whom we live. And I think I am justified in putting it to you on
      these grounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-have to be justified, do you&mdash;have to be justified?&rdquo; Jethro
      inquired. &ldquo;Er&mdash;why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a poser, and for a moment he stared at Jethro, blankly, until he
      decided how to take it. Then he crossed his legs and blew smoke toward the
      ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly fairer to everybody to take the broadest view of a
      situation,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;I am trying to regard this from the aspect of a
      citizen, and I am quite sure that it will appeal to you in the same light.
      If the spirit which imbued the founders of this nation means anything, Mr.
      Bass, it means that the able men who are given a chance to rise by their
      own efforts must still retain the duties and responsibilities of the
      humblest citizens. That, I take it, is our position, Mr. Bass,&mdash;yours
      and mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington had uncrossed his legs, and was now by the inspiration of
      his words impelled to an upright position. Suddenly he glanced at Jethro,
      and started for Jethro had sunk down on the small of his back, his chin on
      his chest, in an attitude of lassitude if not of oblivion. There was a
      silence perhaps a little disconcerting for Mr. Worthington, who chose the
      opportunity to relight his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-got through?&rdquo; said Jethro, without moving, &ldquo;g-got through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through?&rdquo; echoed Mr. Worthington, &ldquo;through what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-through Sunday-school,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worthington dropped his match and stamped on it, and Wetherell began to
      wonder how much the man would stand. It suddenly came over the storekeeper
      that the predicament in which Mr. Worthington found himself whatever it
      was&mdash;must be a very desperate one. He half rose in his chair, sat
      down again, and lighted another match.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;director in the Truro Road, hain't you, Mr. Worthington?&rdquo; asked
      Jethro, without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;principal stockholder&mdash;ain't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but that is neither here nor there, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Road don't pay&mdash;r-road don't pay, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly does not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-would pay if it went to Brampton and Harwich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass, the company consider that they are pledged to the people of
      this section to get the road through. I am not prepared to say whether the
      road would pay, but it is quite likely that it would not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ch-charitable organization?&rdquo; said Jethro, from the depths of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pioneers in such matters take enormous risks for the benefit of the
      community, sir. We believe that we are entitled to a franchise, and in my
      opinion the General Court are behaving disgracefully in refusing us one. I
      will not say all I think about that affair, Mr. Bass. I am convinced that
      influences are at work&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off with a catch in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-tried to get a franchise, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not here to quibble with you, Mr. Bass. We tried to get it by every
      legitimate means, and failed, and you know it as well as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Heth Sutton didn't sign his receipt&mdash;er&mdash;did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The storekeeper, not being a politician, was not aware that the somewhat
      obscure reference of Jethro's to the Speaker of the House concerned an
      application which Mr. Worthington was supposed to have made to that
      gentleman, who had at length acknowledged his inability to oblige, and had
      advised Mr. Worthington to go to headquarters. And Mr. Stephen Merrill,
      who had come to Brampton out of the kindness of his heart, had only
      arranged this meeting in a conversation with Jethro that day, after the
      reform speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington sprang to his feet, and flung out a hand toward Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove your insinuations, air,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I defy you to prove your
      insinuations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jethro still sat unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-Heth in the charitable organization, too?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People told me I was a fool to believe in honesty, but I thought better
      of the lawmakers of my state. I'll tell you plainly what they said to me,
      sir. They said, 'Go to Jethro Bass.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so you have, hain't you? So you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have. I've come to appeal to you in behalf of the people of your
      section to allow that franchise to go through the present Legislature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;come to appeal, have you&mdash;come to appeal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, sitting down again; &ldquo;I have come to-night to
      appeal to you in the name of the farmers and merchants of this region&mdash;your
      neighbors,&mdash;to use your influence to get that franchise. I have come
      to you with the conviction that I shall not have appealed in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;appealed to Heth in the name of the farmers and merchants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sutton is Speaker of the House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-farmers and merchants elected him,&rdquo; remarked Jethro, as though stating
      a fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worthington coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is probable that I made a mistake in going to Sutton,&rdquo; he admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I w-wanted to catch a pike, w-wouldn't use a pin-hook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known,&rdquo; remarked Worthington, after a pause, &ldquo;that Sutton
      could not have been elected Speaker without your influence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro did not answer that, but still remained sunk in his chair. To all
      appearances he might have been asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-worth somethin' to the farmers and merchants to get that road through&mdash;w-worth
      somethin', ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell held his breath. For a moment Mr. Worthington sat very still,
      his face drawn, and then he wet his lips and rose slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may as well end this conversation, Mr. Bass,&rdquo; he said, and though he
      tried to speak firmly his voice shook, &ldquo;it seems to be useless. Good
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up his hat and walked slowly toward the door, but Jethro did not
      move or speak. Mr. Worthington reached the door opened it, and the night
      breeze started the lamp to smoking. Wetherell got up and turned it down,
      and the first citizen was still standing in the doorway. His back was
      toward them, but the fingers of his left hand&mdash;working convulsively
      caught Wetherell's eye and held it; save for the ticking of the clock and
      the chirping of the crickets in the grass, there was silence. Then Mr.
      Worthington closed the door softly, hesitated, turned, and came back and
      stood before Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we've got to have that franchise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell glanced at the countryman who, without moving in his
      chair, without raising his voice, had brought the first citizen of
      Brampton to his knees. The thing frightened the storekeeper, revolted him,
      and yet its drama held him fascinated. By some subtle process which he had
      actually beheld, but could not fathom, this cold Mr. Worthington, this
      bank president who had given him sage advice, this preacher of political
      purity, had been reduced to a frenzied supplicant. He stood bending over
      Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your price? Name it, for God's sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-better wait till you get the bill&mdash;hadn't you? b-better wait till
      you get the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you put the franchise through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin' down to the capital soon?&rdquo; Jethro inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going down on Thursday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-better come in and see me,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; answered Mr. Worthington; &ldquo;I'll be in at two o'clock on
      Thursday.&rdquo; And then, without another word to either of them, he swung on
      his heel and strode quickly out of the store. Jethro did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell's hand was trembling so that he could not write, and he
      could not trust his voice to speak. Although Jethro had never mentioned
      Isaac Worthington's name to him, Wetherell knew that Jethro hated the
      first citizen of Brampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when the sound of the wheels had died away, Jethro broke the
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;didn't laugh&mdash;did he, Will? Didn't laugh once&mdash;did
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh!&rdquo; echoed the storekeeper, who himself had never been further from
      laughter in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-might have let him off easier if he'd laughed,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;if he'd
      laughed just once, m-might have let him off easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with this remark he went out of the store and left Wetherell alone.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The weekly letter to the Newcastle Guardian was not finished that night,
      but Coniston slept, peacefully, unaware of Mr. Worthington's visit; and
      never, indeed, discovered it, since the historian for various reasons of
      his own did not see fit to insert the event in his plan of the Town
      History. Before another sun had set Jethro Bass had departed for the state
      capital, not choosing to remain to superintend the haying of the many
      farms which had fallen into his hand,&mdash;a most unusual omission for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently rumors of a mighty issue about the Truro Railroad began to be
      discussed by the politicians at the Coniston store, and Jake Wheeler held
      himself in instant readiness to answer a summons to the capital&mdash;which
      never came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delegations from Brampton and Harwich went to petition the Legislature for
      the franchise, and the Brampton Clarion and Harwich Sentinel declared that
      the people of Truro County recognized in Isaac Worthington a great and
      public-spirited man, who ought by all means to be the next governor&mdash;if
      the franchise went through.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening Lem Hallowell, after depositing a box of trimmings at Ephraim
      Prescott's harness shop, drove up to the platform of the store with the
      remark that &ldquo;things were gittin' pretty hot down to the capital in that
      franchise fight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hain't you b'en sent for yet, Jake?&rdquo; he cried, throwing his reins over
      the backs of his sweating Morgans; &ldquo;well, that's strange. Guess the fight
      hain't as hot as we hear about. Jethro hain't had to call out his best
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a-goin' down if there's trouble,&rdquo; declared Jake, who consistently
      ignored banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better git up and git,&rdquo; said Lem; &ldquo;there's three out of the five
      railroads against Truro, and Steve Merrill layin' low. Bije Bixby's down
      there, and Heth Sutton, and Abner Parkinson, and all the big bugs. Better
      get aboard, Jake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the discussion was interrupted by the sight of Cynthia
      Wetherell coming across the green with an open letter in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a message from Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement was sufficient to warrant the sensation it produced on
      all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't a letter from Jethro, is it?&rdquo; exclaimed Sam Price, overcome by a
      pardonable curiosity. For it was well known that one of Jethro's fixed
      principles in life was embodied in his own motto, &ldquo;Don't write&mdash;send.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very funny,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, looking down at the paper with a
      puzzled expression. &ldquo;'Dear Cynthia: Judge Bass wished me to say to you
      that he would be pleased if you and Will would come to the capital and
      spend a week with him at the Pelican House, and see the sights. The judge
      says Rias Richardson will tend store. Yours truly, P. Hartington.' That's
      all,&rdquo; said Cynthia, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment you could have heard a pine needle drop on the stoop. Then
      Rias thrust his hands in his pockets and voiced the general sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be&mdash;goldurned!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't say nothin' about Jake?&rdquo; queried Lem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, &ldquo;that's all&mdash;except two pieces of cardboard
      with something about the Truro Railroad and our names. I don't know what
      they are.&rdquo; And she took them from the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I could tell you if I was pressed,&rdquo; said Lem, amid a shout of
      merriment from the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Air you goin', Will?&rdquo; said Sam Price, pausing with his foot on the step
      of his buggy, that he might have the complete news before he left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfrey, Will,&rdquo; exclaimed Rigs, breathlessly, &ldquo;you hain't a-goin' to
      throw up a chance to stay a hull week at the Pelican, be you?&rdquo; The mere
      possibility of refusal overpowered Rias.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who are familiar with that delightful French song which treats of
      the leave-taking of one Monsieur Dumollet will appreciate, perhaps, the
      attentions which were showered upon William Wetherell and Cynthia upon
      their departure for the capital next morning. Although Mr. Wetherell had
      at one time been actually a resident of Boston, he received quite as many
      cautions from his neighbors as Monsieur Dumollet. Billets doux and pistols
      were, of course, not mentioned, but it certainly behooved him, when he
      should have arrived at that place of intrigues, to be on the lookout for
      cabals.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took the stage-coach from Brampton over the pass: picturesque
      stage-coach with its apple-green body and leather springs, soon to be laid
      away forever if the coveted Truro Franchise Bill becomes a law;
      stage-coach which pulls up defiantly beside its own rival at Truro
      station, where our passengers take the train down the pleasant waterways
      and past the little white villages among the fruit trees to the capital.
      The thrill of anticipation was in Cynthia's blood, and the flush of
      pleasure on her cheeks, when they stopped at last under the sheds. The
      conductor snapped his fingers and cried, &ldquo;This way, Judge,&rdquo; and there was
      Jethro in his swallow-tailed coat and stove-pipe hat awaiting them. He
      seized Wetherell's carpet-bag with one hand and Cynthia's arm with the
      other, and shouldered his way through the people, who parted when they saw
      who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; cried Cynthia, breathlessly, &ldquo;I didn't know you were a
      judge. What are you judge of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J-judge of clothes, Cynthy. D-don't you wish you had the red cloth to
      wear here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;I'm glad enough to be here without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-glad to hev you in any fixin's, Cynthy,&rdquo; he said, giving her arm a
      little squeeze, and by that time they were up the hill and William
      Wetherell quite winded. For Jethro was strong as an ox, and Cynthia's
      muscles were like an Indian's.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were among the glories of Main Street now. The capital was then, and
      still remains, a typically beautiful New England city, with wide streets
      shaded by shapely maples and elms, with substantial homes set back amidst
      lawns and gardens. Here on Main Street were neat brick business buildings
      and banks and shops, with the park-like grounds of the Capitol farther on,
      and everywhere, from curb to doorway, were knots of men talking politics;
      broad-faced, sunburned farmers in store clothes, with beards that hid
      their shirt fronts; keen-featured, sallow, country lawyers in long black
      coats crumpled from much sitting on the small of the back; country
      storekeepers with shrewd eyes, and local proprietors and manufacturers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro, I didn't know you were such a great man,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how did ye find out, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way people treat you here. I knew you were great, of course,&rdquo; she
      hastened to add.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how do they treat me?&rdquo; he asked, looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;They all stop talking when you come along and
      stare at you. But why don't you speak to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro smiled and squeezed her arm again, and then they were in the
      corridor of the famous Pelican Hotel, hazy with cigar smoke and filled
      with politicians. Some were standing, hanging on to pillars,
      gesticulating, some were ranged in benches along the wall, and a chosen
      few were in chairs grouped around the spittoons. Upon the appearance of
      Jethro's party, the talk was hushed, the groups gave way, and they
      accomplished a kind of triumphal march to the desk. The clerk, descrying
      them, desisted abruptly from a conversation across the cigar counter, and
      with all the form of a ceremony dipped the pen with a flourish into the
      ink and handed it to Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your rooms are ready, Judge,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they started for the stairs, Jethro and Cynthia leading the way,
      Wetherell felt a touch on his elbow and turned to confront Mr. Bijah Bixby&mdash;at
      very close range, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-come down at last, Will?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thought ye would. Need everybody
      this time&mdash;you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came on pleasure,&rdquo; retorted Mr. Wetherell, somewhat angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bixby appeared hugely to enjoy the joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I callated,&rdquo; he cried, still holding Wetherell's hand in a mild, but
      persuasive grip. &ldquo;So I callated. Guess I done you an injustice, Will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a leetle mite smarter than I thought you was. So long. Got a
      leetle business now&mdash;you understand a leetle business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible, indeed, for the simple-minded to come to the capital and
      not become involved in cabals? With some misgivings William Wetherell
      watched Mr. Bixby disappear among the throng, kicking up his heels behind,
      and then went upstairs. On the first floor Cynthia was standing by an open
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;come and see the rooms Uncle Jethro's got for us!&rdquo; She
      took Wetherell's hand and led him in. &ldquo;See the lace curtains, and the
      chandelier, and the big bureau with the marble top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro had parted his coat tails and seated himself enjoyably on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't come often,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;m-might as well have the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro,&rdquo; said Wetherell, coughing nervously and fumbling in the pocket of
      his coat, &ldquo;you've been very kind to us, and we hardly know how to thank
      you. I&mdash;I didn't have any use for these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out the pieces of cardboard which had come in Cynthia's letter. He
      dared not look at Jethro, and his eye was fixed instead upon the somewhat
      grandiose signature of Isaac D. Worthington, which they bore. Jethro took
      them and tore them up, and slowly tossed the pieces into a cuspidor
      conveniently situated near the foot of the bed. He rose and thrust his
      hands into his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;when you get freshened up, come into Number 7,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number 7! But we shall come to that later. Supper first, in a great
      pillared dining room filled with notables, if we only had the key. Jethro
      sits silent at the head of the table eating his crackers and milk, with
      Cynthia on his left and William Wetherell on his right. Poor William,
      greatly embarrassed by his sudden projection into the limelight, is
      helpless in the clutches of a lady-waitress who is demanding somewhat
      fiercely that he make an immediate choice from a list of dishes which she
      is shooting at him with astonishing rapidity. But who is this, sitting
      beside him, who comes to William's rescue, and demands that the lady
      repeat the bill of fare? Surely a notable, for he has a generous presence,
      and jet-black whiskers which catch the light, which give the gentleman, as
      Mr. Bixby remarked, &ldquo;quite a settin'.&rdquo; Yes, we have met him at last. It is
      none other than the Honorable Heth Sutton, Rajah of Clovelly, Speaker of
      the House, who has condescended to help Mr. Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chamberlain, Mr. Bijah Bixby, sits on the other side of the Honorable
      Heth, and performs the presentation of Mr. Wetherell. But Mr. Sutton, as
      becomes a man of high position, says little after he has rebuked the
      waitress, and presently departs with a carefully chosen toothpick;
      whereupon Mr. Bixby moves into the vacant seat&mdash;not to Mr.
      Wetherell's unqualified delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've knowed him ever sense we was boys,&rdquo; said Mr. Bixby; &ldquo;you saw how
      intimate we was. When he wants a thing done, he says, 'Bije, you go out
      and get 'em.' Never counts the cost. He was nice to you&mdash;wahn't he,
      Will?&rdquo; And then Mr. Bixby leaned over and whispered in Mr. Wetherell's
      ear; &ldquo;He knows&mdash;you understand&mdash;he knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knows what?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bixby gave him another admiring look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knows you didn't come down here with Jethro jest to see the sights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the talk in the dining room fell flat, and looking up
      William Wetherell perceived a portly, rubicund man of middle age being
      shown to his seat by the headwaiter. The gentleman wore a great,
      glittering diamond in his shirt, and a watch chain that contained much
      fine gold. But the real cause of the silence was plainly in the young
      woman who walked beside him, and whose effective entrance argued no little
      practice and experience. She was of a type that catches the eye
      involuntarily and holds it,&mdash;tall, well-rounded, fresh-complexioned,
      with heavy coils of shimmering gold hair. Her pawn, which was far from
      unbecoming, was in keeping with those gifts with which nature had endowed
      her. She carried her head high, and bestowed swift and evidently fatal
      glances to right and left during her progress through the room. Mr.
      Bixby's voice roused the storekeeper from this contemplation of the
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Alvy Hopkins of Gosport and his daughter. Fine gal, hain't she?
      Ever sense she come down here t'other day she's stirred up more turmoil
      than any railroad bill I ever seed. She was most suffocated at the
      governor's ball with fellers tryin' to get dances&mdash;some of 'em old
      fellers, too. And you understand about Alvy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alvy says he's a-goin' to be the next governor, or fail up.&rdquo; Mr. Bixby's
      voice sank to a whisper, and he spoke into Mr. Wetherell's ear. &ldquo;Alvy says
      he has twenty-five thousand dollars to put in if necessary. I'll introduce
      you to him, Will,&rdquo; he added meaningly. &ldquo;Guess you can help him some&mdash;you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bixby!&rdquo; cried Mr. Wetherell, putting down his knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Mr. Bixby, reassuringly; &ldquo;'twon't be no bother. I know him
      as well as I do you&mdash;call each other by our given names. Guess I was
      the first man he sent for last spring. He knows I go through all them
      river towns. He says, 'Bije, you get 'em.' I understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell began to realize the futility of trying to convince Mr.
      Bixby of his innocence in political matters, and glanced at Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't think he was listenin', would you, Will?&rdquo; Mr. Bixby
      remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ears are sharp as a dog's. Callate he kin hear as far as the governor's
      table, and he don't look as if he knows anything. One way he built up his
      power&mdash;listenin' when they're talkin' sly out there in the rotunda.
      They're almighty surprised when they l'arn he knows what they're up to.
      Guess you understand how to go along by quiet and listen when they're
      talkin' sly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did such a thing in my life,&rdquo; cried William Wetherell,
      indignantly aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Bixby winked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long, Will,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;see you in Number 7.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never, since the days of Pompadour and Du Barry, until modern American
      politics were invented, has a state been ruled from such a place as Number
      7 in the Pelican House&mdash;familiarly known as the Throne Room. In this
      historic cabinet there were five chairs, a marble-topped table, a pitcher
      of iced water, a bureau, a box of cigars and a Bible, a chandelier with
      all the gas jets burning, and a bed, whereon sat such dignitaries as
      obtained an audience,&mdash;railroad presidents, governors and
      ex-governors and prospective governors, the Speaker, the President of the
      Senate, Bijah Bixby, Peleg Hartington, mighty chiefs from the North
      Country, and lieutenants from other parts of the state. These sat on the
      bed by preference. Jethro sat in a chair by the window, and never took any
      part in the discussions that raged, but listened. Generally there was some
      one seated beside him who talked persistently in his ear; as at present,
      for instance, Mr. Chauncey Weed, Chairman of the Committee on Corporations
      of the House, who took the additional precaution of putting his hand to
      his mouth when he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stephen Merrill was in the Throne Room that evening, and
      confidentially explained to the bewildered William Wetherell the exact
      situation in the Truro Franchise fight. Inasmuch as it has become our duty
      to describe this celebrated conflict,&mdash;in a popular and engaging
      manner, if possible,&mdash;we shall have to do so through Mr. Wetherell's
      eyes, and on his responsibility. The biographies of some of the gentlemen
      concerned have since been published, and for some unaccountable reason
      contain no mention of the Truro franchise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All Gaul,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill&mdash;he was speaking to a literary man&mdash;&ldquo;all
      Gaul is divided into five railroads. I am one, the Grand Gulf and
      Northern, the impecunious one. That is the reason I'm so nice to
      everybody, Mr. Wetherell. The other day a conductor on my road had a shock
      of paralysis when a man paid his fare. Then there's Batch, president of
      the 'Down East' road, as we call it. Batch and I are out of this fight,&mdash;we
      don't care whether Isaac D. Worthington gets his franchise or not, or I
      wouldn't be telling you this. The two railroads which don't want him to
      get it, because the Truro would eventually become a competitor with them,
      are the Central and the Northwestern. Alexander Duncan is president of the
      Central.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alexander Duncan!&rdquo; exclaimed Wetherell. &ldquo;He's the richest man in the
      state, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill, &ldquo;and he lives in a big square house right here in
      the capital. He ain't a bad fellow, Duncan. You'd like him. He loves
      books. I wish you could see his library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid there's not much chance of that,&rdquo; answered Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I say, there's Duncan, of the Central, and the other is Lovejoy,
      of the Northwestern. Lovejoy's a bachelor and a skinflint. Those two,
      Duncan and Lovejoy, are using every means in their power to prevent
      Worthington from getting that franchise. Have I made myself clear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Mr. Worthington will get it?&rdquo; asked Wetherell, who had in
      mind a certain nocturnal visit at his store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill almost leaped out of his chair at the question. Then he mopped
      his face, and winked very deliberately at the storekeeper. Then Mr.
      Merrill laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for a man who comes down here to stay with Jethro
      Bass to ask me that!&rdquo; Whereupon Mr. Wetherell flushed, and began to
      perspire himself. &ldquo;Didn't you hear Isaac D. Worthington's virtuous appeal
      to the people at Brampton?&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Wetherell, getting redder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you, Will,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill, unexpectedly, &ldquo;darned if I don't.
      I'll tell you what I know about it, and you can have a little fun while
      you're here, lookin' on, only it won't do to write about it to the
      Newcastle Guardian. Guess Willard wouldn't publish it, anyhow. I suppose
      you know that Jethro pulls the strings, end we little railroad presidents
      dance. We're the puppets now, but after a while, when I'm crowded out, all
      these little railroads will get together and there'll be a row worth
      looking at, or I'm mistaken. But to go back to Worthington,&rdquo; continued Mr.
      Merrill, &ldquo;he made a little mistake with his bill in the beginning. Instead
      of going to Jethro, he went to Heth Sutton, and Heth got the bill as far
      as the Committee on Corporations, and there she's been ever since, with
      our friend Chauncey Weed, who's whispering over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sutton couldn't even get it out of the Committee!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not an inch. Jethro saw this thing coming about a year ago, and he took
      the precaution to have Chauncey Weed and the rest of the Committee in his
      pocket&mdash;and of course Heth Sutton's always been there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell thought of that imposing and manly personage, the
      Honorable Heth Sutton, being in Jethro's pocket, and marvelled. Mr.
      Chauncey Weed seemed of a species better able to thrive in the atmosphere
      of pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as I say, there was the Truro Franchise Bill sound asleep in the
      Committee, and when Isaac D. Worthington saw that his little arrangement
      with Heth Sutton wasn't any good, and that the people of the state didn't
      have anything more to say about it than the Crow Indians, and that the end
      of the session was getting nearer and nearer, he got desperate and went to
      Jethro, I suppose. You know as well as I do that Jethro has agreed to put
      the bill through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why doesn't he get the Committee to report it and put it through?&rdquo;
       asked Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless your simple literary nature,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr Merrill, &ldquo;Jethro's got
      more power than any man in the state, but that isn't saying that he
      doesn't have to fight occasionally. He has to fight now. He has seven of
      the twelve senators hitched, and the governor. But Duncan and Lovejoy have
      bought up all the loose blocks of representatives, and it is supposed that
      the franchise forces only control a quorum. The end of the session is a
      week off, and never in all my experience have I seen a more praiseworthy
      attendance on the part of members.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that they are being paid to remain in their seats?&rdquo; cried the
      amazed Mr. Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Mr. Merrill, with a twinkle in his eye, &ldquo;that is a little
      bald and&mdash;and unparliamentary, perhaps, but fairly accurate. Our
      friend Jethro is confronted with a problem to tax even his faculties, and
      to look at him, a man wouldn't suspect he had a care in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro was apparently quite as free from anxiety the next morning when he
      offered, after breakfast, to show Wetherell and Cynthia the sights of the
      town, though Wetherell could not but think that the Throne Room and the
      Truro Franchise Bill were left at a very crucial moment to take care of
      themselves. Jethro talked to Cynthia&mdash;or rather, Cynthia talked to
      Jethro upon innumerable subject's; they looked upon the statue of a great
      statesman in the park, and Cynthia read aloud the quotation graven on the
      rock of the pedestal, &ldquo;The People's Government, made for the People, made
      by the People, and answerable to the People.&rdquo; After that they went into
      the state library, where Wetherell was introduced to the librarian, Mr.
      Storrow. They did not go into the State House because, as everybody knows,
      Jethro Bass never went there. Mr. Bijah Bixby and other lieutenants might
      be seen in the lobbies, and the governor might sign bills in his own
      apartment there, but the real seat of government was that Throne Room into
      which we have been permitted to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked out beyond the outskirts of the town, where there was a grove
      or picnic ground which was also used as a park by some of the inhabitants.
      Jethro liked the spot, and was in the habit sometimes of taking refuge
      there when the atmosphere of the Pelican House became too thick. The three
      of them had sat down on one of the board benches to rest, when presently
      two people were seen at a little distance walking among the trees, and the
      sight of them, for some reason, seemed to give Jethro infinite pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia, &ldquo;one of them is that horrid girl everybody was
      looking at in the dining room last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't like her, Cynthy?&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty&mdash;hain't she&mdash;pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's brazen,&rdquo; declared Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, Miss Cassandra Hopkins, daughter of that Honorable Alva
      who&mdash;according to Mr. Bixby was all ready with a certain sum of money
      to be the next governor. Miss Cassandra was arrayed fluffily in cool, pink
      lawn, and she carried a fringed parasol, and she was gazing upward with
      telling effect into the face of the gentleman by her side. This would have
      all been very romantic if the gentleman had been young and handsome, but
      he was certainly not a man to sweep a young girl off her feet. He was
      tall, angular, though broad-shouldered, with a long, scrawny neck that
      rose out of a very low collar, and a large head, scantily covered with
      hair&mdash;a head that gave a physical as well as a mental effect of
      hardness. His smooth-shaven face seemed to bear witness that its owner was
      one who had pushed frugality to the borders of a vice. It was not a
      pleasant face, but now it wore an almost benign expression under the
      influence of Miss Cassandra's eyes. So intent, apparently, were both of
      them upon each other that they did not notice the group on the bench at
      the other side of the grove. William Wetherell ventured to ask Jethro who
      the man was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-name's Lovejoy,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovejoy!&rdquo; ejaculated the storekeeper, thinking of what Mr. Merrill had
      told him of the opponents of the Truro Franchise Bill. &ldquo;President of the
      'Northwestern' Railroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro gave his friend a shrewd look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-gettin' posted&mdash;hain't you, Will?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she going to marry that old man?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro smiled a little. &ldquo;G-guess not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;g-guess not, if the old
      man can help it. Nobody's married him yet, and hain't likely to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro was unusually silent on the way back to the hotel, but he did not
      seem to be worried or displeased. He only broke his silence once, in fact,
      when Cynthia called his attention to a large poster of some bloodhounds on
      a fence, announcing the fact in red letters that &ldquo;Uncle Tom's Cabin&rdquo; would
      be given by a certain travelling company at the Opera House the next
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L-like to go, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Uncle Jethro, do you think we can go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never b'en to a show&mdash;hev you&mdash;never b'en to a show?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never in my life,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll all go,&rdquo; said Jethro, and he repeated it once or twice as they came
      to Main Street, seemingly greatly tickled at the prospect. And there was
      the Truro Franchise Bill hanging over him, with only a week left of the
      session, and Lovejoy's and Duncan's men sitting so tight in their seats!
      William Wetherell could not understand it.

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, when Mr. Wetherell knocked timidly at Number 7,&mdash;drawn
      thither by an irresistible curiosity,&mdash;the door was opened by a
      portly person who wore a shining silk hat and ample gold watch chain. The
      gentleman had, in fact, just arrived; but he seemed perfectly at home as
      he laid down his hat on the marble-topped bureau, mopped his face, took a
      glass of iced water at a gulp, chose a cigar, and sank down gradually on
      the bed. Mr. Wetherell recognized him instantly as the father of the
      celebrated Cassandra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jethro,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;I've got to come into the Throne Room
      once a day anyhow, just to make sure you don't forget me&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-Alvy,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;I want you to shake hands with a particular friend
      of mine, Mr. Will Wetherell of Coniston. Er&mdash;Will, the Honorable Alvy
      Hopkins of Gosport.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hopkins rose from the bed as gradually as he had sunk down upon it,
      and seized Mr. Wetherell's hand impressively. His own was very moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard you was in town, Mr. Wetherell,&rdquo; he said heartily. &ldquo;If Jethro calls
      you a particular friend, it means something, I guess. It means something
      to me, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will hain't a politician,&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;Er&mdash;Alvy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said Mr. Hopkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Will don't talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Jethro had been real tactful,&rdquo; said the Honorable Alvy, sinking down
      again, &ldquo;he'd have introduced me as the next governor of the state.
      Everybody knows I want to be governor, everybody knows I've got twenty
      thousand dollars in the bank to pay for that privilege. Everybody knows
      I'm going to be governor if Jethro says so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell was a little taken aback at this ingenuous statement of
      the gentleman from Gosport. He looked out of the window through the
      foliage of the park, and his eye was caught by the monument there in front
      of the State House, and he thought of the inscription on the base of it,
      &ldquo;The People's Government.&rdquo; The Honorable Alva had not mentioned the people&mdash;undoubtedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Wetherell, twenty thousand dollars.&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;Time was when a
      man could be governor for ten. Those were the good old days&mdash;eh,
      Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-Alvy, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin's' comin' to town tomorrow&mdash;to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't tell me,&rdquo; said the Honorable Alva, acquiescing cheerfully in
      the change of subject. &ldquo;We'll go. Pleased to have you, too, Mr.
      Wetherell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alvy,&rdquo; said Jethro, again, &ldquo;'Uncle Tom's Cabin' comes to town to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hopkins stopped fanning himself, and glanced at Jethro questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-Alvy, that give you an idea?&rdquo; said Jethro, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wetherell looked blank: it gave him no idea whatsoever, except of
      little Eva and the bloodhounds. For a few moments the Honorable Alva
      appeared to be groping, too, and then his face began to crease into a
      smile of comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Godfrey, Jethro, but you are smart.&rdquo; he exclaimed, with involuntary
      tribute; &ldquo;you mean buy up the theatre?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-callate you'll find it's bought up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean pay for it?&rdquo; said Mr. Hopkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've guessed it, Alvy, you've guessed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hopkins gazed at him in admiration, leaned out of the perpendicular,
      and promptly drew from his trousers' pocket a roll of stupendous
      proportions. Wetting his thumb, he began to push aside the top bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is it?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jethro put up his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hurry, Alvy&mdash;n-no hurry. H-Honorable Alvy Hopkins of Gosport&mdash;p-patron
      of the theatre. Hain't the first time you've b'en a patron, Alvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro,&rdquo; said Mr. Hopkins, solemnly, putting up his money, &ldquo;I'm much
      obliged to you. I'm free to say I'd never have thought of it. If you ain't
      the all-firedest smartest man in America to-day,&mdash;I don't except any,
      even General Grant,&mdash;then I ain't the next governor of this state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon he lapsed into an even more expressive silence, his face still
      glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Alvy,&rdquo; said Jethro presently, &ldquo;what's the name of your gal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hopkins, &ldquo;I guess you've got me. We did christen her Lily,
      but she didn't turn out exactly Lily. She ain't the type,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Hopkins, slowly, not without a note of regret, and lapsed into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what did you say her name was, Alvy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess her name's Cassandra,&rdquo; said the Honorable Alva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-Cassandry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; he explained a trifle apologetically, &ldquo;she's kind of
      taken some matters in her own hands, my gal. Didn't like Lily, and it
      didn't seem to fit her anyway, so she called herself Cassandra. Read it in
      a book. It means, 'inspirer of love,' or some such poetry, but I don't
      deny that it goes with her better than Lily would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-she's a good deal of a gal, Alvy&mdash;fine-appearin' gal, Alvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Jethro, I didn't know you ever looked at a woman. But I
      suppose you couldn't help lookin' at my gal&mdash;she does seem to draw
      men's eyes as if she was magnetized some way.&rdquo; Mr. Hopkins did not speak
      as though this quality of his daughter gave him unmixed delight. &ldquo;But
      she's a good-hearted gal, Cassy is, high-spirited, and I won't deny she's
      handsome and smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll kind of grace my position when I'm governor. But to tell you the
      truth, Jethro, one old friend to another, durned if I don't wish she was
      married. It's a terrible thing for a father to say, I know, but I'd feel
      easier about her if she was married to some good man who could hold her.
      There's young Joe Turner in Gosport, he'd give his soul to have her, and
      he'd do. Cassy says she's after bigger game than Joe. She's young&mdash;that's
      her only excuse. Funny thing happened night before last,&rdquo; continued Mr.
      Hopkins, laughing. &ldquo;Lovejoy saw her, and he's b'en out of his head ever
      since. Al must be pretty near my age, ain't he? Well, there's no fool like
      an old fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-Alvy introduce me to Cassandry sometime will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; answered Mr. Hopkins, heartily, &ldquo;I'll bring her in here.
      And now how about gettin' an adjournment to-morrow night for 'Uncle Tom's
      Cabin'? These night sessions kind of interfere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, when the representatives were pouring into the rotunda
      for dinner, a crowd was pressing thickly around the desk to read a placard
      pinned on the wall above it. The placard announced the coming of Mr.
      Glover's Company for the following night, and that the Honorable Alva
      Hopkins of Gosport, ex-Speaker of the House, had bought three hundred and
      twelve seats for the benefit of the members. And the Honorable Alva
      himself, very red in the face and almost smothered, could be dimly
      discerned at the foot of the stairs trying to fight his way out of a group
      of overenthusiastic friends and admirers. Alva&mdash;so it was said on all
      sides&mdash;was doing the right thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was that one sensation followed another at the capital, and the
      politicians for the moment stopped buzzing over the Truro Franchise Bill
      to discuss Mr. Hopkins and his master-stroke. The afternoon Chronicle
      waxed enthusiastic on the subject of Mr. Hopkins's generosity, and
      predicted that, when Senator Hartington made the motion in the upper house
      and Mr. Jameson in the lower, the General Court would unanimously agree
      that there would be no evening session on the following day. The Honorable
      Alva was the hero of the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon Cynthia and her father walked through the green park to
      make their first visit to the State House. They stood hand in hand on the
      cool, marble-paved floor of the corridor, gazing silently at the stained
      and battered battle-flags behind the glass, and Wetherell seemed to be
      listening again to the appeal of a great President to a great Country in
      the time of her dire need&mdash;the soul calling on the body to fight for
      itself. Wetherell seemed to feel again the thrill he felt when he saw the
      blue-clad men of this state crowded in the train at Boston: and to hear
      again the cheers, and the sobs, and the prayers as he looked upon the
      blood that stained stars and stripes alike with a holy stain. With that
      blood the country had been consecrated, and the state&mdash;yes, and the
      building where they stood. So they went on up the stairs, reverently, nor
      heeded the noise of those in groups about them, and through a door into
      the great hall of the representatives of the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is a mixture of emotions, a jumble of joy and sorrow and reverence
      and mirth and flippancy, of right feeling and heresy. In the morning
      William Wetherell had laughed at Mr. Hopkins and the twenty thousand
      dollars he had put in the bank to defraud the people; but now he could
      have wept over it, and as he looked down upon the three hundred members of
      that House, he wondered how many of them represented their neighbors who
      supposedly had sent them here&mdash;and how many Mr. Lovejoy's railroad,
      Mr. Worthington's railroad, or another man's railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      But gradually he forgot the battle-flags, and his mood changed. Perhaps
      the sight of Mr. Speaker Sutton towering above the House, the very essence
      and bulk of authority, brought this about. He aroused in Wetherell
      unwilling admiration and envy when he arose to put a question in his deep
      voice, or rapped sternly with his gavel to silence the tumult of voices
      that arose from time to time; or while some member was speaking, or the
      clerk was reading a bill at breathless speed, he turned with wonderful
      nonchalance to listen to the conversation of the gentlemen on the bench
      beside him, smiled, nodded, pulled his whiskers, at once conscious and
      unconscious of his high position. And, most remarkable of all to the
      storekeeper, not a man of the three hundred, however obscure, could rise
      that the Speaker did not instantly call him by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell was occupied by such reflections as these when suddenly
      there fell a hush through the House. The clerk had stopped reading, the
      Speaker had stopped conversing, and, seizing his gavel, looked expectantly
      over the heads of the members and nodded. A sleek, comfortably dressed
      mail arose smilingly in the middle of the House, and subdued laughter
      rippled from seat to seat as he addressed the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Jameson of Wantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jameson cleared his throat impressively and looked smilingly about
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the House,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I desired to arouse
      the enthusiasm&mdash;the just enthusiasm&mdash;of any gathering in this
      House, or in this city, or in this state, I should mention the name of the
      Honorable Alva Hopkins of Gosport. I think I am right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jameson was interrupted, as he no doubt expected, by applause from
      floor and gallery. He stood rubbing his hands together, and it seemed to
      William Wetherell that the Speaker did not rap as sharply with his gavel
      as he had upon other occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of the House,&rdquo; continued Mr. Jameson, presently, &ldquo;the Honorable
      Alva Hopkins, whom we all know and love, has with unparalleled generosity&mdash;unparalleled,
      I say&mdash;bought up three hundred and twelve seats in Fosters Opera
      House for to-morrow night&rdquo; (renewed applause), &ldquo;in order that every member
      of this august body may have the opportunity to witness that most classic
      of histrionic productions, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'.&rdquo; (Loud applause, causing
      the Speaker to rap sharply.) &ldquo;That we may show a proper appreciation of
      this compliment&mdash;I move you, Mr. Speaker, that the House adjourn not
      later than six o'clock to-morrow, Wednesday evening, not to meet again
      until Thursday morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jameson of Wantage handed the resolution to a page and sat down amidst
      renewed applause. Mr. Wetherell noticed that many members turned in their
      seats as they clapped, and glancing along the gallery he caught a flash of
      red and perceived the radiant Miss Cassandra herself leaning over the
      rail, her hands clasped in ecstasy. Mr. Lovejoy was not with her&mdash;he
      evidently preferred to pay his attentions in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she is again,&rdquo; whispered Cynthia, who had taken an instinctive and
      extraordinary dislike to Miss Cassandra. Then Mr. Sutton rose majestically
      to put the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, are you ready for the question?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;All those in favor
      of the resolution of the gentleman from Wantage, Mr. Jameson&mdash;&rdquo; the
      Speaker stopped abruptly. The legislators in the front seats swung around,
      and people in the gallery craned forward to see a member standing at his
      seat in the extreme rear of the hall. He was a little man in an
      ill-fitting coat, his wizened face clean-shaven save for the broom-shaped
      beard under his chin, which he now held in his hand. His thin, nasal voice
      was somehow absurdly penetrating as he addressed the chair. Mr. Sutton was
      apparently, for once, taken by surprise, and stared a moment, as though
      racking his brain for the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman from Suffolk, Mr. Heath,&rdquo; he said, and smiling a little,
      sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman from Suffolk, still holding on to his beard, pitched in
      without preamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We farmers on the back seats don't often get a chance to be heard, Mr.
      Speaker,&rdquo; said he, amidst a general tittering from the front seats. &ldquo;We
      come down here without any l'arnin' of parli'ment'ry law, and before we
      know what's happened the session's over, and we hain't said nothin'.&rdquo;
       (More laughter.) &ldquo;There's b'en a good many times when I wanted to say
      somethin', and this time I made up my mind I was a-goin' to&mdash;law or
      no law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (Applause, and a general show of interest in the gentleman from Suffolk.)
      &ldquo;Naow, Mr. Speaker, I hain't ag'in' 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' It's a good play,
      and it's done an almighty lot of good. And I hain't sayin' nothin' ag'in'
      Alvy Hopkins nor his munificence. But I do know there's a sight of little
      bills on that desk that won't be passed if we don't set to-morrow night&mdash;little
      bills that are big bills for us farmers. That thar woodchuck bill, for
      one.&rdquo; (Laughter.) &ldquo;My constituents want I should have that bill passed. We
      don't need a quorum for them bills, but we need time. Naow, Mr. Speaker, I
      say let all them that wants to go and see 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' go and see
      it, but let a few of us fellers that has woodchuck bills and other things
      that we've got to get through come down here and pass 'em. You kin put 'em
      on the docket, and I guess if anything comes along that hain't jest right
      for everybody, somebody can challenge a quorum and bust up the session.
      That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman from Suffolk sat down amidst thunderous applause, and before
      it died away Mr. Jameson was on his feet, smiling and rubbing his hands
      together, and was recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; he said, as soon as he could be heard, &ldquo;if the gentleman
      from Suffolk desires to pass woodchuck bills&rdquo; (renewed laughter), &ldquo;he can
      do so as far as I'm concerned. I guess I know where most of the members of
      this House will be to-morrow night-&rdquo; (Cries of 'You're right', and sharp
      rapping of the gavel.) &ldquo;Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my resolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman from Wantage,&rdquo; said the Speaker, smiling broadly now,
      &ldquo;withdraws his resolution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As William Wetherell was returning to the Pelican House, pondering over
      this incident, he almost ran into a distinguished-looking man walking
      briskly across Main Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Mr. Worthington!&rdquo; said Cynthia, looking after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Worthington had a worried look on his face, and was probably too
      much engrossed in his own thoughts to notice his acquaintances. He had, in
      fact, just come from the Throne Room, where he had been to remind Jethro
      that the session was almost over, and to ask him what he meant to do about
      the Truro Bill. Jethro had given him no satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duncan and Lovejoy have their people paid to sit there night and day,&rdquo;
       Mr. Worthington had said. &ldquo;We've got a bare majority on a full House; but
      you don't seem to dare to risk it. What are you going to do about it, Mr.
      Bass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-want the bill to pass&mdash;don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Mr. Worthington had cried, on the edge of losing his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L-left it to me&mdash;didn't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I'm entitled to know what's being done. I'm paying for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-hain't paid for it yet&mdash;hev you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I most assuredly haven't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-better wait till you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was very little satisfaction in this, and Mr. Worthington had at
      length been compelled to depart, fuming, to the house of his friend the
      enemy, Mr. Duncan, there to attempt for the twentieth time to persuade Mr.
      Duncan to call off his dogs who were sitting with such praiseworthy
      pertinacity in their seats. As the two friends walked on the lawn, Mr.
      Worthington tried to explain, likewise for the twentieth time, that the
      extension of the Truro Railroad could in no way lessen the Canadian
      traffic of the Central, Mr. Duncan's road. But Mr. Duncan could not see it
      that way, and stuck to his present ally, Mr. Lovejoy, and refused
      point-blank to call off his dogs. Business was business.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an apparently inexplicable fact, however, that Mr. Worthington and
      his son Bob were guests at the Duncan mansion at the capital. Two
      countries may not be allies, but their sovereigns may be friends. In the
      present instance, Mr. Duncan and Mr. Worthington's railroads were opposed,
      diplomatically, but another year might see the Truro Railroad and the
      Central acting as one. And Mr. Worthington had no intention whatever of
      sacrificing Mr. Duncan's friendship. The first citizen of Brampton
      possessed one quality so essential to greatness&mdash;that of looking into
      the future, and he believed that the time would come when an event of some
      importance might create a perpetual alliance between himself and Mr.
      Duncan. In short, Mr. Duncan had a daughter, Janet, and Mr. Worthington,
      as we know, had a son. And Mr. Duncan, in addition to his own fortune, had
      married one of the richest heiresses in New England. Prudens futuri, that
      was Mr. Worthington's motto.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Cynthia, who was walking about the town alone, found
      herself gazing over a picket fence at a great square house with a very
      wide cornice that stood by itself in the centre of a shade-flecked lawn.
      There were masses of shrubbery here and there, and a greenhouse, and a
      latticed summer-house: and Cynthia was wondering what it would be like to
      live in a great place like that, when a barouche with two shining horses
      in silver harness drove past her and stopped before the gate. Four or five
      girls and boys came laughing out on the porch, and one of them, who held a
      fishing-rod in his hand, Cynthia recognized. Startled and ashamed, she
      began to walk on as fast as she could in the opposite direction, when she
      heard the sound of footsteps on the lawn behind her, and her own name
      called in a familiar voice. At that she hurried the faster; but she could
      not run, and the picket fence was half a block long, and Bob Worthington
      had an advantage over her. Of course it was Bob, and he did not scruple to
      run, and in a few seconds he was leaning over the fence in front of her.
      Now Cynthia was as red as a peony by this time, and she almost hated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all people, Cynthia Wetherell!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;didn't you hear me
      calling after you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you stop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't want to,&rdquo; said Cynthia, glancing at the distant group on the
      porch, who were watching them. Suddenly she turned to him defiantly. &ldquo;I
      didn't know you were in that house, or in the capital,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I didn't know you were,&rdquo; said Bob, upon whose masculine intelligence
      the meaning of her words was entirely lost. &ldquo;If I had known it, you can
      bet I would have looked you up. Where are you staying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the Pelican House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;with all the politicians? How did you happen to go
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass asked my father and me to come down for a few days,&rdquo; answered
      Cynthia, her color heightening again. Life is full of contrasts, and
      Cynthia was becoming aware of some of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro?&rdquo; said Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; said Cynthia, smiling in spite of herself. He always
      made her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro owns the Pelican House,&rdquo; said Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he? I knew he was a great man, but I didn't know how great he was
      until I came down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia said this so innocently that Bob repented his flippancy on the
      spot. He had heard occasional remarks of his elders about Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean quite that,&rdquo; he said, growing red in his turn. &ldquo;Uncle
      Jethro&mdash;Mr. Bass&mdash;is a great man of course. That's what I
      meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he's a very good man,&rdquo; said Cynthia, who understood now that he had
      spoken a little lightly of Jethro, and resented it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure of it,&rdquo; said Bob, eagerly. Then Cynthia began to walk on,
      slowly, and he followed her on the other side of the fence. &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;I haven't said half the things I want to say&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to say?&rdquo; asked Cynthia, still walking. &ldquo;I have to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you don't! Wait just a minute&mdash;won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia halted, with apparent unwillingness, and put out her toe between
      the pickets. Then she saw that there was a little patch on that toe, and
      drew it in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want to say?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;I don't believe you have
      anything to say at all.&rdquo; And suddenly she flashed a look at him that made
      his heart thump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do&mdash;I swear I do!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I'm coming down to the Pelican
      to-morrow morning to get you to go for a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia could not but think that the remoteness of the time he set was
      scarce in keeping with his ardent tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something else to do to-morrow morning,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll come to-morrow afternoon,&rdquo; said Bob, instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who lives here?&rdquo; she asked irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Duncan. I'm visiting the Duncans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a carryall joined the carriage at the gate. Cynthia glanced
      at the porch again. The group there had gown larger, and they were still
      staring. She began to feel uncomfortable again, and moved on slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayn't I come?&rdquo; asked Bob, going after her; and scraping the butt of the
      rod along the palings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't there enough girls here to satisfy you?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're enough&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but none of 'em could hold a candle
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you tell them all something like that,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't do any such thing,&rdquo; he retorted, and then he laughed himself, and
      Cynthia laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like you because you don't swallow everything whole,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;and&mdash;well,
      for a good many other reams.&rdquo; And he looked into her face with such frank
      admiration that Cynthia blushed and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe a word you say,&rdquo; she answered, and started to walk off,
      this time in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; cried Bob. They were almost at the end of the fence by this,
      and the pickets were sharp and rather high, or he would have climbed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia paused hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come at two o'clock to-morrow,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;We're going on a picnic
      to-day, to Dalton's Bend, on the river. I wish I could get out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there came a voice from the gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob! Bob Worthington!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both turned involuntarily. A slender girl with light brown hair was
      standing there, waving at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's that?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That?&rdquo; said Bob, in some confusion, &ldquo;oh, that's Janet Duncan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm coming to-morrow,&rdquo; he called after her, but she did not turn. In a
      little while she heard the carryall behind her clattering down the street,
      its passengers laughing and joking merrily. Her face burned, for she
      thought that they were laughing at her; she wished with all her heart that
      she had not stopped to talk with him at the palings. The girls, indeed,
      were giggling as the carryall passed, and she heard somebody call out his
      name, but nevertheless he leaned out of the seat and waved his hat at her,
      amid a shout of laughter. Poor Cynthia! She did not look at him. Tears of
      vexation were in her eyes, and the light of her joy at this visit to the
      capital flickered, and she wished she were back in Coniston. She thought
      it would be very nice to be rich, and to live in a great house in a city,
      and to go on picnics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light flickered, but it did not wholly go out. If it has not been
      shown that Cynthia was endowed with a fair amount of sense, many of these
      pages have been written in vain. She sat down for a while in the park and
      thought of the many things she had to be thankful for&mdash;not the least
      of which was Jethro's kindness. And she remembered that she was to see
      &ldquo;Uncle Tom's Cabin&rdquo; that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the joys and sorrows of fifteen!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Amos Cuthbert named it so&mdash;our old friend Amos who lives high up
      in the ether of Town's End ridge, and who now represents Coniston in the
      Legislature. He is the same silent, sallow person as when Jethro first
      took a mortgage on his farm, only his skin is beginning to resemble dried
      parchment, and he is a trifle more cantankerous. On the morning of that
      memorable day when, &ldquo;Uncle Tom's Cabin&rdquo; came to the capital, Amos had
      entered the Throne Room and given vent to his feelings in regard to the
      gentleman in the back seat who had demanded an evening sitting on behalf
      of the farmers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't that beat all?&rdquo; cried Amos. &ldquo;Let them have their darned woodchuck
      session; there won't nobody go to it. For cussed, crisscross contrariness,
      give me a moss-back Democrat from a one-boss, one-man town like Suffolk.
      I'm a-goin' to see the show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-goin' to the show, be you, Amos?&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I be,&rdquo; answered Amos, bitterly. &ldquo;I hain't agoin' nigh the house
      to-night.&rdquo; And with this declaration he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if he really is going?&rdquo; queried Mr. Merrill looking at the
      ceiling. And then he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't he go?&rdquo; asked William Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill's answer to this question was a wink, whereupon he, too,
      departed. And while Wetherell was pondering over the possible meaning of
      these words the Honorable Alva Hopkins entered, wreathed in smiles, and
      closed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all fixed,&rdquo; he said, taking a seat near Jethro in the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-seen your gal&mdash;Alvy&mdash;seen your gal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hopkins gave a glance at Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will don't talk,&rdquo; said Jethro, and resumed his inspection through the
      lace curtains of what was going on in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cassandry's, got him to go,&rdquo; said Mr. Hopkins. &ldquo;It's all fixed, as sure
      as Sunday. If it misses fire, then I'll never mention the governorship
      again. But if it don't miss fire,&rdquo; and the Honorable Alva leaned over and
      put his hand on Jethro's knee, &ldquo;if it don't miss fire, I get the
      nomination. Is that right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-you've guessed it, Alvy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all I want to know,&rdquo; declared the Honorable Alva; &ldquo;when you say
      that much, you never go back on it. And, you can go ahead and give the
      orders, Jethro. I have to see that the boys get the tickets. Cassandry's
      got a head on her shoulders, and she kind of wants to be governor, too.&rdquo;
       He got as far as the door, when he turned and bestowed upon Jethro a
      glance of undoubted tribute. &ldquo;You've done a good many smart things,&rdquo; said
      he, &ldquo;but I guess you never beat this, and never will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-hain't done it yet, Alvy,&rdquo; answered Jethro, still looking out through
      the window curtains at the ever ganging groups of gentlemen in the street.
      These groups had a never ceasing interest for Jethro Bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wetherell didn't talk, but had he been the most incurable of gossips
      he felt that he could have done no damage to this mysterious affair,
      whatever it was. In a certain event, Mr. Hopkins was promised the
      governorship: so much was plain. And it was also evident that Miss
      Cassandra Hopkins was in some way to be instrumental. William Wetherell
      did not like to ask Jethro, but he thought a little of sounding Mr.
      Merrill, and then he came to the conclusion that it would be wiser for him
      not to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Will,&rdquo; said Jethro, presently, &ldquo;you know Heth Sutton&mdash;Speaker
      Heth Sutton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;wouldn't mind askin' him to step in and see me before the
      session&mdash;if he was comin' by&mdash;would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;if he was comin' by,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wetherell found Mr. Speaker Sutton glued to a pillar in the rotunda
      below. He had some difficulty in breaking through the throng that pressed
      around him, and still more in attracting his attention, as Mr. Sutton took
      no manner of notice of the customary form of placing one's hand under his
      elbow and pressing gently up. Summoning up his courage, Mr. Wetherell
      tried the second method of seizing him by the buttonhole. He paused in his
      harangue, one hand uplifted, and turned and glanced at the storekeeper
      abstractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass asked me to tell you to drop into Number 7,&rdquo; said Wetherell, and
      added, remembering express instructions, &ldquo;if you were going by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell had not anticipated the magical effect this usual message would
      have on Mr. Sutton, nor had he thought that so large and dignified a body
      would move so rapidly. Before the astonished gentlemen who had penned him
      could draw a breath, Mr. Sutton had reached the stairway and, was mounting
      it with an agility that did him credit. Five minutes later Wetherell saw
      the Speaker descending again, the usually impressive quality of his face
      slightly modified by the twitching of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the day passed, and the gentlemen of the Lovejoy and Duncan factions
      sat, as tight as ever in their seats, and the Truro Franchise bill still
      slumbered undisturbed in Mr. Chauncey Weed's committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper there was a decided festal air about the dining room of the
      Pelican House, the little band of agricultural gentlemen who wished to
      have a session not being patrons of that exclusive hotel. Many of the
      Solons had sent home for their wives; that they might do the utmost
      justice to the Honorable Alva's hospitality. Even Jethro, as he ate his
      crackers and milk, had a new coat with bright brass buttons, and Cynthia,
      who wore a fresh gingham which Miss Sukey Kittredge of Coniston had helped
      to design, so far relented in deference to Jethro's taste as to tie a red
      bow at her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The middle table under the chandelier was the immediate firmament of Miss
      Cassandra Hopkins. And there, beside the future governor, sat the
      president of the &ldquo;Northwestern&rdquo; Railroad, Mr. Lovejoy, as the chief of the
      revolving satellites. People began to say that Mr. Lovejoy was hooked at
      last, now that he had lost his head in such an unaccountable fashion as to
      pay his court in public; and it was very generally known that he was to
      make one of the Honorable Alva's immediate party at the performance of
      &ldquo;Uncle Tam's Cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Speaker Sutton, of course, would have to forego the pleasure of the
      theatre as a penalty of his high position. Mr. Merrill, who sat at
      Jethro's table next to Cynthia that evening, did a great deal of joking
      with the Honorable Heth about having to preside aver a woodchuck session,
      which the Speaker, so Mr. Wetherell thought, took in astonishingly good
      part, and seemed very willing to make the great sacrifice which his duty
      required of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Mr. Wetherell took a seat in the rotunda. As an observer of
      human nature, he had begun to find a fascination in watching the group of
      politicians there. First of all he encountered Mr. Amos Cuthbert, his
      little coal-black eyes burning brightly, and he was looking very irritable
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're going to the show, Amos?&rdquo; remarked the storekeeper, with an
      attempt at cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his bewilderment, Amos turned upon him fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who said I was going to the show?&rdquo; he snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You yourself told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd ought to know whether I'm a-goin' or not,&rdquo; said Amos, and walked
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mr. Wetherell sat meditating, upon this inexplicable retort, a
      retired, scholarly looking gentleman with a white beard, who wore
      spectacles, came out of the door leading from the barber shop and quietly
      took a seat beside him. The storekeeper's attention was next distracted by
      the sight of one who wandered slowly but ceaselessly from group to group,
      kicking up his heels behind, and halting always in the rear of the
      speakers. Needless to say that this was our friend Mr. Bijah Bixby, who
      was following out his celebrated tactics of &ldquo;going along by when they were
      talkin' sly.&rdquo; Suddenly Mr. Bixby's eye alighted on Mr. Wetherell, who by a
      stretch of imagination conceived that it expressed both astonishment and
      approval, although he was wholly at a loss to understand these sentiments.
      Mr. Bixby winked&mdash;Mr. Wetherell was sure of that. But to his
      surprise, Bijah did not pause in his rounds to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wetherell was beginning to be decidedly uneasy, and was about to go
      upstairs, when Mr. Merrill came down the rotunda whistling, with his hands
      in his pockets. He stopped whistling when he spied the storekeeper, and
      approached him in his usual hearty manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, this is fortunate,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill; &ldquo;how are you, Duncan? I
      want you to know Mr. Wetherell. Wetherell writes that weekly letter for
      the Guardian you were speaking to me about last year. Will, this is Mr.
      Alexander Duncan, president of the 'Central.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Wetherell?&rdquo; said the scholarly gentleman with the
      spectacles, putting out his hand. &ldquo;I'm glad to meet you, very glad,
      indeed. I read your letters with the greatest pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wetherell, as he took Mr. Duncan's hand, had a variety of emotions
      which may be imagined, and need not be set down in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny thing,&rdquo; Mr. Merrill continued, &ldquo;I was looking for you, Duncan. It
      occurred to me that you would like to meet Mr. Wetherell. I was afraid you
      were in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just got back,&rdquo; said Mr. Duncan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted Wetherell to see your library. I was telling him about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be delighted to show it to him,&rdquo; answered Mr. Duncan. That
      library, as is well known, was a special weakness of Mr. Duncan's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor William Wetherell, who was quite overwhelmed by the fact that the
      great Mr. Duncan had actually read his letters and liked them, could
      scarcely utter a sensible word. Almost before he realized what had
      happened he was following Mr. Duncan out of the Pelican House, when the
      storekeeper was mystified once more by a nudge and another wink from Mr.
      Bixby, conveying unbounded admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you write a book, Mr. Wetherell?&rdquo; inquired the railroad
      president, when they were crossing the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I could do it,&rdquo; said Mr. Wetherell, modestly. Such incense
      was overpowering, and he immediately forgot Mr. Bixby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can,&rdquo; said Mr. Duncan, &ldquo;only you don't know it. Take your
      letters for a beginning. You can draw people well enough, when you try.
      There was your description of the lonely hill-farm on the spur&mdash;I
      shall always remember that: the gaunt farmer, toiling every minute between
      sun and sun; the thin, patient woman bending to a task that never charged
      or lightened; the children growing up and leaving one by one, some to the
      cities, some to the West, until the old people are left alone in the
      evening of life&mdash;to the sunsets and the storms. Of course you must
      write a book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Duncan quoted other letters, and William Wetherell thrilled. Poor man!
      he had had little enough incense in his time, and none at all from the
      great. They came to the big square house with the cornice which Cynthia
      had seen the day before, and walked across the lawn through the open door.
      William Wetherell had a glimpse of a great drawing-room with high windows,
      out of which was wafted the sound of a piano and of youthful voice and
      laughter, and then he was in the library. The thought of one man owning
      all those books overpowered him. There they were, in stately rows, from
      the floor to the high ceiling, and a portable ladder with which to reach
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Duncan, understanding perhaps something of the storekeeper's
      embarrassment, proceeded to take down his treasures: first editions from
      the shelves, and folios and mistrals from drawers in a great iron safe in
      one corner and laid them on the mahogany desk. It was the railroad
      president's hobby, and could he find an appreciative guest, he was happy.
      It need scarcely be said that he found William Wetherell appreciative, and
      possessed of knowledge of Shaksperiana and other matters that astonished
      his host as well as pleased him. For Wetherell had found his tongue at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while Mr. Duncan drew out his watch and gave a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it's after eight o'clock. I'll have to ask you
      to excuse me to-night, Mr. Wetherell. I'd like to show you the rest of
      them&mdash;can't you come around to-morrow afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wetherell, who had forgotten his own engagement and &ldquo;Uncle Tom's
      Cabin,&rdquo; said he would be happy to come. And they went out together and
      began to walk toward the State House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't often I find a man who knows anything at all about these
      things,&rdquo; continued Mr. Duncan, whose heart was quite won. &ldquo;Why do you bury
      yourself in Coniston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went there from Briton for my health,&rdquo; said the storekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass lives there, doesn't he&rdquo; said Mr. Duncan, with a laugh. &ldquo;But
      I suppose you don't know anything about politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing at all,&rdquo; said Mr. Wetherell, which was quite true. He had
      been in dreamland, but now the fact struck him again, with something of a
      shock, that this mild-mannered gentleman was one of those who had been
      paying certain legislators to remain in their seats. Wetherell thought of
      speaking to Mr. Duncan of his friendship with Jethro Bass, but the
      occasion passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to heaven I didn't have to know anything about politics,&rdquo; Mr.
      Duncan was saying; &ldquo;they disgust me. There's a little matter on now, about
      an extension of the Truro Railroad to Harwich, which wouldn't interest
      you, but you can't conceive what a nuisance it has been to watch that
      House day and night, as I've had to. It's no joke to have that townsman of
      yours; Jethro Bass, opposed to you. I won't say anything against him, for
      he many be a friend of yours, and I have to use him sometimes myself.&rdquo; Mr.
      Duncan sighed. &ldquo;It's all very sordid and annoying. Now this evening, for
      instance, when we might have enjoyed ourselves with those books, I've' got
      to go to the House, just because some backwoods farmers want to talk about
      woodchucks. I suppose it's foolish,&rdquo; said Mr. Duncan; &ldquo;but Bass has
      tricked us so often that I've got into the habit of being watchful. I
      should have been here twenty minutes ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had come to the entrance of the State House, and
      Wetherell followed Mr. Duncan in, to have a look at the woodchuck session
      himself. Several members hurried by and up the stairs, some of them in
      their Sunday black; and the lobby above seemed, even to the storekeeper's
      unpractised eye, a trifle active for a woodchuck session. Mr. Duncan
      muttered something, and quickened his gait a little on the steps that led
      to the gallery. This place was almost empty. They went down to the rail,
      and the railroad president cast his eye over the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he said sharply, &ldquo;there's almost a quorum here.&rdquo; He ran his
      eye over the members. &ldquo;There is a quorum here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Duncan stood drumming nervously with his fingers on the rail, scanning
      the heads below. The members were scattered far and wide through the
      seats, like an army in open order, listening in silence to the droning
      voice of the clerk. Moths burned in the gas flames, and June bugs hummed
      in at the high windows and tilted against the walls. Then Mr. Duncan's
      finger nails whitened as his thin hands clutched the rail, and a sense of
      a pending event was upon Wetherell. Slowly he realized that he was
      listening to the Speaker's deep voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The Committee on Corporations, to whom was referred House Bill Number
      109, entitled, 'An Act to extend the Truro Railroad to Harwich, having
      considered the same, report the same with the following resolution:
      Resolved, that the bill ought to pass. Chauncey Weed, for the Committee.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Truro Franchise! The lights danced, and even a sudden weakness came
      upon the storekeeper. Jethro's trick! The Duncan and Lovejoy
      representatives in the theatre, the adherents of the bill here! Wetherell
      saw Mr. Duncan beside him, a tense figure leaning on the rail, calling to
      some one below. A man darted up the centre, another up the side aisle.
      Then Mr. Duncan flashed at William Wetherell from his blue eye such a look
      of anger as the storekeeper never forgot, and he, too, was gone. Tingling
      and perspiring, Wetherell leaned out over the railing as the Speaker
      rapped calmly for order. Hysteric laughter, mingled with hoarse cries, ran
      over the House, but the Honorable Heth Sutton did not even smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen members were on their feet shouting to the chair. One was
      recognized, and that man Wetherell perceived with amazement to be Mr.
      Jameson of Wantage, adherent of Jethro's&mdash;he who had moved to adjourn
      for &ldquo;Uncle Tom's Cabin&rdquo;! A score of members crowded into the aisles, but
      the Speaker's voice again rose above the tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doorkeepers will close the doors! Mr. Jameson of Wantage moves that
      the report of the Committee be accepted, and on this motion a roll-call is
      ordered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doorkeepers, who must have been inspired, had already slammed the
      doors in the faces of those seeking wildly to escape. The clerk already
      had the little, short-legged desk before him and was calling the roll with
      incredible rapidity. Bewildered and excited as Wetherell was, and knowing
      as little of parliamentary law as the gentleman who had proposed the
      woodchuck session, he began to form some sort of a notion of Jethro's
      generalship, and he saw that the innocent rural members who belonged to
      Duncan and Lovejoy's faction had tried to get away before the roll-call,
      destroy the quorum, and so adjourn the House. These, needless to say, were
      not parliamentarians, either. They had lacked a leader, they were stunned
      by the suddenness of the onslaught, and had not moved quickly enough. Like
      trapped animals, they wandered blindly about for a few moments, and then
      sank down anywhere. Each answered the roll-call sullenly, out of
      necessity, for every one of them was a marked man. Then Wetherell
      remembered the two members who had escaped, and Mr. Duncan, and fell to
      calculating how long it would take these to reach Fosters Opera House,
      break into the middle of an act, and get out enough partisans to come back
      and kill the bill. Mr. Wetherell began to wish he could witness the scene
      there, too, but something held him here, shaking with excitement,
      listening to each name that the clerk called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would the people at the theatre get back in time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite William Wetherell's principles, whatever these may have been, he
      was so carried away that he found himself with his watch in his hand,
      counting off the minutes as the roll-call went on. Fosters Opera House was
      some six squares distant, and by a liberal estimate Mr. Duncan and his
      advance guard ought to get back within twenty minutes of the time he left.
      Wetherell was not aware that people were coming into the gallery behind
      him; he was not aware that one sat at his elbow until a familiar voice
      spoke, directly into his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Will&mdash;held Duncan pretty tight&mdash;didn't you? He's a
      hard one to fool, too. Never suspected a mite, did he? Look out for your
      watch!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bixby seized it or it would have fallen. If his life had depended on
      it, William Wetherell could not have spoken a word to Mr. Bixby then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You done well, Will, sure enough,&rdquo; that gentleman continued to whisper.
      &ldquo;And Alvy's gal done well, too&mdash;you understand. I guess she's the
      only one that ever snarled up Al Lovejoy so that he didn't know where he
      was at. But it took a fine, delicate touch for her job and yours, Will.
      Godfrey, this is the quickest roll-call I ever seed! They've got halfway
      through Truro County. That fellow can talk faster than a side-show,
      ticket-seller at a circus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk was, indeed, performing prodigies of pronunciation. When he
      reached Wells County, the last, Mr. Bixby so far lost his habitual sang
      froid as to hammer on the rail with his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there hain't a quorum, we're done for,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How much time has
      gone away? Twenty minutes! Godfrey, some of 'em may break loose and git
      here is five minutes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break loose?&rdquo; Wetherell exclaimed involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bixby screwed up his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand. Accidents is liable to happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wetherell didn't understand in the least, but just then the clerk
      reached the last name on the roll; an instant of absolute silence, save
      for the June-bugs, followed, while the assistant clerk ran over his
      figures deftly and handed them to Mr. Sutton, who leaned forward to
      receive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative and
      forty-eight in the negative, and the report of the Committee is accepted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten more'n a quorum!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Bixby, in a voice of thanksgiving,
      as the turmoil below began again. It seemed as though every man in the
      opposition was on his feet and yelling at the chair: some to adjourn; some
      to indefinitely postpone; some demanding roll-calls; others swearing at
      these&mdash;for a division vote would have opened the doors. Others tried
      to get out, and then ran down the aisles and called fiercely on the
      Speaker to open the doors, and threatened him. But the Honorable Heth
      Sutton did not lose his head, and it may be doubted whether he ever
      appeared to better advantage than at that moment. He had a voice like one
      of the Clovelly bulls that fed in his own pastures in the valley, and by
      sheer bellowing he got silence, or something approaching it,&mdash;the
      protests dying down to a hum; had recognised another friend of the bill,
      and was putting another question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gibbs of Wareham moves that the rules of the House be so far
      suspended that this bill be read a second and third time by its title, and
      be put upon its final passage at this time. And on this motion,&rdquo; thundered
      Mr. Sutton, above the tide of rising voices, &ldquo;the yeas and nays are called
      for. The doorkeepers will keep the doors shut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abbey of Ashburton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The nimble clerk had begun on the roll almost before the Speaker was
      through, and checked off the name. Bijah Bixby mopped his brow with a blue
      pocket-handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what a risk Jethro's took! they can't git through
      another roll-call. Jest look at Heth! Ain't he carryin' it magnificent?
      Hain't as ruffled as I be. I've knowed him ever sence he wahn't no
      higher'n that desk. Never would have b'en in politics if it hadn't b'en
      for me. Funny thing, Will&mdash;you and I was so excited we never thought
      to look at the clock. Put up your watch. Godfrey, what's this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The noise of many feet was heard behind them. Men and women were crowding
      breathlessly into the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't take it long to git noised araound,&rdquo; said Mr. Bixby. &ldquo;Say, Will,
      they're bound to have got at 'em in the thea'tre. Don't see how they held
      'em off, c-cussed if I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The seconds ticked into minutes, the air became stifling, for now the
      front of the gallery was packed. Now, if ever, the fate of the Truro
      Franchise hung in the balance, and, perhaps, the rule of Jethro Bass. And
      now, as in the distance, came a faint, indefinable stir, not yet to be
      identified by Wetherell's ears as a sound, but registered somewhere in his
      brain as a warning note. Bijah Bixby, as sensitive as he, straightened up
      to listen, and then the whispering was hushed. The members below raised
      their heads, and some clutched the seats in front of them and looked up at
      the high windows. Only the Speaker sat like a wax statue of himself, and
      glanced neither to the right nor to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harkness of Truro,&rdquo; said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's almost to Wells County again,&rdquo; whispered Bijah, excitedly. &ldquo;I didn't
      callate he could do it. Will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will&mdash;you hear somethin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A distant shout floated with the night breeze in at the windows; a man on
      the floor got to his feet and stood straining: a commotion was going on at
      the back of the gallery, and a voice was heard crying out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the love of God, let me through!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Wetherell turned to see the crowd at the back parting a little, to
      see a desperate man in a gorgeous white necktie fighting his way toward
      the rail. He wore no hat, his collar was wilted, and his normally ashen
      face had turned white. And, strangest of all, clutched tightly in his hand
      was a pink ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Al Lovejoy,&rdquo; said Bijah, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unmindful of the awe-stricken stares he got from those about him when his
      identity became known, Mr. Lovejoy gained the rail and shoved aside a man
      who was actually making way for him. Leaning far out, he scanned the house
      with inarticulate rage while the roll-call went monotonously on. Some of
      the members looked up at him and laughed; others began to make frantic
      signs, indicative of helplessness; still others telegraphed him obvious
      advice about reenforcements which, if anything, increased his fury. Mr.
      Bixby was now fanning himself with the blue handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear 'em!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hear 'em, Will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he did. The unmistakable hum of the voices of many men and the sound
      of feet on stone flagging shook the silent night without. The clerk read
      off the last name on the roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tompkins of Ulster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His assistant lost no time now. A mistake would have been fatal, but he
      was an old hand. Unmindful of the rumble on the wooden stairs below, Mr.
      Sutton took the list with an admirable deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative,
      forty-eight in the negative, the rules of the House are suspended, and&rdquo;
       (the clerk having twice mumbled the title of the bill) &ldquo;the question is:
      Shall the bill pass? As many as are of opinion that the bill pass will say
      Aye, contrary minded No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Feet were in the House corridor now, and voices rising there, and noises
      that must have been scuffling&mdash;yes, and beating of door panels.
      Almost every member was standing, and it seemed as if they were all
      shouting,&mdash;&ldquo;personal privilege,&rdquo; &ldquo;fraud,&rdquo; &ldquo;trickery,&rdquo; &ldquo;open the
      doors.&rdquo; Bijah was slowly squeezing the blood out of William Wetherell's
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doorkeepers has the keys in their pockets!&rdquo; Mr. Bixby had to shout,
      for once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then the Speaker did not flinch. By a seeming miracle he got a
      semblance of order, recognized his man, and his great voice rang through
      the hall and drowned all other sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And on this question a roll-call is ordered. The doorkeepers will close
      the doors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as in reaction, the gallery trembled with a roar of laughter. But
      Mr. Sutton did not smile. The clerk scratched off the names with lightning
      rapidity, scarce waiting for the answers. Every man's color was known, and
      it was against the rules to be present and fail to vote. The noise in the
      corridors grew louder, some one dealt a smashing kick on a panel, and
      Wetherell ventured to ask Mr. Bixby if he thought the doors would hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can break in all they've a mind to now,&rdquo; he chuckled; &ldquo;the Truro
      Franchise is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Wetherell demanded excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a member hain't present when a question is put, he can't git into a
      roll-call,&rdquo; said Bijah.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that the day was lost was evidently brought home to those below,
      for the strife subsided gradually, and finally ceased altogether. The
      whispers in the gallery died down, the spectators relayed a little.
      Lovejoy alone remained tense, though he had seated himself on a bench, and
      the hot anger in which he had come was now cooled into a vindictiveness
      that set the hard lines of his face even harder. He still clutched the
      ribbon. The last part of that famous roll-call was conducted so quietly
      that a stranger entering the House would have suspected nothing unusual.
      It was finished in absolute silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred and twelve gentlemen have voted in the affirmative,
      forty-eight in the negative, and the bill passes. The House will attend to
      the title of the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An act to extend the Truro Railroad to Harwich,&rdquo; said the clerk, glibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such will be the title of the bill unless otherwise ordered by the
      House,&rdquo; said Mr. Speaker Sutton. &ldquo;The doorkeepers will open the doors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somebody moved to adjourn, the motion was carried, and thus ended what has
      gone down to history as the Woodchuck Session. Pandemonium reigned. One
      hundred and forty belated members fought their way in at the four
      entrances, and mingled with them were lobbyists of all sorts and
      conditions, residents and visitors to the capital, men and women to whom
      the drama of &ldquo;Uncle Tom's Cabin&rdquo; was as nothing to that of the Truro
      Franchise Bill. It was a sight to look down upon. Fierce wrangles began in
      a score of places, isolated personal remarks rose above the din, but your
      New Englander rarely comes to blows; in other spots men with broad smiles
      seized others by the hands and shook them violently, while Mr. Speaker
      Sutton seemed in danger of suffocation by his friends. His enemies, for
      the moment, could get nowhere near him. On this scene Mr. Bijah Bixby
      gazed with pardonable pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess there wahn't a mite of trouble about the river towns,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
      had 'em in my pocket. Will, let's amble round to the theatre. We ought to
      git in two acts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell went. There is no need to go into the psychology of the
      matter. It may have been numbness; it may have been temporary insanity
      caused by the excitement of the battle he had witnessed, for his brain was
      in a whirl; or Mr. Bixby may have hypnotized him. As they walked through
      the silent streets toward the Opera House, he listened perforce to Mr.
      Bixby's comments upon some of the innumerable details which Jethro had
      planned and quietly carried out while sitting, in the window of the Throne
      Room. A great light dawned on William Wetherell, but too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro's trusted lieutenants (of whom, needless to say, Mr. Bixby was one)
      had been commanded to notify such of their supporters whose fidelity and
      secrecy could be absolutely depended upon to attend the Woodchuck Session;
      and, further to guard against surprise, this order had not gone out until
      the last minute (hence Mr. Amos Cuthbert's conduct). The seats of these
      members at the theatre had been filled by accommodating townspeople and
      visitors. Forestalling a possible vote on the morrow to recall and
      reconsider, there remained some sixty members whose loyalty was
      unquestioned, but whose reputation for discretion was not of the best. So
      much for the parliamentary side of the affair, which was a revelation of
      generalship and organization to William Wetherell. By the time he had
      grasped it they were come in view of the lights of Fosters Opera House,
      and they perceived, among a sprinkling of idlers, a conspicuous and
      meditative gentleman leaning against a pillar. He was ludicrously tall and
      ludicrously thin, his hands were in his trousers pockets, and the skirts
      of his Sunday broadcloth coat hung down behind him awry. One long foot was
      crossed over the other and rested on the point of the toe, and his head
      was tilted to one side. He had, on the whole, the appearance of a rather
      mournful stork. Mr. Bixby approached him gravely, seized him by the lower
      shoulder, and tilted him down until it was possible to speak into his ear.
      The gentleman apparently did not resent this, although he seemed in
      imminent danger of being upset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you, Peleg? Er&mdash;you know Will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bixby seized Mr. Wetherell under the elbow, and addressed himself to
      the storekeeper's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will, I want you to shake hands with Senator Peleg Hartington, of
      Brampton. This is Will Wetherell, Peleg,&mdash;from Coniston&mdash;you
      understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The senator took one hand from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you?&rdquo; he said. Mr. Bixby was once more pulling down on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-haow was it here?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almighty funny,&rdquo; answered Senator Hartington, sadly, and waved at the
      lobby. &ldquo;There wahn't standin' room in the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass Republican Club come and packed the entrance,&rdquo; explained Mr.
      Bixby with a wink. &ldquo;You understand, Will? Go on, Peleg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sidewalk and street, too,&rdquo; continued Mr. Hartington, slowly. &ldquo;First come
      along Ball of Towles, hollerin' like blazes. They crumpled him all up and
      lost him. Next come old man Duncan himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will kep' Duncan,&rdquo; Mr. Bixby interjected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was wholly an accident,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Wetherell, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will wahn't born in the country,&rdquo; said Mr. Bixby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartington bestowed on the storekeeper a mournful look, and continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never seed Duncan sweatin' before. He didn't seem to grasp why the boys
      was there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't seem to understand,&rdquo; put in Mr. Bixby, sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'For God's sake, gentlemen,' says he, 'let me in! The Truro Bill!' 'The
      Truro Bill hain't in the theatre, Mr. Duncan,' says Dan Everett. Cussed if
      I didn't come near laughin'. 'That's &ldquo;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&rdquo; Mr. Duncan,'
      says Dan. 'You're a dam fool,' says Duncan. I didn't know he was profane.
      'Make room for Mr. Duncan,' says Dan, 'he wants to see the show.' 'I'm
      a-goin' to see you in jail for this, Everett,' says Duncan. They let him
      push in about half a rod, and they swallowed him. He was makin' such a
      noise that they had to close the doors of the theatre&mdash;so's not to
      disturb the play-actors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Bixby to Wetherell. Whereupon he gave another
      shake to Mr. Hartington, who had relapsed into a sort of funereal
      meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; resumed that personage, &ldquo;there was some more come, hollerin' about
      the Truro Bill. Not many. Guess they'll all have to git their wimmen-folks
      to press their clothes to-morrow. Then Duncan wanted to git out again, but
      'twan't exactly convenient. Callated he was suffocatin'&mdash;seemed to
      need air. Little mite limp when he broke loose, Duncan was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Peleg stopped again, as if he were overcome by the
      recollection of Mr. Duncan's plight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;Peleg!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartington started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'd they do?&mdash;what'd they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'd they git notice to 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartington, &ldquo;cussed if that wuhn't funny. Let's see, where
      was I? After awhile they went over t'other side of the street, talkin'
      sly, waitin' for the act to end. But goldarned if it ever did end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For once Mr. Bixby didn't seem to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-didn't end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; explained Mr. Hartington; &ldquo;seems they hitched a kind of nigger
      minstrel show right on to it&mdash;banjos and thingumajigs in front of the
      curtain while they was changin' scenes, and they hitched the second act
      right on to that. Nobody come out of the theatre at all. Funny notion,
      wahn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bixby's face took on a look of extreme cunning. He smiled broadly and
      poked Mr. Wetherell in an extremely sensitive portion of his ribs. On such
      occasions the nasal quality of Bijah's voice seemed to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know that little man, Gibbs, don't ye?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Hartington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Airley Gibbs, hain't it? Runs a livery business daown to Rutgers, on
      Lovejoy's railroad,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bixby, promptly. &ldquo;I know him. Knew old
      man Gibbs well's I do you. Mean cuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Airley's smart&mdash;wahn't quite smart enough, though. His bright
      idea come a little mite late. Hunted up old Christy, got the key to his
      law office right here in the Duncan Block, went up through the skylight,
      clumb down to the roof of Randall's store next door, shinned up the
      lightnin' rod on t'other side, and stuck his head plump into the Opery
      House window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Bixby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somethin' terrible pathetic was goin' on on the stage,&rdquo; resumed Mr.
      Hartington, &ldquo;the folks didn't see him at first,&mdash;they was all cryin'
      and everythin' was still, but Airley wahn't affected. As quick as he got
      his breath he hollered right out loud's he could: 'The Truro Bill's up in
      the House, boys. We're skun if you don't git thar quick.' Then they tell
      me' the lightnin' rod give way; anyhow, he came down on Randall's gravel
      roof considerable hard, I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartington, apparently, had an aggravating way of falling into
      mournful revery and of forgetting his subject. Mr. Bixby was forced to jog
      him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they did,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they did. They come out like the theatre was
      afire. There was some delay in gettin' to the street, but not much&mdash;not
      much. All the Republican Clubs in the state couldn't have held 'em then,
      and the profanity they used wahn't especially edifyin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peleg's a deacon&mdash;you understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Bixby. &ldquo;Say, Peleg,
      where was Al Lovejoy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lovejoy come along with the first of 'em. Must have hurried some&mdash;they
      tell me he was settin' way down in front alongside of Alvy Hopkins's gal,
      and when Airley hollered out she screeched and clutched on to Al, and Al
      said somethin' he hadn't ought to and tore off one of them pink gew-gaws
      she was covered with. He was the maddest man I ever see. Some of the club
      was crowded inside, behind the seats, standin' up to see the show. Al was
      so anxious to git through he hit Si Dudley in the mouth&mdash;injured him
      some, I guess. Pity, wahn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Si hain't in politics, you understand,&rdquo; said Mr. Bixby. &ldquo;Callate Si paid
      to git in there, didn't he, Peleg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Callate he did,&rdquo; assented Senator Hartington.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long and painful pause followed. There seemed, indeed, nothing more to
      be said. The sound of applause floated out of the Opera House doors,
      around which the remaining loiterers were clustered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goin' in, be you, Peleg?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Bixby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartington shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will and me had a notion to see somethin' of the show,&rdquo; said Mr. Bixby,
      almost apologetically. &ldquo;I kep' my ticket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartington, reflectively, &ldquo;I guess you'll find some of
      the show left. That hain't b'en hurt much, so far as I can ascertain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next afternoon, when Mr. Isaac D. Worthington happened to be sitting
      alone in the office of the Truro Railroad at the capital, there came a
      knock at the door, and Mr. Bijah Bixby entered. Now, incredible as it may
      seem, Mr. Worthington did not know Mr. Bixby&mdash;or rather, did not
      remember him. Mr. Worthington had not had at that time much of an
      experience in politics, and he did not possess a very good memory for
      faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bixby, who had, as we know, a confidential and winning manner, seated
      himself in a chair very close to Mr. Worthington&mdash;somewhat to that
      gentleman's alarm. &ldquo;How be you?&rdquo; said Bijah, &ldquo;I-I've got a little bill
      here&mdash;you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington didn't understand, and he drew his chair away from Mr.
      Bixby's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about it, sir,&rdquo; answered the president of the Truro
      Railroad, indignantly; &ldquo;this is neither the manner nor the place to
      present a bill. I don't want to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bixby moved his chair up again. &ldquo;Callate you will want to see this
      bill, Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; he insisted, not at all abashed. &ldquo;Jethro Bass sent
      it&mdash;you understand&mdash;it's engrossed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Mr. Bixby drew from his capacious pocket a roll, tied with white
      ribbon, and pressed it into Mr. Worthington's hands. It was the Truro
      Franchise Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is safe to say that Mr. Worthington understood.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are certain instruments used by scientists so delicate that they
      have to be wrapped in cotton wool and kept in ductless places, and so
      sensitive that the slightest shock will derange them. And there are
      certain souls which cannot stand the jars of life&mdash;souls created to
      register thoughts and sentiments too fine for those of coarser
      construction. Such was the soul of the storekeeper of Coniston. Whether or
      not he was one of those immortalized in the famous Elegy, it is not for us
      to say. A celebrated poet who read the letters to the Guardian&mdash;at
      Miss Lucretia Penniman's request&mdash;has declared Mr. Wetherell to have
      been a genius. He wrote those letters, as we know, after he had piled his
      boxes and rolled his barrels into place; after he had added up the columns
      in his ledger and recorded, each week, the small but ever increasing
      deficit which he owed to Jethro Bass. Could he have been removed from the
      barrels and the ledgers, and the debts and the cares and the implications,
      what might we have had from his pen? That will never be known.

      We left him in the lobby of the Opera House, but he did not go in to see
      the final act of &ldquo;Uncle Tom's Cabin.&rdquo; He made his way, alone, back to the
      hotel, slipped in by a side entrance, and went directly to his room, where
      Cynthia found him, half an hour later, seated by the open window in the
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you well, Dad?&rdquo; she asked anxiously. &ldquo;Why didn't you come to see
      the play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was detained Cynthia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I am well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down beside him and felt his forehead and his hands, and the
      events of the evening which were on her lips to tell him remained
      unspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought not to have left Coniston,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the excitement is too
      much for you. We will go back tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Cynthia, we will go back to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the early train,&rdquo; said Wetherell, &ldquo;and now you must go to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said Cynthia, as she kissed him good night. &ldquo;I have enjoyed
      it here, and I am grateful to Uncle Jethro for bringing us, but&mdash;but
      I like Coniston best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell could have slept but a few hours. When he awoke the
      sparrows were twittering outside, the fresh cool smells of the morning
      were coming in at his windows, and the sunlight was just striking across
      the roofs through the green trees of the Capitol Park. The remembrance of
      a certain incident of the night before crept into his mind, and he got up,
      and drew on his clothes and thrust his few belongings into the carpet-bag,
      and knocked on Cynthia's door. She was already dressed, and her eyes
      rested searchingly on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, you aren't well. I know it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he denied that he was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her belongings were in a neat little bundle under her arm. But when she
      went to put them in the bag she gave an exclamation, knelt down, took
      everything out that he had packed, and folded each article over again with
      amazing quickness. Then she made a rapid survey of the room lest she had
      forgotten anything, closed the bag, and they went out and along the
      corridor. But when Wetherell turned to go down the stairs, she stopped
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you going to say goodby to Uncle Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I would rather go on and get in the train, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Jethro will understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was worried, but she did not care to leave him; and she led him,
      protesting, into the dining room. He had a sinking fear that they might
      meet Jethro there, but only a few big-boned countrymen were scattered
      about, attended by sleepy waitresses. Lest Cynthia might suspect how his
      head was throbbing, Wetherell tried bravely to eat his breakfast. He did
      not know that she had gone out, while they were waiting, and written a
      note to Jethro, explaining that her father was ill, and that they were
      going back to Coniston. After breakfast, when they went to the desk, the
      clerk stared at them in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going, Mr. Wetherell?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find that I have to get back,&rdquo; stammered the storekeeper. &ldquo;Will you
      tell me the amount of my bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Bass gave me instructions that he would settle that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of Mr. Bass,&rdquo; said Wetherell, &ldquo;but I prefer to pay it
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The judge will be very angry, Mr. Wetherell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly give me the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk made it out and handed it over in silence. Wetherell had in his
      pocket the money from several contributions to the Guardian, and he paid
      him. Then they set out for the station, bought their tickets and hurried
      past the sprinkling of people there. The little train for Truro was
      standing under the sheds, the hissing steam from the locomotive rising
      perpendicular in the still air of the morning, and soon they were settled
      in one of the straight-backed seats. The car was almost empty, for few
      people were going up that day, and at length, after what, seemed an
      eternity of waiting, they started, and soon were in the country once more
      in that wonderful Truro valley with its fruit trees and its clover scents;
      with its sparkling stream that tumbled through the passes and mirrored
      between green meadow-banks the blue and white of the sky. How hungrily
      they drank in the freshness of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached Truro village at eleven. Outside the little tavern there,
      after dinner, the green stage was drawn up; and Tom the driver cracked his
      long whip over the Morgan leaders and they started, swaying in the sand
      ruts and jolting over the great stones that cropped out of the road. Up
      they climbed, through narrow ways in the forest&mdash;ways hedged with
      alder and fern and sumach and wild grape, adorned with oxeye daisies and
      tiger lilies, and the big purple flowers which they knew and loved so
      well. They passed, too, wild lakes overhung with primeval trees, where the
      iris and the waterlily grew among the fallen trunks and the water-fowl
      called to each other across the blue stretches. And at length, when the
      sun was beginning visibly to fall, they came out into an open cut on the
      western side and saw again the long line of Coniston once more against the
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; said Cynthia, as she gazed, &ldquo;don't you love it better than any
      other place in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did. But he could not answer her.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, from the hilltops above Isaac Worthington's mills, they saw
      the terraced steeple of Brampton church, and soon the horses were standing
      with drooping heads and wet sides in front of Mr. Sherman's tavern in
      Brampton Street; and Lem Hallowell, his honest face aglow with joy, was
      lifting Cynthia out of the coach as if she were a bundle of feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;this is a little might sudden! What's the
      matter with the capital, Will? Too wicked and sophisticated down thar to
      suit ye?&rdquo; By this time, Wetherell, too, had reached the ground, and as Lem
      Hallowell gazed into his face the laughter in his own died away and gave
      place to a look of concern. &ldquo;Don't wonder ye come back,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you're
      as white as Moses's hoss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He isn't feeling very well, Lem;&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest tuckered, that's all,&rdquo; answered Lem; &ldquo;you git him right into the
      stage, Cynthy, I won't be long. Hurry them things off, Tom,&rdquo; he called,
      and himself seized a huge crate from the back of the coach and flung it on
      his shoulder. He had his cargo on in a jiffy, clucked to his horses, and
      they turned into the familiar road to Coniston just as the sun was dipping
      behind the south end of the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll be surprised some, and disappointed some,&rdquo; said Lem, cheerily;
      &ldquo;they was kind of plannin' a little celebration when you come back, Will&mdash;you
      and Cynthy. Amandy Hatch was a-goin' to bake a cake, and the minister was
      callatin' to say some word of welcome. Wahn't goin' to be anything grand&mdash;jest
      homelike. But you was right to come if you was tuckered. I guess Cynthy
      fetched you. Rias he kep' store and done it well,&mdash;brisker'n I ever
      see him, Rias was. Wait till I put some of them things back, and make you
      more comfortable, Will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved a few parcels and packages from Wetherell's feet and glanced at
      Cynthia as he did so. The mountain cast its vast blue shadow over forest
      and pasture, and above the pines the white mist was rising from Coniston
      Water&mdash;rising in strange shapes. Lem's voice seemed to William
      Wetherell to have given way to a world-wide silence, in the midst of which
      he sought vainly for Cynthia and the stage driver. Most extraordinary of
      all, out of the silence and the void came the checker-paned windows of the
      store at Coniston, then the store itself, with the great oaks bending over
      it, then the dear familiar faces,&mdash;Moses and Amandy, Eph Prescott
      limping toward them, and little Rias Richardson in an apron with a scoop
      shovel in his hand, and many others. They were not smiling at the
      storekeeper's return&mdash;they looked very grave. Then somebody lifted
      him tenderly from the stage and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you worry a mite, Cynthy. Jest tuckered, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell was &ldquo;just tuckered.&rdquo; The great Dr. Coles, authority on
      pulmonary troubles, who came all the way from Boston, could give no better
      verdict than that. It was Jethro Bass who had induced Dr. Coles to come to
      Coniston&mdash;much against the great man's inclination, and to the
      detriment of his patients: Jethro who, on receiving Cynthia's note, had
      left the capital on the next train and had come to Coniston, and had at
      once gone to Boston for the specialist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know why I came,&rdquo; said the famous physician to Dr. Abraham
      Rowell of Tarleton, &ldquo;I never shall know. There is something about that man
      Jethro Bass which compels you to do his will. He has a most extraordinary
      personality. Is this storekeeper a great friend of his?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only intimate friend he had in the world,&rdquo; answered Dr. Rowell; &ldquo;none
      of us could ever understand it. And as for the girl, Jethro Bass worships
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If nursing could cure him, I'd trust her to do it. She's a natural-born
      nurse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two physicians were talking in low tones in the little garden behind
      the store when Jethro came out of the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks as if he were suffering too,&rdquo; said the Boston physician, and he
      walked toward Jethro and laid a hand upon his shoulders. &ldquo;I give him until
      winter, my friend,&rdquo; said Dr. Coles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass sat down on the doorstep&mdash;on that same millstone where he
      had talked with Cynthia many years before&mdash;and was silent for a long
      while. The doctor was used to scenes of sorrow, but the sight of this
      man's suffering unnerved him, and he turned from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-doctor?&rdquo; said Jethro, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor turned again: &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-doctor&mdash;if Wetherell hadn't b'en to the capital would he have
      lived&mdash;if he hadn't been to the capital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Dr. Coles, &ldquo;if Mr. Wetherell had always lived in a warm
      house, and had always been well fed, and helped over the rough places and
      shielded from the storms, he might have lived longer. It is a marvel to me
      that he has lived so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the doctor went way, back to Boston. Many times in his long
      professional life had the veil been lifted for him&mdash;a little. But as
      he sat in the train he said to himself that in this visit to the hamlet of
      Coniston he had had the strangest glimpse of all. William Wetherell
      rallied, as Dr. Coles had predicted, from that first sharp attack, and one
      morning they brought up a reclining chair which belonged to Mr. Satterlee,
      the minister, and set it in the window. There, in the still days of the
      early autumn, Wetherell looked down upon the garden he had grown to love,
      and listened to the song of Coniston Water. There Cynthia, who had
      scarcely left his side, read to him from Keats and Shelley and Tennyson&mdash;yet
      the thought grew on her that he did not seem to hear. Even that wonderful
      passage of Milton's, beginning &ldquo;So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,&rdquo;
       which he always used to beg her to repeat, did not seem to move him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbors came and sat with him, but he would not often speak. Cheery
      Lem Hallowell and his wife, and Cousin Ephraim, to talk about the war,
      hobbling slowly up the stairs&mdash;for rheumatism had been added to that
      trouble of the Wilderness bullet now, and Ephraim was getting along in
      years; and Rias Richardson stole up in his carpet slippers; and Moses,
      after his chores were done, and Amandy with her cakes and delicacies,
      which he left untouched&mdash;though Amandy never knew it. Yes, and Jethro
      came. Day by day he would come silently into the room, and sit silently
      for a space, and go as silently out of it. The farms were neglected now on
      Thousand Acre Hill. William Wetherell would take his hand, and speak to
      him, but do no more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when Cynthia leaned over him, listening as he breathed to
      know whether he slept or were awake. If he were not sleeping, he would
      speak her name: he repeated it often in those days, as though the sound of
      it gave him comfort; and he would fall asleep with it on his lips, holding
      her hand, and thinking, perhaps, of that other Cynthia who had tended and
      nursed and shielded him in other days. Then she would steal down the
      stairs to Jethro on the doorstep: to Jethro who would sit there for hours
      at a time, to the wonder and awe of his neighbors. Although they knew that
      he loved the storekeeper as he loved no other man, his was a grief that
      they could not understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia used to go to Jethro in the garden. Sorrow had brought them very
      near together; and though she had loved him before, now he had become her
      reliance and her refuge. The first time Cynthia saw him; when the worst of
      the illness had passed and the strange and terrifying apathy had come, she
      had hidden her head on his shoulder and wept there. Jethro kept that coat,
      with the tear stains on it, to his dying day, and never wore it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes&mdash;sometimes I think if he hadn't gone to the capital,
      Cynthy, this mightn't hev come,&rdquo; he said to her once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the doctor said that didn't matter, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she answered,
      trying to comfort him. She, too, believed that something had happened at
      the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-never spoke to you about anything there&mdash;n-never spoke to you,
      Cynthia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&mdash;he hardly speaks at all, Uncle Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One bright morning after the sun had driven away the frost, when the
      sumacs and maples beside Coniston Water were aflame with red, Bias
      Richardson came stealing up the stairs and whispered something to Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; she said, laying down her book, &ldquo;it's Mr. Merrill. Will you see
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell gave her a great fright. He started up from his pillows,
      and seized her wrist with a strength which she had not thought remained in
      his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Merrill!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Merrill here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, agitatedly, &ldquo;he's downstairs&mdash;in the store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him to come up,&rdquo; said Wetherell, sinking back again, &ldquo;ask him to come
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, as she stood in the passage, was of two minds about it. She was
      thoroughly frightened, and went first to the garden to ask Jethro's
      advice. But Jethro, so Milly Skinner said, had gone off half an hour
      before, and did not know that Mr. Merrill had arrived. Cynthia went back
      again to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Mr. Merrill?&rdquo; asked Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad, do you think you ought to see him? He&mdash;he might excite you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insist upon seeing him, Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell had never said anything like that before. But Cynthia
      obeyed him, and presently led Mr. Merrill into the room. The kindly little
      railroad president was very serious now. The wasted face of the
      storekeeper, enhanced as it was by the beard, gave Mr. Merrill such a
      shock that he could not speak for a few moments&mdash;he who rarely lacked
      for cheering words on any occasion. A lump rose in his throat as he went
      over and stood by the chair and took the sick man's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you came, Mr. Merrill,&rdquo; said Wetherell, simply, &ldquo;I wanted to
      speak to you. Cynthia, will you leave us alone for a few minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia went, troubled and perplexed, wondering at the change in him. He
      had had something on his mind&mdash;now she was sure of it&mdash;something
      which Mr. Merrill might be able to relieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Merrill who spoke first when she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was coming up to Brampton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and Tom Collins, who drives the
      Truro coach, told me you were sick. I had not heard of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill, too, had something on his mind, and did not quite know how to
      go on. There was in William Wetherell, as he sat in the chair with his
      eyes fixed on his visitor's face, a dignity which Mr. Merrill had not seen
      before&mdash;had not thought the man might possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was coming to see you, anyway,&rdquo; Mr. Merrill said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did you a wrong&mdash;though as God judges me, I did not think of it at
      the time. It was not until Alexander Duncan spoke to me last week that I
      thought of it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued Mr. Merrill wiping his brow, for he found the matter
      even more difficult than he had imagined, &ldquo;it was not until Duncan told me
      how you had acted in his library that I guessed the truth&mdash;that I
      remembered myself how you had acted. I knew that you were not mixed up in
      politics, but I also knew that you were an intimate friend of Jethro's,
      and I thought that you had been let into the secret of the woodchuck
      session. I don't defend the game of politics as it is played, Mr.
      Wetherell, but all of us who are friends of Jethro's are generally willing
      to lend a hand in any little manoeuvre that is going on, and have a
      practical joke when we can. It was not until I saw you sitting there
      beside Duncan that the idea occurred to me. It didn't make a great deal of
      difference whether Duncan or Lovejoy got to the House or not, provided
      they didn't learn of the matter too early, because some of their men had
      been bought off that day. It suited Jethro's sense of humor to play the
      game that way&mdash;and it was very effective. When I saw you there beside
      Duncan I remembered that he had spoken about the Guardian letters, and the
      notion occurred to me to get him to show you his library. I have explained
      to him that you were innocent. I&mdash;I hope you haven't been worrying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell sat very still for a while, gazing out of the window,
      but a new look had come into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass did not know that you&mdash;that you had used me?&rdquo; he asked
      at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Merrill thickly, &ldquo;no. He didn't know a thing about it&mdash;he
      doesn't know it now, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile came upon Wetherell's face, but Mr. Merrill could not look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made me very happy,&rdquo; said the storekeeper, tremulously. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
      have no right to be proud&mdash;I have taken his money&mdash;he has
      supported my daughter and myself all these years. But he had never asked
      me to&mdash;to do anything, and I liked to think that he never would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill could not speak. The tears were streaming down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to promise me, Mr. Merril!&rdquo; he went on presently, &ldquo;I want you
      to promise me that you will never speak to Jethro, of this, or to my
      daughter, Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill merely nodded his head in assent. Still he could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They might think it was this that caused my death. It was not. I know
      very well that I am worn out, and that I should have gone soon in any
      case. And I must leave Cynthia to him. He loves her as his own child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell, his faith in Jethro restored, was facing death as he
      had never faced life. Mr. Merrill was greatly affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not speak of dying, Wetherell,&rdquo; said he, brokenly. &ldquo;Will you
      forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to forgive, now that you have explained matters, Mr.
      Merrill&rdquo; said the storekeeper, and he smiled again. &ldquo;If my fibre had been
      a little tougher, this thing would never have happened. There is only one
      more request I have to make. And that is, to assure Mr. Duncan, from me,
      that I did not detain him purposely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see him on my way to Boston,&rdquo; answered Mr. Merrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Cynthia was called. She was waiting anxiously in the passage for the
      interview to be ended, and when she came in one glance at her father's
      face told her that he was happier. She, too, was happier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would come every day, Mr. Merrill&rdquo; she said, when they
      descended into the garden after the three had talked awhile. &ldquo;It is the
      first time since he fell ill that he seems himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill's answer was to take her hand and pat it. He sat down on the
      millstone and drew a deep breath of that sparkling air and sighed, for his
      memory ran back to his own innocent boyhood in the New England country. He
      talked to Cynthia until Jethro came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have taken a fancy to this girl, Jethro,&rdquo; said the little railroad
      president, &ldquo;I believe I'll steal her; a fellow can't have too many of 'em,
      you know. I'll tell you one thing,&mdash;you won't keep her always shut up
      here in Coniston. She's much too good to waste on the desert air.&rdquo; Perhaps
      Mr. Merrill, too, had been thinking of the Elegy that morning. &ldquo;I don't
      mean to run down Coniston it's one of the most beautiful places I ever
      saw. But seriously, Jethro, you and Wetherell ought to send her to school
      in Boston after a while. She's about the age of my girls, and she can live
      in my house: Ain't I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't know but what you be, Steve,&rdquo; Jethro answered slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am right,&rdquo; declared Mr. Merrill &ldquo;you'll back me in this, I know it.
      Why, she's like your own daughter. You remember what I say. I mean it.&mdash;What
      are you thinking about, Cynthia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't leave Dad and Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, bless your soul,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill &ldquo;bring Dad along. We'll find room
      for him. And I guess Uncle Jethro will get to Boston twice a month if
      you're there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Merrill got into the buggy with Mr. Sherman and drove away to
      Brampton, thinking of many things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-Steve's a good man,&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;C-come up here from Brampton to see
      your father&mdash;did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, &ldquo;he is very kind.&rdquo; She was about to tell Jethro
      what a strange difference this visit had made in her father's spirits, but
      some instinct kept her silent. She knew that Jethro had never ceased to
      reproach himself for inviting Wetherell to the capital, and she was sure
      that something had happened there which had disturbed her father and
      brought on that fearful apathy. But the apathy was dispelled now, and she
      shrank from giving Jethro pain by mentioning the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never knew, indeed, until many years afterward, what had brought
      Stephen Merrill to Coniston. When Jethro went up the stairs that
      afternoon, he found William Wetherell alone, looking out over the garden
      with a new peace and contentment in his eyes. Jethro drew breath when he
      saw that look, as if a great load had been lifted from his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-feelin' some better to-day, Will?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well again, Jethro,&rdquo; replied the storekeeper, pressing Jethro's hand
      for the first time in months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-soon be, Will,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;s-soon be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wetherell, who was not speaking of the welfare of the body, did not
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;there is a little box lying in the top of my
      trunk over there in the corner. Will you get it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro rose and opened the rawhide trunk and handed the little rosewood
      box to his friend. Wetherell took it and lifted the lid reverently, with
      that same smile on his face and far-off look in his eyes, and drew out a
      small daguerreotype in a faded velvet frame. He gazed at the picture a
      long time, and then he held it out to Jethro; and Jethro looked at it, and
      his hand trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a picture of Cynthia Ware. And who can say what emotions it awoke
      in Jethro's heart? She was older than the Cynthia he had known, and yet
      she did not seem so. There was the same sweet, virginal look in the gray
      eyes, and the same exquisite purity in the features. He saw her again&mdash;as
      if it were yesterday&mdash;walking in the golden green light under the
      village maples, and himself standing in the tannery door; he saw the face
      under the poke bonnet on the road to Brampton, and heard the thrush
      singing in the woods. And&mdash;if he could only blot out that scene from
      his life!&mdash;remembered her, a transformed Cynthia,&mdash;remembered
      that face in the lantern-light when he had flung back the hood that shaded
      it; and that hair which he had kissed, wet, then, from the sleet. Ah, God,
      for that briefest of moments she had been his!
    </p>
    <p>
      So he stared at the picture as it lay in the palm of his hand, and forgot
      him who had been her husband. But at length he started, as from a dream,
      and gave it back to Wetherell, who was watching him. Her name had never
      been mentioned between the two men, and yet she had been the one woman in
      the world to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; said William Wetherell, &ldquo;it is strange that I should have
      had but two friends in my life, and that she should have been one and you
      the other. She found me destitute and brought me back to life and married
      me, and cared for me until she died. And after that&mdash;you cared for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you mustn't think of that, Will, 'twahn't much what I did&mdash;no
      more than any one else would hev done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was everything,&rdquo; answered the storekeeper, simply; &ldquo;each of you came
      between me and destruction. There is something that I have always meant to
      tell you, Jethro,&mdash;something that it may be a comfort for you to
      know. Cynthia loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass did not answer. He got up and stood in the window, looking
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she married me,&rdquo; Wetherell continued steadily, &ldquo;she told me that
      there was one whom she had never been able to drive from her heart. And
      one summer evening, how well I recall it!&mdash;we were walking under the
      trees on the Mall and we met my old employer, Mr. Judson, the jeweller. He
      put me in mind of the young countryman who had come in to buy a locket,
      and I asked her if she knew you. Strange that I should have remembered
      your name, wasn't it? It was then that she led me to a bench and confessed
      that you were the man whom she could not forget. I used to hate you then&mdash;as
      much as was in me to hate. I hated and feared you when I first came to
      Coniston. But now I can tell you&mdash;I can even be happy in telling
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass groaned. He put his hand to his throat as though he were
      stifling. Many, many years ago he had worn the locket there. And now? Now
      an impulse seized him, and he yielded to it. He thrust his hand in his
      coat and drew out a cowhide wallet, and from the wallet the oval locket
      itself. There it was, tarnished with age, but with that memorable
      inscription still legible,&mdash;&ldquo;Cynthy, from Jethro&rdquo;; not Cynthia, but
      Cynthy. How the years fell away as he read it! He handed it in silence to
      the storekeeper, and in silence went to the window again. Jethro Bass was
      a man who could find no outlet for his agony in speech or tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Wetherell, &ldquo;I thought you would have kept it. Dear, dear, how
      well I remember it! And I remember how I patronized you when you came into
      the shop. I believed I should live to be something in the world, then.
      Yes, she loved you, Jethro. I can die more easily now that I have told you&mdash;it
      has been on my mind all these years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The locket fell open in William Wetherell's hand, for the clasp had become
      worn with time, and there was a picture of little Cynthia within: of
      little Cynthia,&mdash;not so little now,&mdash;a photograph taken in
      Brampton the year before. Wetherell laid it beside the daguerreotype.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks like her,&rdquo; he said aloud; &ldquo;but the child is more vigorous, more
      human&mdash;less like a spirit. I have always thought of Cynthia Ware as a
      spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro turned at the words, and came and stood looking over Wetherell's
      shoulder at the pictures of mother and daughter. In the rosewood box was a
      brooch and a gold ring&mdash;Cynthia Ware's wedding ring&mdash;and two
      small slips of yellow paper. William Wetherell opened one of these,
      disclosing a little braid of brown hair. He folded the paper again and
      laid it in the locket, and handed that to Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all I have to give you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I know that you will cherish
      it, and cherish her, when I am gone. She&mdash;she has been a daughter to
      both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Wetherell lived but a few days longer. They laid him to rest at
      last in the little ground which Captain Timothy Prescott had hewn out of
      the forest with his axe, where Captain Timothy himself lies under his
      slate headstone with the quaint lettering of bygone days.&mdash;That same
      autumn Jethro Bass made a pilgrimage to Boston, and now Cynthia Ware
      sleeps there, too, beside her husband, amid the scenes she loved so well.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      One day, in the November following William Wetherell's death, Jethro Bass
      astonished Coniston by moving to the little cottage in the village which
      stood beside the disused tannery, and which had been his father's. It was
      known as the tannery house. His reasons for this step, when at length
      discovered, were generally commended: they were, in fact, a disinclination
      to leave a girl of Cynthia's tender age alone on Thousand Acre Hill while
      he journeyed on his affairs about the country. The Rev. Mr. Satterlee,
      gaunt, red-faced, but the six feet of him a man and a Christian, from his
      square-toed boots to the bleaching yellow hair around his temples, offered
      to become her teacher. For by this time Cynthia had exhausted the
      resources of the little school among the birches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four years of her life in the tannery house which are now briefly to
      be chronicled were, for her, full of happiness and peace. Though the young
      may sorrow, they do not often mourn. Cynthia missed her father; at times,
      when the winds kept her wakeful at night, she wept for him. But she loved
      Jethro Bass and served him with a devotion that filled his heart with
      strange ecstasies&mdash;yes, and forebodings. In all his existence he had
      never known a love like this. He may have imagined it once, back in the
      bright days of his youth; but the dreams of its fulfilment had fallen far
      short of the exquisite touch of the reality in which he now spent his days
      at home. In summer, when she sat, in the face of all the conventions of
      the village, reading under the butternut tree before the house, she would
      feel his eyes upon her, and the mysterious yearning in them would startle
      her. Often during her lessons with Mr. Satterlee in the parlor of the
      parsonage she would hear a noise outside and perceive Jethro leaning
      against the pillar. Both Cynthia and Mr. Satterlee knew that he was there,
      and both, by a kind of tacit agreement, ignored the circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, in this period, undertook Jethro's education, too. She could have
      induced him to study the making of Latin verse by the mere asking. During
      those days which he spent at home, and which he had grown to value beyond
      price, he might have been seen seated on the ground with his back to the
      butternut tree while Cynthia read aloud from the well-worn books which had
      been her father's treasures, books that took on marvels of meaning from
      her lips. Cynthia's powers of selection were not remarkable at this
      period, and perhaps it was as well that she never knew the effect of the
      various works upon the hitherto untamed soul of her listener. Milton and
      Tennyson and Longfellow awoke in him by their very music troubled and
      half-formed regrets; Carlyle's &ldquo;Frederick the Great&rdquo; set up tumultuous
      imaginings; but the &ldquo;Life of Jackson&rdquo; (as did the story of Napoleon long
      ago) stirred all that was masterful in his blood. Unlettered as he was,
      Jethro had a power which often marks the American of action&mdash;a
      singular grasp of the application of any sentence or paragraph to his own
      life; and often, about this time, he took away the breath of a judge or a
      senator by flinging at them a chunk of Carlyle or Parton.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps as well that Cynthia was not a woman at this time, and that
      she had grown up with him, as it were. His love, indeed, was that of a
      father for a daughter; but it held within it as a core the revived love of
      his youth for Cynthia, her mother. Tender as were the manifestations of
      this love, Cynthia never guessed the fires within, for there was in truth
      something primeval in the fierceness of his passion. She was his now&mdash;his
      alone, to cherish and sweeten the declining years of his life, and when by
      a chance Jethro looked upon her and thought of the suitor who was to come
      in the fulness of her years, he burned with a hatred which it is given few
      men to feel. It was well for Jethro that these thoughts came not often.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, in the summer afternoons, they took long drives through the
      town behind Jethro's white horse on business. &ldquo;Jethro's gal,&rdquo; as Cynthia
      came to be affectionately called, held the reins while Jethro went in to
      talk to the men folk. One August evening found Cynthia thus beside a
      poplar in front of Amos Cuthbert's farmhouse, a poplar that shimmered
      green-gold in the late afternoon, and from the buggy-seat Cynthia looked
      down upon a thousand purple hilltops and mountain peaks of another state.
      The view aroused in the girl visions of the many wonders which life was to
      hold, and she did not hear the sharp voice beside her until the woman had
      spoken twice. Jethro came out in the middle of the conversation, nodded to
      Mrs. Cuthbert, and drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; asked Cynthia, presently, &ldquo;what is a mortgage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro struck the horse with the whip, an uncommon action with him, and
      the buggy was jerked forward sharply over the boulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;who's b'en talkin' about mortgages, Cynthy?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Cuthbert said that when folks had mortgage held over them they had
      to take orders whether they liked them or not. She said that Amos had to
      do what you told him because there was a mortgage. That isn't so is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro did not speak. Presently Cynthia laid her hand over his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Cuthbert is a spiteful woman,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know the reason why
      people obey you&mdash;it's because you're so great. And Daddy used to tell
      me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tremor shook Jethro's frame and the hand on which hers rested, and all
      the way down the mountain valleys to Coniston village he did not speak
      again. But Cynthia was used to his silences, and respected them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Ephraim Prescott, who, as the days went on, found it more and more
      difficult to sew harness on account of his rheumatism, Jethro was not only
      a great man but a hero. For Cynthia was vaguely troubled at having found
      one discontent. She was wont to entertain Ephraim on the days when his
      hands failed him, when he sat sunning himself before his door; and she
      knew that he was honest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's b'en talkin' to you, Cynthia?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, Jethro's the biggest
      man I know, and the best. I don't like to think where some of us would
      have b'en if he hadn't given us a lift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has enemies, Cousin Eph,&rdquo; said Cynthia, still troubled. &ldquo;What
      great man hain't?&rdquo; exclaimed the soldier. &ldquo;Jethro's enemies hain't worth
      thinkin' about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought that Jethro had enemies was very painful to Cynthia, and she
      wanted to know who they were that she might show them a proper contempt if
      she met them. Lem Hallowell brushed aside the subject with his usual bluff
      humor, and pinched her cheek and told her not to trouble her head; Amanda
      Hatch dwelt upon the inherent weakness in the human race, and the Rev. Mr.
      Satterlee faced the question once, during a history lesson. The nation's
      heroes came into inevitable comparison with Jethro Bass. Was Washington so
      good a man? and would not Jethro have been as great as the Father of his
      Country if he had had the opportunities?
    </p>
    <p>
      The answers sorely tried Mr. Satterlee's conscience, albeit he was not a
      man of the world. It set him thinking. He liked Jethro, this man of rugged
      power whose word had become law in the state. He knew best that side of
      him which Cynthia saw; and&mdash;if the truth be told&mdash;as a native of
      Coniston Mr. Satterlee felt in the bottom of his heart a certain pride in
      Jethro. The minister's opinions well represented the attitude of his time.
      He had not given thought to the subject&mdash;for such matters had came to
      be taken for granted. A politician now was a politician, his ways and
      standards set apart from those of other citizens, and not to be judged by
      men without the pale of public life. Mr. Satterlee in his limited vision
      did not then trace the matter to its source, did not reflect that Jethro
      Bass himself was almost wholly responsible in that state for the condition
      of politics and politicians. Coniston was proud of Jethro, prouder of him
      than ever since his last great victory in the Legislature, which brought
      the Truro Railroad through to Harwich and settled their townsman more
      firmly than ever before in the seat of power. Every statesman who drove
      into their little mountain village and stopped at the tannery house made
      their blood beat faster. Senators came, and representatives, and judges,
      and governors, &ldquo;to git their orders,&rdquo; as Rias Richardson briefly put it,
      and Jethro could make or unmake them at a word. Each was scanned from the
      store where Rias now reigned supreme, and from the harness shop across the
      road. Some drove away striving to bite from their lips the tell-tale smile
      which arose in spite of them; others tried to look happy, despite the
      sentence of doom to which they had listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass was indeed a great man to make such as these tremble or
      rejoice. When he went abroad with Cynthia awheel or afoot, some took off
      their hats&mdash;an unheard-of thing in Coniston. If he stopped at the
      store, they scanned his face for the mood he was in before venturing their
      remarks; if he lingered for a moment in front of the house of Amanda
      Hatch, the whole village was advised of the circumstance before nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two personages worthy of mention here visited the tannery house during the
      years that Cynthia lived with Jethro. The Honorable Heth Sutton drove over
      from Clovelly attended by his prime minister, Mr. Bijah Bixby. The
      Honorable Heth did not attempt to conceal the smile with which he went
      away, and he stopped at the store long enough to enable Rias to produce
      certain refreshments from depths unknown to the United States Internal
      Revenue authorities. Mr. Sutton shook hands with everybody, including Jake
      Wheeler. Well he might. He came to Coniston a private citizen, and drove
      away to all intents and purposes a congressman: the darling wish of his
      life realized after heaven knows how many caucuses and conventions of
      disappointment, when Jethro had judged it expedient for one reason or
      another that a north countryman should go. By the time the pair reached
      Brampton, Chamberlain Bixby was introducing his chief as Congressman
      Sutton, and by this title he was known for many years to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day, when the snow lay in great billows on the ground and filled
      the mountain valleys, when the pines were rusty from the long winter, two
      other visitors drove to Coniston in a two-horse sleigh. The sun was
      shining brightly, the wind held its breath, and the noon-day warmth was
      almost like that of spring. Those who know the mountain country will
      remember the joy of many such days. Cynthia, standing in the sun on the
      porch, breathing deep of the pure air, recognized, as the sleigh drew
      near, the somewhat portly gentleman driving, and the young woman beside
      him regally clad in furs who looked patronizingly at the tannery house as
      she took the reins. The young woman was Miss Cassandra Hopkins, and the
      portly gentleman, the Honorable Alva himself, patron of the drama, who had
      entered upon his governorship and now wished to be senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass home?&rdquo; he called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass is home,&rdquo; answered Cynthia. The girl in the sleigh murmured
      something, laughing a little, and Cynthia flushed. Mr. Hopkins gave a
      somewhat peremptory knock at the door and was admitted by Millicent
      Skinner, but Cynthia stood staring at Cassandra in the sleigh, some
      instinct warning her of a coming skirmish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live here all the year round?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cassandra shrugged as though that were beyond her comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd die in a place like this,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No balls, or theatres. Doesn't
      your father take you around the state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father's dead,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Your name's Cynthia Wetherell, isn't it? You know Bob Worthington,
      don't you? He's gone to Harvard now, but he was a great friend of mine at
      Andover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia didn't answer. It would not be fair to say that she felt a pang,
      though it might add to the romance of this narrative. But her dislike for
      the girl in the sleigh decidedly increased. How was she, in her
      inexperience, to know that the radiant beauty in furs was what the boys at
      Phillips Andover called an &ldquo;old stager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you live with Jethro Bass,&rdquo; was Miss Cassandra's next remark. &ldquo;He's
      rich enough to take you round the state and give you everything you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have everything I want,&rdquo; replied Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't call living here having everything I wanted,&rdquo; declared Miss
      Hopkins, with a contemptuous glance at the tannery house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you wouldn't,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hopkins was nettled. She was out of humor that day, besides she
      shared some of her father's political ambition. If he went to Washington,
      she went too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you know Jethro Bass was rich?&rdquo; she demanded, imprudently. &ldquo;Why,
      my father gave twenty thousand dollars to be governor, and Jethro Bass
      must have got half of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's eyes were of that peculiar gray which, lighted by love or anger,
      once seen, are never forgotten. One hand was on the dashboard of the
      cutter, the other had seized the seat. Her voice was steady, and the three
      words she spoke struck Miss Hopkins with startling effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hopkins's breath was literally taken away, and for once she found no
      retort. Let it be said for her that this was a new experience with a new
      creature. A demure country girl turn into a wildcat before her very eyes!
      Perhaps it was as well for both that the door of the house opened and the
      Honorable Alva interrupted their talk, and without so much as a glance at
      Cynthia he got hurriedly into the sleigh and drove off. When Cynthia
      turned, the points of color still high in her cheeks and the light still
      ablaze in her eyes, she surprised Jethro gazing at her from the porch, and
      some sorrow she felt rather than beheld stopped the confession on her
      lips. It would be unworthy of her even to repeat such slander, and the
      color surged again into her face for very shame of her anger. Cassandra
      Hopkins had not been worthy of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro did not speak, but slipped his hand into hers, and thus they stood
      for a long time gazing at the snow fields between the pines on the heights
      of Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next summer, was the first which the painter&mdash;pioneer of summer
      visitors there&mdash;spent at Coniston. He was an unsuccessful painter,
      who became, by a process which he himself does not to-day completely
      understand, a successful writer of novels. As a character, however, he
      himself confesses his inadequacy, and the chief interest in him for the
      readers of this narrative is that he fell deeply in love with Cynthia
      Wetherell at nineteen. It is fair to mention in passing that other young
      men were in love with Cynthia at this time, notably Eben Hatch&mdash;history
      repeating itself. Once, in a moment of madness, Eben confessed his love,
      the painter never did: and he has to this day a delicious memory which has
      made Cynthia the heroine of many of his stories. He boarded with Chester
      Perkins, and he was humored by the village as a harmless but amiable
      lunatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter had never conceived that a New England conscience and a temper
      of no mean proportions could dwell together in the body of a wood nymph.
      When he had first seen Cynthia among the willows by Coniston Water, he had
      thought her a wood nymph. But she scolded him for his impropriety with so
      unerring a choice of words that he fell in love with her intellect, too.
      He spent much of his time to the neglect of his canvases under the
      butternut tree in front of Jethro's house trying to persuade Cynthia to
      sit for her portrait; and if Jethro himself had not overheard one of these
      arguments, the portrait never would have been painted. Jethro focussed a
      look upon the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;painter-man, be you? Paint Cynthy's picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want to be painted, Uncle Jethro. I won't be painted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how much for a good picture? Er&mdash;only want the best&mdash;only
      want the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter said a few things, with pardonable heat, to the effect&mdash;well,
      never mind the effect. His remarks made no impression whatever upon
      Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;-paint the picture&mdash;paint the picture, and then we'll talk
      about the price. Er&mdash;wait a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the house, and they heard him lumbering up the stairs.
      Cynthia sat with her back to the artist, pretending to read, but presently
      she turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never forgive you&mdash;never, as long as I live,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and I
      won't be painted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-not to please me, Cynthy?&rdquo; It was Jethro's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her look softened. She laid down the book and went up to him on the porch
      and put her hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really want it so much as all that, Uncle Jethro?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Callate I do, Cynthy,&rdquo; he answered. He held a bundle covered with
      newspaper in his hand, he looked down at Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself on the edge of the porch and for the moment seemed lost
      in revery. Then he began slowly to unwrap the newspaper from the bundle:
      there were five layers of it, but at length he disclosed a bolt of
      cardinal cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call this to mind, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how's this for the dress, Mr. Painter-man?&rdquo; said Jethro, with a pride
      that was ill-concealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter started up from his seat and took the material in his hands
      and looked at Cynthia. He belonged to a city club where he was popular for
      his knack of devising costumes, and a vision of Cynthia as the daughter of
      a Doge of Venice arose before his eyes. Wonder of wonders, the daughter of
      a Doge discovered in a New England hill village! The painter seized his
      pad and pencil and with a few strokes, guided by inspiration, sketched the
      costume then and there and held it up to Jethro, who blinked at it in
      astonishment. But Jethro was suspicious of his own sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;well&mdash;Godfrey&mdash;g-guess that'll do.&rdquo; Then came the
      involuntary: &ldquo;W-wouldn't a-thought you had it in you. How about it,
      Cynthy?&rdquo; and he held it up for her inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are pleased, it's all I care about, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she answered,
      and then, her face suddenly flushing, &ldquo;You must promise me on your honor
      that nobody in Coniston shall know about it, 'Mr. Painter-man'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this she always called him &ldquo;Mr. Painter-man,&rdquo;&mdash;when she was
      pleased with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the cardinal cloth was come to its usefulness at last. It was
      inevitable that Sukey Kittredge, the village seamstress, should be taken
      into confidence. It was no small thing to take Sukey into confidence, for
      she was the legitimate successor in more ways than one of Speedy Bates,
      and much of Cynthia and the artist's ingenuity was spent upon devising a
      form of oath which would hold Sukey silent. Sukey, however, got no small
      consolation from the sense of the greatness of the trust confided in her,
      and of the uproar she could make in Coniston if she chose. The painter, to
      do him justice, was the real dressmaker, and did everything except cut the
      cloth and sew it together. He sent to friends of his in the city for
      certain paste jewels and ornaments, and one day Cynthia stood in the old
      tannery shed&mdash;hastily transformed into a studio&mdash;before a
      variously moved audience. Sukey, having adjusted the last pin, became
      hysterical over her handiwork, Millicent Skinner stared openmouthed, words
      having failed her for once, and Jethro thrust his hands in his pockets in
      a quiet ecstasy of approbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-always had a notion that cloth'd set you off, Cynthy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;er&mdash;next
      time I go to the state capital you come along&mdash;g-guess it'll surprise
      'em some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it would, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; said Cynthia, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro postponed two political trips of no small importance to be present
      at the painting of that picture, and he would sit silently by the hour in
      a corner of the shed watching every stroke of the brush. Never stood
      Doge's daughter in her jewels and seed pearls amidst stranger
      surroundings,&mdash;the beam, and the centre post around which the old
      white horse had toiled in times gone by, and all the piled-up, disused
      machinery of forgotten days. And never was Venetian lady more unconscious
      of her environment than Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait was of the head and shoulders alone, and when he had given it
      the last touch, the painter knew that, for once in his life, he had done a
      good thing. Never before; perhaps, had the fire of such inspiration been
      given him. Jethro, who expressed himself in terms (for him) of great
      enthusiasm, was for going to Boston immediately to purchase a frame
      commensurate with the importance of such a work of art, but the artist had
      his own views on that subject and sent to New York for this also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the completion of the picture a rugged figure in rawhide
      boots and coonskin cap approached Chester Perkins's house, knocked at the
      door, and inquired for the &ldquo;Painter-man.&rdquo; It was Jethro. The &ldquo;Painter-man&rdquo;
       forthwith went out into the rain behind the shed, where a somewhat curious
      colloquy took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess I'm willin' to pay you full as much as it's worth,&rdquo; said Jethro,
      producing a cowhide wallet. &ldquo;Er&mdash;what figure do you allow it comes to
      with the frame?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The artist was past taking offence, since Jethro had long ago become for
      him an engrossing study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will send you the bill for the frame, Mr. Bass,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the picture
      belongs to Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Earn your livin' by paintin', don't you&mdash;earn your livin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The painter smiled a little bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I did, I shouldn't be&mdash;alive. Mr. Bass, have you
      ever done anything the pleasure of doing which was pay enough, and to
      spare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro looked at him, and something very like admiration came into the
      face that was normally expressionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put up his wallet a little awkwardly, and held out his hand more
      awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You be more of a feller than I thought for,&rdquo; he said, and strode off
      through the drizzle toward Coniston. The painter walked slowly to the
      kitchen, where Chester Perkins and his wife were sitting down to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro got a mortgage on you, too?&rdquo; asked Chester.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist had his reward, for when the picture was hung at length in the
      little parlor of the tannery house it became a source of pride to Coniston
      second only to Jethro himself.

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Time passes, and the engines of the Truro Railroad are now puffing in and
      out of the yards of Worthington's mills in Brampton, and a fine layer of
      dust covers the old green stage which has worn the road for so many years
      over Truro Gap. If you are ever in Brampton, you can still see the stage,
      if you care to go into the back of what was once Jim Sanborn's livery
      stable, now owned by Mr. Sherman of the Brampton House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conventions and elections had come and gone, and the Honorable Heth Sutton
      had departed triumphantly to Washington, cheered by his neighbors in
      Clovelly. Chamberlain Bixby was left in charge there, supreme. Who could
      be more desirable as a member of Congress than Mr. Sutton, who had so ably
      served his party (and Jethro) by holding the House against the insurgents
      in the matter of the Truro Bill? Mr. Sutton was, moreover, a gentleman, an
      owner of cattle and land, a man of substance whom lesser men were proud to
      mention as a friend&mdash;a very hill-Rajah with stock in railroads and
      other enterprises, who owed allegiance and paid tribute alone to the Great
      Man of Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sutton was one who would make himself felt even in the capital of the
      United States&mdash;felt and heard. And he had not been long in the Halls
      of Congress before he made a speech which rang under the very dome of the
      Capitol. So said the Brampton and Harwich papers, at least, though rivals
      and detractors of Mr. Sutton declared that they could find no matter in it
      which related to the subject of a bill, but that is neither here nor
      there. The oration began with a lengthy tribute to the resources and
      history of his state, and ended by a declaration that the speaker was in
      Congress at no man's bidding, but as the servant of the common people of
      his district.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the lamp of the little parlor in the tannery house, Cynthia (who has
      now arrived at the very serious age of nineteen) was reading the papers to
      Jethro and came upon Mr. Sutton's speech. There were four columns of it,
      but Jethro seemed to take delight in every word; and portions of the
      noblest parts of it, indeed, he had Cynthia read over again. Sometimes, in
      the privacy of his home, Jethro was known to chuckle, and to Cynthia's
      surprise he chuckled more than usual that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said at length, when she had laid the paper down, &ldquo;I
      thought that you sent Mr. Sutton to Congress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What put that into your head, Cynthy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered the girl, &ldquo;everybody says so,&mdash;Moses Hatch, Rias, and
      Cousin Eph. Didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro looked at her, as she thought, strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're too young to know anything about such things, Cynthy,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;too young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you make all the judges and senators and congressmen in the state, I
      know you do. Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia, indignantly, &ldquo;why does Mr. Sutton
      say the people elected him when he owes everything to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro, arose abruptly and flung a piece of wood into the stove, and then
      he stood with his back to her. Her instinct told her that he was
      suffering, though she could not fathom the cause, and she rose swiftly and
      drew him down into the chair beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she said anxiously. &ldquo;Have you got rheumatism, too, like
      Cousin Eph? All old men seem to have rheumatism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Cynthy, it hain't rheumatism,&rdquo; he managed to answer; &ldquo;wimmen folks
      hadn't ought to mix up in politics. They&mdash;they don't understand 'em,
      Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall understand them some day, because I am your daughter&mdash;now
      that&mdash;now that I have only you, I am your daughter, am I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he answered huskily, with his hand on her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know more than most women now,&rdquo; continued Cynthia, triumphantly.
      &ldquo;I'm going to be such a help to you soon&mdash;very soon. I've read a lot
      of history, and I know some of the Constitution by heart. I know why old
      Timothy Prescott fought in the Revolution&mdash;it was to get rid of
      kings, wasn't it, and to let the people have a chance? The people can
      always be trusted to do what is right, can't they, Uncle Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro was silent, but Cynthia did not seem to notice that. After a space
      she spoke again:&mdash;&ldquo;I've been thinking it all out about you, Uncle
      Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know why you are able to send men to Congress and make judges of
      them. It's because the people have chosen you to do all that for them&mdash;you
      are so great and good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the month was March, it was one of those wonderful still nights
      that sometimes come in the mountain-country when the wind is silent in the
      notches and the stars seem to burn nearer to the earth. Cynthia awoke and
      lay staring for an instant at the red planet which hung over the black and
      ragged ridge, and then she arose quickly and knocked at the door across
      the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill, Uncle Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;no, Cynthy. Go to bed. Er&mdash;I was just thinkin'&mdash;thinkin',
      that's all, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though all his life he had eaten sparingly, Cynthia noticed that he
      scarcely touched his breakfast the next morning, and two hours later he
      went unexpectedly to the state capital. That day, too, Coniston was
      clothed in clouds, and by afternoon a wild March snowstorm was sweeping
      down the face of the mountain, piling against doorways and blocking the
      roads. Through the storm Cynthia fought her way to the harness shop, for
      Ephraim Prescott had taken to his bed, bound hand and foot by rheumatism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of that spring Ephraim was all but helpless, and Cynthia spent many
      days nursing him and reading to him. Meanwhile the harness industry
      languished. Cynthia and Ephraim knew, and Coniston guessed, that Jethro
      was taking care of Ephraim, and strong as was his affection for Jethro the
      old soldier found dependence hard to bear. He never spoke of it to
      Cynthia, but he used to lie and dream through the spring days of what he
      might have done if the war had not crippled him. For Ephraim Prescott,
      like his grandfather, was a man of action&mdash;a keen, intelligent
      American whose energy, under other circumstances, might have gone toward
      the making of the West. Ephraim, furthermore, had certain principles which
      some in Coniston called cranks; for instance, he would never apply for a
      pension, though he could easily have obtained one. Through all his
      troubles, he held grimly to the ideal which meant more to him than ease
      and comfort,&mdash;that he had served his country for the love of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the warm weather he was able to be about again, and occasionally to
      mend a harness, but Doctor Rowell shook his head when Jethro stopped his
      buggy in the road one day to inquire about Ephraim. Whereupon Jethro went
      on to the harness shop. The inspiration, by the way, had come from
      Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Ephraim, how'd you like to, be postmaster? H-haven't any
      objections to that kind of a job, hev you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no,&rdquo; said Ephraim. &ldquo;We hain't agoin' to hev a post-office at Coniston&mdash;air
      we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how'd you like to be postmaster at Brampton?&rdquo; demanded Jethro,
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim dropped the trace he was shaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Postmaster at Brampton!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how'd you like it?&rdquo; said Jethro again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ephraim, &ldquo;I hain't got any objections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro started out of the shop, but paused again at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-won't say nothin' about it, will you, Eph?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till I git it,&rdquo; answered Ephraim. The sorrows of three years were
      suddenly lifted from his shoulders, and for an instant Ephraim wanted to
      dance until he remembered the rheumatism and the Wilderness leg. Suddenly
      a thought struck him, and he hobbled to the door and called out after
      Jethro's retreating figure. Jethro returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the pay?&rdquo; said Ephraim, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro named the sum instantly, also in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't tell me!&rdquo; said Ephraim, and sank stupefied into the chair in
      front of the shop, where lately he had spent so much of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro chuckled twice on his way home: he chuckled twice again to
      Cynthia's delight at supper, and after supper he sent Millicent Skinner to
      find Jake Wheeler. Jake as usual, was kicking his heels in front of the
      store, talking to Rias and others about the coming Fourth of July
      celebration at Brampton. Brampton, as we know, was famous for its Fourth
      of July celebrations. Not neglecting to let it be known that Jethro had
      sent for him, Jake hurried off through the summer twilight to the tannery
      house, bowed ceremoniously to Cynthia under the butternut tree, and
      discovered Jethro behind the shed. It was usually Jethro's custom to allow
      the other man to begin the conversation, no matter how trivial the subject&mdash;a
      method which had commended itself to Mr. Bixby and other minor politicians
      who copied him. And usually the other man played directly into Jethro's
      hands. Jake Wheeler always did, and now, to cover the awkwardness of the
      silence, he began on the Brampton celebration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me Heth Sutton's a-goin' to make the address&mdash;seems
      prouder than ever sence he went to Congress. I guess you'll tell him what
      to say when the time comes, Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;goin' to Clovelly after wool this week, Jake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kin go to-morrow,&rdquo; said Jake, scenting an affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;goin' to Clovelly after wool this week, Jake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jake reflected. He saw it was expedient that this errand should not smell
      of haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was goin' to see Cutter on Friday,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;if you should happen to meet Heth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; interrupted Jake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If by chance you should happen to meet Heth, or Bije&rdquo; (Jethro knew that
      Jake never went to Clovelly without a conference with one or the other of
      these personages, if only to be able to talk about it afterward at the
      store), &ldquo;er&mdash;what would you say to 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Jake, scratching his head for the answer, &ldquo;I'd tell him you
      was at Coniston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think we'll have rain, Jake?&rdquo; inquired Jethro, blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jake wended his way back to the store, filled with renewed admiration for
      the great man. Jethro had given him no instructions whatever, could deny
      before a jury if need be that he had sent him (Jake) to Clovelly to tell
      Heth Sutton to come to Coniston for instructions on the occasion of his
      Brampton speech. And Jake was filled with a mysterious importance when he
      took his seat once more in the conclave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jake Wheeler, although in many respects a fool, was one of the most
      efficient pack of political hounds that the state has ever known. By six
      o'clock on Friday morning he was descending a brook valley on the Clovelly
      side of the mountain, and by seven was driving between the forest and
      river meadows of the Rajah's domain, and had come in sight of the big
      white house with its somewhat pretentious bay-windows and Gothic doorway;
      it might be dubbed the palace of these parts. The wide river flowed below
      it, and the pastures so wondrously green in the morning sun were dotted
      with fat cattle and sheep. Jake was content to borrow a cut of tobacco
      from the superintendent and wonder aimlessly around the farm until Mr.
      Sutton's family prayers and breakfast were accomplished. We shall not
      concern ourselves with the message or the somewhat lengthy manner in which
      it was delivered. Jake had merely dropped in by accident, but the Rajah
      listened coldly while he picked his teeth, said he didn't know whether he
      was going to Brampton or not&mdash;hadn't decided; didn't know whether he
      could get to Coniston or not&mdash;his affairs were multitudinous now. In
      short, he set Jake to thinking deeply as his horse walked up the western
      heights of Coniston on the return journey. He had, let it be repeated, a
      sure instinct once his nose was fairly on the scent, and he was convinced
      that a war of great magnitude was in the air, and he; Jake Wheeler, was
      probably the first in all the elate to discover it! His blood leaped at
      the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hill-Rajah's defiance, boiled down, could only mean one thing,&mdash;that
      somebody with sufficient power and money was about to lock horns with
      Jethro Bass. Not for a moment did Jake believe that, for all his pomp and
      circumstance, the Honorable Heth Sutton was a big enough man to do this.
      Jake paid to the Honorable Heth all the outward respect that his high
      position demanded, but he knew the man through and through. He thought of
      the Honorable Heth's reform speech in Congress, and laughed loudly in the
      echoing woods. No, Mr. Sutton was not the man to lead a fight. But to whom
      had he promised his allegiance? This question puzzled Mr. Wheeler all the
      way home, and may it be said finally for many days thereafter. He slid
      into Coniston in the dusk, big with impending events, which he could not
      fathom. As to giving Jethro the careless answer of the hill-Rajah, that
      was another matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fourth of July came at last, nor was any contradiction made in the
      Brampton papers that the speech of the Honorable Heth Sutton had been
      cancelled. Instead, advertisements appeared in the 'Brampton Clarion'
      announcing the fact in large letters. When Cynthia read this advertisement
      to Jethro, he chuckled again. They were under the butternut tree, for the
      evenings were long now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take me to Brampton, Uncle Jethro?&rdquo; said she, letting fall the
      paper on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-who's to get in the hay?&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hay on the Fourth of July!&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia, &ldquo;why, that's&mdash;sacrilege!
      You'd much better come and hear Mr. Sutton's speech&mdash;it will do you
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia could see that Jethro was intensely amused, for his eyes had a way
      of snapping on such occasions when he was alone with her. She was puzzled
      and slightly offended, because, to tell the truth, Jethro had spoiled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'll go with the Painter-man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro came and stood over her, his expression the least bit wistful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Cynthy,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;hain't fond of that Painter-man, be
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's fond of you,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;sh-shouldn't be surprised if he was in
      love with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia looked up at him, the corners of her mouth twitching, and then she
      laughed. The Rev. Mr. Satterlee, writing his Sunday sermon in his study,
      heard her and laid down his pen to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;sometimes I forget that you're a great,
      wise man, and I think that you are just a silly old goose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro wiped his face with his blue cotton handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you hain't a-goin' to marry the Painter-man?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to marry anybody,&rdquo; cried Cynthia, contritely; &ldquo;I'm going to
      live with you and take care of you all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the Fourth, Cynthia drove to Brampton with the
      Painter-man, and when he perceived that she was dreaming, he ceased to
      worry her with his talk. He liked her dreaming, and stole many glances at
      her face of which she knew nothing at all. Through the cool and fragrant
      woods, past the mill-pond stained blue and white by the sky, and scented
      clover fields and wayside flowers nodding in the morning air&mdash;Cynthia
      saw these things in the memory of another journey to Brampton. On that
      Fourth her father had been with her, and Jethro and Ephraim and Moses and
      Amanda Hatch and the children. And how well she recalled, too, standing
      amidst the curious crowd before the great house which Mr. Worthington had
      just built.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are weeks and months, perhaps, when we do not think of people, when
      our lives are full and vigorous, and then perchance a memory will bring
      them vividly before us&mdash;so vividly that we yearn for them. There rose
      before Cynthia now the vision of a boy as he stood on the Gothic porch of
      the house, and how he had come down to the wondering country people with
      his smile and his merry greeting, and how he had cajoled her into
      lingering in front of the meeting-house. Had he forgotten her? With just a
      suspicion of a twinge, Cynthia remembered that Janet Duncan she had seen
      at the capital, whom she had been told was the heiress of the state. When
      he had graduated from Harvard, Bob would, of course, marry her. That was
      in the nature of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some the great event of that day in Brampton was to be the speech of
      the Honorable Heth Sutton in the meeting-house at eleven; others (and this
      party was quite as numerous) had looked forward to the base-ball game
      between Brampton and Harwich in the afternoon. The painter would have
      preferred to walk up meeting-house hill with Cynthia, and from the cool
      heights look down upon the amphitheatre in which the town was built. But
      Cynthia was interested in history, and they went to the meeting-house
      accordingly, where she listened for an hour and a half to the patriotic
      eloquence of the representative. The painter was glad to see and hear so
      great a man in the hour of his glory, though so much as a fragment of the
      oration does not now remain in his memory. In size, in figure, in
      expression, in the sonorous tones of his voice, Mr. Sutton was everything
      that a congressman should be. &ldquo;The people,&rdquo; said Isaac D. Worthington in
      presenting him, &ldquo;should indeed be proud of such an able and high-minded
      representative.&rdquo; We shall have cause to recall that word high-minded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many persons greeted Cynthia outside the meetinghouse, for the girl seemed
      genuinely loved by all who knew her&mdash;too much loved, her companion
      thought, by certain spick-and-span young men of Brampton. But they ate the
      lunch Cynthia had brought, far from the crowd, under the trees by Coniston
      Water. It was she who proposed going to the base-ball game, and the
      painter stifled a sigh and acquiesced. Their way brought them down
      Brampton Street, past a house with great iron dogs on the lawn, so
      imposing and cityfied that he hung back and asked who lived there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, making to move on impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her escort did not think much of the house, but it interested him as the
      type which Mr. Worthington had built. On that same Gothic porch, sublimely
      unconscious of the covert stares and subdued comments of the passers-by,
      the first citizen himself and the Honorable Heth Sutton might be seen. Mr.
      Worthington, whose hawklike look had become more pronounced, sat upright,
      while the Honorable Heth, his legs crossed, filled every nook and cranny
      of an arm-chair, and an occasional fragrant whiff from his cigar floated
      out to those on the tar sidewalk. Although the pedestrians were but twenty
      feet away, what Mr. Worthington said never reached them; but the Honorable
      Heth on public days carried his voice of the Forum around with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said Cynthia, in one of those startling little tempers she was
      subject to; &ldquo;don't stand there like an idiot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the voice of Mr. Sutton boomed toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I understand, Worthington,&rdquo; they heard him say, &ldquo;you want me to
      appoint young Wheelock for the Brampton post-office.&rdquo; He stuck his thumb
      into his vest pocket and recrossed his legs &ldquo;I guess it can be arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the painter at last overtook Cynthia the jewel paints he had so often
      longed to catch upon a canvas were in her eyes. He fell back, wondering
      how he could so greatly have offended, when she put her hand on his
      sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear what he said about the Brampton postoffice?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Brampton post-office?&rdquo; he repeated; dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia; &ldquo;Uncle Jethro has promised it to Cousin Ephraim, who
      will starve without it. Did you hear this man say he would give it to Mr.
      Wheelock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was a new Cynthia, aflame with emotions on a question of politics of
      which he knew nothing. He did, understand, however, her concern for
      Ephraim Prescott, for he knew that she loved the soldier. She turned from
      the painter now with a gesture which he took to mean that his profession
      debarred him from such vital subjects, and she led the way to the
      fair-grounds. There he meekly bought tickets, and they found themselves
      hurried along in the eager crowd toward the stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was still unaccountably angry over that mysterious affair of the
      post-office, and sat with flushed cheeks staring out on the green field,
      past the line of buggies and carryalls on the farther side to the southern
      shoulder of Coniston towering, above them all. The painter, already,
      beginning to love his New England folk, listened to the homely chatter
      about him, until suddenly a cheer starting in one corner ran like a flash
      of gunpowder around the field, and eighteen young men trotted across the
      turf. Although he was not a devotee of sport, he noticed that nine of
      these, as they took their places on the bench, wore blue,&mdash;the
      Harwich Champions. Seven only of those scattering over the field wore
      white; two young gentlemen, one at second base and the other behind the
      batter, wore gray uniforms with crimson stockings, and crimson piping on
      the caps, and a crimson H embroidered on the breast&mdash;a sight that
      made the painter's heart beat a little faster, the honored livery of his
      own college.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are those two Harvard men doing here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, who was leaning forward, started, and turned to him a face which
      showed him that his question had been meaningless. He repeated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the tall one, burned brick-red like an Indian, is Bob
      Worthington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a good type,&rdquo; the artist remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Mister, there hain't a finer young feller anywhere,&rdquo; chimed
      in Mr. Dodd, a portly person with a tuft of yellow beard on his chin. Mr.
      Dodd kept the hardware store in Brampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who,&rdquo; asked the painter, &ldquo;is the bullet-headed little fellow, with
      freckles and short red hair, behind the bat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Cynthia, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Dodd, with just a trace of awe in his voice, &ldquo;that's
      Somers Duncan, son of Millionaire Duncan down to the capital. I guess,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;I guess them two will be the richest men in the state some day.
      Duncan come up from Harvard with Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the game was in full swing, Brampton against Harwich, the
      old rivalry in another form. Every advantage on either side awoke
      thundering cheers from the partisans; beribboned young women sprang to
      their feet and waved the Harwich blue at a home run, and were on the verge
      of tears when the Brampton pitcher struck out their best batsman. But
      beyond the facts that the tide was turning in Brampton's favor; that young
      Mr. Worthington stopped a ball flying at a phenomenal speed and batted
      another at a still more phenomenal speed which was not stopped; that his
      name and Duncan's were mingled generously in the cheering, the painter
      remembered little of the game. The exhibition of human passions which the
      sight of it drew from an undemonstrative race: the shouting, the comments
      wrung from hardy spirits off their guard, the joy and the sorrow,&mdash;such
      things interested him more. High above the turmoil Coniston, as through
      the ages, looked down upon the scene impassive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aroused from these reflections by an incident. Some one had leaped
      over the railing which separated the stand from the field and stood before
      Cynthia,&mdash;a tanned and smiling young man in gray and crimson. His
      honest eyes were alight with an admiration that was unmistakable to the
      painter&mdash;perhaps to Cynthia also, for a glow that might have been of
      annoyance or anger, and yet was like the color of the mountain sunrise,
      answered in her cheek. Mr. Worthington reached out a large brown hand and
      seized the girl's as it lay on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Cynthia,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I've been looking for you all day. I thought
      you might be here. Where were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you look?&rdquo; answered Cynthia, composedly, withdrawing her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everywhere,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;up and down the street, all through the hotel. I
      asked Lem Hallowell, and he didn't know where you were. I only got here
      last night myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in the meeting-house,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The meeting-house!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;You don't mean to tell me that you
      listened to that silly speech of Sutton's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This remark, delivered in all earnestness, was the signal for uproarious
      laughter from Mr. Dodd and others sitting near by, attending earnestly to
      the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia bit her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but I'm sorry now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you would be,&rdquo; said Bob; &ldquo;Sutton's a silly, pompous old
      fool. I had to sit through dinner with him. I believe I could represent
      the district better myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gosh!&rdquo; exploded Mr. Dodd, &ldquo;I believe you could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Bob paid no attention to him. He was looking at Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia, you've grown up since I saw you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How's Uncle Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's well&mdash;thanks,&rdquo; said Cynthia, and now she was striving to put
      down a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still running the state?&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;You tell him I think he ought to
      muzzle Sutton. What did he send him down to Washington for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do after the game?&rdquo; Bob demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going home of course,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you come to the house for supper and stay for the fireworks?&rdquo; he
      begged pleadingly. &ldquo;We'd be mighty glad to have your friend, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia introduced her escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very good of you, Bob,&rdquo; she said, with that New England demureness
      which at times became her so well, &ldquo;but we couldn't possibly do it. And
      then I don't like Mr. Sutton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang him!&rdquo; exclaimed Bob. He took a step nearer to her. &ldquo;Won't you
      stay this once? I have to go West in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are very lucky,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob scanned her face searchingly, and his own fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I think it's the worst thing that ever happened to me.
      My father's so hard-headed when he gets his mind set&mdash;he's making me
      do it. He wants me to see the railroads and the country, so I've got to go
      with the Duncans. I wanted to stay&mdash;&rdquo; He checked himself, &ldquo;I think
      it's a blamed nuisance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said a voice behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the first time that Mr. Somers Duncan had spoken, but Bob
      either had not heard him or pretended not to. Mr. Duncan's freckled face
      smiled at them from the top of the railing, his eyes were on Cynthia's
      face, and he had been listening eagerly. Mr. Duncan's chief
      characteristic, beyond his freckles, was his eagerness&mdash;a quality
      probably amounting to keenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; said Bob, turning impatiently, &ldquo;I might have known you couldn't
      keep away. You're the cause of all my troubles&mdash;you and your father's
      private car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somers became apologetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't my fault,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I'm sure I hate going as much as you do.
      It's spoiled my summer, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he coughed and looked at Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I suppose I'll have to introduce you. This,&rdquo; he added,
      dragging his friend over the railing, &ldquo;is Mr. Somers Duncan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully glad to meet you, Miss. Wetherell,&rdquo; said Somers, fervently;
      &ldquo;to tell you the truth, I thought he was just making up yarns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yarns?&rdquo; repeated Cynthia, with a look that set Mr. Duncan floundering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Worthy said that you were up here, but I
      thought he was crazy the way he talked&mdash;I didn't think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what?&rdquo; inquired Cynthia, but she flushed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rot, Somers!&rdquo; said Bob, blushing furiously under his tan; &ldquo;you ought
      never to go near a woman&mdash;you're the darndest fool with 'em I ever
      saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time even the painter laughed outright, and yet he was a little
      sorrowful, too, because he could not be even as these youths. But Cynthia
      sat serene, the eternal feminine of all the ages, and it is no wonder that
      Bob Worthington was baffled as he looked at her. He lapsed into an
      awkwardness quite as bad as that of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you enjoyed the game,&rdquo; he said at last, with a formality that was
      not at all characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia did not seem to think it worth while to answer this, so the
      painter tried to help him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a fine stop you made, Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;wasn't it,
      Cynthia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody seemed to think so,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, cruelly; &ldquo;but if I were
      a man and had hands like that&rdquo; (Bob thrust them in his pockets), &ldquo;I
      believe I could stop a ball, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somers laughed uproariously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said Bob, with uneasy abruptness, &ldquo;I've got to go into the
      field now. When can I see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you get back from the West&mdash;perhaps,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Bob (they were calling him), &ldquo;I must see you to-night!&rdquo; He
      vaulted over the railing and turned. &ldquo;I'll come back here right after the
      game,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there's only one more inning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll come back right after the game,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Duncan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob shot one look at him,&mdash;of which Mr. Duncan seemed blissfully
      unconscious,&mdash;and stalked off abruptly to second base.
    </p>
    <p>
      The artist sat pensive for a few moments, wondering at the ways of women,
      his sympathies unaccountably enlisted in behalf of Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren't you a little hard on him?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer Cynthia got to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we ought to be going home,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going home!&rdquo; he ejaculated in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised Uncle Jethro I'd be there for supper,&rdquo; and she led the way out
      of the grand stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they drove back to Coniston through the level evening light, and when
      they came to Ephraim Prescott's harness shop the old soldier waved at them
      cheerily from under the big flag which he had hung out in honor of the
      day. The flag was silk, and incidentally Ephraim's most valued possession.
      Then they drew up before the tannery house, and Cynthia leaped out of the
      buggy and held out her hand to the painter with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very good of you to take me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass, rugged, uncouth, in rawhide boots and swallowtail and
      coonskin cap, came down from the porch to welcome her, and she ran toward
      him with an eagerness that started the painter to wondering afresh over
      the contrasts of life. What, he asked himself, had Fate in store for
      Cynthia Wetherell?

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-have a good time, Cynthy?&rdquo; said Jethro, looking down into her face.
      Love had wrought changes in Jethro; mightier changes than he suspected,
      and the girl did not know how zealous were the sentries of that love, how
      watchful they were, and how they told him often and again whether her
      heart, too, was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very gay,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P-painter-man gay?&rdquo; inquired Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's eyes were on the orange line of the sunset over Coniston, but
      she laughed a little, indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;that Painter-man hain't such a bad fellow&mdash;w-why didn't you
      ask him in to supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give you three guesses,&rdquo; said Cynthia, but she did not wait for
      them. &ldquo;It was because I wanted to be alone with you. Milly's gone out,
      hasn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-gone a-courtin',&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and went into the house to see whether Milly had done her duty
      before she left. It was characteristic of Cynthia not to have mentioned
      the subject which was agitating her mind until they were seated on
      opposite sides of the basswood table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I thought you told Mr. Sutton to give Cousin
      Eph the Brampton post-office? Do you trust Mr. Sutton?&rdquo; she demanded
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;why?&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don't,&rdquo; she answered with conviction; &ldquo;I think he's a big
      fraud. He must have deceived you, Uncle Jethro. I can't see why you ever
      sent him to Congress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Although Jethro was in no mood for mirth, he laughed in spite of himself,
      for he was an American. His lifelong habit would have made him defend Heth
      to any one but Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'D you see Heth, Cynthy?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the girl, disgustedly,
      &ldquo;I should say I did, but not to speak to him. He was sitting on Mr.
      Worthington's porch, and I heard him tell Mr. Worthington he would give
      the Brampton post-office to Dave Wheelock. I don't want you to think that
      I was eavesdropping,&rdquo; she added quickly; &ldquo;I couldn't help hearing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll make him give the post-office to Cousin Eph, won't you, Uncle
      Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; said Jethro, very simply, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; He meditated awhile, and then
      said suddenly, &ldquo;W-won't speak about it&mdash;will you, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I won't,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it not be thought by any chance that Coniston was given over to
      revelry and late hours, even on the Fourth of July. By ten o'clock the
      lights were out in the tannery house, but Cynthia was not asleep. She sat
      at her window watching the shy moon peeping over Coniston ridge, and she
      was thinking, to be exact, of how much could happen in one short day and
      how little in a long month. She was aroused by the sound of wheels and the
      soft beat of a horse's hoofs on the dirt road: then came stifled laughter,
      and suddenly she sprang up alert and tingling. Her own name came floating
      to her through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing that happened will be long remembered in Coniston. A
      tentative chord or two from a guitar, and then the startled village was
      listening with all its might to the voices of two young men singing &ldquo;When
      I first went up to Harvard&rdquo;&mdash;probably meant to disclose the identity
      of the serenaders, as if that were necessary! Coniston, never having
      listened to grand opera, was entertained and thrilled, and thought the
      rendering of the song better on the whole than the church choir could have
      done it, or even the quartette that sung at the Brampton celebrations
      behind the flowers. Cynthia had her own views on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were five other songs&mdash;Cynthia remembers all of them, although
      she would not confess such a thing. &ldquo;Naughty, naughty Clara,&rdquo; was another
      one; the other three were almost wholly about love, some treating it
      flippantly, others seriously&mdash;this applied to the last one, which had
      many farewells in it. Then they went away, and the crickets and frogs on
      Coniston Water took up the refrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the occurrence was unusual,&mdash;it might almost be said
      epoch-making,&mdash;Jethro did not speak of it until they had reached the
      sparkling heights of Thousand Acre Hill the next morning. Even then he did
      not look at Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know who that was last night, Cynthy?&rdquo; he inquired, as though the matter
      were a casual one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Cynthia heroically, &ldquo;I believe it was a boy named Somers
      Duncan-and Bob Worthington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Bob Worthington,&rdquo; repeated Jethro, but said nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Coniston, and presently Brampton, knew that Bob Worthington had
      serenaded Cynthia&mdash;and Coniston and Brampton talked. It is noteworthy
      that (with the jocular exceptions of Ephraim and Lem Hallowell) they did
      not talk to the girl herself. The painter had long ago discovered that
      Cynthia was an individual. She had good blood in her: as a mere child she
      had shouldered the responsibility of her father; she had a natural
      aptitude for books&mdash;a quality reverenced in the community; she
      visited, as a matter of habit; the sick and the unfortunate; and lastly
      (perhaps the crowning achievement) she had bound Jethro Bass, of all men,
      with the fetters of love. Of course I have ended up by making her a
      paragon, although I am merely stating what people thought of her. Coniston
      decided at once that she was to marry the heir to the Brampton Mills.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the heir had gone West, and as the summer wore on, the gossip died
      down. Other and more absorbing gossip took its place: never distinctly
      formulated, but whispered; always wishing for more definite news that
      never came. The statesmen drove out from Brampton to the door of the
      tannery house, as usual, only it was remarked by astute observers and Jake
      Wheeler that certain statesmen did not come who had been in the habit of
      coming formerly. In short, those who made it a custom to observe such
      matters felt vaguely a disturbance of some kind. The organs of the people
      felt it, and became more guarded in their statements. What no one knew,
      except Jake and a few in high places, was that a war of no mean magnitude
      was impending.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three men in the State&mdash;and perhaps only three&mdash;who
      realized from the first that all former political combats would pale in
      comparison to this one to come. Similar wars had already started in other
      states, and when at length they were fought out another twist had been
      given to the tail of a long-suffering Constitution; political history in
      the United States had to be written from an entirely new and unforeseen
      standpoint, and the unsuspecting people had changed masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was to be a war of extermination of one side or the other. No quarter
      would be given or asked, and every weapon hitherto known to politics would
      be used. Of the three men who realized this, and all that would happen if
      one side or the other were victorious, one was Alexander Duncan, another
      Isaac D. Worthington, and the third was Jethro Bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro would never have been capable of being master of the state had he
      not foreseen the time when the railroads, tired of paying tribute, would
      turn and try to exterminate the boss. The really astonishing thing about
      Jethro's foresight (known to few only) was that he perceived clearly that
      the time would come when the railroads and other aggregations of capital
      would exterminate the boss, or at least subserviate him. This alone, the
      writer thinks, gives him some right to greatness. And Jethro Bass made up
      his mind that the victory of the railroads, in his state at least, should
      not come in his day. He would hold and keep what he had fought all his
      life to gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro knew, when Jake Wheeler failed to bring him a message back from
      Clovelly, that the war had begun, and that Isaac D. Worthington, commander
      of the railroad forces in the field, had captured his pawn, the
      hill-Rajah. By getting through to Harwich, the Truro had made a sad muddle
      in railroad affairs. It was now a connecting link; and its president, the
      first citizen of Brampton, a man of no small importance in the state. This
      fact was not lost upon Jethro, who perceived clearly enough the fight for
      consolidation that was coming in the next Legislature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated on an old haystack on Thousand Acre Hill, that sits in turn on the
      lap of Coniston, Jethro smiled as he reflected that the first trial of
      strength in this mighty struggle was to be over (what the unsuspecting
      world would deem a trivial matter) the postmastership of Brampton. And
      Worthington's first move in the game would be to attempt to capture for
      his faction the support of the Administration itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro thought the view from Thousand Acre Hill, especially in September,
      to be one of the sublimest efforts of the Creator. It was September, first
      of the purple months in Coniston, not the red-purple of the Maine coast,
      but the blue-purple of the mountain, the color of the bloom on the Concord
      grape. His eyes, sweeping the mountain from the notch to the granite ramp
      of the northern buttress, fell on the weather-beaten little farmhouse in
      which he had lived for many years, and rested lovingly on the orchard,
      where the golden early apples shone among the leaves. But Jethro was not
      looking at the apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy,&rdquo; he called out abruptly, &ldquo;h-how'd you like to go to Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washington!&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia. &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-now&mdash;to-morrow.&rdquo; Then he added uneasily, &ldquo;C-can't you get ready?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'll go to-night, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said admiringly, &ldquo;you hain't one of them clutterin' females. We
      can get some finery for you in New York, Cynthy. D-don't want any of them
      town ladies to put you to shame. Er&mdash;not that they would,&rdquo; he added
      hastily&mdash;&ldquo;not that they would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia climbed up beside him on the haystack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;when you make a senator or a judge, I
      don't interfere, do I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her uneasily, for there were moments when he could not for
      the life of him make out her drift.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; he assented, &ldquo;of course not, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it that I don't interfere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I callate,&rdquo; answered Jethro, still more uneasily, &ldquo;I callate it's because
      you're a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don't you think,&rdquo; asked Cynthia, &ldquo;that a woman ought to know what
      becomes her best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro reflected, and then his glance fell on her approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess you're right, Cynthy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I always had some success in
      dressin' up Listy, and that kind of set me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On such occasions he spoke of his wife quite simply. He had been genuinely
      fond of her, although she was no more than an episode in his life. Cynthia
      smiled to herself as they walked through the orchard to the place where
      the horse was tied, but she was a little remorseful. This feeling, on the
      drive homeward, was swept away by sheer elation at the prospect of the
      trip before her. She had often dreamed of the great world beyond Coniston,
      and no one, not even Jethro, had guessed the longings to see it which had
      at times beset her. Often she had dropped her book to summon up a picture
      of what a great city was like, to reconstruct the Boston of her early
      childhood. She remembered the Mall, where she used to walk with her
      father, and the row of houses where the rich dwelt, which had seemed like
      palaces. Indeed, when she read of palaces, these houses always came to her
      mind. And now she was to behold a palace even greater than these,&mdash;and
      the house where the President himself dwelt. But why was Jethro going to
      Washington?
    </p>
    <p>
      As if in answer to the question, he drove directly to the harness shop
      instead of to the tannery house. Ephraim greeted them from within with a
      cheery hail, and hobbled out and stood between the wheels of the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That bridle bust again?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Ephraim,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;how long since you b'en away from
      Coniston&mdash;how long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to Harwich with Moses before that bad spell I had in March,&rdquo; he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia smiled from pure happiness, for she began to see the drift of
      things now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how long since you've b'en in foreign parts?&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sixty-five,&rdquo; answered Ephraim, with astonishing promptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;like to go to Washington with us to-morrow like to go to
      Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim gasped, even as Cynthia had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washin'ton!&rdquo; he ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy and I was thinkin' of takin' a little trip,&rdquo; said Jethro, almost
      apologetically, &ldquo;and we kind of thought we'd like to have you with us.
      Didn't we, Cynthy? Er&mdash;we might see General Grant,&rdquo; he added
      meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim was a New Englander, and not an adept in expressing his emotions.
      Both Cynthia and Jethro felt that he would have liked to have said
      something appropriate if he had known how. What he actually said was:&mdash;&ldquo;What
      time to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-callate to take the nine o'clock from Brampton,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll report for duty at seven,&rdquo; said Ephraim, and it was then he squeezed
      the hand that he found in his. He watched them calmly enough until they
      had disappeared in the barn behind the tannery house, and then his
      thoughts became riotous. Rumors had been rife that summer, prophecies of
      changes to come, and the resignation of the old man who had so long been
      postmaster at Brampton was freely discussed&mdash;or rather the matter of
      his successor. As the months passed, Ephraim had heard David Wheelock
      mentioned with more and more assurance for the place. He had had many
      nights when sleep failed him, but it was characteristic of the old soldier
      that he had never once broached the subject since Jethro had spoken to him
      two months before. Ephraim had even looked up the law to see if he was
      eligible, and found that he was, since Coniston had no post-office, and
      was within the limits of delivery of the Brampton office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Coniston was treated to a genuine surprise. After loading
      up at the store, Lem Hallowell, instead of heading for Brampton, drove to
      the tannery house, left his horses standing as he ran in, and presently
      emerged with a little cowhide trunk that bore the letter W. Following the
      trunk came a radiant Cynthia, following Cynthia, Jethro Bass in a
      stove-pipe hat, with a carpetbag, and hobbling after Jethro, Ephraim
      Prescott, with another carpet-bag. It was remarked in the buzz of query
      that followed the stage's departure that Ephraim wore the blue suit and
      the army hat with a cord around it which he kept for occasions. Coniston
      longed to follow them, in spirit at least, but even Milly Skinner did not
      know their destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately we can follow them. At Brampton station they got into the
      little train that had just come over Truro Pass, and steamed, with many
      stops, down the valley of Coniston Water until it stretched out into a
      wide range of shimmering green meadows guarded by blue hills veiled in the
      morning haze. Then, bustling Harwich, and a wait of half an hour until the
      express from the north country came thundering through the Gap; then a
      five-hours' journey down the broad river that runs southward between the
      hills, dinner in a huge station amidst a pleasant buzz of excitement and
      the ringing of many bells. Then into another train, through valleys and
      factory towns and cities until they came, at nightfall, to the metropolis
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia will always remember the awe with which that first view of New
      York inspired her, and Ephraim confessed that he, too, had felt it, when
      he had first seen the myriad lights of the city after the long, dusty ride
      from the hills with his regiment. For all the flags and bunting it had
      held in '61, Ephraim thought that city crueller than war itself. And
      Cynthia thought so too, as she clung to Jethro's arm between the carriages
      and the clanging street-cars, and looked upon the riches and poverty
      around her. There entered her soul that night a sense of that which is the
      worst cruelty of all&mdash;the cruelty of selfishness. Every man going his
      own pace, seeking to gratify his own aims and desires, unconscious and
      heedless of the want with which he rubs elbows. Her natural imagination
      enhanced by her life among the hills, the girl peopled the place in the
      street lights with all kinds of strange evil-doers of whose sins she knew
      nothing, adventurers, charlatans, alert cormorants, who preyed upon the
      unwary. She shrank closer to Ephraim from a perfumed lady who sat next to
      her in the car, and was thankful when at last they found themselves in the
      corridor of the Astor House standing before the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotel clerks, especially city ones, are supernatural persons. This one
      knew Jethro, greeted him deferentially as Judge Bass, and dipped the pen
      in the ink and handed it to him that he might register. By half-past nine
      Cynthia was dreaming of Lem Hallowell and Coniston, and Lem was driving a
      yellow street-car full of queer people down the road to Brampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were few guests in the great dining room when they breakfasted at
      seven the next morning. New York, in the sunlight, had taken on a more
      kindly expression, and those who were near by smiled at them and seemed
      full of good-will. Persons smiled at them that day as they walked the
      streets or stood spellbound before the shop windows, and some who saw them
      felt a lump rise in their throats at the memories they aroused of
      forgotten days: the three seemed to bring the very air of the hills with
      them into that teeming place, and many who, had come to the city with high
      hopes, now in the shackles of drudgery; looked after them. They were a
      curious party, indeed: the straight, dark girl with the light in her eyes
      and the color in her cheeks; the quaint, rugged figure of the elderly man
      in his swallow-tail and brass buttons and square-toed, country boots; and
      the old soldier hobbling along with the aid of his green umbrella, clad in
      the blue he had loved and suffered for. Had they remained until Sunday,
      they might have read an amusing account of their visit,&mdash;of Jethro's
      suppers of crackers and milk at the Astor House, of their progress along
      Broadway. The story was not lacking in pathos, either, and in real human
      feeling, for the young reporter who wrote it had come, not many years
      before, from the hills himself. But by that time they had accomplished
      another marvellous span in their journey, and were come to Washington
      itself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cynthia was deprived, too, of that thrilling first view of the capital
      from the train which she had pictured, for night had fallen when they
      reached Washington likewise. As the train slowed down, she leaned a little
      out of the window and looked at the shabby houses and shabby streets
      revealed by the flickering lights in the lamp-posts. Finally they came to
      a shabby station, were seized upon by a grinning darky hackman, who would
      not take no for an answer, and were rattled away to the hotel. Although he
      had been to Washington but once in his life before, as a Lincoln elector,
      Jethro was greeted as an old acquaintance by this clerk also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you, Judge,&rdquo; said he, genially. &ldquo;Train late? You've come
      purty nigh, missin' supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A familiar of great men, the clerk was not offended when he got no
      response to his welcome. Cynthia and Ephraim, intent on getting rid of
      some of the dust of their journey, followed the colored hallboy up the
      stairs. Jethro stood poring over the register, when a
      distinguished-looking elderly gentleman with a heavy gray beard and eyes
      full of shrewdness and humor paused at the desk to ask a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Senator?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The senator (for such he was, although he did not represent Jethro's
      state) turned and stared, and then held out his hand with unmistakable
      warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;upon my word! What are you doing in
      Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro took the hand, but he did not answer the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Senator&mdash;when can I see the President?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered the senator, somewhat taken aback, &ldquo;why, to-night, if you
      like. I'm going to the White House in a few minutes and I think I can
      arrange it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-to-morrow afternoon&mdash;t-to-morrow afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The senator cast his eye over the swallow-tail coat and stove-pipe hat
      tilted back, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thunder!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you haven't changed a bit. I'm beginning to look
      like an old man; but that milk-and-crackers diet seems to keep you young,
      Jethro. I'll fix it for to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what time&mdash;two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll fix it for two to-morrow afternoon. I never could understand
      you, Jethro; you don't do things like other men. Do I smell gunpowder?
      What's up now&mdash;what do you want to see Grant about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro cast his eye around the corridor, where a few men were taking their
      ease after supper, and looked at the senator mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any place where we can talk?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can go into the writing room and shut the door,&rdquo; answered the senator,
      more amused than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cynthia came downstairs, Jethro was standing with the gentleman in
      the corridor leading to the dining room, and she heard the gentleman say
      as he took his departure:&mdash;&ldquo;I haven't forgotten what you did for us
      in '70, Jethro. I'll go right along and see to it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia liked the gentleman's looks, and rightly surmised that he was one
      of the big men of the nation. She was about to ask Jethro his name when
      Ephraim came limping along and put the matter out of her mind, and the
      three went into the almost empty dining room. There they were served with
      elaborate attention by a darky waiter who had, in some mysterious way,
      learned Jethro's name and title. Cynthia reflected with pride that Jethro,
      too, was one of the nation's great men, who could get anything he wanted
      simply by coming to the capital and asking for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim was very much excited on finding himself in Washington, the sight
      of the place reviving in his mind a score of forgotten incidents of the
      war. After supper they found seats in a corner of the corridor, where a
      number of people were scattered about, smoking and talking. It did not
      occur to Jethro or Cynthia, or even to Ephraim, that these people were all
      of the male sex, and on the other hand the guests of the hotel were
      apparently used once in a while to see a lady from the country seated
      there. At any rate, Cynthia was but a young girl, and her two companions,
      however unusual their appearance, were clearly most respectable. Jethro,
      his hands in his pockets and his hat tilted, sat on the small of his back
      rapt in meditation; Cynthia, her head awhirl, looked around her with
      sparkling eyes; while Ephraim was smoking a cigar he had saved for just
      such a festal occasion. He did not see the stout man with the button and
      corded hat until he was almost on top of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eph Prescott, I believe!&rdquo; exclaimed the stout one. &ldquo;How be you, Comrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heedless of his rheumatism, Ephraim sprang to his feet and dropped the
      cigar, which the stout one picked up with much difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ephraim, in a voice that shook with unwonted emotion, &ldquo;you
      kin skin me if it ain't Amasy Beard!&rdquo; His eye travelled around Amasa's
      figure. &ldquo;Wouldn't a-knowed you, I swan, I wouldn't. Why, when I seen you
      last, Amasy, your stomach was havin' all it could do to git hold of your
      backbone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia laughed outright, and even Jethro sat up and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When was it?&rdquo; said Amasa, still clinging on to Ephraim's hand and
      incidentally to the cigar, which Ephraim had forgotten; &ldquo;Beaver Creek,
      wahn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;July 10, 1863,&rdquo; said Ephraim, instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually they reached a sitting position, the cigar was restored to its
      rightful owner, and Mr. Beard was introduced, with some ceremony, to
      Cynthia and Jethro. From Beaver Creek they began to fight the war over
      again, backward and forward, much to Cynthia's edification, when her
      attention was distracted by the entrance of a street band of wind
      instruments. As the musicians made their way to another corner and began
      tuning up, she glanced mischievously at Jethro, for she knew his
      peculiarities by heart. One of these was a most violent detestation of any
      but the best music. He had often given her this excuse, laughingly, for
      not going to meeting in Coniston. How he had come by his love for good
      music, Cynthia never knew&mdash;he certainly had not heard much of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a great volume of sound filled the corridor, and the band burst
      forth into what many supposed to be &ldquo;The Watch on the Rhine.&rdquo; Some people
      were plainly delighted; the veterans, once recovered from their surprise,
      shouted their reminiscences above the music, undismayed; Jethro held on to
      himself until the refrain, when he began to squirm, and as soon as the
      tune was done and the scattering applause had died down, he reached over
      and grabbed Mr. Amasa Beard by the knee. Mr. Beard did not immediately
      respond, being at that moment behind logworks facing a rebel charge; he
      felt vaguely that some one was trying to distract his attention, and in
      some lobe of his brain was registered the fact that that particular knee
      had gout in it. Jethro increased the pressure, and then Mr. Beard
      abandoned his logworks and swung around with a snort of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how much do they git for that noise&mdash;h-how much do they git?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beard tenderly lifted the hand from his knee and stared at Jethro with
      his mouth open, like a man aroused from a bad dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? What noise?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Dutchmen,&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;H-how much do they git for that noise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Mr. Beard glanced at the band and began to laugh. He thought Jethro
      a queer customer, no doubt, but he was a friend of Comrade Prescott's. &ldquo;By
      gum!&rdquo; said Mr. Beard, &ldquo;I thought for a minute a rebel chain-shot had took
      my leg off. Well, sir, I guess that band gets about two dollars. They've
      come in here every evening since I've been at the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-two dollars? Is that the price? Er&mdash;you say two dollars is their
      price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thereabouts,&rdquo; answered Mr. Beard, uneasily. Veteran as he was, Jethro's
      appearance and earnestness were a little alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say two dollars is their price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thereabouts,&rdquo; shouted Mr. Beard, seating himself on the edge of his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jethro paid no attention to him. He rose, unfolding by degrees his six
      feet two, and strode diagonally across the corridor toward the band
      leader. Conversation was hushed at the sight of his figure, a titter ran
      around the walls, but Jethro was oblivious to these things. He drew a
      great calfskin wallet from an inside pocket of his coat, and the band
      leader, a florid German, laid down his instrument and made an elaborate
      bow. Jethro waited until the man had become upright and then held out a
      two-dollar bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that about right for the performance?&rdquo; he said &ldquo;is that about right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ja, mein Herr,&rdquo; said the man, nodding vociferously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to pay what's right&mdash;I want to pay what's right,&rdquo; said
      Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you very much, sir,&rdquo; said the leader, finding his English, &ldquo;you
      haf pay for all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P-paid for everything&mdash;everything to-night?&rdquo; demanded Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      The leader spread out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haf pay for one whole evening,&rdquo; said he, and bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take it, take it,&rdquo; said Jethro, pushing the bill into the man's
      palm; &ldquo;but don't you come back to-night&mdash;don't you come back
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The amazed leader stared at Jethro&mdash;and words failed him. There was
      something about this man that compelled him to obey, and he gathered up
      his followers and led the way silently out of the hotel. Roars of laughter
      and applause arose on all sides; but Jethro was as one who heard them not
      as he made his way back to his seat again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did a good job, my friend,&rdquo; said Mr. Beard, approvingly. &ldquo;I'm going
      to take Eph Prescott down the street to see some of the boys. Won't you
      come, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Beard doubtless accepted it as one of the man's eccentricities that
      Jethro did not respond to him, for without more ado he departed arm in arm
      with Ephraim. Jethro was looking at Cynthia, who was staring toward the
      desk at the other end of the corridor, her face flushed, and her fingers
      closed over the arms of her chair. It never occurred to Jethro that she
      might have been embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what's the matter, Cynthy?&rdquo; he asked, sinking into the chair beside
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her breath caught sharply, but she tried to smile at him. He did not
      discover what was the matter until long afterward, when he recalled that
      evening to mind. Jethro was a man used to hotel corridors, used to sitting
      in an attitude that led the unsuspecting to believe he was half asleep;
      but no person of note could come or go whom he did not remember. He had
      seen the distinguished party arrive at the desk, preceded by a host of
      bell-boys with shawls and luggage. On the other hand, some of the
      distinguished party had watched the proceeding of paying off the band with
      no little amusement. Miss Janet Duncan had giggled audibly, her mother had
      smiled, while her father and Mr. Worthington had pretended to be deeply
      occupied with the hotel register. Somers was not there. Bob Worthington
      laughed heartily with the rest until his eye, travelling down the line of
      Jethro's progress, fell on Cynthia, and now he was striding across the
      floor toward them. And even in the horrible confusion of that moment
      Cynthia had a vagrant thought that his clothes had an enviable cut and
      became him remarkably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all things, to find you here!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;this is the best luck
      that ever happened. I am glad to see you. I was going to steal away to
      Brampton for a couple of days before the term opened, and I meant to look
      you up there. And Mr. Bass,&rdquo; said Bob, turning to Jethro, &ldquo;I'm glad to see
      you too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro looked at the young man and smiled and held out his hand. It was
      evident that Bob was blissfully unaware that hostilities between powers of
      no mean magnitude were about to begin; that the generals themselves were
      on the ground, and that he was holding treasonable parley with the enemy.
      The situation appealed to Jethro, especially as he glanced at the backs of
      the two gentlemen facing the desk. These backs seemed to him full of
      expression. &ldquo;Th-thank you, Bob, th-thank you,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the way you fixed that band,&rdquo; said Bob; &ldquo;I haven't laughed as much
      for a year. You hate music, don't you? I hope you'll forgive that awful
      noise we made outside of your house last July, Mr. Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you make that noise, Bob, you&mdash;you make that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I'm afraid I did most of it. There was another fellow
      that helped some and played the guitar. It was pretty bad,&rdquo; he added, with
      a side glance at Cynthia, &ldquo;but it was meant for a compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it was meant for a compliment, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he answered, glad of the opportunity to turn his attention
      entirely to her. &ldquo;I was for slipping away right after supper, but my
      father headed us off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slipping away?&rdquo; repeated Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, he had a kind of a reception and fireworks afterward. We didn't
      get away till after nine, and then I thought I'd have a lecture when I got
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;he didn't know where I'd been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia felt the blood rush to her temples, but by habit and instinct she
      knew when to restrain herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it have made any difference to him where you had been?&rdquo; she asked
      calmly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob had a presentiment that he was on dangerous ground. This new and
      self-possessed Cynthia was an enigma to him&mdash;certainly a fascinating
      enigma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father world have thought I was a fool to go off serenading,&rdquo; he
      answered, flushing. Bob did not like a lie; he knew that his father would
      have been angry if he had heard he had gone to Coniston; he felt, in the
      small of his back, that his father was angry mow, and guessed the reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him gravely as he spoke, and then her eyes left his face and
      became fixed upon an object at the far end of the corridor. Bob turned in
      time to see Janet Duncan swing on her heel and follow her mother up the
      stairs. He struggled to find words to tide over what he felt was an
      awkward moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've had a fine trip;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;though I should much rather have stayed
      at home. The West is a wonderful country, with its canons and mountains
      and great stretches of plain. My father met us in Chicago, and we came
      here. I don't know why, because Washington's dead at this time of the
      year. I suppose it must be on account of politics.&rdquo; Looking at Jethro with
      a sudden inspiration, &ldquo;I hadn't thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro had betrayed no interest in the conversation. He was seated, as
      usual, on the small of his back. But he saw a young man of short stature,
      with a freckled face and close-cropped, curly red hair, come into the
      corridor by another entrance; he saw Isaac D. Worthington draw him aside
      and speak to him, and he saw the young man coming towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Miss Wetherell?&rdquo; cried the young man joyously, while still
      ten feet away, &ldquo;I'm awfully glad to see you, upon my word; I am. How long
      are you going to be in Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Mr. Duncan,&rdquo; answered Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Worthy know you were here?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Duncan, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did when he saw me,&rdquo; said Cynthia, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till then?&rdquo; asked Mr. Duncan. &ldquo;Say, Worthy; your father wants to see
      you right away. I'm going to be in Washington a day or two&mdash;will you
      go walking with me to-morrow morning, Miss Wetherell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's going walking with me,&rdquo; said Bob, not in the best of tempers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll go along,&rdquo; said Mr. Duncan, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Cynthia got up and was holding out her hand to Bob
      Worthington. &ldquo;I'm not going walking with either of you,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;I have
      another engagement. And I think I'll have to say good night, because I'm
      very tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When can I see you?&rdquo; Both the young men asked the question at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you'll have plenty of chances,&rdquo; she answered, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men looked at each other somewhat blankly; and then down at
      Jethro, who did not seem to know that they were there, and then they made
      their way toward the desk. But Isaac D. Worthington and his friends had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later the distinguished-looking senator with whom Jethro had
      been in conversation before supper entered the hotel. He seemed
      preoccupied, and heedless of the salutations he received; but when he
      caught sight of Jethro he crossed the corridor rapidly and sat down beside
      him. Jethro did not move. The corridor was deserted now, save for the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bass,&rdquo; began the senator, &ldquo;what's the row up in your state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-haven't heard of any row,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you come to Washington for?&rdquo; demanded the senator, somewhat
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;vacation,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;vacation&mdash;to show my gal, Cynthy,
      the capital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now see here, Bass,&rdquo; said the senator, &ldquo;I don't forget what happened in
      '70. I don't object to wading through a swarm of bees to get a little
      honey for a friend, but I think I'm entitled to know why he wants it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-got the honey?&rdquo; asked Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      The senator took off his hat and wiped his brow, and then he stole a look
      at Jethro, with apparently barren results.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;people say you run that state of yours right up to the
      handle. What's all this trouble about a two-for-a-cent postmastership?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-haven't heard of any trouble,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is trouble,&rdquo; said the senator, losing patience at last. &ldquo;When
      I told Grant you were here and mentioned that little Brampton matter to
      him,&mdash;it didn't seem much to me,&mdash;the bees began to fly pretty
      thick, I can tell you. I saw right away that somebody had been stirring
      'em up. It looks to me, Jethro,&rdquo; said the senator gravely, &ldquo;it looks to me
      as if you had something of a rebellion on your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what'd Grant say?&rdquo; Jethro inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he didn't say a great deal&mdash;he isn't much of a talker, you
      know, but what he did say was to the point. It seems that your man,
      Prescott, doesn't come from Brampton, in the first place, and Grant says
      that while he likes soldiers, he hasn't any use for the kind that want to
      lie down and make the government support 'em. I'll tell you what I found
      out. Worthington and Duncan wired the President this morning, and they've
      gone up to the White House now. They've got a lot of railroad interests
      back of them, and they've taken your friend Sutton into camp; but I
      managed to get the President to promise not to do anything until he saw
      you tomorrow afternoon at two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro sat silent so long that the senator began to think he wasn't going
      to answer him at all. In his opinion, he had told Jethro some very grave
      facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-when are you going to see the President again?&rdquo; said Jethro, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning,&rdquo; answered the senator; &ldquo;he wants me to walk over with
      him to see the postmaster-general, who is sick in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time do you leave the White House?&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At eleven,&rdquo; said the senator, very much puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Grant ever pay any attention to an old soldier on the street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The senator glanced at Jethro, and a twinkle came into his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes he has been known to,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you ever pay any attention to an old soldier on the street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the senator's eyes began to snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I have been known to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;suppose an old soldier was in front of the White House at eleven
      o'clock&mdash;an old soldier with a gal suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The senator saw the point, and took no pains to restrain his admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro,&rdquo; he said, slapping him on the shoulder, &ldquo;I'm willing to bet a few
      thousand dollars you'll run your state for a while yet.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard you say you was goin' for a walk this morning, Cynthy,&rdquo; Jethro
      remarked, as they sat at breakfast the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, &ldquo;Cousin Eph and I are going out to see
      Washington, and he is to show me the places that he remembers.&rdquo; She looked
      at Jethro appealingly. &ldquo;Aren't you coming with us?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-meet you at eleven, Cynthy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleven!&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia in dismay, &ldquo;that's almost dinner-time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-meet you in front of the White House at eleven,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;plumb in
      front of it, under a tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By half-past seven, Cynthia and Ephraim with his green umbrella were in
      the street, but it would be useless to burden these pages with a
      description of all the sights they saw, and with the things that Ephraim
      said about them, and incidentally about the war. After New York, much of
      Washington would then have seemed small and ragged to any one who lacked
      ideals and a national sense, but Washington was to Cynthia as Athens to a
      Greek. To her the marble Capitol shining on its hill was a sacred temple,
      and the great shaft that struck upward through the sunlight, though yet
      unfinished, a fitting memorial to him who had led the barefoot soldiers of
      the colonies through ridicule to victory. They looked up many institutions
      and monument, they even had time to go to the Navy Yard, and they saved
      the contemplation of the White House till the last. The White House, which
      Cynthia thought the finest and most graceful mansion in all the world, in
      its simplicity and dignity, a fitting dwelling for the chosen of the
      nation. Under the little tree which Jethro had mentioned, Ephraim stood
      bareheaded before the walls which had sheltered Lincoln, which were now
      the home of the greatest of his captains, Grant: and wondrous emotions
      played upon the girl's spirit, too, as she gazed. They forgot the present
      in the past and the future, and they did not see the two gentlemen who had
      left the portico some minutes before and were now coming toward them along
      the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen, however, slowed their steps involuntarily at a sight
      which was uncommon, even in Washington. The girl's arm was in the
      soldier's, and her face, which even in repose had a true nobility, now was
      alight with an inspiration that is seen but seldom in a lifetime. In
      marble, could it have been wrought by a great sculptor, men would have
      dreamed before it of high things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two, indeed, might have stood for a group, the girl as the spirit, the
      man as the body which had risked and suffered all for it, and still held
      it fast. For the honest face of the soldier reflected that spirit as truly
      as a mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim was aroused from his thoughts by Cynthia nudging his arm. He
      started, put on his hat, and stared very hard at a man smoking a cigar who
      was standing before him. Then he stiffened and raised his hand in an
      involuntary salute. The man smiled. He was not very tall, he had a closely
      trimmed light beard that was growing a little gray, he wore a soft hat
      something like Ephraim's, a black tie on a white pleated shirt, and his
      eyeglasses were pinned to his vest. His eyes were all kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Comrade?&rdquo; he said, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General,&rdquo; said Ephraim, &ldquo;Mr. President,&rdquo; he added, correcting himself,
      &ldquo;how be you?&rdquo; He shifted the green umbrella, and shook the hand timidly
      but warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General will do,&rdquo; said the President, with a smiling glance at the tall
      senator beside him, &ldquo;I like to be called General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've growed some older, General,&rdquo; said Ephraim, scanning his face with
      a simple reverence and affection, &ldquo;but you hain't changed so much as I'd a
      thought since I saw you whittlin' under a tree beside the Lacy house in
      the Wilderness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My duty has changed some,&rdquo; answered the President, quite as simply. He
      added with a touch of sadness, &ldquo;I liked those days best, Comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess!&rdquo; exclaimed Ephraim, &ldquo;you're general over everything now,
      but you're not a mite bigger man to me than you was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President took the compliment as it was meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found it easier to run an army than I do to run a country,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim's blue eyes flamed with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't take no stock in the bull-dogs and the gold harness at Long
      Branch and&mdash;and all them lies the dratted newspapers print about
      you,&rdquo;&mdash;Ephraim hammered his umbrella on the pavement as an expression
      of his feelings,&mdash;&ldquo;and what's more, the people don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President glanced at the senator again, and laughed a little, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you; Comrade,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a plain, common man,&rdquo; continued Ephraim, paying the highest
      compliment known to rural New England; &ldquo;the people think a sight of you,
      or they wouldn't hev chose you twice, General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you were in the Wilderness?&rdquo; said the President, adroitly changing the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, General. I was pressed into orderly duty the first day&mdash;that's
      when I saw you whittlin' under the tree, and you didn't seem to have no
      more consarn than if it had been a company drill. Had a cigar then, too.
      But the second day; May the 6th, I was with the regiment. I'll never
      forget that day,&rdquo; said Ephraim, warming to the subject, &ldquo;when we was
      fightin' Ewell up and down the Orange Plank Road, playin' hide-and-seek
      with the Johnnies in the woods. You remember them woods, General?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President nodded, his cigar between his teeth. He looked as though the
      scene were coming back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never seen such woods,&rdquo; said Ephraim, &ldquo;scrub oak and pine and cedars and
      young stuff springin' up until you couldn't see the length of a company,
      and the Rebs jumpin' and hollerin' around and shoutin' every which way.
      After a while a lot of them saplings was mowed off clean by the bullets,
      and then the woods caught afire, and that was hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you wounded?&rdquo; asked the President, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hurt some, in the hip,&rdquo; answered Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some!&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia, &ldquo;why, you have walked lame ever since.&rdquo; She
      knew the story by heart, but the recital of it never failed to stir her
      blood! &ldquo;They carried him out just as he was going to be burned up, in a
      blanket hung from rifles, and he was in the hospital nine months, and had
      to come home for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy,&rdquo; said Ephraim in gentle reproof, &ldquo;I callate the General don't
      want to hear that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia flushed, but the President looked at her with an added interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that seems to me the vital part of the
      story. If I remember rightly,&rdquo; he added, turning again to Ephraim, &ldquo;the
      Fifth Corps was on the Orange turnpike. What brigade were you in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The third brigade of the First Division,&rdquo; answered Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Griffin's,&rdquo; said the President. &ldquo;There were several splendid New England
      regiments in that brigade. I sent them with Griffin to help Sheridan at
      Five Forks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thar too,&rdquo; cried Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;with the lame hip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, General, I went back, I couldn't help it. I couldn't stay away from
      the boys&mdash;just couldn't. I didn't limp as bad then as I do now. I
      wahn't much use anywhere else, and I had l'arned to fight. Five Forks!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Ephraim. &ldquo;I call that day to mind as if it was yesterday. I
      remember how the boys yelled when they told us we was goin' to Sheridan.
      We got started about daylight, and it took us till four o'clock in the
      afternoon to git into position. The woods was just comin' a little green,
      and the white dogwoods was bloomin' around. Sheridan, he galloped up to
      the line with that black horse of his'n and hollered out, 'Come on, boys,
      go in at a clean, jump or You won't ketch one of 'em.' You know how men,
      even veterans like that Fifth Corps, sometimes hev to be pushed into a
      fight. There was a man from a Maine regiment got shot in the head fust
      thing. 'I'm killed,' said he. 'Oh, no, you're not,' says Sheridan, 'pickup
      your gun and go for 'em.' But he was killed. Well, we went for 'em through
      all the swamps and briers and everything, and Sheridan, thar in front, had
      got the battle-flag and was rushin' round with it swearin' and prayin' and
      shoutin', and the first thing we knowed he'd jumped his horse clean over
      their logworks and landed right on top of the Johnnie's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;that was Sheridan, sure enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. President,&rdquo; said the senator, who stood by wonderingly while General
      Grant had lost himself in this conversation, &ldquo;do you realize what time it
      is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;we must go on. What was your rank,
      Comrade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant, General.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you have got a good pension for that hip,&rdquo; said the President,
      kindly. It may be well to add that he was not always so incautious, but
      this soldier bore the unmistakable stamp of simplicity and sincerity on
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never would ask for a pension, General,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the President in real astonishment, &ldquo;are you so rich as
      all that?&rdquo; and he glanced at the green umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, General,&rdquo; said Ephraim, uncomfortably, &ldquo;I never liked the notion of
      gittin' paid for it. You see, I was what they call a war-Democrat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said the President, but more to himself. &ldquo;What do you do
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I callate to make harness,&rdquo; answered Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only he can't make it any more on account of his rheumatism, Mr.
      President,&rdquo; Cynthia put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you might call me General, too,&rdquo; he said, with the grace that
      many simple people found inherent in him. &ldquo;And may I ask your name, young
      lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia Wetherell&mdash;General,&rdquo; she said smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds more natural,&rdquo; said the President, and then to Ephraim, &ldquo;Your
      daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't think more of her if she was,&rdquo; answered Ephraim; &ldquo;Cynthy's
      pulled me through some tight spells. Her mother was my cousin, General. My
      name's Prescott&mdash;Ephraim Prescott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim Prescott!&rdquo; ejaculated the President, sharply, taking his cigar
      from his mouth, &ldquo;Ephraim Prescott!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prescott&mdash;that's right&mdash;Prescott, General,&rdquo; repeated Ephraim,
      sorely puzzled by these manifestations of amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you come to Washington for?&rdquo; asked the President.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, General, I kind of hate to tell you&mdash;I didn't intend to
      mention that. I guess I won't say nothin' about it,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;we've had
      such a sociable time. I've always b'en a little mite ashamed of it,
      General, ever since 'twas first mentioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said the President again, and then he looked at Cynthia.
      &ldquo;What is it, Miss Cynthia?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now Cynthia's turn to be a little confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro&mdash;that is, Mr. Bass&rdquo; (the President nodded), &ldquo;went to
      Cousin Eph when he couldn't make harness any more and said he'd give him
      the Brampton post-office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President's eyes met the senator's, and both gentlemen laughed.
      Cynthia bit her lip, not seeing any cause for mirth in her remark, while
      Ephraim looked uncomfortable and mopped the perspiration from his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he'd give it to him, did he?&rdquo; said the President. &ldquo;Is Mr. Bass
      your uncle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, General,&rdquo; replied Cynthia, &ldquo;he's really no relation. He's done
      everything for me, and I live with him since my father died. He was going
      to meet us here,&rdquo; she continued, looking around hurriedly, &ldquo;I'm sure I
      can't think what's kept him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. President, we are half an hour late already,&rdquo; said the senator,
      hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;I suppose I must go. Good-by, Miss
      Cynthia,&rdquo; said he, taking the girl's hand warmly. &ldquo;Good-by, Comrade. If
      ever you want to see General Grant, just send in your name. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President lifted his hat politely to Cynthia and passed. He said
      something to the senator which they did not hear, and the senator laughed
      heartily. Ephraim and Cynthia watched them until they were out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfrey!&rdquo; exclaimed Ephraim, &ldquo;they told me he was hard to talk to. Why,
      Cynthy, he's as simple as a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've always thought that all great men must be simple,&rdquo; said Cynthia;
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that the President of the United States stood talkin' to us on
      the sidewalk for half an hour,&rdquo; said Ephraim, clutching Cynthia's arm.
      &ldquo;Cynthy, I'm glad we didn't press that post-office matter it was worth
      more to me than all the post-offices in the Union to have that talk with
      General Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They waited some time longer under the tree, happy in the afterglow of
      this wonderful experience. Presently a clock struck twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's dinner-time, Cynthy,&rdquo; said Ephraim. &ldquo;I guess Jethro haint'
      a-comin'&mdash;must hev b'en delayed by some of them politicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the first time I ever knew him to miss an appointment,&rdquo; said
      Cynthia, as they walked back to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro was not in the corridor, so they passed on to the dining room and
      looked eagerly from group to group. Jethro was not there, either, but
      Cynthia heard some one laughing above the chatter of the guests, and drew
      back into the corridor. She had spied the Duncans and the Worthingtons
      making merry by themselves at a corner table, and it was Somers's laugh
      that she heard. Bob, too, sitting next to Miss Duncan, was much amused
      about something. Suddenly Cynthia's exaltation over the incident of the
      morning seemed to leave her, and Bob Worthington's words which she had
      pondered over in the night came back to her with renewed force. He did not
      find it necessary to steal away to see Miss Duncan. Why should he have
      &ldquo;stolen away&rdquo; to see her? Was it because she was a country girl, and poor?
      That was true; but on the other hand, did she not live in the sunlight, as
      it were, of Uncle Jethro's greatness, and was it not an honor to come to
      his house and see any one? And why had Mr. Worthington turned hid back on
      Jethro, and sent for Bob when he was talking to them? Cynthia could not
      understand these things, and her pride was sorely wounded by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Jethro's in his room,&rdquo; suggested Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      And indeed they found him there seated on the bed, poring over some
      newspapers, and both in a breath demanded where he had been. Ephraim did
      not wait for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We seen General Grant, Jethro,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;while we was waitin' for you
      under the tree he come up and stood talkin' to us half an hour. Full half
      an hour, wahn't it, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, forgetting her own grievance at the
      recollection; &ldquo;only it didn't seem nearly that long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-want to know!&rdquo; exclaimed Jethro, in astonishment, putting down his
      paper. &ldquo;H-how did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right up and spoke to us,&rdquo; said Ephraim, in a tone he might have
      used to describe a miracle, &ldquo;jest as if he was common folk. Never had a
      more sociable talk with anybody. Why, there was times when I clean forgot
      he was President of the United States. The boys won't believe it when we
      git back at Coniston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ephraim, full of his subject, began to recount from the beginning the
      marvellous affair, occasionally appealing to Cynthia for confirmation. How
      he had lived over again the Wilderness and Five Forks; how the General had
      changed since he had seen him whittling under a tree; how the General had
      asked about his pension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-didn't mention the post-office, did you, Ephraim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; replied Ephraim, &ldquo;I didn't like to exactly. You see, we was
      havin' such a good time I didn't want to spoil it, but Cynthy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told the President about it, Uncle Jethro; I told him how sick Cousin
      Eph had been, and that you were going to give him the postmastership
      because he couldn't work any more with his hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The training of a lifetime had schooled Jethro not to betray surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;K-kind of mixin' up in politics, hain't you, Cynthy? P-President say he'd
      give you the postmastership, Eph?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't say nothin' about it, Jethro,&rdquo; answered Ephraim slowly; &ldquo;I
      callate he has other views for the place, and he was too kind to come
      right out with 'em and spoil our mornin'. You see, Jethro, I wahn't only a
      sergeant, and Brampton's gittin' to be a big town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, surely,&rdquo; cried Cynthia, who could scarcely wait for him to finish,
      &ldquo;surely you're going to give Cousin Eph the post-office, aren't you, Uncle
      Jethro? All you have to do is to tell the President that you want it for
      him. Why, I had an idea that we came down for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Cynthy,&rdquo; Ephraim put in, deprecatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else would get the post-office?&rdquo; asked Cynthia. &ldquo;Surely you're not
      going to let Mr. Sutton have it for Dave Wheelock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Cynthy,&rdquo; said Jethro, slyly, &ldquo;w-what'd you say to me once about
      interferin' with women's fixin's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia saw the point. She perceived also that the mazes of politics were
      not to be understood by a young woman, of even by an old soldier. She
      laughed and seized Jethro's hands and pulled him from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't get any dinner unless we hurry,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the dining room she was relieved to discover that the
      party in the corner had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon there were many more sights to be viewed, but they were
      back in the hotel again by half-past four, because Ephraim's Wilderness
      leg had its limits of endurance. Jethro (though he had not mentioned the
      fact to them) had gone to the White House.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the slack hours that our friend the senator, whose interest
      in the matter of the Brampton post office out-weighed for the present
      certain grave problems of the Administration in which he was involved,
      hurried into the Willard Hotel, looking for Jethro Bass. He found him
      without much trouble in his usual attitude, occupying one of the chairs in
      the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed the senator, with a touch of eagerness he did not often
      betray, &ldquo;did you see Grant? How about your old soldier? He's one of the
      most delightful characters I ever met&mdash;simple as a child,&rdquo; and he
      laughed at the recollection. &ldquo;That was a masterstroke of yours, Bass,
      putting him under that tree with that pretty girl. I doubt if you ever did
      anything better in your life. Did they tell you about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;they told me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about Grant? What did he say to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-well, I went up there and sent in my card. D-didn't have to wait a
      great while, as I was pretty early, and soon he came in, smokin' a black
      cigar, head bent forward a little. D-didn't ask me to sit down, and what
      talkin' we did we did standin'. D-didn't ask me what he could do for me,
      what I wanted, or anything else, but just stood there, and I stood there.
      F-fust time in my life I didn't know how to commerce or what to say;
      looked&mdash;looked at me&mdash;didn't take his eye off me. After a while
      I got started, somehow; told him I was there to ask him to appoint Ephraim
      Prescott to the Brampton postoffice&mdash;t-told him all about Ephraim
      from the time he was locked in the cradle&mdash;never was so hard put that
      I could remember. T-told him how Ephraim shook butternuts off my fathers
      tree&mdash;for all I know. T-told him all about Ephraim's war record&mdash;leastways
      all I could call to mind&mdash;and, by Godfrey! before I got through, I
      wished I'd listened to more of it. T-told him about Ephraim's Wilderness
      bullets&mdash;t-told him about Ephraim's rheumatism,&mdash;how it bothered
      him when he went to bed and when he got up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Jethro had glanced at his companion, he would have seen the senator was
      shaking with silent and convulsive laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the time I talked to him I didn't see a muscle move in his face,&rdquo;
       Jethro continued, &ldquo;so I started in again, and he looked&mdash;looked&mdash;looked
      right at me. W-wouldn't wink&mdash;don't think he winked once while I was
      in that room. I watched him as close as I could, and I watched to see if a
      muscle moved or if I was makin' any impression. All he would do was to
      stand there and look&mdash;look&mdash;look. K-kept me there ten minutes
      and never opened his mouth at all. Hardest man to talk to I ever met&mdash;never
      see a man before but what I could get him to say somethin', if it was only
      a cuss word. I got tired of it after a while, made up my mind that I had
      found one man I couldn't move. Then what bothered me was to get out of
      that room. If I'd a had a Bible I believe I'd a read it to him. I didn't
      know what to say, but I did say this after a while:&mdash;&ldquo;'W-well, Mr.
      President, I guess I've kept you long enough&mdash;g-guess you're a pretty
      busy man. H-hope you'll give Mr. Prescott that postmastership. Er&mdash;er
      good-by.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Wait, sir,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' I said, 'I-I'll wait.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought you was goin' to give him that postmastership, Mr. Bass,' he
      said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the senator could not control his mirth, and the empty
      corridor echoed his laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By thunder! what did you say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;I said, 'Mr. President, I thought I was until a while ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And when did you change your mind?' says he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he laughed a little&mdash;not much&mdash;but he laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I understand that your old soldier lives within the limits of the
      delivery of the Brampton office,' said he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's correct, Mr. President,' said I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well,' said he, 'I will app'int him postmaster at Brampton, Mr. Bass.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'When?' said I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he laughed a little more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have the app'intment sent to your hotel this afternoon,' said he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Then I said to him, 'This has come out full better than I expected, Mr.
      President. I'm much obliged to you.' He didn't say nothin' more, so I come
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grant didn't say anything about Worthington or Duncan, did he?&rdquo; asked the
      senator, curiously, as he rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess I've told you all he said,&rdquo; answered Jethro; &ldquo;'twahn't a great
      deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The senator held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bass,&rdquo; he said, laughing, &ldquo;I believe you came pretty near meeting your
      match. But if Grant's the hardest man in the Union to get anything out of,
      I've a notion who's the second.&rdquo; And with this parting shot the senator
      took his departure, chuckling to himself as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been said, there were but few visitors in Washington at this time,
      and the hotel corridor was all but empty. Presently a substantial-looking
      gentleman came briskly in from the street, nodding affably to the colored
      porters and bell-boys, who greeted him by name. He wore a flowing Prince
      Albert coat, which served to dignify a growing portliness, and his
      coal-black whiskers glistened in the light. A voice, which appeared to
      come from nowhere in particular, brought the gentleman up standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you, Heth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may not be that Mr. Sutton's hand trembled, but the ashes of his cigar
      fell to the floor. He was not used to visitations, and for the instant, if
      the truth be told, he was not equal to looking around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Washington, Heth&mdash;like Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Sutton turned. His presence of mind, and that other presence of
      which he was so proud, seemed for the moment to have deserted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-stick pretty close to business, Heth, comin' down here out of session
      time. S-stick pretty close to business, don't you, since the people sent
      you to Congress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sutton might have offered another man a cigar or a drink, but (as is
      well known) Jethro was proof against tobacco or stimulants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Honorable Heth, catching his breath and making a dive, &ldquo;I
      am surprised to see you, Jethro,&rdquo; which was probably true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th-thought you might be,&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;Er&mdash;glad to see me, Heth&mdash;glad
      to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As has been recorded, it is peculiarly difficult to lie to people who are
      not to be deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, certainly I am,&rdquo; answered the Honorable Heth, swallowing hard,
      &ldquo;certainly I am, Jethro. I meant to have got to Coniston this summer, but
      I was so busy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peoples' business, I understand. Er&mdash;hear you've gone in for
      high-minded politics, Heth&mdash;r-read a highminded speech of yours&mdash;two
      high-minded speeches. Always thought you was a high-minded man, Heth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you like those speeches, Jethro?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sutton, striving as
      best he might to make some show of dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th-thought they was high-minded,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a silence, for Mr. Sutton could think of nothing more to
      say. And he yearned to depart with a great yearning, but something held
      him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heth,&rdquo; said Jethro after a while, &ldquo;you was always very friendly and
      obliging. You've done a great many favors for me in your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've always tried to be neighborly, Jethro,&rdquo; said Mr. Sutton, but his
      voice sounded a little husky even to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I may have done one or two little things for you, Heth,&rdquo; Jethro
      continued, &ldquo;but I can't remember exactly. Er&mdash;can you remember,
      Heth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sutton was trying with becoming nonchalance to light the stump of his
      cigar. He did not succeed this time. He pulled himself together with a
      supreme effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we've both been mutually helpful, Jethro,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mutually
      helpful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jethro, reflectively, &ldquo;I don't know as I could have put it as
      well as that&mdash;there's somethin' in being an orator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another silence, a much longer one. The Honorable Heth threw his
      butt away, and lighted another cigar. Suddenly, as if by magic, his aplomb
      returned, and in a flash of understanding he perceived the situation. He
      saw himself once more as the successful congressman, the trusted friend of
      the railroad interests, and he saw Jethro as a discredited boss. He did
      not stop to reflect that Jethro did not act like a discredited boss, as a
      keener man might have done. But if the Honorable Heth had been a keener
      man, he would not have been at that time a congressman. Mr. Sutton accused
      himself of having been stupid in not grasping at once that the tables were
      turned, and that now he was the one to dispense the gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;K-kind of fortunate you stopped to speak to me, Heth. N-now I come to
      think of it, I hev a little favor to ask of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sutton, blowing out the smoke; &ldquo;of course anything I
      can do, Jethro&mdash;anything in reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-wouldn't ask a high-minded man to do anything he hadn't ought to,&rdquo; said
      Jethro; &ldquo;the fact is, I'd like to git Eph Prescott appointed at the
      Brampton post-office. You can fix that, Heth&mdash;can't you&mdash;you can
      fix that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sutton stuck his thumb into his vest pocket and cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you how sorry I am not to oblige you, Jethro, but I've
      arranged to give that post-office to Dave Wheelock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-arranged it, hev You&mdash;a-arranged it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Sutton, scarcely believing his own ears. Could it be
      possible that he was using this patronizingly kind tone to Jethro Bass?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's too bad,&rdquo; said Jethro; &ldquo;g-got it all fixed, hev you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practically,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sutton, grandly; &ldquo;indeed, I may go as far as
      to say that it is as certain as if I had the appointment here in my
      pocket. I'm sorry not to oblige you, Jethro; but these are matters which a
      member of Congress must look after pretty closely.&rdquo; He held out his hand,
      but Jethro did not appear to see it,&mdash;he had his in his pockets.
      &ldquo;I've an important engagement,&rdquo; said the Honorable Heth, consulting a
      large gold watch. &ldquo;Are you going to be in Washington long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess I've about got through, Heth&mdash;g-guess I've about got
      through,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you have time and there's any other little thing, I'm in Room
      29,&rdquo; said Mr. Sutton, as he put his foot on the stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-told Worthington you got that app'intment for Wheelock&mdash;t-told
      Worthington?&rdquo; Jethro called out after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sutton turned and waved his cigar and smiled in acknowledgment of this
      parting bit of satire. He felt that he could afford to smile. A few
      minutes later he was ensconced on the sofa of a private sitting room
      reviewing the incident, with much gusto, for the benefit of Mr. Isaac D.
      Worthington and Mr. Alexander Duncan. Both of these gentlemen laughed
      heartily, for the Honorable Heth Sutton knew the art of telling a story
      well, at least, and was often to be seen with a group around him in the
      lobbies of Congress.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      About five o'clock that afternoon Ephraim was sitting in his shirt-sleeves
      by the window of his room, and Cynthia was reading aloud to him an article
      (about the war, of course) from a Washington paper, which his friend, Mr.
      Beard, had sent him. There was a knock at the door, and Cynthia opened it
      to discover a colored hall-boy with a roll in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistah Ephum Prescott?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Ephraim, &ldquo;that's me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia shut the door and gave him the roll, but Ephraim took it as though
      he were afraid of its contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess it's some of them war records from Amasy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cousin Eph,&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia, excitedly, &ldquo;why don't you open it? If
      you don't I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess you'd better, Cynthy,&rdquo; and he held it out to her with a trembling
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia did open it, and drew out a large document with seals and printing
      and signatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Eph,&rdquo; she cried, holding it under his nose, &ldquo;Cousin Eph, you're
      postmaster of Brampton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim looked at the paper, but his eyes swam, and he could only make out
      a dancing, bronze seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Fetch Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cynthia had already flown on that errand. Curiously enough, she ran
      into Jethro in the hall immediately outside of Ephraim's door. Ephraim got
      to his feet; it was very difficult for him to realize that his troubles
      were ended, that he was to earn his living at last. He looked at Jethro,
      and his eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;I guess I can't thank you as I'd ought
      to, Jethro,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;leastways, not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll thank him for you, Cousin Eph,&rdquo; said Cynthia. And she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't thank me,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;I didn't have much to do with it, Eph.
      Thank the President.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim did thank the President, in one of the most remarkable letters,
      from a literary point of view, ever received at the White House. For the
      art of literature largely consists in belief in what one is writing, and
      Ephraim's letter had this quality of sincerity, and no lack of vividness
      as well. He spent most of the evening in composing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, too, had received a letter that day&mdash;a letter which she had
      read several times, now with a smile, and again with a pucker of the
      forehead which was meant for a frown. &ldquo;Dear Cynthia,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Where do
      you keep yourself? I am sure you would not be so cruel if you knew that I
      was aching to see you.&rdquo; Aching! Cynthia repeated the word, and remembered
      the glimpse she had had of him in the dining room with Miss Janet Duncan.
      &ldquo;Whenever I have been free&rdquo; (Cynthia repeated this also, somewhat
      ironically, although she conceded it the merit of frankness), &ldquo;Whenever I
      have been free, I have haunted the corridors for a sight of you. Think of
      me as haunting the hotel desk for an answer to this, telling me when I can
      see you&mdash;and where. P.S. I shall be around all evening.&rdquo; And it was
      signed, &ldquo;Your friend and playmate, R. Worthington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is a fact&mdash;not generally known&mdash;that Cynthia did answer the
      letter&mdash;twice. But she sent neither answer. Even at that age she was
      given to reflection, and much as she may have approved of the spirit of
      the letter, she liked the tone of it less. Cynthia did not know a great
      deal of the world, it is true, but the felt instinctively that something
      was wrong when Bob resorted to such means of communication. And she was
      positively relieved, or thought that she was, when she went down to supper
      and discovered that the table in the corner was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper Ephraim had his letter to write, and Jethro wished to sit in
      the corridor. But Cynthia had learned that the corridor was not the place
      for a girl, so she explained&mdash;to Jethro that he would find her in the
      parlor if he wanted her, and that she was going there to read. That parlor
      Cynthia thought a handsome room, with its high windows and lace curtains,
      its long mirrors and marble-topped tables. She established herself under a
      light, on a sofa in one corner, and sat, with the book on her lap watching
      the people who came and went. She had that delicious sensation which comes
      to the young when they first travel&mdash;the sensation of being a part of
      the great world; and she wished that she knew these people, and which were
      the great, and which the little ones. Some of them looked at her intently,
      she thought too intently, and at such times she pretended to read. She was
      aroused by hearing some one saying:&mdash;&ldquo;Isn't this Miss Wetherell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia looked up and caught her breath, for the young lady who had spoken
      was none other than Miss Janet Duncan herself. Seen thus startlingly at
      close range, Miss Duncan was not at all like what Cynthia had expected&mdash;but
      then most people are not. Janet Duncan was, in fact, one of those strange
      persons who do not realize the picture which their names summon up. She
      was undoubtedly good-looking; her hair, of a more golden red than her
      brother's, was really wonderful; her neck was slender; and she had a
      strange, dreamy face that fascinated Cynthia, who had never seen anything
      like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put down her book on the sofa and got up, not without a little tremor
      at this unexpected encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm Cynthia Wetherell,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add to her embarrassment, Miss Duncan seized both her hands impulsively
      and gazed into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're really very beautiful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's only answer to this was a blush. She wondered if all city girls
      were like Miss Duncan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was determined to come up and speak to you the first chance I had,&rdquo;
       Janet continued. &ldquo;I've been making up stories about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stories!&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia, drawing away her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Romances,&rdquo; said Miss Duncan&mdash;&ldquo;real romances. Sometimes I think I'm
      going to be a novelist, because I'm always weaving stories about people
      that I see people who interest me, I mean. And you look as if you might be
      the heroine of a wonderful romance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's breath was now quite taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&mdash;had never thought that I looked like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do,&rdquo; said Miss Duncan; &ldquo;you've got all sorts of possibilities in
      your face&mdash;you look as if you might have lived for ages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As old as that?&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia, really startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I don't express myself very well&rdquo; said the other, hastily; &ldquo;I
      wish you could see what I've written about you already. I can do it so
      much better with pen and ink. I've started quite a romance already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Cynthia, not without interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down on the sofa and I'll tell you,&rdquo; said Miss Duncan; &ldquo;I've done it
      all from your face, too. I've made you a very poor girl brought up by
      peasants, only you are really of a great family, although nobody knows it.
      A rich duke sees you one day when he is hunting and falls in love with
      you, and you have to stand a lot of suffering and persecution because of
      it, and say nothing. I believe you could do that,&rdquo; added Janet, looking
      critically at Cynthia's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I could if I had to,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;but I shouldn't like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it would do you good,&rdquo; said Janet; &ldquo;it would ennoble your character.
      Not that it needs it,&rdquo; she added hastily. &ldquo;And I could write another story
      about that quaint old man who paid the musicians to go away, and who made
      us all laugh so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's eye kindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass isn't a quaint old man,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he's the greatest man in the
      state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Duncan's patronage had been of an unconscious kind. She knew that she
      had offended, but did not quite realize how.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so sorry,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I didn't mean to hurt you. You live with him,
      don't you&mdash;Coniston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cynthia, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard about Coniston. It must be quite a romance in itself to live
      all the year round in such a beautiful place and to make your own clothes.
      Yours become you very well,&rdquo; said Miss Duncan, &ldquo;although I don't know why.
      They're not at all in style, and yet they give you quite an air of
      distinction. I wish I could live in Coniston for a year, anyway, and write
      a book about you. My brother and Bob Worthington went out there one night
      and serenaded you, didn't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia, that peculiar flash coming into her eyes again, &ldquo;and
      I think it was very foolish of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Duncan, in surprise; &ldquo;I wish somebody would
      serenade me. I think it was the most romantic thing Bob ever did. He's
      wild about you, and so is Somers they have both told me so in confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's face was naturally burning now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it were true,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they wouldn't have told you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that's so,&rdquo; said Miss Duncan, thoughtfully, &ldquo;only you're very
      clever to have seen it. Now that I know you, I think you a more remarkable
      person than ever. You don't seem at all like a country girl, and you don't
      talk like one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia laughed outright. She could not help liking Janet Duncan, mere
      flesh and blood not being proof against such compliments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's because my father was an educated man,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he
      taught me to read and speak when I was young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you are just like a person out of a novel! Who was your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He kept the store at Coniston,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, smiling a little sadly.
      She would have liked to have added that William Wetherell would have been
      a great man if he had had health, but she found it difficult to give out
      confidences, especially when they were in the nature of surmises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Janet, stoutly, &ldquo;I think that is more like a story than ever.
      Do you know,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I saw you once at the state capital outside
      of our grounds the day Bob ran after you. That was when I was in love with
      him. We had just come back from Europe then, and I thought he was the most
      wonderful person I had ever seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Cynthia had felt any emotion from this disclosure, she did not betray
      it. Janet, moreover, was not looking for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you change your mind?&rdquo; asked Cynthia, biting her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bob hasn't the temperament,&rdquo; said Janet, making use of a word that
      she had just discovered; &ldquo;he's too practical&mdash;he never does or says
      the things you want him to. He's just been out West with us on a trip, and
      he was always looking at locomotives and brakes and grades and bridges and
      all such tiresome things. I should like to marry a poet,&rdquo; said Miss
      Duncan, dreamily; &ldquo;I know they want me to marry Bob, and Mr. Worthington
      wants it. I'm sure, of that. But he wouldn't at all suit me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Cynthia had been able to exercise an equal freedom of speech, she might
      have been impelled to inquire what young Mr. Worthington's views were in
      the matter. As it was, she could think of nothing appropriate to say, and
      just then four people entered the room and came towards them. Two of these
      were Janet's mother and father, and the other two were Mr. Worthington,
      the elder, and the Honorable Heth Sutton. Mrs. Duncan, whom Janet did not
      at all resemble was a person who naturally commanded attention. She had
      strong features, and a very decided, though not disagreeable, manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't imagine what had become of you, Janet,&rdquo; she said, coming
      forward and throwing off her lace shawl. &ldquo;Whom have you found&mdash;a
      school friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mamma,&rdquo; said Janet, &ldquo;this is Cynthia Wetherell.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Duncan, looking very hard at Cynthia in a near-sighted way, and, not
      knowing in the least who she was; &ldquo;you haven't seen Senator and Mrs.
      Meade, have you, Janet? They were to be here at eight o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Janet, turning again to Cynthia and scarcely hearing the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Janet hasn't seen them, Dudley,&rdquo; said Mrs. Duncan, going up to Mr.
      Worthington, who was pulling his chop whiskers by the door. &ldquo;Janet has
      discovered such a beautiful creature,&rdquo; she went on, in a voice which she
      did not take the trouble to lower. &ldquo;Do look at her, Alexander. And you,
      Mr. Sutton&mdash;who are such a bureau of useful information, do tell me
      who she is. Perhaps she comes from your part of the country&mdash;her
      name's Wetherell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wetherell? Why, of course I know her,&rdquo; said Mr. Sutton, who was greatly
      pleased because Mrs. Duncan had likened him to an almanac: greatly pleased
      this evening in every respect, and even the diamond in his bosom seemed to
      glow with a brighter fire. He could afford to be generous to-night, and he
      turned to Mr. Worthington and laughed knowingly. &ldquo;She's the ward of our
      friend Jethro,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Duncan, who knew and cared nothing about
      politics, &ldquo;a country girl, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sutton, &ldquo;a country girl from a little village not far
      from Clovelly. A good girl, I believe, in spite of the atmosphere in which
      she has been raised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's really wonderful, Mr. Sutton, how you seem to know every one in your
      district, including the women and children,&rdquo; said the lady; &ldquo;but I suppose
      you wouldn't be where you are if you didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Heth cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wetherell,&rdquo; Mr. Duncan was saying, staring at Cynthia through his
      spectacles, &ldquo;where have I heard that name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He must suddenly have remembered, and recalled also that he and his ally
      Worthington had been on opposite sides in the Woodchuck Session, for he
      sat down abruptly beside the door, and remained there for a while. For Mr.
      Duncan had never believed Mr. Merrill's explanation concerning poor
      William Wetherell' s conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty, ain't she?&rdquo; said Mr. Sutton to Mr. Worthington. &ldquo;Guess she's more
      dangerous than Jethro, now that we've clipped his wings a little.&rdquo; The
      congressman had heard of Bob's infatuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaac D. Worthington, however, was in a good humor this evening and was
      moved by a certain curiosity to inspect the girl. Though what he had seen
      and heard of his son's conduct with her had annoyed him, he did not regard
      it seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you going to speak to your constituent, Mr. Sutton?&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Duncan, who was bored because her friends had not arrived; &ldquo;a congressman
      ought to keep on the right side of the pretty girls, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It hadn't occurred to the Honorable Heth to speak to his constituent. The
      ways of Mrs. Duncan sometimes puzzled him, and he could not see why that
      lady and her daughter seemed to take more than a passing interest in the
      girl. But if they could afford to notice her, certainly he could; so he
      went forward graciously and held out his hand to Cynthia; interrupting
      Miss Duncan in the middle of a discourse upon her diary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Cynthia?&rdquo; said Mr. Sutton. Had he been in Coniston, he
      would have said, &ldquo;How be you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia took the hand, but did not rise, somewhat to Mr. Sutton's
      annoyance. A certain respect was due to a member of Congress and the Rajah
      of Clovelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Sutton?&rdquo; said Cynthia, very coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like her,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Duncan to Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a splendid trip for you, eh, Cynthia?&rdquo; Mr. Sutton persisted, with
      a praiseworthy determination to be pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has turned out to be so, Mr. Sutton,&rdquo; replied Cynthia. This was not
      precisely the answer Mr. Sutton expected, and to tell the truth, he didn't
      know quite what to make of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great treat to see Washington and New York, isn't it?&rdquo; said Mr. Sutton,
      kindly, &ldquo;a great treat for a Coniston girl. I suppose you came through New
      York and saw the sights?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there another way to get to Washington?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Duncan nudged Mr. Worthington and drew a little nearer, while Mr.
      Sutton began to wish he had not been lured into the conversation. Cynthia
      had been very polite, but there was something in the quiet manner in which
      the girl's eyes were fixed upon him that made him vaguely uneasy. He could
      not back out with dignity, and he felt himself on the verge of becoming
      voluble. Mr. Sutton prided himself on never being voluble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;we have to go to New York to get anywhere in
      these days.&rdquo; There was a slight pause. &ldquo;Uncle Jethro taking you and Mr.
      Prescott on a little pleasure trip?&rdquo; He had not meant to mention Jethro's
      name, but he found himself, to his surprise, a little at a loss for a
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, partly a pleasure trip. It's always a pleasure for Uncle Jethro to
      do things for others,&rdquo; said Cynthia, quietly, &ldquo;although people do not
      always appreciate what he does for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Honorable Heth coughed. He was now very uncomfortable, indeed. How
      much did this astounding young person know, whom he had thought so
      innocent?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't discover he was in town until I ran across him in the corridor
      this evening. Should have liked to have introduced him to some of the
      Washington folks&mdash;some of the big men, although not many of 'em are
      here,&rdquo; Mr. Sutton ran on, not caring to notice the little points of light
      in Cynthia's eyes. (The idea of Mr. Sutton introducing Uncle Jethro to
      anybody!) &ldquo;I haven't seen Ephraim Prescott. It must be a great treat for
      him, too, to get away on a little trip and see his army friends. How is
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's very happy,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sutton. &ldquo;Oh, yes, of course, Ephraim's always
      happy, in spite of his troubles and his rheumatism. I always liked Ephraim
      Prescott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia did not answer this remark at all, and Mr. Sutton suspected
      strongly that she did not believe it, therefore he repeated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always liked Ephraim. I want you to tell Jethro that I'm downright
      sorry I couldn't get him that Brampton postmastership.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell him that you are sorry, Mr. Sutton,&rdquo; replied Cynthia, gravely,
      &ldquo;but I don't think it'll do any good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not do any good!&mdash;What did the girl mean? Mr. Sutton came to the
      conclusion that he had been condescending enough, that somehow he was
      gaining no merit in Mrs. Duncan's eyes by this kindness to a constituent.
      He buttoned up his coat rather grandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won't misunderstand me, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I regret extremely
      that my sense of justice demanded that I should make David Wheelock
      postmaster at Brampton, and I have made him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now Cynthia's turn to be amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;but Cousin Ephraim is postmaster of Brampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sutton started violently, and that part of his face not hidden by his
      whiskers seemed to pale, and Mr. Worthington, usually self-possessed, took
      a step forward and seized him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean, Sutton?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sutton pulled himself together, and glared at Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are mistaken,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the congressman of the district
      usually arranges these matters, and the appointment will be sent to Mr.
      Wheelock to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Cousin Ephraim already has the appointment,&rdquo; said Cynthia; &ldquo;it was
      sent to him this afternoon, and he is up in his room now writing to thank
      the President for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the world's the matter?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Duncan, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's simple announcement had indeed caused something of a panic among
      the gentlemen present. Mr. Duncan had jumped up from his seat beside the
      door, and Mr. Worthington, his face anything but impassive, tightened his
      hold on the congressman's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, Sutton!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;can this be true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As for Cynthia, she was no less astonished than Mrs. Duncan by the fact
      that these rich and powerful gentlemen were so excited over a little thing
      like the postmastership of Brampton. But Mr. Sutton laughed; it was not
      hearty, but still it might have passed muster for a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he exclaimed, making a fair attempt to regain his composure,
      &ldquo;the girl's got it mixed up with something else&mdash;she doesn't know
      what she's talking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Duncan thought the girl did look uncommonly as if she knew what she
      was talking about, and Mr. Duncan and Mr. Worthington had some such
      impression, too, as they stared at her. Cynthia's eyes flashed, but her
      voice was no louder than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am used to being believed, Mr. Sutton,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but here's Uncle
      Jethro himself. You might ask him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all turned in amazement, and one, at least, in trepidation, to
      perceive Jethro Bass standing behind them with his hands in his pockets,
      as unconcerned as though he were under the butternut tree in Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you, Heth?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Er&mdash;still got that appointment
      p-practically in your pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;Mr. Sutton does not believe me when I tell
      him that Cousin Ephraim has been made postmaster of Brampton. He would
      like to have you tell him whether it is so or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this, as it happened, was exactly what the Honorable Heth did not want
      to have Jethro tell him. How he got out of the parlor of the Willard House
      he has not to this day a very clear idea. As a matter of fact, he followed
      Mr. Worthington and Mr. Duncan, and they made their exit by the farther
      door. Jethro did not appear to take any notice of their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Janet,&rdquo; said Mrs. Duncan, &ldquo;I think Senator and Mrs. Meade must have gone
      to our sitting room.&rdquo; Then, to Cynthia's surprise, the lady took her by
      the hand. &ldquo;I can't imagine what you've done, my dear,&rdquo; she said
      pleasantly, &ldquo;but I believe that you are capable of taking care of
      yourself, and I like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it will be seen that Mrs. Duncan was an independent person. Sometimes
      heiresses are apt to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I like you, too,&rdquo; said Janet, taking both of Cynthia's hands, &ldquo;and I
      hope to see you very, very often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro looked after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;the women folks seem to have some sense,&rdquo; he said. Then he
      turned to Cynthia. &ldquo;B-be'n havin' some fun with Heth, Cynthy?&rdquo; he
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any respect for Mr. Sutton,&rdquo; said Cynthia, indignantly; &ldquo;it
      serves him right for presuming to think that he could give a post-office
      to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro made no remark concerning this presumption on the part of the
      congressman of the district. Cynthia's indignation against Mr. Sutton was
      very real, and it was some time before she could compose herself
      sufficiently to tell Jethro what had happened. His enjoyment as he
      listened may be imagined but presently he forgot this, and became aware
      that something really troubled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she asked suddenly, &ldquo;why do they treat me as they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer at once. This was because of a pain around his heart&mdash;had
      she known it. He had felt that pain before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how do they treat you, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. She had not yet learned to use the word patronize in the
      social sense, and she was at a loss to describe the attitude of Mrs.
      Duncan and her daughter, though her instinct had registered it. She was at
      a loss to account for Mr. Worthington's attitude, too. Mr. Sutton's she
      bitterly resented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they your enemies?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro was in real distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they are,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I won't speak to them again. If they can't
      treat me as&mdash;as your daughter ought to be treated, I'll turn my back
      on them. I am&mdash;I am just like your daughter&mdash;am I not, Uncle
      Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put out his hand and seized hers roughly, and his voice was thick with
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Cynthy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&mdash;you're all I've got in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She squeezed his hand in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she cried contritely, &ldquo;I oughtn't to have
      troubled you by asking. You&mdash;you have done everything for me, much
      more than I deserve. And I shan't be hurt after this when people are too
      small to appreciate how good you are, and how great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pain tightened about Jethro's heart&mdash;tightened so sharply that he
      could not speak, and scarcely breathe because of it. Cynthia picked up her
      novel, and set the bookmark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that Cousin Eph is provided for, let's go back to Coniston, Uncle
      Jethro.&rdquo; A sudden longing was upon her for the peaceful life in the
      shelter of the great ridge, and she thought of the village maples all red
      and gold with the magic touch of the frosts. &ldquo;Not that I haven't enjoyed
      my trip,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;but we are so happy there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not look at her, because he was afraid to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-Cynthy,&rdquo; he said, after a little pause, &ldquo;th-thought we'd go to Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boston, Uncle Jethro!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;at one&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;like to go to
      Boston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully, &ldquo;I remember parts of it. The Common, where I
      used to walk with Daddy, and the funny old streets that went uphill. It
      will be nice to go back to Coniston that way&mdash;over Truro Pass in the
      train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night a piece of news flashed over the wires to New England, and the
      next morning a small item appeared in the Newcastle Guardian to the effect
      that one Ephraim Prescott had bean appointed postmaster at Brampton.
      Copied in the local papers of the state, it caused some surprise in
      Brampton, to be sure, and excitement in Coniston. Perhaps there were but a
      dozen men, however, who saw its real significance, who knew through this
      item that Jethro Bass was still supreme&mdash;that the railroads had
      failed to carry this first position in their war against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a light heart the next morning that Cynthia, packed the little
      leather trunk which had been her father's. Ephraim was in the corridor
      regaling his friend, Mr. Beard, with that wonderful encounter with General
      Grant which sounded so much like a Fifth Reader anecdote of a chance
      meeting with royalty. Jethro's room was full of visiting politicians. So
      Cynthia, when she had finished her packing, went out to walk about the
      streets alone, scanning the people who passed her, looking at the big
      houses, and wondering who lived in them. Presently she found herself, in
      the middle of the morning, seated on a bench in a little park, surrounded
      by colored mammies and children playing in the paths. It seemed a long
      time since she had left the hills, and this glimpse of cities had given
      her many things to think and dream about. Would she always live in
      Coniston? Or was her future to be cast among those who moved in the world
      and helped to sway it? Cynthia felt that she was to be of these, though
      she could not reason why, and she told herself that the feeling was
      foolish. Perhaps it was that she knew in the bottom of her heart that she
      had been given a spirit and intelligence to cope with a larger life than
      that of Coniston. With a sense that such imaginings were vain, she tried
      to think what the would do if she were to become a great lady like Mrs.
      Duncan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aroused from these reflections by a distant glimpse, through the
      trees, of Mr. Robert Worthington. He was standing quite alone on the edge
      of the park, his hands in his pockets, staring at the White House. Cynthia
      half rose, and then sat down and looked at him again. He wore a light
      gray, loose-fitting suit and a straw hat, and she could not but
      acknowledge that there was something stalwart and clean and altogether
      appealing in him. She wondered, indeed, why he now failed to appeal to
      Miss Duncan, and she began to doubt the sincerity of that young lady's
      statements. Bob certainly was not romantic, but he was a man&mdash;or
      would be very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia sat still, although her impulse was to go away. She scarcely
      analyzed her feeling of wishing to avoid him. It may not be well, indeed,
      to analyze them on paper too closely. She had an instinct that only pain
      could come from frequent meetings, and she knew now what but a week ago
      was a surmise, that he belonged to the world of which she had been
      dreaming&mdash;Mrs. Duncan's world. Again, there was that mysterious
      barrier between them of which she had seen so many evidences. And yet she
      sat still on her bench and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he turned, slowly, as if her eyes had compelled his. She sat
      still&mdash;it was too late, then. In less than a minute he was standing
      beside her, looking down at her with a smile that had in it a touch of
      reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Worthington?&rdquo; said Cynthia, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you haven't called me that before. We are
      not children any more,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does that make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal,&rdquo; said Cynthia, not caring to define it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, sitting down on the beach and facing her,
      &ldquo;do you think you've treated me just right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or I should have treated you differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob ignored such quibbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you run away from that baseball game in Brampton? And why
      couldn't you have answered my letter yesterday, if it were only a line?
      And why have you avoided me here in Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is very difficult to answer for another questions which one cannot
      answer for one's self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't avoided you,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been looking for you all over town this morning,&rdquo; said Bob, with
      pardonable exaggeration, &ldquo;and I believe that idiot Somers has, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why should you call him an idiot?&rdquo; Cynthia flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you do catch a fellow up!&rdquo; said he; admiringly. &ldquo;We both found out
      you'd gone out for a walk alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find it out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bob, hesitating, &ldquo;we asked the colored doorkeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; said Cynthia, with an indignation that made him quail,
      &ldquo;do you think it right to ask a doorkeeper to spy on my movements?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, Cynthia,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn't think of it that way&mdash;and
      he won't tell. Desperate cases require desperate remedies, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cynthia was not appeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wanted to see me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why didn't you send your card to my
      room, and I would have come to the parlor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I did send a note, and waited around all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How was she to tell him that it was to the tone of the note she objected&mdash;to
      the hint of a clandestine meeting? She turned the light of her eyes full
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have been content to see me in the parlor?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Did you
      mean to see me there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I would have given my head to see you anywhere, only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Duncan might have came in and spoiled it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoiled what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob fidgeted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you're not stupid&mdash;far from it. Of
      course you know a fellow would rather talk to you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have been very glad to have seen Mr. Duncan, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would, would you!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I shouldn't have thought that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he your friend?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;and one of the best in the world. Only&mdash;I
      shouldn't have thought you'd care to talk to him.&rdquo; And he looked around
      for fear the vigilant Mr. Duncan was already in the park and had
      discovered them. Cynthia smiled, and immediately became grave again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was only on Mr. Duncan's account that you didn't ask me to come
      down to the parlor?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob was in a quandary. He was a truthful person, and he had learned
      something of the world through his three years at Cambridge. He had seen
      many young women, and many kinds of them. But the girl beside him was such
      a mixture of innocence and astuteness that he was wholly at a loss how to
      deal with her&mdash;how to parry her searching questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally&mdash;I wanted to have you all to myself,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you ought
      to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia did not commit herself on this point. She wished to go mercilessly
      to the root of the matter, but the notion of what this would imply
      prevented her. Bob took advantage of her silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody who sees you falls a victim, Cynthia,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;Mrs. Duncan
      and Janet lost their hearts. You ought to have heard them praising you at
      breakfast.&rdquo; He paused abruptly, thinking of the rest of that conversation,
      and laughed. Bob seemed fated to commit himself that day. &ldquo;I heard the way
      you handled Heth Sutton,&rdquo; he said, plunging in. &ldquo;I'll bet he felt as if
      he'd been dropped out of the third-story window,&rdquo; and Bob laughed again.
      &ldquo;I'd have given a thousand dollars to have been there. Somers and I went
      out to supper with a classmate who lives in Washington, in that house over
      there,&rdquo; and he pointed casually to one of the imposing mansions fronting
      on the park. &ldquo;Mrs. Duncan said she'd never heard anybody lay it on the way
      you did. I don't believe you half know what happened, Cynthia. You made a
      ten-strike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ten-strike?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you not only laid out Heth, but my father and Mr.
      Duncan, too. Mrs. Duncan laughed at 'em&mdash;she isn't afraid of
      anything. But they didn't say a word all through breakfast. I've never
      seen my father so mad. He ought to have known better than to run up
      against Uncle Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did they run up against Uncle Jethro?&rdquo; asked Cynthia, now keenly
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know?&rdquo; exclaimed Bob, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;or I shouldn't have asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't Uncle Jethro tell you about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never tells me anything about his affairs,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob's astonishment did not wear off at once. Here was a new phase, and he
      was very hard put. He had heard, casually, a good deal of abuse of Jethro
      and his methods in the last two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't know anything about politics. I don't know
      myself why father and Mr. Duncan were so eager for this post-mastership.
      But they were. And I heard them say something about the President going
      back on them when they had telegraphed from Chicago and come to see him
      here. And maybe they didn't let Heth in for it. It seems Uncle Jethro only
      had to walk up to the White House. They ought to have sense enough to know
      that he runs the state. But what's the use of wasting time over this
      business?&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;I told you I was going to Brampton before the term
      begins just to see you, didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I didn't believe you,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it's my nature, I suppose,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much for Bob, exasperated though he was, and he burst into
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're the queerest girl I've ever known,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a very original remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be saying a great deal,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have known many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;and none of 'em, no matter how much they'd knocked
      about, were able to look out for themselves any better than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even Cassandra Hopkins?&rdquo; Cynthia could not resist saying. She saw
      that she had scored; his expressions registered his sensations so
      accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about her?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Cynthia, mysteriously, &ldquo;I heard that you were very fond of her
      at Andover.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob could not help pluming himself a little. He thought the fact that she
      had mentioned the matter a flaw in Cynthia's armor, as indeed it was. And
      yet he was not proud of the Cassandra Hopkins episode in his career.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cassandra is one of the institutions at Andover,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;most fellows
      have to take a course in Cassandra to complete their education.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours seems to be very complete,&rdquo; Cynthia retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking at her, &ldquo;no wonder you made
      mince-meat of the Honorable Heth. Where did you learn it all, Cynthia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia did not know. She merely wondered where she would be if she hadn't
      learned it. Something told her that if it were not for this anchor she
      would be drifting out to sea: might, indeed, soon be drifting out to sea
      in spite of it. It was one thing for Mr. Robert Worthington, with his
      numerous resources, to amuse himself with a girl in her position; it would
      be quite another thing for the girl. She got to her feet and held out her
      hand to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are leaving Washington at one o'clock, and Uncle Jethro will be
      worried if I am not in time for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leaving at one! That's the worst luck I've had yet. But I'm going back to
      the hotel myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia didn't see how she was to prevent him walking with her. She would
      not have admitted to herself that she had enjoyed this encounter, since
      she was trying so hard not to enjoy it. So they started together out of
      the park. Bob, for a wonder, was silent awhile, glancing now and then at
      her profile. He knew that he had a great deal to say, but he couldn't
      decide exactly what it was to be. This is often the case with young men in
      his state of mind: in fact, to be paradoxical again, he might hardly be
      said at this time to have had a state of mind. He lacked both an attitude
      and a policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you see Duncan before I do, let me know,&rdquo; he remarked finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia bit her lip. &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we've only got five minutes more alone together, at best. If we
      see him in time, we can go down a side street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be hard to get away from Mr. Duncan if we met him&mdash;even
      if we wanted to,&rdquo; she said, laughing outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know how true that is,&rdquo; he replied, with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds as though you'd tried it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paid no attention to this thrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't see you again till I get to Brampton,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that will be a
      whole week. And then,&rdquo; he ventured to look at her, &ldquo;I shan't see you until
      the Christmas holidays. You might be a little kind, Cynthia. You know I've&mdash;I've
      always thought the world of you. I don't know how I'm going to get through
      the three months without seeing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You managed to get through a good many years,&rdquo; said Cynthia, looking at
      the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I was sent away to school and college, and our lives
      separated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, our lives separated,&rdquo; she assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I didn't know you were going to be like&mdash;like this,&rdquo; he went on,
      vaguely enough, but with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like&mdash;well, I'd rather be with you and talk to you than any girl I
      ever saw. I don't care who she is,&rdquo; Bob declared, &ldquo;or how much she may
      have traveled.&rdquo; He was running into deep water. &ldquo;Why are you so cold,
      Cynthia?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why can't you be as you used to be? You used to like me well
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I like you now,&rdquo; answered Cynthia. They were very near the hotel by
      this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk as if you were ten years older than I,&rdquo; he said, smiling
      plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped and turned to him, smiling. They had reached the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I am, Bob,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I haven't seen much of the world, but
      I've seen something of its troubles. Don't be foolish. If you're coming to
      Brampton just to see me, don't come. Good-by.&rdquo; And she gave him her hand
      frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will come to Brampton,&rdquo; he cried, taking her hand and squeezing it.
      &ldquo;I'd like to know why I shouldn't come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Cynthia drew her hand away a gentleman came out of the hotel, paused
      for a brief moment by the door and stared at them, and then passed on
      without a word or a nod of recognition. It was Mr. Worthington. Bob looked
      after his father, and then glanced at Cynthia. There was a trifle more
      color in her cheeks, and her head was raised a little, and her eyes were
      fixed upon him gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should know why not,&rdquo; she said, and before he could answer her she
      was gone into the hotel. He did not attempt to follow her, but stood where
      she had left him in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aroused by the voice of the genial colored doorkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, suh, you found the lady, Mistah Wo'thington. Thought you would, suh.
      T'other young gentleman come in while ago&mdash;looked as if he was
      feelin' powerful bad, Mistah Wo'thington.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When they reached Boston, Cynthia felt almost as if she were home again,
      and Ephraim declared that he had had the same feeling when he returned
      from the war. Though it be the prosperous capital of New England, it is a
      city of homes, and the dwellers of it have held stanchly to the belief of
      their forefathers that the home is the very foundation-rock of the nation.
      Held stanchly to other beliefs, too: that wealth carries with it some
      little measure of responsibility. The stranger within the gates of that
      city feels that if he falls, a heedless world will not go charging over
      his body: that a helping hand will be stretched out,&mdash;a helping and a
      wise hand that will inquire into the circumstances of his fall&mdash;but
      still a human hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting in the parlor of the Tremont House that morning with the
      sun streaming in the windows, waiting for Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; Cynthia asked, abruptly, &ldquo;did you ever know my mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro started, and looked at her quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-why, Cynthy?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because she grew up in Coniston,&rdquo; answered Cynthia. &ldquo;I never thought of
      it before, but of course you must have known her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew her,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know her well?&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro got up and went over to the window, where he stood with his back
      toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Cynthy,&rdquo; he answered at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven't you ever told me about her?&rdquo; asked Cynthia. How was she to
      know that her innocent questions tortured him cruelly; that the spirit of
      the Cynthia who had come to him in the tannery house had haunted him all
      his life, and that she herself, a new Cynthia, was still that spirit? The
      bygone Cynthia had been much in his thoughts since they came to Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was she like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;she was like you, Cynthy,&rdquo; he said, but he did not turn round.
      &ldquo;She was a clever woman, and a good woman, and&mdash;a lady, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl said nothing for a while, but she tingled with pleasure because
      Jethro had compared her to her mother. She determined to try to be like
      that, if he thought her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;I'd like to go to see the house where
      she lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Ephraim knows it,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when Ephraim came the three went over the hill; past the State House
      which Bulfinch set as a crown on the crest of it looking over the sweep of
      the Common, and on into the maze of quaint, old-world streets on the slope
      beyond: streets with white porticos, and violet panes in the windows. They
      came to an old square hidden away on a terrace of the hill, and after that
      the streets grew narrower and dingier. Ephraim, whose memory never
      betrayed him, hobbled up to a shabby house in the middle of one of these
      blocks and rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's where I found Will when I come back from the war,&rdquo; he said, and
      explained the matter in full to the slatternly landlady who came to the
      door. She was a good-natured woman, who thought her boarder would not
      mind, and led the way up the steep stairs to the chamber over the roofs
      where Wetherell and Cynthia had lived and hoped and worked together; where
      he had written those pages by which, with the aid of her loving criticism,
      he had thought to become famous. The room was as bare now as it had been
      then, and Ephraim, poking his stick through a hole in the carpet, ventured
      the assertion that even that had not been changed. Jethro, staring out
      over the chimney tops, passed his hand across his eyes. Cynthia Ware had
      come to this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found him right here in that bed,&rdquo; Ephraim was saying, and he poked the
      bottom boards, too. &ldquo;The same bed. Had a shack when I saw him. Callate he
      wouldn't have lived two months if the war hadn't bust up and I hadn't come
      along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cousin Eph!&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old soldier turned and saw that there were tears in her eyes. But,
      stranger than that, Cynthia saw that there were tears in his own. He took
      her gently by the arm and led her down the stairs again, she supporting
      him, and Jethro following.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same morning, Jethro, whose memory was quite as good as Ephraim's,
      found a little shop tucked away in Cornhill which had been miraculously
      spared in the advance of prosperity. Mr. Judson's name, however, was no
      longer in quaint lettering over the door. Standing before it, Jethro told
      the story in his droll way, of a city clerk and a country bumpkin, and
      Cynthia and Ephraim both laughed so heartily that the people who were
      passing turned round to look at them and laughed too. For the three were
      an unusual group, even in Boston. It was not until they were seated at
      dinner in the hotel, Ephraim with his napkin tucked under his chin, that
      Jethro gave them the key to the characters in this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who was the locket for, Uncle Jethro?&rdquo; demanded Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro, however, shook his head, and would not be induced to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were still so seated when Cynthia perceived coming toward them
      through the crowded dining roam a merry, middle-aged gentleman with a bald
      head. He seemed to know everybody in the room, for he was kept busy
      nodding right and left at the tables until he came to theirs. He was Mr.
      Merrill who had come to see her father in Coniston, and who had spoken so
      kindly to her on that occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Jethro, you'll be the death of me yet.
      'Don't write-send,' eh? Well, as long as you sent word you were here, I
      don't complain. So you licked 'em again, eh&mdash;down in Washington?
      Never had a doubt but what you would. Is this the new postmaster? How are
      you, Mr. Prescott&mdash;and Cynthia&mdash;a young lady! Bless my soul,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Merrill, looking her over as he shook her hand. &ldquo;What have you
      done to her, Jethro? What kind of beauty powder do they use in Coniston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill took the seat next to her and continued to talk, scattering
      his pleasantries equally among the three, patting her arm when her own
      turn came. She liked Mr. Merrill very much; he seemed to her (as, indeed,
      he was) honest and kind-hearted. Cynthia was not lacking in a proper
      appreciation of herself&mdash;that may have been discovered. But she was
      puzzled to know why this gentleman should make it a point to pay such
      particular attention to a young country girl. Other railroad presidents
      whom she could name had not done so. She was thinking of these things,
      rather than listening to Mr. Merrill's conversation, when the sound of Mr.
      Worthington's name startled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jethro,&rdquo; Mr. Merrill was saying, &ldquo;you certainly nipped this little
      game of Worthington's in the bud. Thought he'd take you in the rear by
      going to Washington, did he? Ha, ha! I'd like to know how you did it. I'll
      get you to tell me to-night&mdash;see if I don't. You're all coming in to
      supper to-night, you know, at seven o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim laid down his knife and fork for the first time. Were the wonders
      of this journey never to cease? And Jethro, once in his life, looked
      nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;er&mdash;Cyn'thy'll go, Steve&mdash;Cynthy'll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Cynthy'll go,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Merrill, &ldquo;and you'll go, and Ephraim'll
      go.&rdquo; Although he by no means liked everybody, as would appear at first
      glance, Mr. Merrill had a way of calling people by their first names when
      he did fancy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Steve,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;what would your wife say if I was to drink
      coffee out of my saucer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's see,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill grave for once. &ldquo;What's the punishment for
      that in my house? I know what she'd do if you didn't drink it. What do you
      think she'd do, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him what was the matter with it,&rdquo; said Cynthia, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cynthy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I know why these old fellows take you round with
      'em. To take care of 'em, eh? They're not fit to travel alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it was settled, after much further argument, that they were all to
      sup at Mr. Merrill's house, Cynthia stoutly maintaining that she would not
      desert them. And then Mr. Merrill, having several times repeated the
      street and number, went, back to his office. There was much mysterious
      whispering between Ephraim and Jethro in the hotel parlor after dinner,
      while Cynthia was turning over the leaves of a magazine, and then Ephraim
      proposed going out to see the sights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Uncle Jethro going?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll meet us,&rdquo; said Ephraim, promptly, but his voice was not quite
      steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Uncle Jethro!&rdquo; cried Cynthia, &ldquo;you're trying to get out of it. You
      remember you promised to meet us in Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Guess he'll keep this app'intment,&rdquo; said Ephraim, who seemed to be full
of a strange mirth that bubbled over, for he actually winked at Jethro.
 went first to Faneuil Hall. Presently they found themselves among the
crowd in Washington Street, where Ephraim confessed the trepidation
which he felt over the coming supper party: a trepidation greater, so
he declared many times, than he had ever experienced before any of his
battles in the war. He stopped once or twice in the eddy of the crowd to
glance up at the numbers; and finally came to a halt before the windows
of a large dry-goods store.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I ought to buy a new shirt for this occasion, Cynthy,&rdquo; he said,
      staring hard at the articles of apparel displayed there: &ldquo;Let's go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia laughed outright, since Ephraim could not by any chance have worn
      any of the articles in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cousin Ephraim,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you can't buy gentlemen's things
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I guess you can,&rdquo; said Ephraim, and hobbled confidently in at the
      doorway. There we will leave him for a while conversing in an undertone
      with a floor-walker, and follow Jethro. He, curiously enough, had some
      fifteen minutes before gone in at the same doorway, questioned the same
      floor-walker, and he found himself in due time walking amongst a
      bewildering lot of models on the third floor, followed by a giggling
      saleswoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a dress do you want, sir?&rdquo; asked the saleslady,&mdash;for we
      are impelled to call her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-silk cloth,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shades of silk would you like, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shades? shades? What do you mean by shades?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, colors,&rdquo; said the saleslady, giggling openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Green,&rdquo; said Jethro, with considerable emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saleslady clapped her hand over her mouth and led the way to another
      model.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't call that green&mdash;do you? That's not green enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They inspected another dress, and then another and another,&mdash;not all
      of them were green,&mdash;Jethro expressing very decided if not expert
      views on each of them. At last he paused before two models at the far end
      of the room, passing his hand repeatedly over each as he had done so often
      with the cattle of Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These two pieces same kind of goods?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er-this one is a little shinier than that one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the finish is a little higher,&rdquo; ventured the saleslady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh-shinier,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, shinier, if you please to call it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what would you call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the saleslady had become quite hysterical, and altogether
      incapable of performing her duties. Jethro looked at her for a moment in
      disgust, and in his predicament cast around for another to wait on him.
      There was no lack of these, at a safe distance, but they all seemed to be
      affected by the same mania. Jethro's eye alighted upon the back of another
      customer. She was, apparently, a respectable-looking lady of uncertain
      age, and her own attention was so firmly fixed in the contemplation of a
      model that she had not remarked the merriment about her, nor its cause.
      She did not see Jethro, either, as he strode across to her. Indeed, her
      first intimation of his presence was a dig in her arm. The lady turned,
      gave a gasp of amazement at the figure confronting her, and proceeded to
      annihilate it with an eye that few women possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-how do, Ma'am,&rdquo; he said. Had he known anything about the appearance of
      women in general, he might have realized that he had struck a tartar. This
      lady was at least sixty-five, and probably unmarried. Her face, though not
      at all unpleasant, was a study in character-development: she wore
      ringlets, a peculiar bonnet of a bygone age, and her clothes had certain
      eccentricities which, for, lack of knowledge, must be omitted. In short,
      the lady was no fool, and not being one she glanced at the giggling group
      of saleswomen and&mdash;wonderful to relate&mdash;they stopped giggling.
      Then she looked again at Jethro and gave him a smile. One of superiority,
      no doubt, but still a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-trying to buy a silk cloth gown for a woman. There's two over here I
      fancied a little. Er&mdash;thought perhaps you'd help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the dresses?&rdquo; she demanded abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro led the way in silence until they came to the models. She planted
      herself in front of them and looked them over swiftly but critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the age of the lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what difference does that make?&rdquo; said Jethro, whose instinct was
      against committing himself to strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difference!&rdquo; she exclaimed sharply, &ldquo;it makes a considerable difference.
      Perhaps not to you, but to the lady. What coloring is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-coloring? She's white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion turned her back on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What size is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-about that size,&rdquo; said Jethro, pointing to a model.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About! about!&rdquo; she ejaculated, and then she faced him. &ldquo;Now look here, my
      friend,&rdquo; she said vigorously, &ldquo;there's something very mysterious about all
      this. You look like a good man, but you may be a very wicked one for all I
      know. I've lived long enough to discover that appearances, especially
      where your sex is concerned, are deceitful. Unless you are willing to tell
      me who this lady is for whom you are buying silk dresses, and what your
      relationship is to her, I shall leave you. And mind, no evasions. I can
      detect the truth pretty well when I hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unexpected as it was, Jethro gave back a step or two before this onslaught
      of feminine virtue, and the movement did not tend to raise him in the
      lady's esteem. He felt that he would rather face General Grant a thousand
      times than this person. She was, indeed, preparing to sweep away when
      there came a familiar tap-tap behind them on the bare floor, and he turned
      to behold Ephraim hobbling toward them with the aid of his green umbrella,
      Cynthia by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; cried Cynthia, looking at him and the lady in
      astonishment, and then with equal astonishment at the models. &ldquo;What in the
      world are you doing here?&rdquo; Then a light seemed to dawn on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You frauds! So this is what you were whispering about! This is the way
      Cousin Ephraim buys his shirts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-Cynthy,&rdquo; said Jethro, apologetically, &ldquo;d-don't you think you ought to
      have a nice city dress for that supper party?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're ashamed of my country clothes, are you?&rdquo; she asked gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-want you to have the best, Cynthy,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I-I-meant to have it
      all chose and bought when you come, but I got into a kind of argument with
      this lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Argument!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady. But she did not seem displeased. She had
      been staring very fixedly at Cynthia. &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she continued kindly,
      &ldquo;you look like some one I used to know a long, long time ago, and I'll be
      glad to help you. Your uncle may be sensible enough in other matters, but
      I tell him frankly he is out of place here. Let him go away and sit down
      somewhere with the other gentleman, and we'll get the dress between us, if
      he'll tell us how much to pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P-pay anything, so's you get it,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro, do you really want it so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It must not be thought that Cynthia did not wish for a dress, too. But the
      sense of dependence on Jethro and the fear of straining his purse never
      quite wore off. So Jethro and Ephraim took to a bench at some distance,
      and at last a dress was chosen&mdash;not one of the gorgeous models Jethro
      had picked out, but a pretty, simple, girlish gown which Cynthia herself
      had liked and of which the lady highly approved. Not content with helping
      to choose it, the lady must satisfy herself that it fit, which it did
      perfectly. And so Cynthia was transformed into a city person, though her
      skin glowed with a health with which few city people are blessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said the lady, still staring at her, &ldquo;you look very well. I
      should scarcely have supposed it.&rdquo; Cynthia took the remark in good part,
      for she thought the lady a character, which she was. &ldquo;I hope you will
      remember that we women were created for a higher purpose than mere beauty.
      The Lord gave us brains, and meant that we should use them. If you have a
      good mind, as I believe you have, learn to employ it for the betterment of
      your sex, for the time of our emancipation is at hand.&rdquo; Having delivered
      this little lecture, the lady continued to stare at her with keen eyes.
      &ldquo;You look very much like someone I used to love when I was younger. What
      is your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia Wetherell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia Wetherell? Was your mother Cynthia Ware, from Coniston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the strange lady had risen and had taken Cynthia in her
      embrace, new dress and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I thought your face had a familiar look. It was your
      mother I knew and loved. I'm Miss Lucretia Penniman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia Penniman! Could this be, indeed, the authoress of the &ldquo;Hymn
      to Coniston,&rdquo; of whom Brampton was so proud? The Miss Lucretia Penniman
      who sounded the first clarion note for the independence of American women,
      the friend of Bryant and Hawthorne and Longfellow? Cynthia had indeed
      heard of her. Did not all Brampton point to the house which had held the
      Social Library as to a shrine?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, &ldquo;I have a meeting now of a girls' charity
      to which I must go, but you will come to me at the offices of the Woman's
      Hour to-morrow morning at ten. I wish to talk to you about your mother and
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia promised, provided they did not leave for Coniston earlier, and in
      that event agreed to write. Whereupon Miss Lucretia kissed her again and
      hurried off to her meeting. On the way back to the Tremont House Cynthia
      related excitedly the whole circumstance to Jethro and Ephraim. Ephraim
      had heard of Miss Lucretia, of course. Who had not? But he did not read
      the Woman's Hour. Jethro was silent. Perhaps he was thinking of that fresh
      summer morning, so long ago, when a girl in a gig had overtaken him in the
      canon made by the Brampton road through the woods. The girl had worn a
      poke bonnet, and was returning a book to this same Miss Lucretia
      Penniman's Social Library. And the book was the &ldquo;Life of Napoleon
      Bonaparte.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro, shall we still be in Boston to-morrow morning?&rdquo; Cynthia
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused himself. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;When are you going home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer this simple question, but countered. &ldquo;Hain't you
      enjoyin' yourself, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; she declared. But she thought it strange that he would
      not tell her when they would be in Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim did buy a new shirt, and also (in view of the postmastership in
      his packet) a new necktie, his old one being slightly frayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grandeur of the approaching supper party and the fear of Mrs. Merrill
      hung very heavy over him; nor was Jethro's mind completely at rest.
      Ephraim even went so far as to discuss the question as to whether Mr.
      Merrill had not surpassed his authority in inviting him, and full expected
      to be met at the door by that gentleman uttering profuse apologies, which
      Ephraim was quite prepared and willing to take in good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing of the kind happened, however. Mr. Merrill's railroad being a
      modest one, his house was modest likewise. But Ephraim thought it grand
      enough, and yet acknowledged a homelike quality in its grandeur. He began
      by sitting on the edge of the sofa and staring at the cut-glass
      chandelier, but in five minutes he discovered with a shock of surprise
      that he was actually leaning back, describing in detail how his regiment
      had been cheered as they marched through Boston. And incredible as it may
      seem, the person whom he was entertaining in this manner was Mrs. Stephen
      Merrill herself. Mrs. Merrill was as tall as Mr. Merrill was short. She
      wore a black satin dress with a big cameo brooch pinned at her throat, her
      hair was gray, and her face almost masculine until it lighted up with a
      wonderfully sweet smile. That smile made Ephraim and Jethro feel at home;
      and Cynthia, too, who liked Mrs. Merrill the moment she laid eyes on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there were the daughters, Jane and Susan, who welcomed her with a
      hospitality truly amazing for city people. Jane was big-boned like her
      mother, but Susan was short and plump and merry like her father. Susan
      talked and laughed, and Jane sat and listened and smiled, and Cynthia
      could not decide which she liked the best. And presently they all went
      into the dining room to supper, where there was another chandelier over
      the table. There was also real silver, which shone brilliantly on the
      white cloth&mdash;but there was nothing to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell us another story, Mr. Prescott,&rdquo; said Susan, who had listened to
      his last one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of the table, however, had for the moment upset Ephraim, &ldquo;Get
      Jethro to tell you how he took dinner with Jedge Binney,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion, under the circumstances, might not have been a happy one,
      but its lack of appropriateness did not strike Jethro either. He yielded
      to the demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I supposed I was goin' to set down same as I would at
      home, where we put the vittles on the table. W-wondered what I was goin'
      to eat&mdash;wahn't nothin' but a piece of bread on the table. S-sat there
      and watched 'em&mdash;nobody ate anything. Presently I found out that
      Binney's wife ran her house same as they run hotels. Pretty soon a couple
      of girls come in and put down some food and took it away again before you
      had a chance. A-after a while we had coffee, and when I set my cup on the
      table, I noticed Mis' Binney looked kind of cross and began whisperin' to
      the girls. One of 'em fetched a small plate and took my cup and set it on
      the plate. That was all right. I used the plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, along about next summer Binney had to come to Coniston to see me on
      a little matter and fetched his wife. Listy, my wife, was alive then. I'd
      made up my mind that if I could ever get Mis' Binney to eat at my place I
      would, so I asked 'em to stay to dinner. When we set down, I said: 'Now,
      Mis' Binney, you and the Judge take right hold, and anything you can't
      reach, speak out and we'll wait on you.' And Mis' Binney?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She was a little mite scared, I guess. B-begun to
      suspect somethin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mis' Binney,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;y-you can set your cup and sarcer where you've a
      mind to.' O-ought to have heard the Judge laugh. Says he to his wife:
      'Fanny, I told you Jethro'd get even with you some time for that sarcer
      business.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This story, strange as it may seem, had a great success at Mr. Merrill's
      table. Mr. Merrill and his daughter Susan shrieked with laughter when it
      was finished, while Mrs. Merrill and Jane enjoyed themselves quite as much
      in their quiet way. Even the two neat Irish maids, who were serving the
      supper very much as poor Mis' Binney's had been served, were fain to leave
      the dining room abruptly, and one of them disgraced herself at sight of
      Jethro when she came in again, and had to go out once mare. Mrs. Merrill
      insisted that Jethro should pour out his coffee in what she was pleased to
      call the old-fashioned way. All of which goes to prove that table-silver
      and cut glass chandeliers do not invariably make their owners heartless
      and inhospitable. And Ephraim, whose plan of campaign had been to eat
      nothing to speak of and have a meal when he got back to the hotel, found
      that he wasn't hungry when he arose from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much bantering of Jethro by Mr. Merrill, which the ladies did
      not understand&mdash;talk of a mighty coalition of the big railroads which
      was to swallow up the little railroads. Fortunately, said Mr. Merrill,
      humorously, fortunately they did not want his railroad. Or unfortunately,
      which was it? Jethro didn't know. He never laughed at anybody's jokes. But
      Cynthia, who was listening with one ear while Susan talked into the other,
      gathered that Jethro had been struggling with the railroads, and was
      sooner or later to engage in a mightier struggle with them. How, she asked
      herself in her innocence, was any one, even Uncle Jethro, to struggle with
      a railroad? Many other people in these latter days have asked themselves
      that very question.
    </p>
    <p>
      All together the evening at Mr. Merrill's passed off so quickly and so
      happily that Ephraim was dismayed when he discovered that it was ten
      o'clock, and he began to make elaborate apologies to the ladies. But
      Jethro and Mr. Merrill were still closeted together in the dining room:
      once Mrs. Merrill had been called to that conference, and had returned
      after a while to take her place quietly again among the circle of
      Ephraim's listeners. Now Mr. Merrill came out of the dining room alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he said, and his tone was a little more grave than usual, &ldquo;your
      Uncle Jethro wants to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia rose, with a sense of something in the air which concerned her,
      and went into the dining room. Was it the light falling from above that
      brought out the lines of his face so strongly? Cynthia did not know, but
      she crossed the room swiftly and sat down beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Uncle Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-Cynthy,&rdquo; he said, putting his hand over hers on the table, &ldquo;I want you
      to do something for me er&mdash;for me,&rdquo; he repeated, emphasizing the last
      word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do anything in the world for you, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;you
      know that. What&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L-like Mr. Merrill, don't you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;L-like Mrs. Merrill&mdash;like the gals&mdash;don't you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Very much,&rdquo;
       said Cynthia, perplexedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like 'em enough to&mdash;to live with 'em a winter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Live with them a winter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-Cynthy, I want you should stay in Boston this winter and go to a young
      ladies' school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was out. He had said it, though he never quite knew where he had found
      the courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro!&rdquo; she cried. She could only look at him in dismay, but the
      tears came into her eyes and sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you'll be happy here, Cynthy. It'll be a change for you. And I
      shan't be so lonesome as you'd think. I'll&mdash;I'll be busy this winter,
      Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I wouldn't leave you, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said
      reproachfully. &ldquo;I should be lonesome, if you wouldn't. You would be
      lonesome&mdash;you know you would be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll do this for me, Cynthy. S-said you would, didn't you&mdash;said
      you would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want me to do this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-want you to go to school for a winter, Cynthy. Shouldn't think I'd done
      right by you if I didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have been to school. Daddy taught me a lot, and Mr. Satterlee has
      taught me a great deal more. I know as much as most girls of my age, and I
      will study so hard in Coniston this winter, if that is what you want. I've
      never neglected my lessons, Uncle Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tain't book-larnin'&mdash;'tain't what you'd get in book larnin' in
      Boston, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;they'd teach you to be a lady, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father come of good people, and&mdash;and your mother was a lady.
      I'm only a rough old man, Cynthy, and I don't know much about the ways of
      fine folks. But you've got it in ye, and I want you should be equal to the
      best of 'em: You can. And I shouldn't die content unless I'd felt that
      you'd had the chance. Er&mdash;Cynthy&mdash;will you do it for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a long while before she turned to him, and then the tears
      were running very swiftly down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will do it for you,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Uncle Jethro, I believe you
      are the best man, in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't say that, Cynthy&mdash;d-don't say that,&rdquo; he exclaimed, and a
      sharp agony was in his voice. He got to his feet and went to the folding
      doors and opened them. &ldquo;Steve!&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;Steve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-says she'll stay, Steve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill had come in, followed by his wife. Cynthia saw them but dimly
      through her tears. And while she tried to wipe the tears away she felt
      Mrs. Merrill's arm about her, and heard that lady say:&mdash;&ldquo;We'll try to
      make you very happy, my dear, and send you back safely in the spring.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      An attempt will be made in these pages to set down such incidents which
      alone may be vital to this chronicle, now so swiftly running on. The
      reasons why Mr. Merrill was willing to take Cynthia into his house must
      certainly be clear to the reader. In the first place, he was under very
      heavy obligations to Jethro Bass for many favors; in the second place, Mr.
      Merrill had a real affection for Jethro, which, strange as it may seem to
      some, was quite possible; and in the third place, Mr. Merrill had taken a
      fancy to Cynthia, and he had never forgotten the unintentional wrong he
      had done William Wetherell. Mr. Merrill was a man of impulses, and
      generally of good impulses. Had he not himself urged upon Jethro the
      arrangement, it would never have come about. Lastly, he had invited
      Cynthia to his house that his wife might inspect her, and Mrs. Merrill's
      verdict had been instant and favorable&mdash;a verdict not given in words.
      A single glance was sufficient, for these good people so understood each
      other that Mrs. Merrill had only to raise her eyes to her husband's, and
      this she did shortly after the supper party began; while she was pouring
      the coffee, to be exact. Thus the compact that Cynthia was to spend the
      winter in their house was ratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, first of all, the parting with Jethro and the messages with
      which he and Ephraim were laden for the whole village and town of
      Coniston. It was very hard, that parting, and need not be dwelt upon.
      Ephraim waved his blue handkerchief as the train pulled out, but Jethro
      stood on the platform, silent and motionless: more eloquent in his sorrow&mdash;so
      Mr. Merrill thought&mdash;than any human being he had ever known. Mr.
      Merrill wondered if Jethro's sorrow were caused by this parting alone; he
      believed it was not, and suddenly guessed at the true note of it. Having
      come by chance upon the answer to the riddle, Mr. Merrill stood still with
      his hand on the carriage door and marvelled that he had not seen it all
      sooner. He was a man to take to heart the troubles of his friends. A
      subtle change had indeed come over Jethro, and he was not the same man Mr.
      Merrill had known for many years. Would others, the men with whom Jethro
      contended and the men he commanded, mark this change? And what effect
      would it have on the conflict for the mastery of a state which was to be
      waged from now on?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said his daughter Susan, &ldquo;if you don't get in and close the
      door, we'll drive off and leave you standing on the sidewalk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Cynthia went to her new friends in their own carriage. Mrs. Merrill
      was goodness itself, and loved the girl for what she was. How, indeed, was
      she to help loving her? Cynthia was scrupulous in her efforts to give no
      trouble, and yet she never had the air of a dependent or a beneficiary;
      but held her head high, and when called upon gave an opinion as though she
      had a right to it. The very first morning Susan, who was prone to be late
      to breakfast, came down in a great state of excitement and laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think Cynthia's done, Mother?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I went into her
      room a while ago, and it was all swept and aired, and she was making up
      the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's an excellent plan,&rdquo; said Mrs. Merrill, &ldquo;tomorrow morning you three
      girls will have a race to see who makes up her room first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is needless to say that the race at bed-making never came off, Susan
      and Jane having pushed Cynthia into a corner as soon as breakfast was
      over, and made certain forcible representations which she felt bound to
      respect, and a treaty was drawn up and faithfully carried out, between the
      three, that she was to do her own room if necessary to her happiness. The
      chief gainer by the arrangement was the chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Odd as it may seem, the Misses Merrill lived amicably enough with Cynthia.
      It is a difficult matter to force an account of the relationship of five
      people living in one house into a few pages, but the fact that the
      Merrills had large hearts makes this simpler. There are few families who
      can accept with ease the introduction of a stranger into their midst, even
      for a time, and there are fewer strangers who can with impunity be
      introduced. The sisters quarrelled among themselves as all sisters will,
      and sometimes quarrelled with Cynthia. But oftener they made her the
      arbiter of their disputes, and asked her advice on certain matters.
      Especially was this true of Susan, whom certain young gentlemen from
      Harvard College called upon more or less frequently, and Cynthia had all
      of Susan's love affairs&mdash;including the current one&mdash;by heart in
      a very short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Cynthia, there were many subjects on which she had to take the
      advice of the sisters. They did not criticise the joint creations of
      herself and Miss Sukey Kittredge as frankly as Janet Duncan had done; but
      Jethro had left in Mrs. Merrill's hands a certain sufficient sum for new
      dresses for Cynthia, and in due time the dresses were got and worn. To do
      them justice, the sisters were really sincere in their rejoicings over the
      very wonderful transformation which they had been chiefly instrumental in
      effecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a difficult task to praise a heroine, and one that should be
      indulged in but charily. But let some little indulgence be accorded this
      particular heroine by reason of the life she had led, and the situation in
      which she now found herself: a poor Coniston girl, dependent on one who
      was not her father, though she loved him as a father; beholden to these
      good people who dwelt in a world into which she had no reasonable
      expectations of entering, and which, to tell the truth, she now feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was inevitable that Cynthia should be brought into contact with many
      friends and relations of the family. Some of these noticed and admired
      her; others did neither; others gossiped about Mrs. Merrill behind her
      back at her own dinners and sewing circles and wondered what folly could
      have induced her to bring the girl into her house. But Mrs. Merrill, like
      many generous people who do not stop to calculate a kindness, was always
      severely criticised.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there were Jane's and Susan's friends, in and out of Miss
      Sadler's school. For Mrs. Merrill's influence had been sufficient to
      induce Miss Sadler to take Cynthia as a day scholar with her own
      daughters. This, be it known, was a great concession on the part of Miss
      Sadler, who regarded Cynthia's credentials as dubious enough; and her
      young ladies were inclined to regard them so, likewise. Some of these
      young ladies came from other cities,&mdash;New York and Philadelphia and
      elsewhere,&mdash;and their fathers and mothers were usually people to be
      mentioned as a matter of course&mdash;were, indeed, frequently so
      mentioned by Miss Sadler, especially when a visitor called at the school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isabel, I saw that your mother sailed for Europe yesterday,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Sally,
      your father tells me he is building a gallery for his collection.&rdquo; Then to
      the visitor, &ldquo;You know the Broke house in Washington Square, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course the visitor did. But Sally or Isabel would often imitate Miss
      Sadler behind her back, showing how well they understood her snobbishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sadler was by no means the type which we have come to recognize in
      the cartoons as the Boston school ma'am. She was a little, round person
      with thin lips and a sharp nose all out of character with her roundness,
      and bright eyes like a bird's. To do her justice, so far as instruction
      went, her scholars were equally well cared for, whether they hailed from
      Washington Square or Washington Court House. There were, indeed, none from
      such rural sorts of places&mdash;except Cynthia. But Miss Sadler did not
      take her hand on the opening day&mdash;or afterward&mdash;and ask her
      about Uncle Jethro. Oh, no. Miss Sadler had no interest for great men who
      did not sail for Europe or add picture galleries on to their houses.
      Cynthia laughed, a little bitterly, perhaps, at the thought of a picture
      gallery being added to the tannery house. And she told herself stoutly
      that Uncle Jethro was a greater man than any of the others, even if Miss
      Sadler did not see fit to mention him. So she had her first taste of a
      kind of wormwood that is very common in the world though it did not grow
      in Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while after Cynthia's introduction to the school she was calmly
      ignored by many of the young ladies there, and once openly&mdash;snubbed,
      to use the word in its most disagreeable sense. Not that she gave any of
      them any real cause to snub her. She did not intrude her own affairs upon
      them, but she was used to conversing kindly with the people about her as
      equals, and for this offence; on the third day, Miss Sally Broke snubbed
      her. It is hard not to make a heroine of Cynthia, not to be able to relate
      that she instantly put Miss Sally's nose out of joint. Susan Merrill tried
      to do that, and failed signally, for Miss Sally's nose was not easily
      dislodged. Susan fought more than one of Cynthia's battles. As a matter of
      fact, Cynthia did not know that she had been affronted until that evening.
      She did not tell her friends how she spent the night yearning fiercely for
      Coniston and Uncle Jethro, at times weeping for them, if the truth be
      told; how she had risen before the dawn to write a letter, and to lay some
      things in the rawhide trunk. The letter was never sent, and the packing
      never finished. Uncle Jethro wished her to stay and to learn to be a lady,
      and stay she would, in spite of Miss Broke and the rest of them. She went
      to school the next day, and for many days and weeks thereafter, and held
      communion with the few alone who chose to treat her pleasantly.
      Unquestionably this is making a heroine of Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      If young men are cruel in their schools, what shall be written of young
      women? It would be better to say that both are thoughtless. Miss Sally
      Broke, strange as it may seem, had a heart, and many of the other young
      ladies whose fathers sailed for Europe and owned picture galleries; but
      these young ladies were absorbed, especially after vacation, in affairs of
      which a girl from Coniston had no part. Their friends were not her
      friends, their amusements not her amusements, and their talk not her talk.
      But Cynthia watched them, as was her duty, and gradually absorbed many
      things which are useful if not essential&mdash;outward observances of
      which the world takes cognizance, and which she had been sent there by
      Uncle Jethro to learn. Young people of Cynthia's type and nationality are
      the most adaptable in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the December snows set in Cynthia had made one firm friend, at
      least, in Boston; outside of the Merrill family. That friend was Miss
      Lucretia Penniman, editress of the Woman's Hour. Miss Lucretia lived in
      the queerest and quaintest of the little houses tucked away under the
      hill, with the back door a story higher than the fronts an arrangement
      which in summer enabled the mistress to walk out of her sitting-room
      windows into a little walled garden. In winter that sitting room was the
      sunniest, cosiest room in the city, and Cynthia spent many hours there,
      reading or listening to the wisdom that fell from the lips of Miss
      Lucretia or her guests. The sitting room had uneven, yellow-white
      panelling that fairly shone with enamel, mahogany bookcases filled with
      authors who had chosen to comply with Miss Lucretia's somewhat rigorous
      censorship; there was a table laden with such magazines as had to do with
      the uplifting of a sex, a delightful wavy floor covered with a rose
      carpet; and, needless to add, not a pin or a pair of scissors out of place
      in the whole apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no intention of enriching these pages with Miss Lucretia's
      homilies. Their subject-matter may be found in the files of the Woman's
      Hour. She did not always preach, although many people will not believe
      this statement. Miss Lucretia, too, had a heart, though she kept it hidden
      away, only to be brought out on occasions when she was sure of its
      appreciation, and she grew strangely interested in this self-contained
      girl from Coniston whose mother she had known. Miss Lucretia understood
      Cynthia, who also was the kind who kept her heart hidden, the kind who
      conceal their troubles and sufferings because they find it difficult to
      give them out. So Miss Lucretia had Cynthia to take supper with her at
      least once in the week, and watched her quietly, and let her speak of as
      much of her life as she chose&mdash;which was not much, at first. But Miss
      Lucretia was content to wait, and guessed at many things which Cynthia did
      not tell her, and made some personal effort, unknown to Cynthia, to find
      out other things. It will be said that she had designs on the girl. If so,
      they were generous designs; and perhaps it was inevitable that Miss
      Lucretia should recognize in every young woman of spirit and brains a
      possible recruit for the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has now been shown in some manner and as briefly as possible how
      Cynthia's life had changed, and what it had become. We have got her partly
      through the winter, and find her still dreaming of the sparkling snow on
      Coniston and of the wind whirling it on clear, cold days like smoke among
      the spruces; of Uncle Jethro sitting by his stove through the long
      evenings all alone; of Rias in his store and Moses Hatch and Lem
      Hallowell, and Cousin Ephraim in his new post-office. Uncle Jethro wrote
      for the first time in his life&mdash;letters: short letters, but in his
      own handwriting, and deserving of being read for curiosity's sake if there
      were time. The wording was queer enough and guarded enough, but they were
      charged with a great affection which clung to them like lavender.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cynthia kept them every one, and read them over on such occasions when
      she felt that she could not live another minute out of sight of her
      mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of affairs one gray afternoon in December when Cynthia,
      who was sitting in Mrs. Merrill's parlor, suddenly looked up from her book
      to discover that two young men were in the room. The young men were
      apparently quite as much surprised as she, and the parlor maid stood
      grinning behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Miss Susan and Miss Jane, Ellen,&rdquo; said Cynthia, preparing to depart.
      One of the young men she recognized from a photograph on Susan's bureau.
      He was, for the time being, Susan's. His name, although it does not matter
      much, was Morton Browne, and he would have been considerably astonished if
      he had guessed how much of his history Cynthia knew. It was Mr. Browne's
      habit to take Susan for a walk as often as propriety permitted, and on
      such occasions he generally brought along a good-natured classmate to take
      care of Jane. This, apparently, was one of the occasions. Mr. Browne was
      tall and dark and generally good-looking, while his friends were usually
      distinguished for their good nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Browne stood between her and the door and looked at her rather
      fixedly. Then he said:&mdash;&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A great many friendships, and even love affairs, have been inaugurated by
      just such an opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Cynthia, and tried to pass out. But Mr. Browne had no
      intention of allowing her to do so if he could help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I am not intruding,&rdquo; he said politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, wondering how she could get by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you waiting for Miss Merrill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Cynthia again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other young man turned his back and became absorbed in the picture of
      a lion getting ready to tear a lady to pieces. But Mr. Browne was of that
      mettle which is not easily baffled in such matters. He introduced himself,
      and desired to know whom he had the honor of addressing. Cynthia could not
      but enlighten him. Mr. Browne was greatly astonished, and showed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are the mysterious young lady who has been staying here in the
      house this winter,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as though it were a marvellous thing. &ldquo;I
      have heard Miss Merrill speak of you. She admires you very much. Is it
      true that you come from&mdash;Coniston?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see&mdash;where is Coniston?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Browne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where Brampton is?&rdquo; asked Cynthia. &ldquo;Coniston is near
      Brampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brampton!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Browne, &ldquo;I have a classmate who comes from
      Brampton&mdash;Bob Worthington&mdash;You must know Bob, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Cynthia knew Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His father's got a mint of money, they say. I've been told that old
      Worthington was the whole show up in those parts. Is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not quite! Mr. Morton Browne eyed her in surprise, and from that moment
      she began to have decided possibilities. Just then Jane and Susan entered
      arrayed for the walk, but Mr. Browne showed himself in no hurry to depart:
      began to speak, indeed, in a deprecating way about the weather, appealed
      to his friend, Mr. King, if it didn't look remarkably like rain, or hail,
      or snow. Susan sat down, Jane sat down, Mr. Browne and his friend prepared
      to sit down when Cynthia moved toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not going, Cynthia!&rdquo; cried Susan, in a voice that may have had a
      little too much eagerness in it. &ldquo;You must stay and help us entertain Mr.
      Browne.&rdquo; (Mr. King, apparently, was not to be entertained.) &ldquo;We've tried
      so hard to make her come down when people called, Mr. Browne, but she
      never would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was not skilled in the art of making excuses. She hesitated for
      one, and was lost. So she sat down, as far from Mr. Browne as possible,
      next to Jane. In a few minutes Mr. Browne was seated beside her, and how
      he accomplished this manoeuvre Cynthia could not have said, so skilfully
      and gradually was it done. For lack of a better subject he chose Mr.
      Robert Worthington. Related, for Cynthia's delectation, several of Bob's
      escapades in his freshman year: silly escapades enough, but very bold and
      daring and original they sounded to Cynthia, who listened (if Mr. Browne
      could have known it) with almost breathless interest, and forgot all about
      poor Susan talking to Mr. King. Did Mr. Worthington still while away his
      evenings stealing barber poles and being chased around Cambridge by irate
      policemen? Mr. Browne laughed at the notion. O dear, no! seniors never
      descended to that. Had not Miss Wetherell heard the song wherein seniors
      were designated as grave and reverend? Yes, Miss Wetherell had heard the
      song. She did not say where, or how. Mr. Worthington, said his classmate,
      had become very serious-minded this year. Was captain of the base-ball
      team and already looking toward the study of law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Study law!&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia, &ldquo;I thought he would go into his father's
      mills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Bob very well?&rdquo; asked Mr. Browne.
    </p>
    <p>
      She admitted that she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's been away from Brampton a good deal, of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Browne,
      who seemed pleased by her admission. To do him justice, he would not
      undermine a classmate, although he had other rules of conduct which might
      eventually require a little straightening out. &ldquo;Worthy's a first-rate
      fellow, a little quick-tempered, perhaps, and inclined to go his own way.
      He's got a good mind, and he's taken to using it lately. He has come
      pretty near being suspended once or twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia wanted to ask what &ldquo;suspended&rdquo; was. It sounded rather painful. But
      at this instant there was the rattle of a latch key at the door, and Mr.
      Merrill walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, spying Cynthia, &ldquo;so you have got Cynthia to come
      down and entertain the young men at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;we have got Cynthia to come down at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Susan did not go to Cynthia's room that night to chat, as usual, and Mr.
      Morton Browne's photograph was mysteriously removed from the prominent
      position it had occupied. If Susan had carried out a plan which she
      conceived in a moment of folly of placing that photograph on Cynthia's
      bureau, there would undoubtedly have been a quarrel. Cynthia's own
      feelings&mdash;seeing that Mr. Browne had not dazzled her&mdash;were not&mdash;enviable.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she held her peace, which indeed was all she could do, and the next
      time Mr. Browne called, though he took care to mention her name
      particularly at the door, she would not go down to entertain him: though
      Susan implored and Jane appealed, she would not go down. Mr. Browne called
      several times again, with the same result. Cynthia was inexorable&mdash;she
      would have none of him. Then Susan forgave her. There was no quarrel,
      indeed, but there was a reconciliation, which is the best part of a
      quarrel. There were tears, of Susan's shedding; there was a
      character-sketch of Mr. Browne, of Susan's drawing, and that gentleman
      flitted lightly out of Susan's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ten days subsequent to this reconciliation Ellen, the parlor maid,
      brought up a card to Cynthia's room. The card bore the name of Mr. Robert
      Worthington. Cynthia stared at it, and bent it in her fingers, while Ellen
      explained how the gentleman had begged that she might see him. To tell the
      truth, Cynthia had wondered more than once why he had not come before, and
      smiled when she thought of all the assurances of undying devotion she had
      heard in Washington. After all, she reflected, why should she not see him&mdash;once?
      He might give her news of Brampton and Coniston. Thus willingly deceiving
      herself, she told Ellen that she would go down: much to the girl's
      delight, for Cynthia was a favorite in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she entered the parlor Mr. Worthington was standing in the window. When
      he turned and saw her he started to come forward in his old impetuous way,
      and stopped and looked at her in surprise. She herself did not grasp the
      reason for this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be possible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can it be possible that this is my friend
      from the country?&rdquo; And he took her hand with the greatest formality,
      pressed it the least little bit, and released it. &ldquo;How do you do, Miss
      Wetherell? Do you remember me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do&mdash;Bob,&rdquo; she answered, laughing in spite of herself at
      his banter. &ldquo;You haven't changed, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Mr. Worthington in Washington,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Now it is 'Bob' and
      'Miss Wetherell.' Rank patronage! How did you do it, Cynthia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are like all men,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;you look at the clothes, and not
      the woman. They are not very fine clothes; but if they were much finer,
      they wouldn't change me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must be Miss Sadler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Sadler would willingly change me&mdash;if she could,&rdquo; said Cynthia,
      a little bitterly. &ldquo;How did you find out I was at Miss Sadler's?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morton Browne told me yesterday,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;I felt like punching his
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he tell you?&rdquo; she asked with some concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that you were here, visiting the Merrills, among other things,
      and said that you knew me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;other things&rdquo; Mr. Browne had said were interesting, but flippant. He
      had seen Bob at a college club and declared that he had met a witch of a
      country girl at the Merrills. He couldn't make her out, because she had
      refused to see him every time he called again. He had also repeated
      Cynthia's remark about Bob's father not being quite the biggest man in his
      part of the country, and ventured the surmise that she was the daughter of
      a rival mill owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you let me know you were in Boston?&rdquo; said Bob, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; asked Cynthia, and she could not resist adding, &ldquo;Didn't
      you find it out when you went to Brampton&mdash;to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, getting fiery red, &ldquo;the fact is&mdash;I didn't go to
      Brampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you were sensible enough to take my advice, though I suppose
      that didn't make any difference. But&mdash;from the way you spoke, I
      should have thought nothing could have kept you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I'd promised to visit a fellow named
      Broke in my class, who lives in New York. And I couldn't get out of it.
      His sister, by the way, is in Miss Sadler's. I suppose you know her. But
      if I'd thought you'd see me, I should have gone to Brampton, anyway. You
      were so down on me in Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very good of you to take the trouble to come to see me here. There
      must be a great many girls in Boston you have to visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught the little note of coolness in her voice. Cynthia was asking
      herself whether, if Mr. Browne had not seen fit to give a good report of
      her, he would have come at all. He would have come, certainly. It is to be
      hoped that Bob Worthington's attitude up to this time toward Cynthia has
      been sufficiently defined by his conversation and actions. There had been
      nothing serious about it. But there can be no question that Mr. Browne's
      openly expressed admiration had enhanced her value in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no girl in Boston that I care a rap for,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm relieved to hear it,&rdquo; said Cynthia, with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you expect me to be, when you said it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've learned more than one thing since you've been in the city,&rdquo; he
      remarked, &ldquo;I suppose there are a good many fellows who come here all the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there are,&rdquo; she said demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;you've changed a lot in three months. I always
      thought that, if you had a chance, there'd be no telling where you'd end
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't sound very complimentary,&rdquo; said Cynthia. She had, indeed,
      changed. &ldquo;In what terrible place do you think I'll end up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you'll marry one of these Boston men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;that wouldn't be so terrible, would it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you're engaged to one of 'em now,&rdquo; he remarked, looking very
      hard at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you believed that, I don't think you would say it,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't make you out. You used to be so frank with me, and now you're not
      at all so. Are you going to Coniston for the holidays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face fell at the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bob,&rdquo; she cried, surprising him utterly by a glimpse of the real
      Cynthia, &ldquo;I wish I were&mdash;I wish I were! But I don't dare to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't dare to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I went, I should' never come back&mdash;never. I should stay with
      Uncle Jethro. He's so lonesome up there, and I'm so lonesome down here,
      without him. And I promised him faithfully I'd stay a whole winter at
      school in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; said Bob, in a strange voice as he leaned toward her, &ldquo;do you&mdash;do
      you care for him as much as all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care for him?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care for&mdash;for Uncle Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I care for him,&rdquo; she cried, her eyes flashing at the thought.
      &ldquo;I love him better than anybody in the world. Certainly no one ever had
      better reason to care for a person. My father failed when he came to
      Coniston&mdash;he was not meant for business, and Uncle Jethro took care
      of him all his life, and paid his debts. And he has taken care of me and
      given me everything that a girl could wish. Very few people know what a
      fine character Uncle Jethro has,&rdquo; continued Cynthia, carried away as she
      was by the pent-up flood of feeling within her. &ldquo;I know what he has done
      for others, and I should love him for that even if he never had done
      anything for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob was silent. He was, in the first place, utterly amazed at this
      outburst, revealing as it did a depth of passionate feeling in the girl
      which he had never suspected, and which thrilled him. It was unlike her,
      for she was usually so self-repressed; and, being unlike her, accentuated
      both sides of her character the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was he to say of the defence of Jethro Bass? Bob was not a young
      man who had pondered much over the problems of life, because these
      problems had hitherto never touched him. But now he began to perceive,
      dimly, things that might become the elements of a tragedy, even as Mr.
      Merrill had perceived them some months before. Could a union endure
      between so delicate a creature as the girl before him and Jethro Bass?
      Could Cynthia ever go back to him again, and live with him happily,
      without seeing many things which before were hidden by reason of her youth
      and innocence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob had not been nearly four years at college without learning something
      of the world; and it had not needed the lecture from his father, which he
      got upon leaving Washington, to inform him of Jethro's political
      practices. He had argued soundly with his father on that occasion, having
      the courage to ask Mr. Worthington in effect whether he did not sanction
      his underlings to use the same tools as Jethro used. Mr. Worthington was
      righteously angry, and declared that Jethro had inaugurated those
      practices in the state, and had to be fought with his own weapons. But Mr.
      Worthington had had the sense at that time not to mention Cynthia's name.
      He hoped and believed that that affair was not serious, and merely a
      boyish fancy&mdash;as indeed it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      It remains to be said, however, that the lecture had not been without its
      effect upon Bob. Jethro Bass, after all, was&mdash;Jethro Bass. All his
      life Bob had heard him familiarly and jokingly spoken of as the boss of
      the state, and had listened to the tales, current in all the country
      towns, of how Jethro had outwitted this man or that. Some of them were not
      refined tales. Jethro Bass as the boss of the state&mdash;with the
      tolerance with which the public in general regard politics&mdash;was one
      thing. Bob was willing to call him &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; admire his great
      strength and shrewdness, and declare that the men he had outwitted had
      richly deserved it. But Jethro Bass as the ward of Cynthia Wetherell was
      quite another thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not only that Cynthia had suddenly and inevitably become a lady.
      That would not have mattered, for such as she would have borne Coniston
      and the life of Coniston cheerfully. But Bob reflected, as he walked back
      to his rooms in the dark through the snow-laden streets, that Cynthia,
      young though she might be, possessed principles from which no love would
      sway her a hair's breadth. How, indeed, was she to live with Jethro once
      her eyes were opened?
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought made him angry, but returned to him persistently during the
      days that followed,&mdash;in the lecture room, in the gymnasium, in his
      own study, where he spent more time than formerly. By these tokens it will
      be perceived that Bob, too, had changed a little. And the sight of Cynthia
      in Mrs. Merrill's parlor had set him to thinking in a very different
      manner than the sight of her in Washington had affected him. Bob had
      managed to shift the subject from Jethro, not without an effort, though he
      had done it in that merry, careless manner which was so characteristic of
      him. He had talked of many things,&mdash;his college life, his friends,&mdash;and
      laughed at her questions about his freshman escapades. But when at length,
      at twilight, he had risen to go, he had taken both her hands and looked
      down into her face with a very different expression than she had seen him
      wear before&mdash;a much more serious expression, which puzzled her. It
      was not the look of a lover, nor yet that of a man who imagines himself in
      love. With either of these her instinct would have told her how to deal.
      It was more the look of a friend, with much of the masculine spirit of
      protection in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come to see you again?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gently she released her hands, and she did not answer at once. She went to
      the window, and stared across the sloping street at the grilled railing
      before the big house opposite, thinking. Her reason told her that he
      should not come, but her spirit rebelled against that reason. It was a
      pleasure to see him, so she freely admitted to herself. Why should she not
      have that pleasure? If the truth be told, she had argued it all out
      before, when she had wondered whether he would come. Mrs. Merrill, she
      thought, would not object to his coming. But&mdash;there was the question
      she had meant to ask him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; she said, turning to him, &ldquo;Bob, would your father want you to
      come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was growing dark, and she could scarcely see his face. He hesitated,
      but he did not attempt to evade the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he would not,&rdquo; he answered. And added, with a good deal of force and
      dignity: &ldquo;I am of age, and can choose my own friends. I am my own master.
      If he knew you as I knew you, he would look at the matter in a different
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia felt that this was not quite true. She smiled a little sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you don't know me very well, Bob.&rdquo; He was about to protest,
      but she went on, bravely, &ldquo;Is it because he has quarrelled with Uncle
      Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bob. She was making it terribly hard for him, sparing indeed
      neither herself nor him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you come here to see me, it will cause a quarrel between you and your
      father. I&mdash;I cannot do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing wrong in my seeing you,&rdquo; said Bob, stoutly; &ldquo;if he cares
      to quarrel with me for that, I cannot help it. If the people I choose for
      my friends are good people, he has no right to an objection, even though
      he is my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia had never come so near real admiration for him as at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Bob, you must not come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will not have you quarrel with
      him on my account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will quarrel with him on my own account,&rdquo; he had answered.
      &ldquo;Good-by. You may expect me this day week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went into the hall to put on his overcoat. Cynthia stood still on the
      spot of the carpet where he had left her. He put his head in at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This day week,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob, you must not come,&rdquo; she answered. But the street door closed after
      him as he spoke.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not come.&rdquo; Had Cynthia made the prohibition strong enough? Ought
      she not to have said, &ldquo;If you do come, I will not see you?&rdquo; Her knowledge
      of the motives of the men and women in the greater world was largely
      confined to that which she had gathered from novels&mdash;not trashy
      novels, but those by standard authors of English life. And many another
      girl of nineteen has taken a novel for a guide when she has been suddenly
      confronted with the first great problem outside of her experience.
      Somebody has declared that there are only seven plots in the world. There
      are many parallels in English literature to Cynthia's position,&mdash;so
      far as she was able to define that position,&mdash;the wealthy young peer,
      the parson's or physician's daughter, and the worldly, inexorable parents
      who had other plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was, of course, foolish. She would not look ahead, yet there was
      the mirage in the sky when she allowed herself to dream. It can truthfully
      be said that she was not in love with Bob Worthington. She felt, rather
      than knew, that if love came to her the feeling she had for Jethro Bass&mdash;strong
      though that was&mdash;would be as nothing to it. The girl felt the
      intensity of her nature, and shrank from it when her thoughts ran that
      way, for it frightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Merrill&rdquo; she said, a few days later, when she found herself alone
      with that lady, &ldquo;you once told me you would have no objection if a friend
      came to see me here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever, my dear,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Merrill. &ldquo;I have asked you to have
      your friends here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merrill knew that a young man had called on Cynthia. The girls had
      discussed the event excitedly, had teased Cynthia about it; they had
      discovered, moreover, that the young man had not been a tiller of the soil
      or a clerk in a country store. Ellen, with the enthusiasm of her race, had
      painted him in glowing colors&mdash;but she had neglected to read the name
      on his card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob Worthington came to see me last week, and he wants to come again. He
      lives in Brampton,&rdquo; Cynthia explained, &ldquo;and is at Harvard College.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merrill was decidedly surprised. She went on with her sewing,
      however, and did not betray the fact. She knew of Dudley Worthington as
      one of the richest and most important men in his state; she had heard her
      husband speak of him often; but she had never meddled with politics and
      railroad affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By all means let him come, Cynthia,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Merrill got home that evening she spoke of the matter to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia is a strange character,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sometimes I can't understand
      her&mdash;she seems so much older than our girls, Stephen. Think of her
      keeping this to herself for four days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill laughed, but he went off to a little writing room he had and
      sat for a long time looking into the glowing coals. Then he laughed again.
      Mr. Merrill was a philosopher. After all, he could not forbid Dudley
      Worthington's son coming to his house, nor did he wish to.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening Cynthia wrote a letter and posted it. She found it a
      very difficult letter to write, and almost as difficult to drop into the
      mail-box. She reflected that the holidays were close at hand, and then he
      would go to Brampton and forget, even as he had forgotten before. And she
      determined when Wednesday afternoon came around that she would take a long
      walk in the direction of Brookline. Cynthia loved these walks, for she
      sadly missed the country air,&mdash;and they had kept the color in her
      cheeks and the courage in her heart that winter. She had amazed the
      Merrill girls by the distances she covered, and on more than one occasion
      she had trudged many miles to a spot from which there was a view of Blue
      Hills. They reminded her faintly of Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can speak or write with any certainty of the feminine character, or
      declare what unexpected twists perversity and curiosity may give to it?
      Wednesday afternoon came, and Cynthia did not go to Brookline. She put on
      her coat, and took it off again. Would he dare to come in the face of the
      mandate he had received? If he did come, she wouldn't see him. Ellen had
      received her orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o'clock the doorbell rang, and shortly thereafter Ellen appeared,
      simpering and apologetic enough, with a card. She had taken the trouble to
      read it this time. Cynthia was angry, or thought she was, and her cheeks
      were very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you to excuse me, Ellen. Why did you let him in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Cynthia, darlin',&rdquo; said Ellen, &ldquo;if it was made of flint I was,
      wouldn't he bring the tears out of me with his wheedlin' an' coaxin'? An'
      him such a fine young gintleman! And whin he took to commandin' like, sure
      I couldn't say no to him at all at all. 'Take the card to her, Ellen,' he
      says&mdash;didn't he know me name!&mdash;'an' if she says she won't see
      me, thin I won't trouble her more.' Thim were his words, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There he was before the fire, his feet slightly apart and his hands in his
      pockets, waiting for her. She got a glimpse of him standing thus, as she
      came down the stairs. It was not the attitude of a culprit. Nor did he
      bear the faintest resemblance to a culprit as he came up to her in the
      doorway. The chief recollection she carried away of that moment was that
      his teeth were very white and even when he smiled. He had the impudence to
      smile. He had the impudence to seize one of her hands in his, and to hold
      aloft a sheet of paper in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you thick it means?&rdquo; retorted Cynthia, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A summons to stay away,&rdquo; said Bob, thereby more or less accurately
      describing it. &ldquo;What would you have thought of me if I had not come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was not prepared for any such question as this. She had meant to
      ask the questions herself. But she never lacked for words to protect
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what I think of you for coming, Bob, for insisting upon
      seeing me as you did,&rdquo; she said, remembering with shame Ellen's account of
      that proceeding. &ldquo;It was very unkind and very thoughtless of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unkind?&rdquo; Thus she succeeded in putting him on the defensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, unkind, because I know it is best for you not to come to see me, and
      you know it, and yet you will not help me when I try to do what is right.
      I shall be blamed for these visits,&rdquo; she said. The young ladies in the
      novels always were. But it was a serious matter for poor Cynthia, and her
      voice trembled a little. Her troubles seemed very real.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will blame you?&rdquo; asked Bob, though he knew well enough. Then he
      added, seeing that she did not answer: &ldquo;I don't at all agree with you that
      it is best for me not to see you. I know of nobody in the world it does me
      more good to see than yourself. Let's sit down and talk it all over,&rdquo; he
      said, for she still remained standing uncompromisingly by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suspicion of a smile came over Cynthia's face. She remembered how
      Ellen had been wheedled. Her instinct told her that now was the time to
      make a stand or never.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't do any good, Bob,&rdquo; she replied, shaking her head; &ldquo;we talked
      it all over last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we only touched upon a few points last week. We
      ought to thrash it out. Various aspects of the matter have occurred to me
      which I ought to call to your attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not avoid this bantering tone, but she saw that he was very much
      in earnest too. He realized the necessity of winning; likewise, and he had
      got in and meant to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to argue,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;I've thought it all out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;I haven't thought of anything else, to speak of.
      And by the way,&rdquo; he declared, shaking the envelope, &ldquo;I never got a colder
      and more formal letter in my life. You must have taken it from one of Miss
      Sadler's copy books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry I haven't been able to equal the warmth of your other
      correspondents,&rdquo; said Cynthia, smiling at the mention of Miss Sadler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a good many degrees yet to go,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no idea of doing so,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Cynthia had lured him there, and had carefully thought out a plan of
      fanning his admiration into a flame, she could not have done better than
      to stand obstinately by the door. Nothing appeals to a man like resistance&mdash;resistance
      for a principle appealed to Bob, although he did not care a fig about that
      particular principle. In his former dealings with young women&mdash;and
      they had not been few&mdash;the son of Dudley Worthington had encountered
      no resistance worth the mentioning. He looked at the girl before him, and
      his blood leaped at the thought of a conquest over her. She was often
      demure, but behind that demureness was firmness: she was mistress of
      herself, and yet possessed a marvellous vitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;don't you think you had better go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Go! He laughed outright. Never! He would sit down under that fortress, and
      some day he meant to scale the walls. Like John Paul Jones, he had not yet
      begun to fight. But he did not sit down just yet, because Cynthia remained
      standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm here now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what's the good of going away? I might as well
      stay the rest of the afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find a photograph album on the table,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;with
      pictures of all the Merrill family and their friends and relations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the threat this remark conveyed, he could not help laughing at
      it. Mrs. Merrill in her sitting room heard the laugh, and felt that she
      would like Bob Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a heavy album, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;perhaps you would hold up one
      side of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Cynthia's turn to laugh. She could not decide whether he were a man
      or a boy. Sometimes, she had to admit, he was very much of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upstairs, of course,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was really alarming. But fate thrust a final weapon into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'll look at the album. What time does Mr. Merrill
      get home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About six,&rdquo; answered Cynthia. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he comes,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;I shall put on my most disconsolate
      expression. He'll ask me what I'm doing, and I'll tell him you went
      upstairs at half-past four and haven't come down. He'll sympathize, I'll
      bet anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether Bob were really capable of doing this, Cynthia could not tell. She
      believed he was. Perhaps she really did not intend to go upstairs just
      then. To his intense relief she seated herself on a straight-backed chair
      near the door, although she had the air of being about to get up again at
      any minute. It was not a surrender, not at all&mdash;but a parley, at
      least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really want to talk to you seriously, Bob,&rdquo; she said, and her voice was
      serious. &ldquo;I like you very much&mdash;I always have&mdash;and I want you to
      listen seriously. All of us have friends. Some people&mdash;you, for
      instance&mdash;have a great many. We have but one father.&rdquo; Her voice
      failed a little at the word. &ldquo;No friend can ever be the same to you as
      your father, and no friendship can make up what his displeasure will cost
      you. I do not mean to say that I shan't always be your friend, for I shall
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young men seldom arrive at maturity by gradual steps&mdash;something sets
      them thinking, a week passes, and suddenly the world has a different
      aspect. Bob had thought much of his father during that week, and had
      considered their relationship very carefully. He had a few precious
      memories of his mother before she had been laid to rest under that hideous
      and pretentious monument in the Brampton hill cemetery. How unlike her was
      that monument! Even as a young boy, when on occasions he had wandered into
      the cemetery, he used to stand before it with a lump in his throat and
      bitter resentment in his heart, and once he had shaken his fist at it. He
      had grown up out of sympathy with his father, but he had never until now
      began to analyze the reasons for it. His father had given him everything
      except that communion of which Cynthia spoke so feelingly. Mr. Worthington
      had acted according to his lights: of all the people in the world he
      thought first of his son. But his thoughts and care had been alone of what
      the son would be to the world: how that son would carry on the wealth and
      greatness of Isaac D. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob had known this before, but it had had no such significance for him
      then as now. He was by no means lacking in shrewdness, and as he had grown
      older he had perceived clearly enough Mr. Worthington's reasons for
      throwing him socially with the Duncans. Mr. Worthington had never been a
      plain-spoken man, but he had as much as told his son that it was decreed
      that he should marry the heiress of the state. There were other plans
      connected with this. Mr. Worthington meant that his son should eventually
      own the state itself, for he saw that the man who controlled the highways
      of a state could snap his fingers at governor and council and legislature
      and judiciary: could, indeed, do more&mdash;could own them even more
      completely than Jethro Bass now owned them, and without effort. The
      dividends would do the work: would canvass the counties and persuade this
      man and that with sufficient eloquence. By such tokens it will be seen
      that Isaac D. Worthington is destined to become great, though the
      greatness will be akin to that possessed by those gentlemen who in past
      ages had built castles across the highway between Venice and the North
      Sea. All this was in store for Bob Worthington, if he could only be
      brought to see it. These things would be given him, if he would but
      confine his worship to the god of wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are running ahead, however, of Bob's reflections in Mr. Merrill's
      parlor in Mount Vernon Street, and the ceremony of showing him the cities
      of his world from Brampton hill was yet to be gone through. Bob knew his
      father's plans only in a general way, but in the past week he had come to
      know his father with a fair amount of thoroughness. If Isaac D.
      Worthington had but chosen a worldly wife, he might have had a more
      worldly son. As it was, Bob's thoughts were a little bitter when Cynthia
      spoke of his father, and he tried to think instead what his mother would
      have him do. He could not, indeed, speak of Mr. Worthington's shortcomings
      as he understood them, but he answered Cynthia vigorously enough&mdash;even
      if his words were not as serious as she desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I am old enough to judge for myself, Cynthia,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I
      intend to judge for myself. I don't pretend to be a paragon of virtue, but
      I have a kind of a conscience which tells me when I am doing wrong, if I
      listen to it. I have not always listened to it. It tells me I'm doing
      right now, and I mean to listen to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia could not but think there was very little self-denial attached to
      this. Men are not given largely to self-denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easy enough to listen to your conscience when you think it impels
      you to do that which you want to do, Bob,&rdquo; she answered, laughing at his
      argument in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you wicked?&rdquo; he demanded abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, I don't think I am,&rdquo; said Cynthia, taken aback. But she
      corrected herself swiftly, perceiving his bent. &ldquo;I should be doing wrong
      to let you come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He ignored the qualification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you vain and frivolous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remembered that she had looked in the glass before she had come down
      to him, and bit her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you given over to idle pursuits, to leading young men from their
      occupations and duties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you've come here to recite the Blue Laws,&rdquo; said she, laughing again,
      &ldquo;I have something better to do than to listen to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I'll tell you what you are. I'll draw your character
      for you, and then, if you can give me one good reason why I should not
      associate with you, I'll go away and never come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all very well,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;but suppose I don't admit your
      qualifications for drawing my character. And I don't admit them, not for a
      minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will draw it,&rdquo; said he, standing up in front of her. &ldquo;Oh, confound it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation, astonishing and out of place as it was, was caused by a
      ring at the doorbell. The ring was followed by a whispering and giggling
      in the hall, and then by the entrance of the Misses Merrill into the
      parlor. Curiosity had been too strong for them. Susan was human, and here
      was the opportunity for a little revenge. In justice to her, she meant the
      revenge to be very slight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Cynthia, you should have come to the concert,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it was
      fine, wasn't it, Jane? Is this Mr. Worthington? How do you do. I'm Miss
      Susan Merrill, and this is Miss Jane Merrill.&rdquo; Susan only intended to stay
      a minute, but how was Bob to know that? She was tempted into staying
      longer. Bob lighted the gas, and she inspected him and approved. Her
      approval increased when he began to talk to her in his bantering way, as
      if he had known her always. Then, when she was fully intending to go, he
      rose to take his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully glad to have met you at last,&rdquo; he said to Susan, &ldquo;I've heard
      so much about you.&rdquo; His leave-taking of Jane was less effusive, and then
      he turned to Cynthia and took her hand. &ldquo;I'm going to Brampton on Friday,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;for the holidays. I wish you were going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn't think of letting her go, Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; cried Susan, for
      the thought of the hills had made Cynthia incapable of answering. &ldquo;We're
      only to have her for one short winter, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, gravely. &ldquo;I'll see old Ephraim, and
      tell him you're well, and what a marvel of learning, you've become. And&mdash;and
      I'll go to Coniston if that will please you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Bob, you mustn't do anything of the kind,&rdquo; answered Cynthia,
      trying to keep back the tears. &ldquo;I&mdash;I write to Uncle Jethro very
      often. Good-by. I hope you will enjoy your holidays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm coming to see you the minute I get back and tell you all about
      everybody,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was she to forbid him to come before Susan and Jane! She could only be
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come, Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; said Susan, warmly, wondering at Cynthia's
      coldness and, indeed, misinterpreting it. &ldquo;I am sure she will be glad to
      see you. And we shall always make you welcome, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was out of the door, Susan became very repentant, and
      slipped her hand about Cynthia's waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shouldn't have come in at all if we had known he would go so soon,
      indeed we shouldn't, Cynthia.&rdquo; And seeing that Cynthia was still silent,
      she added: &ldquo;I wouldn't do such a mean thing, Cynthia, I really wouldn't.
      Won't you believe me and forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia scarcely heard her at first. She was thinking of Coniston
      mountain, and how the sun had just set behind it. The mountain would be
      ultramarine against the white fields, and the snow on the hill pastures to
      the east stained red as with wine. What would she not have given to be
      going back to-morrow&mdash;yes, with Bob. She confessed&mdash;though
      startled by the very boldness of the thought&mdash;that she would like to
      be going there with Bob. Susan's appeal brought her back to Boston and the
      gas-lit parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive you, Susan! There's nothing to forgive. I wanted him to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted him to go?&rdquo; repeated Susan, amazed. She may be pardoned if she
      did not believe this, but a glance at Cynthia's face scarcely left a room
      for doubt. &ldquo;Cynthia Wetherell, you're the strangest girl I've ever known
      in all my life. If I had a&mdash;a friend&rdquo; (Susan had another word on her
      tongue) &ldquo;if I had such a friend as Mr. Worthington, I shouldn't be in a
      hurry to let him leave me. Of course,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I shouldn't let him
      know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's heart was very heavy during the next few days, heavier by far
      than her friends in Mount Vernon Street imagined. They had grown to love
      her almost as one of themselves, and because of the sympathy which comes
      of such love they guessed that her thoughts would be turning homeward at
      Christmastide. At school she had listened, perforce, to the festival plans
      of thirty girls of her own age; to accounts of the probable presents they
      were to receive, the cost of some of which would support a family in
      Coniston for several months; to arrangements for visits, during which
      there were to be theatre-parties and dances and other gaieties. Cynthia
      could not help wondering, as she listened in silence to this talk, whether
      Uncle Jethro had done wisely in sending her to Miss Sadler's; whether she
      would not have been far happier if she had never known about such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the last day of school, which began with leave-takings and
      embraces. There were not many who embraced Cynthia, though, had she known
      it, this was largely her own fault. Poor Cynthia! how was she to know it?
      Many more of them than she imagined would have liked to embrace her had
      they believed that the embrace would be returned. Secretly they had grown
      to admire this strange, dark girl, who was too proud to bend for the good
      opinion of any one&mdash;even of Miss Sally Broke. Once during the term
      Cynthia had held some of them&mdash;in the hollow of her hand, and had
      incurred the severe displeasure of Miss Sadler by refusing to tell what
      she knew of certain mischief-makers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Miss Sadler was going about among them in the school parlor saying
      good-by, sending particular remembrance to such of the fathers and mothers
      as she thought worthy of that honor; kissing some, shaking, hands with
      all. It was then that a dramatic incident occurred&mdash;dramatic for a
      girls' school, at least. Cynthia deliberately turned her back on Miss
      Sadler and looked out of the window. The chatter in the room was hushed,
      and for a moment a dangerous wrath flamed in Miss Sadler's eyes. Then she
      passed on with a smile, to send most particular messages to the mother of
      Miss Isabel Burrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some few moments afterward Cynthia felt a touch on her arm, and turned to
      find herself confronted by Miss Sally Broke. Unfortunately there is not
      much room for Miss Broke in this story, although she may appear in another
      one yet to be written. She was extremely good-looking, with real golden
      hair and mischievous blue eyes. She was, in brief, the leader of Miss
      Sadler's school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was rude to you when you first came here, and I'm
      sorry for it. I want to beg your pardon.&rdquo; And she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment's suspense for those watching to see if Cynthia would
      take it. She did take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, too,&rdquo; said Cynthia, simply, &ldquo;I couldn't see what I'd done to
      offend you. Perhaps you'll explain now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Broke blushed violently, and for an instant looked decidedly
      uncomfortable. Then she burst into laughter,&mdash;merry, irresistible
      laughter that carried all before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a snob, that's all,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;just a plain, low down snob. You
      don't understand what that means, because you're not one.&rdquo; (Cynthia did
      understand, ) &ldquo;But I like you, and I want you to be my friend. Perhaps
      when I get to know you better, you will come home with me sometime for a
      visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Go home with her for a visit to that house in Washington Square with the
      picture gallery!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say that I'd give my head to have been able to turn my back on
      Miss Sadler as you did,&rdquo; continued Miss Broke; &ldquo;if you ever want a friend,
      remember Sally Broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of Cynthia's trouble, at least, was mitigated by this episode; and
      Miss Broke having led the way, Miss Broke's followers came shyly, one by
      one, with proffers of friendship. To the good-hearted Merrill girls the
      walk home that day was a kind of a triumphal march, a victory over Miss
      Sadler and a vindication of their friend. Mrs. Merrill, when she heard of
      it, could not find it in her heart to reprove Cynthia. Miss Sadler had got
      her just deserts. But Miss Sadler was not a person who was likely to
      forget such an incident. Indeed, Mrs. Merrill half expected to receive a
      note before the holidays ended that Cynthia's presence was no longer
      desired at the school. No such note came, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one had to be away from home on Christmas, there could surely be no
      better place to spend that day than in the Merrill household. Cynthia
      remembers still, when that blessed season comes around, how each member of
      the family vied with the others to make her happy; how they showered
      presents on her, and how they strove to include her in the laughter and
      jokes at the big family dinner. Mr. Merrill's brother was there with his
      wife, and Mrs. Merrill's aunt and her husband, and two broods of cousins.
      It may be well to mention that the Merrill relations, like Sally Broke,
      had overcome their dislike for Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were eatables from Coniston on that board. A turkey sent by Jethro
      for which, Mr. Merrill declared, the table would have to be strengthened;
      a saddle of venison&mdash;Lem Hallowell having shot a deer on the mountain
      two Sundays before; and mince-meat made by Amanda Hatch herself. Other
      presents had come to Cynthia from the hills: a gorgeous copy of Mr.
      Longfellow's poems from Cousin Ephraim, and a gold locket from Uncle
      Jethro. This locket was the precise counterpart (had she but known it) of
      a silver one bought at Mr. Judson's shop many years before, though the
      inscription &ldquo;Cynthy, from Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; was within. Into the other side
      exactly fitted that daguerreotype of her mother which her father had given
      her when he died. The locket had a gold chain with a clasp, and Cynthia
      wore it hidden beneath her gown-too intimate a possession to be shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still another and very mysterious present, this being a huge box
      of roses, addressed to Miss Cynthia Wetherell, which was delivered on
      Christmas morning. If there had been a card, Susan Merrill would certainly
      have found it. There was no card. There was much pretended speculation on
      the part of the Merrill girls as to the sender, sly reference to Cynthia's
      heightened color, and several attempts to pin on her dress a bunch of the
      flowers, and Susan declared that one of them would look stunning in her
      hair. They were put on the dining-room table in the centre of the wreath
      of holly, and under the mistletoe which hung from the chandelier. Whether
      Cynthia surreptitiously stole one has never been discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Christmas came and went: not altogether unhappily, deferring for a day
      at least the knotty problems of life. Although Cynthia accepted the
      present of the roses with such magnificent unconcern, and would not make
      so much as a guess as to who sent them, Mr. Robert Worthington was
      frequently in her thoughts. He had declared his intention of coming to
      Mount Vernon Street as soon as the holidays ended, and had been cordially
      invited by Susan to do so. Cynthia took the trouble to procure a Harvard
      catalogue from the library, and discovered that he had many holidays yet
      to spend. She determined to write another letter, which he would find in
      his rooms when he returned. Just what terrible prohibitory terms she was
      to employ in that letter Cynthia could not decide in a moment, nor yet in
      a day, or a week. She went so far as to make several drafts, some of which
      she destroyed for the fault of leniency, and others for that of severity.
      What was she to say to him? She had expended her arguments to no avail.
      She could wound him, indeed, and at length made up her mind that this was
      the only resource left her, although she would thereby wound herself more
      deeply. When she had arrived at this decision, there remained still more
      than a week in which to compose the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning after New Year's, when the family were assembled around the
      breakfast table, Mrs. Merrill remarked that her husband was neglecting a
      custom which had been his for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't the newspaper come, Stephen?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill had read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read it!&rdquo; repeated his wife, in surprise, &ldquo;you haven't been down long
      enough to read a column.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was full of trash,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill, lightly, and began on his usual
      jokes with the girls. But Mrs. Merrill was troubled. She thought his jokes
      not as hearty as they were wont to be, and disquieting surmises of
      business worries filled her mind. The fact that he beckoned her into his
      writing room as soon as breakfast was over did not tend to allay her
      suspicions. He closed and locked the door after her, and taking the paper
      from a drawer in his desk bade her read a certain article in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The article was an arraignment of Jethro Bass&mdash;and a terrible
      arraignment indeed. Step by step it traced his career from the beginning,
      showing first of all how he had debauched his own town of Coniston; how,
      enlarging on the same methods, he had gradually extended his grip over the
      county and finally over the state; how he had bought and sold men for his
      own power and profit, deceived those who had trusted in him, corrupted
      governors and legislators, congressmen and senators, and even justices of
      the courts: how he had trafficked ruthlessly in the enterprises of the
      people. Instance upon instance was given, and men of high prominence from
      whom he had received bribes were named, not the least important of these
      being the Honorable Alva Hopkins of Gosport.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merrill looked up from the paper in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's copied from the Newcastle Guardian,&rdquo; she said, for lack of immediate
      power to comment. &ldquo;Isn't the Guardian the chief paper in that state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Worthington's bought it, and he instigated the article, of course.
      I've been afraid of this for a long time, Carry,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill, pacing
      up and down. &ldquo;There's a bigger fight than they've ever had coming on up
      there, and this is the first gun. Worthington, with Duncan behind him, is
      trying to get possession of and consolidate all the railroads in the
      western part of that state. If he succeeds, it will mean the end of
      Jethro's power. But he won't succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; said his wife, &ldquo;do you mean to say that Jethro Bass will try to
      defeat this consolidation simply to keep his power?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; answered Mr. Merrill, still pacing, &ldquo;two wrongs don't
      make a right, I admit. I've known these things a long time, and I've
      thought about them a good deal. But I've had to run along with the tide,
      or give place to another man who would; and&mdash;and starve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merrill's eyes slowly filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;do you mean to say&mdash;?&rdquo; There she stopped,
      utterly unable to speak. He ceased his pacing and sat down beside her and
      took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, I mean to say I've submitted to these things. God knows
      whether I've been right or wrong, but I have. I've often thought I'd be
      happier if I resigned my office as president of my road and became a clerk
      in a store. I don't attempt to excuse myself, Carry, but my sin has been
      in holding on to my post. As long as I remain president I have to cope
      with things as I find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill spoke thickly, for the sight of his wife's tears wrung his
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when we were first married and you were a district
      superintendent, you used to tell me everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stephen Merrill was a man, and a good man, as men go. How was he to tell
      her the degrees by which he had been led into his present situation? How
      was he to explain that these degrees had been so gradual that his
      conscience had had but a passing wrench here and there? Politics being
      what they were, progress and protection had to be obtained in accordance
      with them, and there was a duty to the holders of bonds and stocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife had a question on her lips, a question for which she had to
      summon all her courage. She chose that form for it which would hurt him
      least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington is going to try to change these things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill roused himself at the words, and his eyes flashed. He became a
      different man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change them!&rdquo; he cried bitterly, &ldquo;change them for the worse, if he can.
      He will try to wrest the power from Jethro Bass. I don't defend him. I
      don't defend myself. But I like Jethro Bass. I won't deny it. He's human,
      and I like him, and whatever they say about him I know that he's been a
      true friend to me. And I tell you as I hope for happiness here and
      hereafter, that if Worthington succeeds in what he is trying to do, if the
      railroads win in this fight, there will be no mercy for the people of that
      state. I'm a railroad man myself, though I have no interest in this
      affair. My turn may come later. Will come later, I suppose. Isaac D.
      Worthington has a very little heart or soul or mercy himself; but the
      corporation which he means to set up will have none at all. It will grind
      the people and debase them and clog their progress a hundred times more
      than Jethro Bass has done. Mark my words, Carry. I'm running ahead of the
      times a little, but I can see it all as clearly as if it existed now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merrill went about her duties that morning with a heavy heart, and
      more than once she paused to wipe away a tear that would have fallen on
      the linen she was sorting. At eleven o'clock the doorbell rang, and Ellen
      appeared at the entrance to the linen closet with a card in her hand. Mrs.
      Merrill looked at it with a flurry of surprise. It read:&mdash;

           MISS LUCRETIA PENNIMAN

            The Woman's Hour

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was certainly affinity that led Miss Lucretia to choose the rosewood
      sofa of a bygone age, which was covered with horsehair. Miss Lucretia's
      features seemed to be constructed on a larger and more generous principle
      than those of women are nowadays. Her face was longer. With her curls and
      her bonnet and her bombazine,&mdash;which she wore in all seasons,&mdash;she
      was in complete harmony with the sofa. She had thrown aside the storm
      cloak which had become so familiar to pedestrians in certain parts of
      Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Penniman,&rdquo; said Mrs. Merrill, &ldquo;I am delighted and honored. I
      scarcely hoped for such a pleasure. I have so long admired you and your
      work, and I have heard Cynthia speak of you so kindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good of you to say so, Mrs. Merrill&rdquo; answered Miss Lucretia,
      in her full, deep voice. It was by no means an unpleasant voice. She
      settled herself, though she sat quite upright, in the geometrical centre
      of the horsehair sofa, and cleared her throat. &ldquo;To be quite honest with
      you, Mrs. Merrill,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I came upon particular errand, though
      I believe it would not be a perversion of the truth if I were to add that
      I have had for a month past every intention of paying you a friendly
      call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Good Mrs. Merrill's breath was a little taken away by this extremely
      scrupulous speech. She also began to feel a misgiving about the cause of
      the visit, but she managed to say something polite in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come about Cynthia,&rdquo; announced Miss Lucretia, without further
      preliminaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Cynthia?&rdquo; faltered Mrs. Merrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia opened a reticule at her waist and drew forth a newspaper
      clipping, which she unfolded and handed to Mrs. Merrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen this?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merrill took it, although she guessed very well what it was, glanced
      at it with a shudder, and handed it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have read it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to ask you, Mrs. Merrill&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, &ldquo;if it is
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was a question, indeed, for the poor lady to answer! But Mrs. Merrill
      was no coward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is partly true, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Partly?&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, partly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Merrill, rousing herself for the trial; &ldquo;I have
      never yet seen a newspaper article which was wholly true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is because newspapers are not edited by women,&rdquo; observed Miss
      Lucretia. &ldquo;What I wish you to tell me, Mrs. Merrill, is this: how much of
      that article is true, and how much of it is false?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Miss Penniman,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Merrill, with spirit, &ldquo;I don't see
      why you should expect me to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman should take an intelligent interest in her husband's affairs,
      Mrs. Merrill. I have long advocated it as an entering wedge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An entering wedge!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Merrill, who had never read a page of
      the Woman's Hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Your husband is the president of a railroad, I believe, which is
      largely in that state. I should like to ask him whether these statements
      are true in the main. Whether this Jethro Bass is the kind of man they
      declare him to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merrill was in a worse quandary than ever. Her own spirits were none
      too good, and Miss Lucretia's eye, in its search for truth, seemed to
      pierce into her very soul. There was no evading that eye. But Mrs. Merrill
      did what few people would have had the courage or good sense to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a political article, Miss Penniman,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;inspired by a
      bitter enemy of Jethro Bass, Mr. Worthington, who has bought the newspaper
      from which it was copied. For that reason, I was right in saying that it
      is partly true. You nor I, Miss Penniman, must not be the judges of any
      man or woman, for we know nothing of their problems or temptations. God
      will judge them. We can only say that they have acted rightly or wrongly
      according to the light that is in us. You will find it difficult to get a
      judgment of Jethro Bass that is not a partisan judgment, and yet I believe
      that that article is in the main a history of the life of Jethro Bass. A
      partisan history, but still a history. He has unquestionably committed
      many of the acts of which he is accused.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was talk to make the author of the &ldquo;Hymn to Coniston&rdquo; sit up, if she
      hadn't been sitting up already.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don't you condemn him for those acts?&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Merrill, thinking of her own husband. Yesterday she would
      certainly have condemned. Jethro Bass. But now! &ldquo;I do not condemn anybody,
      Miss Penniman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia thought this extraordinary, to say the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will put the question in another way, Mrs. Merrill,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Do you
      think this Jethro Bass a proper guardian for Cynthia Wetherell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To her amazement Mrs. Merrill did not give her an instantaneous answer to
      this question. Mrs. Merrill was thinking of Jethro's love for the girl,
      manifold evidences of which she had seen, and her heart was filled with a
      melting pity. It was such a love, Mrs. Merrill knew, as is not given to
      many here below. And there was Cynthia's love for him. Mrs. Merrill had
      suffered that morning thinking of this tragedy also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think he is a proper guardian for her, Miss Penniman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was then that the tears came to Mrs. Merrill's eyes for there is a
      limit to all human endurance. The sight of these caused a remarkable
      change in Miss Lucretia, and she leaned forward and seized Mrs. Merrill's
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;my dear, what are we to do? Cynthia can't go back
      to that man. She loves him, I know, she loves him as few girls are capable
      of loving. But when she, finds out what he is! When she finds out how he
      got the money to support her father!&rdquo; Miss Lucretia fumbled in her
      reticule and drew forth a handkerchief and brushed her own eyes&mdash;eyes
      which a moment ago were so piercing. &ldquo;I have seen many young women,&rdquo; she
      continued; &ldquo;but I have known very few who were made of as fine a fibre and
      who have such principles as Cynthia Wetherell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Merrill too much cast down to be amazed
      by this revelation of Miss Lucretia's weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are we to do?&rdquo; insisted that lady; &ldquo;who is to tell her what he
      is? How is it to be kept from her, indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Merrill, &ldquo;there will be more, articles. Mr. Merrill says
      so. It seems there is to be a great political struggle in that state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, sadly. &ldquo;And whoever tells the girl will
      forfeit her friendship. I&mdash;I am very fond of her,&rdquo; and here she
      applied again to the reticule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom would she believe?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Merrill, whose estimation of Miss
      Lucretia was increasing by leaps and bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; agreed Miss Lucretia. &ldquo;But she must hear about it sometime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't it be better to let her hear?&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Merrill; &ldquo;we
      cannot very well soften that shock: I talked the matter over a little with
      Mr. Merrill, and he thinks that we must take time over it, Miss Penniman.
      Whatever we do, we must not act hastily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, &ldquo;as I said, I am very fond of the girl, and I
      am willing to do my duty, whatever it may be. And I also wished to say,
      Mrs. Merrill, that I have thought about another matter very carefully. I
      am willing to provide for the girl. I am getting too old to live alone. I
      am getting too old, indeed, to do my work properly, as I used to do it. I
      should like to have her to live with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has become as one of my own daughters,&rdquo; said Mrs. Merrill. Yet she
      knew that this offer of Miss Lucretia's was not one to be lightly set
      aside, and that it might eventually be the best solution of the problem.
      After some further earnest discussion it was agreed between them that the
      matter was, if possible, to be kept from Cynthia for the present, and when
      Miss Lucretia departed Mrs. Merrill promised her an early return of her
      call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Merrill had another talk with her husband, which lasted far into the
      night. This talk was about Cynthia alone, and the sorrow which threatened
      her. These good people knew that it would be no light thing to break the
      faith of such as she, and they made her troubles their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia little guessed as she exchanged raillery with Mr. Merrill the next
      morning that he had risen fifteen minutes earlier than usual to search his
      newspaper through. He would read no more at breakfast, so he declared in
      answer to his daughters' comments; it was a bad habit which did not agree
      with his digestion. It was something new for Mr. Merrill to have trouble
      with his digestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another and scarcely less serious phase of the situation which
      Mr. and Mrs. Merrill had yet to discuss between them&mdash;a phase of
      which Miss Lucretia Penniman knew nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day before Miss Sadler's school was to reopen nearly a week before the
      Harvard term was to commence&mdash;a raging, wet snowstorm came charging
      in from the Atlantic. Snow had no terrors for a Coniston person, and
      Cynthia had been for her walk. Returning about five o'clock, she was
      surprised to have the door opened for her by Susan herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a picture you are in those furs!&rdquo; she cried, with an intention which
      for the moment was lost upon Cynthia. &ldquo;I thought you would never come. You
      must have walked to Dedham this time. Who do you think is here? Mr.
      Worthington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been trying to entertain him, but I am afraid I have been a very
      poor substitute. However, I have persuaded him to stay for supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It needed but little persuasion,&rdquo; said Bob, appearing in the doorway. All
      the snowstorms of the wide Atlantic could not have brought such color to
      her cheeks. Cynthia, for all her confusion at the meeting, had not lost
      her faculty of observation. He seemed to have changed again, even during
      the brief time he had been absent. His tone was grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needs to be cheered up, Cynthia,&rdquo; Susan went on, as though reading her
      thoughts. &ldquo;I have done my best, without success. He won't confess to me
      that he has come back to make up some of his courses. I don't mind owning
      that I've got to finish a theme to be handed in tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words Susan departed, and left them standing in the hall
      together. Bob took hold of Cynthia's jacket and helped her off with it. He
      could read neither pleasure nor displeasure in her face, though he
      searched it anxiously enough. It was she who led the way into the parlor
      and seated herself, as before, on one of the uncompromising,
      straight-backed chairs. Whatever inward tremors the surprise of this visit
      had given her, she looked at him clearly and steadily, completely mistress
      of herself, as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought your holidays did not end until next week,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why are you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I could not stay away, Cynthia,&rdquo; he answered. It was not the
      manner in which he would have said it a month ago. There was a note of
      intense earnestness in his voice&mdash;now, and to it she could make no
      light reply. Confronted again with an unexpected situation, she could not
      decide at once upon a line of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you leave Brampton?&rdquo; she asked, to gain time. But with the words
      her thoughts flew to the hill country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on the early train. They have three feet of snow
      up there.&rdquo; He, too, seemed glad of a respite from something. &ldquo;They're
      having a great fuss in Brampton about a new teacher for the village
      school. Miss Goddard has got married. Did you know Miss Goddard, the lanky
      one with the glasses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia, beginning to be amused at the turn the conversation
      was taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they can't find anybody smart enough to replace Miss Goddard. Old
      Ezra Graves, who's on the prudential committee, told Ephraim they ought to
      get you. I was in the post-office when they were talking about it. Just
      see what a reputation for learning you have in Brampton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was plainly pleased by the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Cousin Eph?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy as a lark,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;the greatest living authority in New England
      on the Civil War. He's made the post-office the most popular social club I
      ever saw. If anybody's missing in Brampton, you can nearly always find
      them in the post-office. But I smiled at the notion of your being a school
      ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see anything so funny about it,&rdquo; replied Cynthia, smiling too.
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't I be? I should like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were made for something different,&rdquo; he answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a subject she did not choose to discuss with him, and dropped her
      lashes before the plainly spoken admiration in his eyes. So a silence fell
      between them, broken only by the ticking of the agate clock on the mantel
      and the music of sleigh-bells in a distant street. Presently the
      sleigh-bells died away, and it seemed to Cynthia that the sound of her own
      heartbeats must be louder than the ticking of the clock. Her tact had
      suddenly deserted her; without reason, and she did not dare to glance
      again at Bob as he sat under the lamp. That minute&mdash;for it was a full
      minute&mdash;was charged with a presage which she could not grasp.
      Cynthia's instincts were very keen. She understood, of course, that he had
      cut short his holiday to come to see her, and she might have dealt with
      him had that been all. But&mdash;through that sixth sense with which some
      women are endowed&mdash;she knew that something troubled him. He, too, had
      never yet been at a loss for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence forced him to speak first, and he tried to restore the light
      tone to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Ephraim gave me a piece of news,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ezra Graves got it,
      too. He told us you were down in Boston at a fashionable school. Cousin
      Ephraim knows a thing or two. He says he always callated you were cut out
      for a fine lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said Cynthia, nerving herself for the ordeal, &ldquo;did you tell Cousin
      Ephraim you had seen me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him and Ezra that I had been a constant and welcome visitor at
      this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did, you tell your father that you had seen me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was too serious a question to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did not. There was no reason why I should have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was every reason,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;and you know it. Did you tell him
      why you came to Boston to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he think you came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't think anything about it,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;He went off to Chicago
      yesterday to attend a meeting of the board of directors of a western
      railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; she said reproachfully, &ldquo;you slipped off as soon as his back was
      turned. I would not have believed that of you, Bob. Do you think that was
      fair to him or me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob Worthington sprang to his feet and stood over her. She had spoken to a
      boy, but she had aroused a man, and she felt an amazing thrill at the
      result. The muscles in his face tightened, and deepened the lines about
      his mouth, and a fire was lighted about his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;even you shall not speak to me like that. If I
      had believed it were right, if I had believed that it would have done any
      good to you or me, I should have told my father the moment I got to
      Brampton. In affairs of this kind&mdash;in a matter of so much importance
      in my life,&rdquo; he continued, choosing his words carefully, &ldquo;I am likely to
      know whether I am doing right or wrong. If my mother were alive, I am sure
      that she would approve of this&mdash;this friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having got so far, he paused. Cynthia felt that she was trembling, as
      though the force and feeling that was in him had charged her also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not intend to come so soon,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but&mdash;I had a reason
      for coming. I knew that you did not want me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that that is not true, Bob,&rdquo; she faltered. His next words
      brought her to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he said, in a voice shaken by the intensity of his passion, &ldquo;I
      came because I love you better than all the world&mdash;because I always
      will love you so. I came to protect you, and care for you whatever
      happens. I did not mean to tell you so, now. But it cannot matter,
      Cynthia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized her, roughly indeed, in his arms, but his very roughness was a
      proof of the intensity of his love. For an instant she lay palpitating
      against him, and as long as he lives he will remember the first exquisite
      touch of her firm but supple figure and the marvellous communion of her
      lips. A current from the great store that was in her, pent up and all
      unknown, ran through him, and then she had struggled out of his arms and
      fled, leaving him standing alone in the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that such things happen, and no man or woman may foretell the
      day or the hour thereof. Cynthia fled up the stairs, miraculously arriving
      unnoticed at her own room, and locked the door and flung herself on the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears came&mdash;tears of shame, of joy, of sorrow, of rejoicing, of
      regret; tears that burned, and yet relieved her, tears that pained while
      they comforted. Had she sinned beyond the pardon of heaven, or had she
      committed a supreme act of right? One moment she gloried in it, and the
      next upbraided herself bitterly. Her heart beat with tumult, and again
      seemed to stop. Such, though the words but faintly describe them, were her
      feelings, for thoughts were still to emerge out of chaos. Love comes like
      a flame to few women, but so it came to Cynthia Wetherell, and burned out
      for a while all reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only for a while. Generations which had practised self-restraint were
      strong in her&mdash;generations accustomed, too, to thinking out, so far
      as in them lay, the logical consequences of their acts; generations
      ashamed of these very instants when nature has chosen to take command.
      After a time had passed, during which the world might have shuffled from
      its course, Cynthia sat up in the darkness. How was she ever to face the
      light again? Reason had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she sat for another space, and thought of what she had done&mdash;thought
      with a surprising calmness now which astonished her. Then she thought of
      what she would do, for there was an ordeal still to be gone through.
      Although she shrank from it, she no longer lacked the courage to endure
      it. Certain facts began to stand out clearly from the confusion. The least
      important and most immediate of these was that she would have to face him,
      and incidentally face the world in the shape of the Merrill family, at
      supper. She rose mechanically and lighted the gas and bathed her face and
      changed her gown. Then she heard Susan's voice at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia, what in the world are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia opened the door and the sisters entered. Was it possible that they
      did not read her terrible secret in her face? Apparently not. Susan was
      busy commenting on the qualities and peculiarities of Mr. Robert
      Worthington, and showering upon Cynthia a hundred questions which she
      answered she knew not how; but neither Susan nor Jane, wonderful as it may
      seem, betrayed any suspicion. Did he send the flowers? Cynthia had not
      asked him. Did he want to know whether she read the newspapers? He had
      asked Susan that, before Cynthia came. Susan was ready to repeat the whole
      of her conversation with him. Why did he seem so particular about
      newspapers? Had he notions that girls ought not to read them?
    </p>
    <p>
      The significance of Bob's remarks about newspapers was lost upon Cynthia
      then. Not till afterward did she think of them, or connect them with his
      unexpected visit. Then the supper bell rang, and they went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will be spared Mr. Worthington's feelings after Cynthia left
      him, although they were intense enough, and absorbing and far-reaching
      enough. He sat down on a chair and buried his head in his hands. His
      impulse had been to leave the house and return again on the morrow, but he
      remembered that he had been asked to stay for supper, and that such a
      proceeding would cause comment. At length he got up and stood before the
      fire, his thoughts still above the clouds, and it was thus that Mr.
      Merrill found him when he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said that gentleman, genially, not knowing in the least
      who Bob was, but prepossessed in his favor by the way he came forward and
      shook his hand and looked him clearly in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Robert Worthington, Mr. Merrill&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; Mr. Merrill gasped, &ldquo;eh! Oh, certainly, how do you do, Mr.
      Worthington?&rdquo; Mr. Merrill would have been polite to a tax collector or a
      sheriff. He separated the office from the man, which ought not always to
      be done. &ldquo;I'm glad to see you, Mr. Worthington. Well, well, bad storm,
      isn't it? I had an idea the college didn't open until next week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington's going to stay for supper, Papa,&rdquo; said Susan, entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Mr. Merrill. &ldquo;Capital! You won't miss the old folks after
      supper, will you, girls? Your mother wants me to go to a whist party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be helped, Carry,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill to his wife, as they walked
      up the hill to a neighbor's that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's in love with Cynthia,&rdquo; said Mrs. Merrill, somewhat sadly; &ldquo;it's as
      plain as the nose on your face, Stephen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't very plain. Suppose he is! You can dam a mountain stream, but
      you can't prevent it reaching the sea, as we used to say when I was a boy
      in Edmundton. I like Bob,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill, with his usual weakness for
      Christian names, &ldquo;and he isn't any more like Dudley Worthington than I am.
      If you were to ask me, I'd say he couldn't do a better thing than marry
      Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Merrill. But in her heart she thought so, too.
      &ldquo;What will Mr. Worthington say when he hears the young man has been coming
      to our house to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill had been thinking of that very thing, but with more amusement
      than concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to Mr. Merrill's house, the three girls and the one young man
      were seated around the fire, and their talk, Merrill as it had begun, was
      becoming minute by minute more stilted. This was largely the fault of
      Susan, who would not be happy until she had taken Jane upstairs and left
      Mr. Worthington and Cynthia together. This matter had been arranged
      between the sisters before supper. Susan found her opening at last, and
      upbraided Jane for her unfinished theme; Jane, having learned her lesson
      well, accused Susan. But Cynthia, who saw through the ruse, declared that
      both themes were finished. Susan, naturally indignant at such ingratitude,
      denied this. The manoeuvre, in short, was executed very clumsily and very
      obviously, but executed nevertheless&mdash;the sisters marching out of the
      room under a fire of protests. The reader, too, will no doubt think it a
      very obvious manoeuvre, but some things are managed badly in life as well
      as in books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia and Bob were left alone: left, moreover, in mortal terror of each
      other. It is comparatively easy to open the door of a room and rush into a
      lady's arms if the lady be willing and alone. But to be abandoned, as
      Susan had abandoned them, and with such obvious intent, creates quite a
      different atmosphere. Bob had dared to hope for such an opportunity: had
      made up his mind during supper, while striving to be agreeable, just what
      he would do if the opportunity came. Instead, all he could do was to sit
      foolishly in his chair and look at the coals, not so much as venturing to
      turn his head until the sound of footsteps had died away on the upper
      floors. It was Cynthia who broke the silence and took command&mdash;a very
      different Cynthia from the girl who had thrown herself on the bed not
      three hours before. She did not look at him, but stared with determination
      into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob, you must go,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; he cried. Her voice loosed the fetters of his passion, and he dared
      to seize the band that lay on the arm of her chair. She did not resist
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you must go. You should not have stayed for supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how can I leave you? I will not leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can and must,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked, looking at her in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the reason,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know it?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I know why I should stay. I know that I love you
      with my whole heart and soul. I know that I love you as few men have ever
      loved&mdash;and that you are the one woman among millions who can inspire
      such a love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Bob, no,&rdquo; she said, striving hard to keep her head, withdrawing her
      hand that it might not betray the treason of her lips. Aware, strange as
      it may seem, of the absurdity of the source of what she was to say, for a
      trace of a smile was about her mouth as she gazed at the coals. &ldquo;You will
      get over this. You are not yet out of college, and many such fancies
      happen there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the moment he was incapable of speaking, incapable of finding an
      answer sufficiently emphatic. How was he to tell her of the rocks upon
      which his love was built?
    </p>
    <p>
      How was he to declare that the very perils which threatened her had made a
      man of him, with all of a man's yearning to share these perils and shield
      her from them? How was he to speak at all of those perils? He did not
      declaim, yet when he spoke, an enduring sincerity which she could not deny
      was in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know in your heart that what you say is not true, Cynthia. Whatever
      happens, I shall always love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever happens: She shuddered at the words, reminding her as they did of
      all her vague misgivings and fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever happens!&rdquo; she found herself repeating them involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, whatever happens I will love you truly and faithfully. I will never
      desert you, never deny you, as long as I live. And you love me, Cynthia,&rdquo;
       he cried, &ldquo;you love me, I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she answered, her breath coming fast. He was on his feet now,
      dangerously near her, and she rose swiftly to avoid him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head, that he might not read the denial in her eyes; and
      yet had to look at him again, for he was coming toward her quickly. &ldquo;Don't
      touch me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don't touch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and looked at her so pitifully that she could scarce keep back
      her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do love me,&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they stood for a moment, while Cynthia made a supreme effort to speak
      calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Bob,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;if you ever wish to see me again, you
      must do as I say. You must write to your father, and tell him what you
      have done and&mdash;and what you wish to do. You may come to me and tell
      me his answer, but you must not come to me before.&rdquo; She would have said
      more, but her strength was almost gone. Yes, and more would have implied a
      promise or a concession. She would not bind herself even by a hint. But of
      this she was sure: that she would not be the means of wrecking his
      opportunities. &ldquo;And now&mdash;you must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stayed where he was, though his blood leaped within him, his admiration
      and respect for the girl outran his passion. Robert Worthington was a
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do as you say, Cynthia,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but I am doing it for you.
      Whatever my father's reply may be will not change my love or my
      intentions. For I am determined that you shall be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words, and one long, lingering look, he turned and left her. He
      had lacked the courage to speak of his father's bitterness and animosity.
      Who will blame him? Cynthia thought none the less of him for not telling
      her. There was, indeed, no need now to describe Dudley Worthington's
      feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door had closed she stoke to the window, and listened to his
      footfalls in the snow until she heard them no more.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Cynthia's heart was heavy as she greeted her new friends
      at Miss Sadler's school. Life had made a woman of her long ago, while
      these girls had yet been in short dresses, and now an experience had come
      to her which few, if any, of these could ever know. It was of no use for
      her to deny to herself that she loved Bob Worthington&mdash;loved him with
      the full intensity of the strong nature that was hers. To how many of
      these girls would come such a love? and how many would be called upon to
      make such a renunciation as hers had been? No wonder she felt out of place
      among them, and once more the longing to fly away to Coniston almost
      overcame her. Jethro would forgive her, she knew, and stretch out his arms
      to receive her, and understand that some trouble had driven her to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aroused by some one calling her name&mdash;some one whose voice
      sounded strangely familiar. Cynthia was perhaps the only person in the
      school that day who did not know that Miss Janet Duncan had entered it.
      Miss Sadler certainly knew it, and asked Miss Duncan very particularly
      about her father and mother and even her brother. Miss Sadler knew, even
      before Janet's unexpected arrival, that Mr. and Mrs. Duncan had come to
      Boston after Christmas, and had taken a large house in the Back Bay in
      order to be near their son at Harvard. Mrs. Duncan was, in fact, a
      Bostonian, and more at home there than at any other place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sadler observed with a great deal of astonishment the warm embrace
      that Janet bestowed on Cynthia. The occurrence started in Miss Sadler a
      train of thought, as a result of which she left the drawing-room where
      these reunions were held, and went into her own private study to write a
      note. This she addressed to Mrs. Alexander Duncan, at a certain number on
      Beacon Street, and sent it out to be posted immediately. In the meantime,
      Janet Duncan had seated herself on the sofa beside Cynthia, not having for
      an instant ceased to talk to her. Of what use to write a romance, when
      they unfolded themselves so beautifully in real life! Here was the country
      girl she had seen in Washington already in a fine way to become the
      princess, and in four months! Janet would not have thought it possible for
      any one to change so much in such a time. Cynthia listened, and wondered
      what language Miss Duncan would use if she knew how great and how complete
      that change had been. Romances, Cynthia thought sadly, were one thing to
      theorize about and quite another thing to endure&mdash;and smiled at the
      thought. But Miss Duncan had no use for a heroine without a heartache.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not improbable that Miss Janet Duncan may appear with Miss Sally
      Broke in another volume. The style of her conversation is known, and there
      is no room to reproduce it here. She, too, had a heart, but she was a
      young woman given to infatuations, as Cynthia rightly guessed. Cynthia
      must spend many afternoons at her house&mdash;lunch with her, drive with
      her. For one omission Cynthia was thankful: she did not mention Bob
      Worthington's name. There was the romance under Miss Duncan's nose, and
      she did not see it. It is frequently so with romancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's impassiveness, her complete poise, had fascinated Miss Duncan
      with the others. Had there been nothing beneath that exterior, Janet would
      never have guessed it, and she would have been quite as happy. Cynthia saw
      very clearly that Mr. Worthington or no other man or woman could force Bob
      to marry Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, in such intervals as her studies permitted, Janet
      continued her attentions to Cynthia. That same morning she had brought a
      note from her father to Miss Sadler, of the contents of which Janet knew
      nothing. Miss Sadler retired into her study to read it, and two newspaper
      clippings fell out of it under the paper-cutter. This was the note:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;My DEAR MISS SADLER:

   &ldquo;Mrs. Duncan has referred your note to me, and I enclose two
   clippings which speak for themselves. Miss Wetherell, I believe,
   stands in the relation of ward to the person to whom they refer, and
   her father was a sort of political assistant to this person.
   Although, as you say, we are from that part of the country (Miss
   Sadler bad spoken of the Duncans as the people of importance there),
   it was by the merest accident that Miss Wetherell's connection with
   this Jethro Bass was brought to my notice.

   &ldquo;Sincerely yours,

   &ldquo;ALEXANDER DUNCAN.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      It is pleasant to know that there were people in the world who could snub
      Miss Sadler; and there could be no doubt, from the manner in which she
      laid the letter down and took up the clippings, that Miss Sadler felt
      snubbed: equally, there could be no doubt that the revenge would fall on
      other shoulders than Mr. Duncan's. And when Miss Sadler proceeded to read
      the clippings, her hair would have stood on end with horror had it not
      been so efficiently plastered down. Miss Sadler seized her pen, and began
      a letter to Mrs. Merrill. Miss Sadler's knowledge of the proprieties&mdash;together
      with other qualifications&mdash;had made her school what it was. No
      Cynthia Wetherells had ever before entered its sacred portals, or should
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of these clippings was the article containing the arraignment of
      Jethro Bass which Mr. Merrill had shown to his wife, and which had been
      the excuse for Miss Penniman's call. The second was one which Mr. Duncan
      had clipped from the Newcastle Guardian of the day before, and gave, from
      Mr. Worthington's side, a very graphic account of the conflict which was
      to tear the state asunder. The railroads were tired of paying toll to the
      chief of a band of thieves and cutthroats, to a man who had long throttled
      the state which had nourished him, to&mdash;in short,&mdash;to Jethro
      Bass. Miss Sadler was not much interested in the figures and metaphors of
      political compositions. Right had found a champion&mdash;the article
      continued&mdash;in Mr. Isaac D. Worthington of Brampton, president of the
      Truro Road and owner of large holdings elsewhere. Mr. Worthington, backed
      by other respectable property interests, would fight this monster of
      iniquity to the death, and release the state from his thraldom. Jethro
      Bass, the article alleged, was already about his abominable work&mdash;had
      long been so&mdash;as in mockery of that very vigilance which is said to
      be the price of liberty. His agents were busy in every town of the state,
      seeing to it that the slaves of Jethro Bass should be sent to the next
      legislature.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was this system which he had built up among these rural
      communities? It might aptly be called the System of Mortgages. The
      mortgage&mdash;dread name for a dreadful thing&mdash;was the chief weapon
      of the monster. Even as Jethro Bass held the mortgages of Coniston and
      Tarleton and round about, so his lieutenants held mortgages in every town
      and hamlet of the state, What was a poor farmer to do&mdash;? His choice
      was not between right and wrong, but between a roof over the heads of his
      wife and children and no roof. He must vote for the candidate of Jethro
      Bass end corruption or become a homeless wanderer. How the gentleman and
      his other respectable backers were to fight the system the article did not
      say. Were they to buy up all the mortgages? As a matter of fact, they
      intended to buy up enough of these to count, but to mention this would be
      to betray the methods of Mr. Worthington's reform. The first bitter
      frontier fighting between the advance cohorts of the new giant and the old&mdash;the
      struggle for the caucuses and the polls&mdash;had begun. Miss Sadler cared
      but little and understood less of all this matter. She lingered over the
      sentences which described Jethro Bass as a monster of iniquity, as a
      pariah with whom decent men would have no intercourse, and in the heat of
      her passion that one who had touched him had gained admittance to the most
      exclusive school for young ladies in the country she wrote a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Sadler wrote the letter, and three hours later tore it up and wrote
      another and more diplomatic one. Mrs. Merrill, though not by any means of
      the same importance as Mrs. Duncan, was not a person to be wantonly
      offended, and might&mdash;knowing nothing about the monster&mdash;in the
      goodness of her heart have taken the girl into her house. Had it been
      otherwise, surely Mrs. Merrill would not have had the effrontery! She
      would give Mrs. Merrill a chance. The bell of release from studies was
      ringing as she finished this second letter, and Miss Sadler in her haste
      forgot to enclose the clippings. She ran out in time to intercept Susan
      Merrill at the door, and to press into her hands the clippings and the
      note, with a request to take both to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the Duncans dined in the evening, the Merrills had dinner at
      half-past one in the afternoon, when the girls returned from school. Mr.
      Merrill usually came home, but he had gone off somewhere for this
      particular day, and Mrs. Merrill had a sewing circle. The girls sat down
      to dinner alone. When they got up from the table, Susan suddenly
      remembered the note which she had left in her coat pocket. She drew out
      the clippings with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what Miss Sadler is sending mamma clippings for,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Why, Cynthia, they're about your uncle. Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she handed over the article headed &ldquo;Jethro Bass.&rdquo; Jane, who had
      quicker intuitions than her sister, would have snatched it from Cynthia's
      hand, and it was a long time before Susan forgave herself for her folly.
      Thus Miss Sadler had her revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is often mercifully ordained that the mightiest blows of misfortune are
      tempered for us. During the winter evenings in Coniston, Cynthia had read
      little newspaper attacks on Jethro, and scorned them as the cowardly
      devices of enemies. They had been, indeed, but guarded and covert
      allusions&mdash;grimaces from a safe distance. Cynthia's first sensation
      as she read was anger&mdash;anger so intense as to send all the blood in
      her body rushing to her head. But what was this? &ldquo;Right had found a
      champion at last&rdquo; in&mdash;in Isaac D. Worthington! That was the first
      blow, and none but Cynthia knew the weight of it. It sank but slowly into
      her consciousness, and slowly the blood left her face, slowly but surely:
      left it at length as white as the lace curtain of the window which she
      clutched in her distress. Words which somebody had spoken were ringing in
      her ears. Whatever happens! &ldquo;Whatever happens I will never desert you,
      never deny you, as long as I live.&rdquo; This, then, was what he had meant by
      newspapers, and why he had come to her!
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters, watching her, cried out in dismay. There was no need to tell
      them that they were looking on at a tragedy, and all the love and sympathy
      in their hearts went out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia! Cynthia! What is it?&rdquo; cried Susan, who, thinking she would
      faint, seized her in her arms. &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia did not faint, being made of sterner substance. Gently, but with
      that inexorable instinct of her kind which compels them to look for
      reliance within themselves even in the direst of extremities, Cynthia
      released herself from Susan's embrace and put a hand to her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you leave me here a little while&mdash;alone?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jane now who drew Susan out and shut the door of the parlor after
      them. In utter misery they waited on the stairs while Cynthia fought out
      her battle for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone she sank down into the big chair under the reading
      lamp&mdash;the very chair in which he had sat only two nights before. She
      saw now with a terrible clearness the thing which for so long had been but
      a vague premonition of disaster, and for a while she forgot the clippings.
      And when after a space the touch of them in her hand brought them back to
      her remembrance, she lacked the courage to read them through. But not for
      long. Suddenly her fear of them gave place to a consuming hatred of the
      man who had inspired these articles: of Isaac D. Worthington, for she knew
      that he must have inspired them. And then she began again to read them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth, though it come perverted from the mouth of an enemy, has in itself
      a note to which the soul responds, let the mind deny as vehemently as it
      will. Cynthia read, and as she read her body was shaken with sobs, though
      the tears came not. Could it be true? Could the least particle of the
      least of these fearful insinuations be true? Oh, the treason of those
      whispers in a voice that was surely not her own, and yet which she could
      not hush! Was it possible that such things could be printed about one whom
      she had admired and respected above all men&mdash;nay, whom she had so
      passionately adored from childhood? A monster of iniquity, a pariah! The
      cruel, bitter calumny of those names! Cynthia thought of his goodness and
      loving kindness and his charity to her and to many others. His charity!
      The dreaded voice repeated that word, and sent a thought that struck
      terror into her heart: Whence had come the substance of that charity? Then
      came another word&mdash;mortgage. There it was on the paper, and at sight
      of it there leaped out of her memory a golden-green poplar shimmering
      against the sky and the distant blue billows of mountains in the west. She
      heard the high-pitched voice of a woman speaking the word, and even then
      it had had a hateful sound, and she heard herself asking, &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,
      what is a mortgage?&rdquo; He had struck his horse with the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loyal though the girl was, the whispers would not hush, nor the doubts
      cease to assail her. What if ever so small a portion of this were true?
      Could the whole of this hideous structure, tier resting upon tier, have
      been reared without something of a foundation? Fiercely though she told
      herself she would believe none of it, fiercely though she hated Mr.
      Worthington, fervently though she repeated aloud that her love for Jethro
      and her faith in him had not changed, the doubts remained. Yet they
      remained unacknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed. It was a thing beyond belief that one hour could have held
      such a store of agony. An hour passed, and Cynthia came dry-eyed from the
      parlor. Susan and Jane, waiting to give her comfort when she was recovered
      a little from this unknown but overwhelming affliction, were fain to stand
      mute when they saw her to pay a silent deference to one whom sorrow had
      lifted far above them and transfigured. That was the look on Cynthia's
      face. She went up the stairs, and they stood in the hall not knowing what
      to do, whispering in awe-struck voices. They were still there when Cynthia
      came down again, dressed for the street. Jane seized her by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, Cynthia?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be back by five,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up the hill, and across to old Louisburg Square, and up the hill
      again. The weather had cleared, the violet-paned windows caught the
      slanting sunlight and flung it back across the piles of snow. It was a day
      for wedding-bells. At last Cynthia came to a queerly fashioned little
      green door that seemed all askew with the slanting street, and rang the
      bell, and in another moment was standing on the threshold of Miss Lucretia
      Penniman's little sitting room. To Miss Lucretia, at her writing table,
      one glance was sufficient. She rose quickly to meet the girl, kissed her
      unresponsive cheek, and led her to a chair. Miss Lucretia was never one to
      beat about the bush, even in the gravest crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have read the articles,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read them! During her walk hither Cynthia had been incapable of thought,
      but the epithets and arraignments and accusations, the sentences and
      paragraphs, wars printed now, upon her brain, never, she believed, to be
      effaced. Every step of the way she had been unconsciously repeating them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you read them?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has everybody read them?&rdquo; Did the whole world, then, know of her shame?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you came to me, my dear,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, taking her hand.
      &ldquo;Have you talked of this to any one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cynthia, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia was puzzled. She had not looked for apathy, but she did not
      know all of Cynthia's troubles. She wondered whether she had misjudged the
      girl, and was misled by her attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; she said, with a briskness meant to hide emotion for Miss
      Lucretia had emotions, &ldquo;I am a lonely old woman, getting too old, indeed,
      to finish the task of my life. I went to see Mrs. Merrill the other day to
      ask her if she would let you come and live with me. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Miss Lucretia, I cannot,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't press it on you now,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot, Miss Lucretia. I'm going to Coniston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to Coniston!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Lucretia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of that place&mdash;magic name, once so replete with visions of
      happiness and content&mdash;seemed to recall Cynthia's spirit from its
      flight. Yes, the spirit was there, for it flashed in her eyes as she
      turned and looked into Miss Lucretia's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are these the articles you read?&rdquo; she asked; taking the clippings from
      her muff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia put on her spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen both of them,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you believe what they say about&mdash;about Jethro Bass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor Miss Lucretia! For once in her life she was at a loss. She, too, paid
      a deference to that face, young as it was. She had robbed herself of sleep
      trying to make up her mind what she would say upon such an occasion if it
      came. A wonderful virgin faith had to be shattered, and was she to be the
      executioner? She loved the girl with that strange, intense affection which
      sometimes comes to the elderly and the lonely, and she had prayed that
      this cup might pass from her. Was it possible that it was her own voice
      using very much the same words for which she had rebuked Mrs. Merrill?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;those articles were written by politicians, in a
      political controversy. No such articles can ever be taken literally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lucretia, do you believe what it says about Jethro Bass?&rdquo; repeated
      Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was she to avoid those eyes? They pierced into, her soul, even as her
      own had pierced into Mrs. Merrill's. Oh, Miss Lucretia, who pride yourself
      on your plain speaking, that you should be caught quibbling! Miss Lucretia
      blushed for the first time in many, years, and into her face came the
      light of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a coward, my dear. I deserve your rebuke. To the best of my
      knowledge and belief, and so far as I can judge from the inquiries I have
      undertaken, Jethro Bass has made his living and gained and held his power
      by the methods described in those articles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia took off her spectacles and wiped them. She had committed a
      fine act of courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that is what I wanted to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; cried Miss Lucretia, in amazement and apprehension, &ldquo;but what
      are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Coniston,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;to ask him if those things are
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To ask him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If he tells me they are true, then I shall believe them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he tells you?&rdquo; Miss Lucretia gasped. Here was a courage of which she
      had not reckoned. &ldquo;Do you think he will tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will tell me, and I shall believe him, Miss Lucretia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a remarkable girl, Cynthia,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, involuntarily.
      Then she paused for a moment. &ldquo;Suppose he tells you they are true? You
      surely can't live with him again, Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose I am going to desert him, Miss Lucretia?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;He
      loves me, and&mdash;and I love him.&rdquo; This was the first time her voice had
      faltered. &ldquo;He kept my father from want and poverty, and he has brought me
      up as a daughter. If his life has been as you say, I shall make my own
      living!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; demanded Miss Lucretia, the practical part of her coming uppermost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall teach school. I believe I can get a position, in a place where I
      can see him often. I can break his heart, Miss Lucretia, I&mdash;I can
      bring sadness to myself, but I will not desert him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia stared at her for a moment, not knowing what to say or do.
      She perceived that the girl had a spirit as strong as her own: that her
      plans were formed, her mind made up, and that no arguments could change
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you come to me?&rdquo; she asked irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I thought that you would have read the articles, and I knew if
      you had, you would have taken the trouble to inform yourself of the
      world's opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Miss Lucretia stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go to Coniston with you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;at least as far as Brampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's face softened a little at the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather go alone, Miss Lucretia,&rdquo; she answered gently, but with
      the same firmness. &ldquo;I&mdash;I am very grateful to you for your kindness to
      me in Boston. I shall not forget it&mdash;or you. Good-by, Miss Lucretia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Lucretia, sobbing openly, gathered the girl in her arms and
      pressed her. Age was coming on her indeed, that she should show such
      weakness. For a long time she could not trust herself to speak, and then
      her words were broken. Cynthia must come to her at the first sign of doubt
      or trouble: this, Miss Lucretia's house, was to be a refuge in any storm
      that life might send&mdash;and Miss Lucretia's heart. Cynthia promised,
      and when she went out at last through the little door her own tears were
      falling, for she loved Miss Lucretia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was going to Coniston. That journey was as fixed, as inevitable,
      as things mortal can be. She would go to Coniston unless she perished on
      the way. No loving entreaties, no fears of Mrs. Merrill or her daughters,
      were of any avail. Mrs. Merrill too, was awed by the vastness of the
      girl's sorrow, and wondered if her own nature were small by comparison.
      She had wept, to be sure, at her husband's confession, and lain awake over
      it in the night watches, and thought of the early days of their marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, Mrs. Merrill told herself, Cynthia would have to talk with Mr.
      Merrill. How was he to come unscathed out of that? There was pain and
      bitterness in that thought, and almost resentment against Cynthia,
      quivering though she was with sympathy for the girl. For Mrs. Merrill,
      though the canker remained, had already pardoned her husband and had asked
      the forgiveness of God for that pardon. On other occasions, in other
      crisis, she had waited and watched for him in the parlor window, and
      to-night she was at the door before his key was in the lock, while he was
      still stamping the snow from his boots. She drew him into the room and
      told him what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Stephen,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what are you going to say to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What, indeed? His wife had sorrowed, but she had known the obstacles and
      perils by which he had been beset. But what was he to say to Cynthia? Her
      very name had grown upon him, middle-aged man of affairs though he was,
      until the thought of it summoned up in his mind a figure of purity, and of
      the strength which was from purity. He would not have believed it possible
      that the country girl whom they had taken into their house three months
      before should have wrought such an influence over them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the first hour of her sorrow which she had spent that afternoon in
      the parlor, Cynthia had thought of Mr. Merrill. He could tell her whether
      those accusations were true or false, for he was a friend of Jethro's. Her
      natural impulse&mdash;the primeval one of a creature which is hurt&mdash;had
      been to hide herself; to fly to her own room, and perhaps by nightfall the
      courage would come to her to ask him the terrible questions. He was a
      friend of Jethro's. An illuminating flash revealed to her the meaning of
      that friendship&mdash;if the accusations were true. It was then she had
      thought of Miss Lucretia Penniman, and somehow she had found the courage
      to face the sunlight and go to her. She would spare Mr. Merrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      But had she spared him? Sadly the family sat down to supper without her,
      and after supper Mr. Merrill sent a message to his club that he could not
      attend a committee meeting there that evening. He sat with his wife in the
      little writing room, he pretending to read and she pretending to sew,
      until the silence grew too oppressive, and they spoke of the matter that
      was in their hearts. It was one of the bitterest evenings in Mr. Merrill's
      life, and there is no need to linger on it. They talked earnestly of
      Cynthia, and of her future. But they both knew why she did not come down
      to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she is really going to Coniston,&rdquo; said Mr. Merrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Merrill, &ldquo;and I think she is doing right, Stephen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill groaned. His wife rose and put her hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Stephen,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;you will see her in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go to Coniston with her,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Merrily &ldquo;she wants to go alone. And I believe it is
      best that she should.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Great afflictions generally bring in their train a host of smaller
      sorrows, each with its own little pang. One of these sorrows had been the
      parting with the Merrill family. Under any circumstance it was not easy
      for Cynthia to express her feelings, and now she had found it very
      difficult to speak of the gratitude and affection which she felt. But they
      understood&mdash;dear, good people that they were: no eloquence was needed
      with them. The ordeal of breakfast over, and the tearful &ldquo;God bless you,
      Miss Cynthia,&rdquo; of Ellen the parlor-maid, the whole family had gone with
      her to the station. For Susan and Jane had spent their last day at Miss
      Sadler's school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Merrill had sent for the conductor and bidden him take care of Miss
      Wetherell, and recommend her in his name to a conductor on the Truro Road.
      The man took off his cap to Mr. Merrill and called him by name and
      promised. It was a dark day, and long after the train had pulled out
      Cynthia remembered the tearful faces of the family standing on the damp
      platform of the station. As they fled northward through the flat
      river-meadows, the conductor would have liked to talk to her of Mr.
      Merrill; there were few employees on any railroad who did not know the
      genial and kindly president of the Grand Gulf and sympathize with his
      troubles. But there was a look on the girl's face that forbade intrusion.
      Passengers stared at her covertly, as though fascinated by that look, and
      some tried to fathom it. But her eyes were firmly fixed upon a point far
      beyond their vision. The car stopped many times, and flew on again, but
      nothing seemed to break her absorption.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she was aroused by the touch of the conductor on her sleeve. The
      people were beginning to file out of the car, and the train was under the
      shadow of the snow-covered sheds in the station of the state capital.
      Cynthia recognized the place, though it was cold and bare and very
      different in appearance from what it had been on the summer's evening when
      she had come into it with her father. That, in effect, had been her first
      glimpse of the world, and well she recalled the thrill it had given her.
      The joy of such things was gone now, the rapture of holidays and new
      sights. These were over, so she told herself. Sorrow had quenched the
      thrills forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind conductor led her to the eating room, and when she would not eat
      his concern drew greater than ever. He took a strange interest in this
      young lady who had such a face and such eyes. He pointed her out to his
      friend the Truro conductor, and gave him some sandwiches and fruit which
      he himself had bought, with instructions to press them on her during the
      afternoon.
    </p>

      Cynthia could not eat. She hated this place, with its memories. Hated it,
      too, as a mart where men were bought and sold, for the wording of those
      articles ran in her head as though some priest of evil were chanting them
      in her ears. She did not remember then the sweeter aspect of the old town,
      its pretty homes set among their shaded gardens&mdash;homes full of good
      and kindly people. State House affairs were far removed from most of
      these, and the sickness and corruption of the body politic. And this
      political corruption, had she known it, was no worse than that of the
      other states in the wide Union: not so bad, indeed, as many, though this
      was small comfort. No comfort at all to Cynthia, who did not think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while she rose and followed the new conductor to the Truro train,
      glad to leave the capital behind her. She was going to the hills&mdash;to
      the mountains. They, in truth, could not change, though the seasons passed
      over them, hot and cold, wet and dry. They were immutable in their
      goodness. Presently she saw them, the lower ones: the waters of the little
      stream beside her broke the black bonds of ice and raced over the rapids;
      the engine was puffing and groaning on the grade. Then the sun crept out,
      slowly, from the indefinable margin of vapor that hung massed over the low
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she had come to the hills. Up and up climbed the train, through the
      little white villages in the valley nooks, banked with whiter snow;
      through the narrow gorges,&mdash;sometimes hanging over them,&mdash;under
      steep granite walls seared with ice-filled cracks, their brows hung with
      icicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truro Pass is not so high as the Brenner, but it has a grand, wild look in
      winter, remote as it is from the haunts of men. A fitting refuge, it might
      be, for a great spirit heavy with the sins of the world below. Such a
      place might have been chosen, in the olden time, for a monastery&mdash;a
      gray fastness built against the black forest over the crag looking down
      upon the green clumps of spruces against the snow. Some vague longing for
      such a refuge was in Cynthia's heart as she gazed upon that silent place,
      and then the waters had already begun to run westward&mdash;the waters of
      Tumble Down brook, which flowed into Coniston Water above Brampton. The
      sun still had more than two hours to go on its journey to the hill crests
      when the train pulled into Brampton station. There were but a few people
      on the platform, but the first face she saw as she stepped from the car
      was Lem Hallowell's. It was a very red face, as we know, and its owner was
      standing in front of the Coniston stage, on runners now. He stared at her
      for an instant, and no wonder, and then he ran forward with outstretched
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy&mdash;Cynthy Wetherell!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Great Godfrey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got so far, he seized her hands, and then he stopped, not knowing why.
      There were many more ejaculations and welcomes and what not on the end of
      his tongue. It was not that she had become a lady&mdash;a lady of a type
      he had never before seen. He meant to say that, too, in his own way, but
      he couldn't. And that transformation would have bothered Lem but little.
      What was the change, then? Why was he in awe of her&mdash;he, Lem
      Hallowell, who had never been in awe of any one? He shook his head, as
      though openly confessing his inability to answer that question. He wanted
      to ask others, but they would not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lem,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am so glad you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Climb right in, Cynthy. I'll get the trunk.&rdquo; There it lay, the little
      rawhide one before him on the boards, and he picked it up in his bare
      hands as though it had been a paper parcel. It was a peculiarity of the
      stage driver that he never wore gloves, even in winter, so remarkable was
      the circulation of his blood. After the trunk he deposited, apparently
      with equal ease, various barrels and boxes, and then he jumped in beside
      Cynthia, and they drove down familiar Brampton Street, as wide as a wide
      river; past the meeting-house with the terraced steeple; past the
      postoffice,&mdash;Cousin Ephraim's postoffice,&mdash;where Lem gave her a
      questioning look&mdash;but she shook her head, and he did not wait for the
      distribution of the last mail that day; past the great mansion of Isaac D.
      Worthington, where the iron mastiffs on the lawn were up to their muzzles
      in snow. After that they took the turn to the right, which was the road to
      Coniston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well-remembered road, and in winter or summer, Cynthia knew every tree and
      farmhouse beside it. Now it consisted of two deep grooves in the deep
      snow; that was all, save for a curving turnout here and there for team to
      pass team. Well-remembered scene! How often had Cynthia looked upon it in
      happier days! Such a crust was on the snow as would bear a heavy man; and
      the pasture hillocks were like glazed cakes in the window of a baker's
      shop. Never had the western sky looked so yellow through the black columns
      of the pine trunks. A lonely, beautiful road it was that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time the silence of the great hills was broken only by the
      sweet jingle of the bells on the shaft. Many a day, winter and summer, Lem
      had gone that road alone, whistling, and never before heeding that
      silence. Now it seemed to symbolize a great sorrow: to be in subtle
      harmony with that of the girl at his side. What that sorrow was he could
      not guess. The good man yearned to comfort her, and yet he felt his
      comfort too humble to be noticed by such sorrow. He longed to speak, but
      for the first time in his life feared the sound of his own voice. Cynthia
      had not spoken since she left the station, had not looked at him, had not
      asked for the friends and neighbors whom she had loved so well&mdash;had
      not asked for Jethro! Was there any sorrow on earth to be felt like that?
      And was there one to feel it?
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when they reached the great forest, Lem Hallowell knew that he
      must speak or cry aloud. But what would be the sound of his voice&mdash;after
      such an age of disuse? Could he speak at all? Broken and hoarse and
      hideous though the sound might be, he must speak. And hoarse and broken it
      was. It was not his own, but still it was a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks&mdash;folks'll be surprised to see you, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, he had not spoken at all. Yes, he had, for she answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they will, Lem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mighty glad to have you back, Cynthy. We think a sight of you. We missed
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Lem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro hain't lookin' for you by any chance, be he?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. But the question startled her. Suppose he had not been at
      home! She had never once thought of that. Could she have borne to wait for
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      After that Lem gave it up. He had satisfied himself as to his vocal
      powers, but he had not the courage even to whistle. The journey to
      Coniston was faster in the winter, and at the next turn of the road the
      little village came into view. There it was, among the snows. The pain in
      Cynthia's heart, so long benumbed, quickened when she saw it. How write of
      the sharpness of that pain to those who have never known it? The sight of
      every gable brought its agony,&mdash;the store with the checker-paned
      windows, the harness shop, the meeting-house, the white parsonage on its
      little hill. Rias Richardson ran out of the store in his carpet slippers,
      bareheaded in the cold, and gave one shout. Lem heeded him not; did not
      stop there as usual, but drove straight to the tannery house and pulled up
      under the butternut tree. Milly Skinner ran out on the porch, and gave one
      long look, and cried:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, it's Cynthy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Jethro?&rdquo; demanded Lem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Milly did not answer at once. She was staring at Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's in the tannery shed,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;choppin' wood.&rdquo; But still she kept
      her eyes on Cynthia's face. &ldquo;I'll fetch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;I'll go to him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the path, leaving Millicent with her mouth open, too amazed to
      speak again, and yet not knowing why.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tannery shed! Would Jethro remember what happened there almost six
      and thirty years before? Would he remember how that other Cynthia had come
      to him there, and what her appeal had been?
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia came to the doors. One of these was open now&mdash;both had been
      closed that other evening against the storm of sleet&mdash;and she caught
      a glimpse of him standing on the floor of chips and bark&mdash;tan-bark no
      more. Cynthia caught a glimpse of him, and love suddenly welled up into
      her heart as waters into a spring after a drought. He had not seen her,
      not heard the sound of the sleigh-bells. He was standing with his foot
      upon the sawbuck and the saw across his knee, he was staring at the
      woodpile, and there was stamped upon his face a look which no man or woman
      had ever seen there, a look of utter loneliness and desolation, a look as
      of a soul condemned to wander forever through the infinite, cold spaces
      between the worlds&mdash;alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia stopped at sight of it. What had been her misery and affliction
      compared to this? Her limbs refused her, though she knew not whether she
      would have fled or rushed into his arms. How long she stood thus, and he
      stood, may not be said, but at length he put down his foot and took the
      saw from his knee, his eyes fell upon her, and his lips spoke her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Speechless, she ran to him and flung her arms about his neck, and he
      dropped the saw and held her tightly&mdash;even as he had held that other
      Cynthia in that place in the year gone by. And yet not so. Now he clung to
      her with a desperation that was terrible, as though to let go of her would
      be to fall into nameless voids beyond human companionship and love. But at
      last he did release her, and stood looking down into her face, as if
      seeking to read a sentence there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And how was she to pronounce that sentence! Though her faith might be
      taken away, her love remained, and grew all the greater because he needed
      it. Yet she knew that no subterfuge or pretence would avail her to hide
      why she had come. She could not hide it. It must be spoken out now, though
      death was preferable.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was waiting. Did he guess? She could not tell. He had spoken no
      word but her name. He had expressed no surprise at her appearance, asked
      no reasons for it. Superlatives of suffering or joy or courage are hard to
      convey&mdash;words fall so far short of the feeling. And Cynthia's pain
      was so far beyond tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;yesterday something&mdash;something happened. I
      could not stay in Boston any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to come to you. I could not wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I read something.&rdquo; To take a white-hot iron and sear herself
      would have been easier than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that the look was coming again&mdash;the look which she had
      surprised in his face. His hands dropped lifelessly from her shoulders,
      and he turned and went to the door, where he stood with his back to her,
      silhouetted against the eastern sky all pink from the reflection of
      sunset. He would not help her. Perhaps he could not. The things were true.
      There had been a grain of hope within her, ready to sprout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I read two articles from the Newcastle Guardian about you&mdash;about
      your life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. But he did not turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you had&mdash;how you had earned your living. How you had gained your
      power,&rdquo; she went on, her pain lending to her voice an exquisite note of
      many modulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Cynthy,&rdquo; he said, and still stared at the eastern sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took two steps toward him, her arms outstretched, her fingers opening
      and closing. And then she stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would believe no one,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will believe no one&mdash;until&mdash;unless
      you tell me. Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she cried in agony, &ldquo;Uncle Jethro, tell me
      that those things are not true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waited a space, but he did not stir. There was no sound, save the song
      of Coniston Water under the shattered ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you speak to me?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Won't you tell me that they are
      not true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His shoulders shook convulsively. O for the right to turn to her and tell
      her that they were lies! He would have bartered his soul for it. What was
      all the power in the world compared to this priceless treasure he had
      lost? Once before he had cast it away, though without meaning to. Then he
      did not know the eternal value of love&mdash;of such love as those two
      women had given him. Now he knew that it was beyond value, the one
      precious gift of life, and the knowledge had come too late. Could he have
      saved his life if he had listened to that other Cynthia?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you tell me that they are not true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even then he did not turn to her, but he answered. Curious to relate,
      though his heart was breaking, his voice was steady&mdash;steady as it
      always had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I've seen it comin', Cynthy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never knowed anything I
      was afraid of before&mdash;but I was afraid of this. I knowed what your
      notions of right and wrong was&mdash;your&mdash;your mother had them.
      They're the principles of good people. I&mdash;I knowed the day would come
      when you'd ask, but I wanted to be happy as long as I could. I hain't been
      happy, Cynthy. But you was right when you said I'd tell you the truth.
      S-so I will. I guess them things which you speak about are true&mdash;the
      way I got where I am, and the way I made my livin'. They&mdash;they hain't
      put just as they'd ought to be, perhaps, but that's the way I done it in
      the main.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was thus that Jethro Bass met the supreme crisis of his life. And who
      shall say he did not meet it squarely and honestly? Few men of finer fibre
      and more delicate morals would have acquitted themselves as well. That was
      a Judgment Day for Jethro; and though he knew it not, he spoke through
      Cynthia to his Maker, confessing his faults freely and humbly, and
      dwelling on the justness of his punishment; putting not forward any good
      he may have done; nor thinking of it; nor seeking excuse because of the
      light that was in him. Had he been at death's door in the face of nameless
      tortures, no man could have dragged such a confession from him. But a
      great love had been given him, and to that love he must speak the truth,
      even at the cost of losing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not to lose it. Even as he was speaking a thrill of admiration
      ran through Cynthia, piercing her sorrow. The superb strength of the man
      was there in that simple confession, and it is in the nature of woman to
      admire strength. He had fought his fight, and gained, and paid the price
      without a murmur, seeking no palliation. Cynthia had not come to that
      trial&mdash;so bitter for her&mdash;as a judge. If the reader has seen
      youth and innocence sitting in the seat of justice, with age and
      experience at the bar, he has mistaken Cynthia. She came to Coniston
      inexorable, it is true, because hers was a nature impelled to do right
      though it perish. She did not presume to say what Jethro's lights and
      opportunities might have been. Her own she knew, and by them she must act
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished speaking, she stole silently to his side and slipped
      her hand in his. He trembled violently at her touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said in a low tone, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words he trembled more violently still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Cynthy,&rdquo; he answered thickly, &ldquo;don't say that&mdash;I&mdash;I
      don't expect it, Cynthy, I know you can't&mdash;'twouldn't be right,
      Cynthy. I hain't fit for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I love you better than I have ever loved you in
      my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how welcome were the tears! and how human! He turned, pitifully
      incredulous, wondering that she should seek by deceit to soften the blow;
      he saw them running down her cheeks, and he believed. Yes, he believed,
      though it seemed a thing beyond belief. Unworthy, unfit though he were,
      she loved him. And his own love as he gazed at her, sevenfold increased as
      it had been by the knowledge of losing her, changed in texture from homage
      to worship&mdash;nay, to adoration. His punishment would still be heavy;
      but whence had come such a wondrous gift to mitigate it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't you believe me?&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;can't you see that it is true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And yet he could only hold her there at arm's length with that new and
      strange reverence in his face. He was not worthy to touch her, but still
      she loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flush had faded from the eastern sky, and the faintest border of
      yellow light betrayed the ragged outlines of the mountain as they walked
      together to the tannery house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Millicent, in the kitchen, was making great preparations&mdash;for
      Millicent. Miss Skinner was a person who had hitherto laid it down as a
      principle of life to pay deference or do honor to no human made of mere
      dust, like herself. Millicent's exception; if Cynthia had thought about
      it, was a tribute of no mean order. Cynthia, alas, did not think about it:
      she did not know that, in her absence, the fire had not been lighted in
      the evening, Jethro supping on crackers and milk and Milly partaking of
      the evening meal at home. Moreover, Miss Skinner had an engagement with a
      young man. Cynthia saw the fire, and threw off her sealskin coat which Mr.
      and Mrs. Merrill had given her for Christmas, and took down the saucepan
      from the familiar nail on which it hung. It was a miraculous fact, for
      which she did not attempt to account, that she was almost happy: happy,
      indeed, in comparison to that which had been her state since the afternoon
      before. Millicent snatched the saucepan angrily from her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What be you doin', Cynthy?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Miss Skinner's little way of showing deference. Though deference
      is not usually vehement, Miss Skinner's was very real, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Milly, what's the matter?&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hain't a-goin' to do any cookin', that's all,&rdquo; said Milly, very red
      in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've always helped,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why not? A tribute was one thing, but to have to put the reasons for that
      tribute, into words was quite another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; cried Milly, &ldquo;because you hain't a-goin' to, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strange deference! But Cynthia turned and looked at the girl with a
      little, sad smile of comprehension and affection. She took her by the
      shoulders and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon a most amazing thing happened&mdash;Millicent burst into tears&mdash;wild,
      ungovernable tears they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you hain't a-goin' to,&rdquo; she repeated, her words interspersed with
      violent sobs. &ldquo;You go 'way, Cynthy,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;git out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Milly,&rdquo; said Cynthia, shaking her head, &ldquo;you ought to be ashamed of
      yourself.&rdquo; But they were not words of reproof. She took a little lamp from
      the shelf, and went up the narrow stairs to her own room in the gable,
      where Lemuel had deposited the rawhide trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though she had had nothing all day, she felt no hunger, but for Milly's
      sake she tried hard to eat the supper when it came. Before it had fairly
      begun Moses Hatch had arrived, with Amandy and Eben; and Rias Richardson
      came in, and other neighbors, to say a word of welcome to hear (if the
      truth be not too disparaging to their characters) the reasons for her
      sudden appearance, and such news of her Boston experiences as she might
      choose to give them. They had learned from Lem Hallowell that Cynthia had
      returned a lady: a real lady, not a sham one who relied on airs and
      graces, such as had come to Coniston the summer before to look for a
      summer place on the painter's recommendation. Lem was not a gossip, in the
      disagreeable sense of the term, and he had not said a word to his
      neighbors of his feelings on that terrible drive from Brampton. Knowing
      that some blow had fallen upon Cynthia, he would have spared her these
      visits if he could. But Lem was wise and kind, so he merely said that she
      had returned a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they had found a lady. As they stood or sat around the kitchen (Eben
      and Rias stood), Cynthia talked to them&mdash;about Coniston: rather, be
      it said, that they talked about Coniston in answer to her questions. The
      sledding had been good; Moses had hauled so many thousand feet of lumber
      to Brampton; Sam Price's woman (she of Harwich) had had a spell of
      sciatica; Chester Perkins's bull had tossed his brother-in-law, come from
      Iowy on a visit, and broke his leg; yes, Amandy guessed her dyspepsy was
      somewhat improved since she had tried Graham's Golden Remedy&mdash;it made
      her feel real lighthearted; Eben (blushing furiously) was to have the
      Brook Farm in the spring; there was a case of spotted fever in Tarleton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Lem Hallowell had been right, Cynthia was a lady, but not a mite
      stuck up. What was the difference in her? Not her clothes, which she wore
      as if she had been used to them all her life. Poor Cynthia, the clothes
      were simple enough. Not her manner, which was as kind and sweet as ever.
      What was it that compelled their talk about themselves, that made them
      refrain from asking those questions about Boston, and why she had come
      back? Some such query was running in their minds as they talked, while
      Jethro, having finished his milk and crackers, sat silent at the end of
      the table with his eyes upon her. He rose when Mr. Satterlee came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Satterlee looked at her, and then he went quietly across the room and
      kissed her. But then Mr. Satterlee was the minister. Cynthia thought his
      hair a little thinner and the lines in his face a little deeper. And Mr.
      Satterlee thought perhaps he was the only one of the visitors who guessed
      why she had come back. He laid his thin hand on her head, as though in
      benediction, and sat down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is the learning, Cynthia?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, indeed, they were going to hear something at last. An intuition
      impelled Cynthia to take advantage of that opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The learning has become so great, Mr. Satterlee,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I have
      come back to try to make some use of it. It shall be wasted no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not dare to look at Jethro, but she was aware that he had sat down
      abruptly. What sacrifice will not a good woman make to ease the burden of
      those whom she loves! And Jethro's burden would be heavy enough. Such a
      woman will speak almost gayly, though her heart be heavy. But Cynthia's
      was lighter now than it had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was always sure you would not waste your learning, Cynthia,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Satterlee, gravely; &ldquo;that you would make the most of the advantages God
      has given you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to try, Mr. Satterlee. I cannot be content in idleness. I was
      wasting time in Boston, and I&mdash;I was not happy so far away from you
      all&mdash;from Uncle Jethro. Mr. Satterlee, I am going to teach school. I
      have always wanted to, and now I have made up my mind to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was Jethro's punishment. But had she not lightened it for him a
      little by choosing this way of telling him that she could not eat his
      bread or partake of his bounty? Though by reason of that bounty she was
      what she was, she could not live and thrive on it longer, coming as it did
      from such a source. Mr. Satterlee might perhaps surmise the truth, but the
      town and village would think her ambition a very natural one, certainly no
      better time could have been chosen to announce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To teach school.&rdquo; She was sure now that Mr. Satterlee knew and approved,
      and perceived something, at least, of her little ruse. He was a man whose
      talents fitted him for a larger flock than he had at Coniston, but he
      possessed neither the graces demanded of city ministers nor the power of
      pushing himself. Never was a more retiring man. The years she had spent in
      his study had not gone for nothing, for he who has cherished the bud can
      predict what the flower will be, and Mr. Satterlee knew her spiritually
      better than any one else in Coniston. He had heard of her return, and had
      walked over to the tannery house, full of fears, the remembrance of those
      expressions of simple faith in Jethro coming back to his mind. Had the
      revelation which he had so long expected come at last? and how had she
      taken it? would it embitter her? The good man believed that it would not,
      and now he saw that it had not, and rejoiced accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To teach school,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I expected that you would wish to, Cynthia.
      It is a desire that most of us have, who like books and what is in them. I
      should have taught school if I had not become a minister. It is a high
      calling, and an absorbing one, to develop the minds of the young.&rdquo; Mr.
      Satterlee was often a little discursive, though there was reason for it on
      this occasion, and Moses Hatch half closed his eyes and bowed his head a
      little out of sheer habit at the sound of the minister's voice. But he
      raised it suddenly at the next words. &ldquo;I was in Brampton yesterday, and
      saw Mr. Graves, who is on the prudential committee of that district. You
      may not have heard that Miss Goddard has left. They have not yet succeeded
      in filling her place, and I think it more than likely that you can get
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia glanced at Jethro, but the habit of years was so strong in him
      that he gave no sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, Mr. Satterlee?&rdquo; she said gratefully. &ldquo;I had heard of the
      place, and hoped for it, because it is near enough for me to spend the
      Saturdays and Sundays with Uncle Jethro. And I meant to go to Brampton
      tomorrow to see about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; said the minister; &ldquo;I have business in Brampton
      to-morrow.&rdquo; He did not mention that this was the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length they had all departed, Jethro rose and went about the house
      making fast the doors, as was his custom, while Cynthia sat staring
      through the bars at the dying embers in the stove. He knew now, and it was
      inevitable that he should know, what she had made up her mind to do. It
      had been decreed that she, who owed him everything, should be made to pass
      this most dreadful of censures upon his whole life. Oh, the cruelty of
      that decree!
    </p>
    <p>
      How, she mused, would it affect him? Had the blow been so great that he
      would relinquish those practices which had become a lifelong habit with
      him? Would he (she caught her breath at this thought) would he abandon
      that struggle with Isaac D. Worthington in which he was striving to
      maintain the mastery of the state by those very practices? Cynthia hated
      Mr. Worthington. The term is not too strong, and it expresses her feeling.
      But she would have got down on her knees on the board floor of the kitchen
      that very night and implored Jethro to desist from that contest, if she
      could. She remembered how, in her innocence, she had believed that the
      people had given Jethro his power,&mdash;in those days when she was so
      proud of that very power,&mdash;now she knew that he had wrested it from
      them. What more supreme sacrifice could he make than to relinquish it! Ah,
      there was a still greater sacrifice that Jethro was to make, had she known
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came and stood over her by the stove, and she looked up into his face
      with these yearnings in her eyes. Yes, she would have thrown herself on
      her knees, if she could. But she could not. Perhaps he would abandon that
      struggle. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps his heart was broken. And could a man with
      a broken heart still fight on? She took his hand and pressed it against
      her face, and he felt that it was wet with her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-better go to bed now, Cynthy,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;m-must be worn out&mdash;m-must
      be worn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and kissed her on the forehead. It was thus that Jethro Bass
      accepted his sentence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      At sunrise, in that Coniston hill-country, it is the western hills which
      are red; and a distant hillock on the meadow farm which was soon to be
      Eden's looked like the daintiest conical cake with pink icing as Cynthia
      surveyed the familiar view the next morning. There was the mountain, the
      pastures on the lower slopes all red, too, and higher up the dark masses
      of bristling spruce and pine and hemlock mottled with white where the
      snow-covered rocks showed through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunrise in January is not very early, and sunrise at any season is not
      early for Coniston. Cynthia sat at her window, and wondered whether that
      beautiful landscape would any longer be hers. Her life had grown up on it;
      but now her life had changed. Would the beauty be taken from it, too?
      Almost hungrily she gazed at the scene. She might look upon it again&mdash;many
      times, perhaps&mdash;but a conviction was strong in her that its daily
      possession would now be only a memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Satterlee was as good as his word, for he was seated in the stage when
      it drew up at the tannery house, ready to go to Brampton. And as they
      drove away Cynthia took one last look at Jethro standing on the porch. It
      seemed to her that it had been given her to feel all things, and to know
      all things: to know, especially, this strange man, Jethro Bass, as none
      other knew him, and to love him as none other loved him. The last severe
      wrench was come, and she had left him standing there alone in the cold,
      divining what was in his heart as though it were in her own. How worthless
      was this mighty power which he had gained, how hateful, when he could not
      bestow the smallest fragment of it upon one whom he loved? Someone has
      described hell as disqualification in the face of opportunity. Such was
      Jethro's torment that morning as he saw her drive away, the minister in
      the place where he should have been, at her side, and he, Jethro Bass, as
      helpless as though he had indeed been in the pit among the flames. Had the
      prudential committee at Brampton promised the appointment ten times over,
      he might still have obtained it for her by a word. And he must not speak
      even that word. Who shall say that a large part of the punishment of
      Jethro Bass did not come to him in the life upon this earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some such thoughts were running in Cynthia's head as they jingled away to
      Brampton that dazzling morning. Perhaps the stage driver, too, who knew
      something of men and things and who meddled not at all, had made a guess
      at the situation. He thought that Cynthia's spirits seemed lightened a
      little, and he meant to lighten them more; so he joked as much as his
      respect for his passengers would permit, and told the news of Brampton.
      Not the least of the news concerned the first citizen of that place. There
      was a certain railroad in the West which had got itself much into
      Congress, and much into the newspapers, and Isaac D. Worthington had got
      himself into that railroad: was gone West, it was said on that business,
      and might not be back for many weeks. And Lem Hallowell remembered when
      Mr. Worthington was a slim-cheated young man wandering up and down
      Coniston Water in search of health. Good Mr. Satterlee, thinking this a
      safe subject, allowed himself to be led into a discussion of the first
      citizen's career, which indeed had something fascinating in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they jingled into Brampton Street and stopped before the cottage of
      Judge Graves&mdash;a courtesy title. The judge himself came to the door
      and bestowed a pronounced bow on the minister, for Mr. Satterlee was
      honored in Brampton. Just think of what Ezra Graves might have looked
      like, and you have him. He greeted Cynthia, too, with a warm welcome&mdash;for
      Ezra Graves,&mdash;and ushered them into a best parlor which was reserved
      for ministers and funerals and great occasions in general, and actually
      raised the blinds. Then Mr. Satterlee, with much hemming and hawing,
      stated the business which had brought them, while Cynthia looked out of
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Graves sat and twirled his lean thumbs. He went so far as to say that
      he admired a young woman who scorned to live in idleness, who wished to
      impart the learning with which she had been endowed. Fifteen applicants
      were under consideration for the position, and the prudential committee
      had so far been unable to declare that any of them were completely
      qualified. (It was well named, that prudential committee?) Mr. Graves,
      furthermore, volunteered that he had expressed a wish to Colonel Prescott
      (Oh, Ephraim, you too have got a title with your new honors!), to Colonel
      Prescott and others, that Miss Wetherell might take the place. The middle
      term opened on the morrow, and Miss Bruce, of the Worthington Free
      Library, had been induced to teach until a successor could be appointed,
      although it was most inconvenient for Miss Bruce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could Miss Wetherell start in at once, provided the committee agreed?
      Cynthia replied that she would like nothing better. There would be an
      examination before Mr. Errol, the Brampton Superintendent of Schools. In
      short, owing to the pressing nature of the occasion, the judge would take
      the liberty of calling the committee together immediately. Would Mr.
      Satterlee and Miss Wetherell make themselves at home in the parlor?
    </p>
    <p>
      It very frequently happens that one member of a committee is the brain,
      and the other members form the body of it. It was so in this case. Ezra
      Graves typified all of prudence there was about it, which, it must be
      admitted, was a great deal. He it was who had weighed in the balance the
      fifteen applicants and found them wanting. Another member of the committee
      was that comfortable Mr. Dodd, with the tuft of yellow beard, the hardware
      dealer whom we have seen at the baseball game. Mr. Dodd was not a person
      who had opinions unless they were presented to him from certain sources,
      and then he had been known to cling to them tenaciously. It is sufficient
      to add that, when Cynthia Wetherell's name was mentioned to him, he
      remembered the girl to whom Bob Worthington had paid such marked
      attentions on the grand stand. He knew literally nothing else about
      Cynthia. Judge Graves, apparently, knew all about her; this was
      sufficient, at that time, for Mr. Dodd; he was sick and tired of the whole
      affair, and if, by the grace of heaven, an applicant had been sent who
      conformed with Judge Graves's multitude of requirements, he was devoutly
      thankful. The other member, Mr. Hill, was a feed and lumber dealer, and
      not a very good one, for he was always in difficulties; certain scholarly
      attainments were attributed to him, and therefore he had been put on the
      committee. They met in Mr. Dodd's little office back of the store, and in
      five minutes Cynthia was a schoolmistress, subject to examination by Mr.
      Errol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a word about Mr. Errol. He was a retired lawyer, with some means, who
      took an interest in town affairs to occupy his time. He had a very
      delicate wife, whom he had been obliged to send South at the beginning of
      the winter. There she had for a while improved, but had been taken ill
      again, and two days before Cynthia's appointment he had been summoned to
      her bedside by a telegram. Cynthia could go into the school, and her
      examination would take place when Mr. Errol returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was explained by the judge when, half an hour after he had left
      them, he returned to the best parlor. Miss Wetherell would, then, be
      prepared to take the school the following morning. Whereupon the judge
      shook hands with her, and did not deny that he had been instrumental in
      the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, Mr. Satterlee, I am so grateful to you,&rdquo; said Cynthia, when they
      were in the street once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Cynthia, I did nothing,&rdquo; answered the minister, quite bewildered
      by the quick turn affairs had taken; &ldquo;it is your own good reputation that
      got you the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless Mr. Satterlee had done his share in the matter. He had known
      Mr. Graves for a long time, and better than any other person in Brampton.
      Mr. Graves remembered Cynthia Ware, and indeed had spoken to Cynthia that
      day about her mother. Mr. Graves had also read poor William Wetherell's
      contributions to the Newcastle Guardian, and he had not read that paper
      since they had ceased. From time to time Mr. Satterlee had mentioned his
      pupil to the judge, whose mind had immediately flown to her when the
      vacancy occurred. So it all came about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Mr. Satterlee, &ldquo;what will you do, Cynthia? We've got the
      good part of a day to arrange where you will live, before the stage
      returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't go back to-night, I think,&rdquo; said Cynthia, turning her head away;
      &ldquo;if you would be good enough to tell Uncle Jethro to send my trunk and
      some other things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is just as well,&rdquo; assented the minister, understanding
      perfectly. &ldquo;I have thought that Miss Bruce might be glad to board you,&rdquo; he
      continued, after a pause. &ldquo;Let us go to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Satterlee,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;would you mind if we went first to see
      Cousin Ephraim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, we must see Ephraim,&rdquo; said Mr. Satterlee, briskly. So
      they walked on past the mansion of the first citizen, and the new block of
      stores which the first citizen had built, to the old brick building which
      held the Brampton post-office, and right through the door of the partition
      into the sanctum of the postmaster himself, which some one had nicknamed
      the Brampton Club. On this occasion the postmaster was seated in his shirt
      sleeves by the stove, alone, his listeners being conspicuously absent.
      Cynthia, who had caught a glimpse of him through the little mail-window,
      thought he looked very happy and comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Tecumseh!&rdquo; he cried,&mdash;an exclamation he reserved for
      extraordinary occasions, &ldquo;if it hain't Cynthy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started to hobble toward her, but Cynthia ran to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, looking at her closely after the greeting was over, &ldquo;you
      be changed, Cynthy. Mercy, I don't know as I'd have dared done that if I'd
      seed you first. What have you b'en doin' to yourself? You must have seed a
      whole lot down there in Boston. And you're a full-blown lady, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I'm not, Cousin Eph,&rdquo; she answered, trying to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you be,&rdquo; he insisted, still scrutinizing her, vainly trying to
      account for the change. Tact, as we know, was not Ephraim's strong point.
      Now he shook his head. &ldquo;You always was beyond me. Got a sort of air about
      you, and it grows on you, too. Wouldn't be surprised,&rdquo; he declared,
      speaking now to the minister, &ldquo;wouldn't be a mite surprised to see her in
      the White House, some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Cousin Eph,&rdquo; said Cynthia, coloring a little, &ldquo;you mustn't talk
      nonsense. What have you done with your coat? You have no business to go
      without it with your rheumatism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hain't b'en so bad since Uncle Sam took me over again, Cynthy,&rdquo; he
      answered, &ldquo;with nothin' to do but sort letters in a nice hot room.&rdquo; The
      room was hot, indeed. &ldquo;But where did you come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grew tired of being taught, Cousin Eph. I&mdash;I've always wanted to
      teach. Mr. Satterlee has been with me to see Mr. Graves, and they've given
      me Miss Goddard's place. I'm coming to Brampton to live, to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Tecumseh!&rdquo; exclaimed Ephraim again, overpowered by the yews. &ldquo;I
      want to know! What does Jethro say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;he is willing,&rdquo; she replied in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ephraim, &ldquo;I always thought you'd come to it. It's in the
      blood, I guess&mdash;teachin'. Your mother had it too. I'm kind of sorry
      for Jethro, though, so I be. But I'm glad for myself, Cynthy. So you're
      comin' to Brampton to live with me!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to ask Miss Bruce to take me in,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No you hain't, anything of the kind,&rdquo; said Ephraim, indignantly. &ldquo;I've
      got a little house up the street, and a room all ready for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me share expenses, Cousin Eph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll let you do anything you want,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;so's you come. Don't you
      think she'd ought to come and take care of an old man, Mr. Satterlee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Satterlee turned. He had been contemplating, during this conversation,
      a life-size print of General Grant under two crossed flags, that was hung
      conspicuously on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think you could do better, Cynthia,&rdquo; he answered, smiling. The
      minister liked Ephraim, and he liked a little joke, occasionally. He felt
      that one would not be, particularly out of place just now; so he repeated,
      &ldquo;I do not think you could do better than to accept the offer of Colonel
      Prescott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim grew very red, as was his wont when twitted about his new title.
      He took things literally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't a colonel, no more than you be, Mr. Satterlee. But the boys down
      here will have it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three days later, by the early train which leaves the state capital at an
      unheard-of hour in the morning, a young man arrived in Brampton. His jaw
      seemed squarer than ever to the citizens who met the train out of
      curiosity, and to Mr. Dodd, who was expecting a pump; and there was a set
      look on his face like that of a man who is going into a race or a fight.
      Mr. Dodd, though astonished, hastened toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is unexpected, Bob,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;How be you? Harvard College
      failed up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For Mr. Dodd never let slip a chance to assure a member of the Worthington
      family of his continued friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Mr. Dodd?&rdquo; answered Bob, nodding at him carelessly, and
      passing on. Mr. Dodd did not dare to follow. What was young Worthington
      doing in Brampton, and his father in the West on that railroad business?
      Filled with curiosity, Mr. Dodd forgot his pump, but Bob was already
      striding into Brampton Street, carrying his bag. If he had stopped for a
      few moments with the hardware dealer, or chatted with any of the dozen
      people who bowed and stared at him, he might have saved himself a good
      deal of trouble. He turned in at the Worthington mansion, and rang the
      bell, which was answered by Sarah, the housemaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bob!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Mrs. Holden?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Holden was the elderly housekeeper. She had gone, unfortunately, to
      visit a bereaved relative; unfortunately for Bob, because she, too, might
      have told him something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me some breakfast, Sarah. Anything,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;and tell Silas to
      hitch up the black trotters to my cutter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sarah, though in consternation, did as she was bid. The breakfast was
      forthcoming, and in half an hour Silas had the black trotters at the door.
      Bob got in without a word, seized the reins, the cutter flew down Brampton
      Street (observed by many of the residents thereof) and turned into the
      Coniston road. Silas said nothing. Silas, as a matter of fact, never did
      say anything. He had been the Worthington coachman for five and twenty
      years, and he was known in Brampton as Silas the Silent. Young Mr.
      Worthington had no desire to talk that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The black trotters covered the ten miles in much quicker time than Lem
      Hallowell could do it in his stage, but the distance seemed endless to
      Bob. It was not much more than half an hour after he had left Brampton
      Street, however, that he shot past the store, and by the time Rias
      Richardson in his carpet slippers reached the platform the cutter was in
      front of the tannery house, and the trotters, with their sides smoking,
      were pawing up the snow under the butternut tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob leaped out, hurried up the path, and knocked at the door. It was
      opened by Jethro Bass himself!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Bass,&rdquo; said the young man, gravely, and he held out
      his hand. Jethro gave him such a scrutinizing look as he had given many a
      man whose business he cared to guess, but Bob looked fearlessly into his
      eyes. Jethro took his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-come in,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob went into that little room where Jethro and Cynthia had spent so many
      nights together, and his glance flew straight to the picture on the wall,&mdash;the
      portrait of Cynthia Wetherell in crimson and seed pearls, so strangely set
      amidst such surroundings. His glance went to the portrait, and his feet
      followed, as to a lodestone. He stood in front of it for many minutes, in
      silence, and Jethro watched him. At last he turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a queer question, and Jethro's answer was quite as lacking in
      convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-gone to Brampton&mdash;gone to Brampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone to Brampton! Do you mean to say&mdash;? What is she doing there?&rdquo;
       Bob demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teachin' school,&rdquo; said Jethro; &ldquo;g-got Miss Goddard's place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob did not reply for a moment. The little schoolhouse was the only
      building in Brampton he had glanced at as he came through. Mrs. Merrill
      had told him that she might take that place, but he had little imagined
      she was already there on her platform facing the rows of shining little
      faces at the desks. He had deemed it more than possible that he might see
      Jethro at Coniston, but he had not taken into account that which he might
      say to him. Bob had, indeed, thought of nothing but Cynthia, and of the
      blow that had fallen upon her. He had tried to realize the multiple phases
      of the situation which confronted him. Here was the man who, by the
      conduct of his life, had caused the blow; he, too, was her benefactor; and
      again, this same man was engaged in the bitterest of conflicts with his
      father, Isaac D. Worthington, and it was this conflict which had
      precipitated that blow. Bob could not have guessed, by looking at Jethro
      Bass, how great was the sorrow which had fallen upon him. But Bob knew
      that Jethro hated his father, must hate him now, because of Cynthia, with
      a hatred given to few men to feel. He thought that Jethro would crush Mr.
      Worthington and ruin him if he could; and Bob believed he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he to say? He did not fear Jethro, for Bob Worthington had
      courage enough; but these things were running in his mind, and he felt the
      power of the man before him, as all men did. Bob went to the window and
      came back again. He knew that he must speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;did Cynthia ever mention me to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass, I love her. I have told her so, and I have asked her to be my
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no need, indeed, to have told Jethro this. The shock of that
      revelation had come to him when he had seen the trotters, had been
      confirmed when the young man had stood before the portrait. Jethro's face
      might have twitched when Bob stood there with his back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro could not speak. Once more there had come to him a moment when he
      would not trust his voice to ask a question. He dreaded the answer, though
      none might have surmised this. He knew Cynthia. He knew that, when she had
      given her heart, it was for all time. He dreaded the answer; because it
      might mean that her sorrow was doubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; Bob continued painfully, seeing that Jethro would say
      nothing, &ldquo;I believe that Cynthia loves me. I should not dare to say it or
      to hope it, without reason. She has not said so, but&mdash;&rdquo; the words
      were very hard for him, yet he stuck manfully to the truth; &ldquo;but she told
      me to write to my father and let him know what I had done, and not to come
      back to her until I had his answer. This,&rdquo; he added, wondering that a man
      could listen to such a thing without a sign, &ldquo;this was before&mdash;before
      she had any idea of coming home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Cynthia, did love him. There was no doubt about it in Jethro's mind.
      She would not have bade Bob write to his father if she had not loved him.
      Still Jethro did not speak, but by some intangible force compelled Bob to
      go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall write to my father as soon as he comes back from the West, but I
      wish to say to you, Mr. Bass, that whatever his answer contains, I mean to
      marry Cynthia. Nothing can shake me from that resolution. I tell you this
      because my father is fighting you, and you know what he will say.&rdquo; (Jethro
      knew Dudley Worthington well enough to appreciate that this would make no
      particular difference in his opposition to the marriage except to make
      that opposition more vehement.) &ldquo;And because you do not know me,&rdquo;
       continued Bob. &ldquo;When I say a thing, I mean it. Even if my father cuts me
      off and casts me out, I will marry Cynthia. Good-by, Mr. Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro took the young man's hand again. Bob imagined that he even pressed
      it&mdash;a little&mdash;something he had never done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Bob.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob got as far as the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;go back to Harvard, Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to, Mr. Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;Bob?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't quarrel with your father&mdash;don't quarrel with your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't be the one to quarrel, Mr. Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob&mdash;hain't you pretty young&mdash;pretty young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bob, rather unexpectedly, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Then he added, &ldquo;I know my
      own mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P-pretty young. Don't want to get married yet awhile&mdash;do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;but I suppose I shan't be able to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;wait awhile, Bob. Go back to Harvard. W-wouldn't write that
      letter if I was you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will. I'll not have him think I'm ashamed of what I've done. I'm
      proud of it, Mr. Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the eyes of Coniston, which had been waiting for his reappearance, Bob
      Worthington jumped into the sleigh and drove off. He left behind him
      Jethro Bass, who sat in his chair the rest of the morning with his head
      bent in revery so deep that Millicent had to call him twice to his simple
      dinner. Bob left behind him, too, a score of rumors, sprung full grown
      into life with his visit. Men and women an incredible distance away heard
      them in an incredible time: those in the village found an immediate
      pretext for leaving their legitimate occupation and going to the store,
      and a gathering was in session there when young Mr. Worthington drove past
      it on his way back. Bob thought little about the rumors, and not thinking
      of them it did not occur to him that they might affect Cynthia. The only
      person then in Coniston whom he thought about was Jethro Bass. Bob decided
      that his liking for Jethro had not diminished, but rather increased; he
      admired Jethro for the advice he had given, although he did not mean to
      take it. And for the first time he pitied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob did not know that rumor, too, was spreading in Brampton. He had his
      dinner in the big walnut dining room all alone, and after it he smoked his
      father's cigars and paced up and down the big hall, watching the clock.
      For he could not go to her in the school hours. At length he put on his
      hat and hurried out, crossing the park-like enclosure in the middle of the
      street; bowed at by Mr. Dodd, who always seemed to be on hand, and others,
      and nodding absently in return. Concealment was not in Bob Worthington's
      nature. He reached the post-office, where the partition door was open, and
      he walked right into a comparatively full meeting of the Brampton Club.
      Ephraim sat in their midst, and for once he was not telling war stories.
      He was silent. And the others fell suddenly silent, too, at Bob's
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Prescott?&rdquo; he said, as Ephraim struggled to his feet.
      &ldquo;How is the rheumatism?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How be you, Mr. Worthington?&rdquo; said Ephraim; &ldquo;this is a kind of a
      surprise, hain't it?&rdquo; Ephraim was getting used to surprises. &ldquo;Well, it is
      good-natured of you to come in and shake hands with an old soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't mention it, Mr. Prescott,&rdquo; answered honest Bob, a little abashed,
      &ldquo;I should have done so anyway, but the fact is, I wanted to speak to you a
      moment in private.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; said Ephraim, glancing helplessly around him, &ldquo;jest come out
      front.&rdquo; That space, where the public were supposed to be, was the only
      private place in the Brampton post-office. But the members of the Brampton
      Club could take a hint, and with one consent began to make excuses. Bob
      knew them all from boyhood and spoke to them all. Some of them ventured to
      ask him if Harvard had bust up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does Cynthia-live?&rdquo; he demanded, coming straight to the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim stared at him for a moment in a bewildered fashion, and then a
      light began to dawn on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lives with me,&rdquo; he answered. He was quite as ashamed, for Bob's sake, as
      if he himself had asked the question, and he went on talking to cover that
      embarrassment. &ldquo;It's made some difference, too, sence she come. House
      looks like a different place. Afore she, come I cooked with a kit, same as
      I used to in the harness shop. I l'arned it in the army. Cynthy's got a
      stove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not the way Ephraim would have gone about a love affair, had he had
      one. Sam Price's were the approved methods in that section of the country,
      though Sam had overdone them somewhat. It was an unheard-of thing to ask a
      man right out like that where a girl lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; said Bob, and was gone. Ephraim raised his hands in
      despair, and hobbled to the little window to get a last look at him. Where
      were the proprieties in these days? The other aspect of the affair, what
      Mr. Worthington would think of it when he returned, did not occur to the
      innocent mind of the old soldier until people began to talk about it that
      afternoon. Then it worried him into another attack of rheumatism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half of Brampton must have seen Bob Worthington march up to the little
      yellow house which Ephraim had rented from John Billings. It had four
      rooms around the big chimney in the middle, and that was all. Simple as it
      was, an architect would have said that its proportions were nearly
      perfect. John Billings had it from his Grandfather Post, who built it, and
      though Brampton would have laughed at the statement, Isaac D.
      Worthington's mansion was not to be compared with it for beauty. The old
      cherry furniture was still in it, and the old wall papers and the
      panelling in the little room to the right which Cynthia had made into a
      sitting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half of Brampton, too, must have seen Cynthia open the door and Bob walk
      into the entry. Then the door was shut. But it had been held open for an
      appreciable time, however,&mdash;while you could count twenty,&mdash;because
      Cynthia had not the power to close it. For a while she could only look
      into his eyes, and he into hers. She had not seen him coming, she had but
      answered the knock. Then, slowly, the color came into her cheeks, and she
      knew that she was trembling from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;mayn't I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer, for fear her voice would tremble, too. And she could
      not send him away in the face of all Brampton. She opened the door a
      little wider, a very little, and he went in. Then she closed it, and for a
      moment they stood facing each other in the entry, which was lighted only
      by the fan-light over the door, Cynthia with her back against the wall. He
      spoke her name again, his voice thick with the passion which had overtaken
      him like a flood at the sight of her&mdash;a passion to seize her in his
      arms, and cherish and comfort and protect her forever and ever. All this
      he felt and more as he looked into her face and saw the traces of her
      great sorrow there. He had not thought that that face could be more
      beautiful in its strength and purity, but it was even so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia-my love!&rdquo; he cried, and raised his arms. But a look as of a great
      fear came into her eyes, which for one exquisite moment had yielded to his
      own; and her breath came quickly, as though she were spent&mdash;as indeed
      she was. So far spent that the wall at her back was grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;no&mdash;you must not&mdash;you must not&mdash;you must
      not!&rdquo; Again and again she repeated the words, for she could summon no
      others. They were a mandate&mdash;had he guessed it&mdash;to herself as to
      him. For the time her brain refused its functions, and she could think of
      nothing but the fact that he was there, beside her, ready to take her in
      his arms. How she longed to fly into them, none but herself knew&mdash;to
      fly into them as into a refuge secure against the evil powers of the
      world. It was not reason that restrained her then, but something higher in
      her, that restrained him likewise. Without moving from the wall she pushed
      open the door of the sitting room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in there,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in as she bade him and stood before the flickering logs in the
      wide and shallow chimney-place&mdash;logs that seemed to burn on the very
      hearth itself, and yet the smoke rose unerring into the flue. No stove had
      ever desecrated that room. Bob looked into the flames and waited, and
      Cynthia stood in the entry fighting this second great battle which had
      come upon her while her forces were still spent with that other one. Woman
      in her very nature is created to be sheltered and protected; and the
      yearning in her, when her love is given, is intense as nature itself to
      seek sanctuary in that love. So it was with Cynthia leaning against the
      entry wall, her arms full length in front of her, and her hands clasped as
      she prayed for strength to withstand the temptation. At last she grew
      calmer, though her breath still came deeply, and she went into the sitting
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he knew, vaguely, why she had not followed him at once. He had
      grown calmer himself, calmer with that desperation which comes to a man of
      his type when his soul and body are burning with desire for a woman. He
      knew that he would have to fight for her with herself. He knew now that
      she was too strong in her position to be carried by storm, and the
      interval had given him time to collect himself. He did not dare at first
      to look up from the logs, for fear he should forget himself and be
      defeated instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been to Coniston, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been to Coniston this morning, and I have seen Mr. Bass, and I
      have told him that I love you, and that I will never give you up. I told
      you so in Boston, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I knew that this this trouble would
      come to you. I would have given my life to have saved you from it&mdash;from
      the least part of it. I would have given my life to have been able to say
      'it shall not touch you.' I saw it flowing in like a great sea between you
      and me, and yet I could not tell you of it. I could not prepare you for
      it. I could only tell you that I would never give you up, and I can only
      repeat that now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must, Bob,&rdquo; she answered, in a voice so low that it was almost a
      whisper; &ldquo;you must give me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would not if the words were written on all the
      rocks of Coniston Mountain. I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;I have to say some things to you. They will be
      very hard to say, but you must listen to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will listen,&rdquo; he said doggedly; &ldquo;but they will not affect my
      determination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you do not wish to drive me away from Brampton,&rdquo; she continued,
      in the same low voice, &ldquo;when I have found a place to earn my living
      near-near Uncle Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words told him all he had suspected&mdash;almost as much as though
      he had been present at the scene in the tannery shed in Coniston. She knew
      now the life of Jethro Bass, but he was still &ldquo;Uncle Jethro&rdquo; to her. It
      was even as Bob had supposed,&mdash;that her affection once given could
      not be taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I would not by an act or a word annoy or trouble you.
      If you bade me, I would go to the other side of the world to-morrow. You
      must know that. But I should come back again. You must know, that, too. I
      should come back again for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; she said again, and her voice faltered a very little now, &ldquo;you must
      know that I can never be your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know it,&rdquo; he exclaimed, interrupting her vehemently, &ldquo;I will not
      know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;think! I must say what I, have to say, however it
      hurts me. If it had not been for&mdash;for your father, those things never
      would have been written. They were in his newspaper, and they express his
      feelings toward&mdash;toward Uncle Jethro.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once the words were out, she marvelled that she had found the courage to
      pronounce them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;yes, I know that, but listen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;wait until I have finished. I am not speaking of the
      pain I had when I read these things, I&mdash;I am not speaking of the
      truth that may be in them&mdash;I have learned from them what I should
      have known before, and felt, indeed, that your father will never consent
      to&mdash;to a marriage between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he does not,&rdquo; cried Bob, &ldquo;if he does not, do you think that I will
      abide by what he says, when my life's happiness depends upon you, and my
      life's welfare? I know that you are a good woman, and a true woman, that
      you will be the best wife any man could have. Though he is my father, he
      shall not deprive me of my soul, and he shall not take my life away from
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Cynthia listened she thought that never had words sounded sweeter than
      these&mdash;no, and never would again. So she told herself as she let them
      run into her heart to be stored among the treasures there. She believed in
      his love&mdash;believed in it now with all her might. (Who, indeed, would
      not?) She could not demean herself now by striving to belittle it or doubt
      its continuance, as she had in Boston. He was young, yes; but he would
      never be any older than this, could never love again like this. So much
      was given her, ought she not to be content? Could she expect more?
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood Isaac Worthington, now, as well as his son understood him.
      She knew that, if she were to yield to Bob Worthington, his father would
      disown and disinherit him. She looked ahead into the years as a woman
      will, and allowed herself for the briefest of moments to wonder whether
      any happiness could thrive in spite of the violence of that schism&mdash;any
      happiness for him. She would be depriving him of his birthright, and it
      may be that those who are born without birthrights often value them the
      most. Cynthia saw these things, and more, for those who sit at the feet of
      sorrow soon learn the world's ways. She saw herself pointed out as the
      woman whose designs had beggared and ruined him in his youth, and
      (agonizing and revolting thought!) the name of one would be spoken from
      whom she had learned such craft. Lest he see the scalding tears in her
      eyes, she turned away and conquered them. What could she do? Where should
      she hide her love that it might not be seen of men? And how, in truth,
      could she tell him these things?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; he went on, seeing that she did not answer, and taking heart,
      &ldquo;I will not say a word against my father. I know you would not respect me
      if I did. We are different, he and I, and find happiness in different
      ways.&rdquo; Bob wondered if his father had ever found it. &ldquo;If I had never met
      you and loved you, I should have refused to lead the life my father wishes
      me to lead. It is not in me to do the things he will ask. I shall have to
      carve out my own life, and I feel that I am as well able to do it as he
      was. Percy Broke, a classmate of mine and my best friend, has a position
      for me in a locomotive works in which his father is largely interested. We
      are going in together, the day after we graduate; it is all arranged, and
      his father has agreed. I shall work very hard, and in a few years,
      Cynthia, we shall be together, never to part again. Oh, Cynthia,&rdquo; he
      cried, carried away by the ecstasy of this dream which he had, summoned
      up, &ldquo;why do you resist me? I love you as no man has ever loved,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, with scornful egotism and contempt of those who had made the
      world echo with that cry through the centuries, &ldquo;and you love me! Ah, do
      you think I do not see it&mdash;cannot feel it? You love me&mdash;tell me
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was coming toward her, and how was she to prevent his taking her by
      storm? That was his way, and well she knew it. In her dreams she had felt
      herself lifted and borne off, breathless in his arms, to Elysium. Her
      breath was going now, her strength was going, and yet she made him pause
      by the magic of a word. A concession was in that word, but one could not
      struggle so piteously and concede nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Love her! If there was a love that acknowledged no bounds, that was
      confined by no superlatives, it was his. He began to speak, but she
      interrupted him with a wild passion that was new to her. As he sat in the
      train on his way back to Cambridge through the darkening afternoon, the
      note of it rang in his ears and gave him hope&mdash;yes, and through many
      months afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you love me I beg, I implore, I beseech you in the name of that love&mdash;for
      your sake and my sake, to leave me. Oh, can you not see why you must go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, even as he had before in the parlor in Mount Vernon Street. He
      could but stop in the face of such an appeal&mdash;and yet the blood beat
      in his head with a mad joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me that you love me,&mdash;once,&rdquo; he cried,&mdash;&ldquo;once, Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do-do not ask me,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;Go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her words were a supplication, not a command. And in that they were a
      supplication he had gained a victory. Yes, though she had striven with all
      her might to deny, she had bade him hope. He left her without so much as a
      touch of the hand, because she had wished it. And yet she loved him!
      Incredible fact! Incredible conjury which made him doubt that his feet
      touched the snow of Brampton Street, which blotted, as with a golden glow,
      the faces and the houses of Brampton from his sight. He saw no one, though
      many might have accosted him. That part of him which was clay, which
      performed the menial tasks of his being, had kindly taken upon itself to
      fetch his bag from the house to the station, and to board the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, but Brampton had seen him!

      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Great events, like young Mr. Worthington's visit to Brampton, are all very
      well for a while, but they do not always develop with sufficient rapidity
      to satisfy the audiences of the drama. Seven days were an interlude quite
      long enough in which to discuss every phase and bearing of this opening
      scene, and after that the play in all justice ought to move on. But there
      it halted&mdash;for a while&mdash;and the curtain obstinately refused to
      come up. If the inhabitants of Brampton had only known that the drama,
      when it came, would be well worth waiting for, they might have been less
      restless.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to enrich the pages of this folio with all the footnotes
      and remarks of, the sages of Brampton. These can be condensed into a
      paragraph of two&mdash;and we can ring up the curtain when we like on the
      next scene, for which Brampton had to wait considerably over a month.
      There is to be no villain in this drama with the face of an Abbe Maury
      like the seven cardinal sins. Comfortable looking Mr. Dodd of the
      prudential committee, with his chin-tuft of yellow beard, is cast for the
      part of the villain, but will play it badly; he would have been better
      suited to a comedy part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mr. Worthington left Brampton on the five o'clock train, and at six
      Mr. Dodd met his fellow-member of the committee, Judge Graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Called a meetin'?&rdquo; asked Mr. Dodd, pulling the yellow tuft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; said the judge, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What be you a-goin' to do about it?&rdquo; said Mr. Dodd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do about what?&rdquo; demanded the judge, looking at the hardware dealer from
      under his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodd knew well enough that this was not ignorance on the part of Mr.
      Graves, whose position in the matter dad been very well defined in the two
      sentences he had spoken. Mr. Dodd perceived that the judge was trying to
      get him to commit himself, and would then proceed to annihilate him. He,
      Levi Dodd, had no intention of walking into such a trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, with a final tug at the tuft, &ldquo;if that's the way you feel
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feel about what?&rdquo; said the judge, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Callate you know best,&rdquo; said Mr. Dodd, and passed on up the street. But
      he felt the judge's gimlet eyes boring holes in his back. The judge's
      position was very fine, no doubt for the judge. All of which tends to show
      that Levi Dodd had swept his mind, and that it was ready now for the
      reception of an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six weeks or more, as has been said, passed before the curtain rose again,
      but the snarling trumpets of the orchestra played a fitting prelude.
      Cynthia's feelings and Cynthia's life need not be gone into during this
      interval knowing her character, they may well be imagined. They were
      trying enough, but Brampton had no means of guessing them. During the
      weeks she came and went between the little house and the little school,
      putting all the strength that was in her into her duties. The Prudential
      Committee, which sometimes sat on the platform, could find no fault with
      the performance of these duties, or with the capability of the teacher,
      and it is not going too far to state that the children grew to love her
      better than Miss Goddard had been loved. It may be declared that children
      are the fittest citizens of a republic, because they are apt to make up
      their own minds on any subject without regard to public opinion. It was so
      with the scholars of Brampton village lower school: they grew to love the
      new teacher, careless of what the attitude of their elders might be, and
      some of them could have been seen almost any day walking home with her
      down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the attitude of the elders&mdash;there was none. Before assuming
      one they had thought it best, with characteristic caution, to await the
      next act in the drama. There were ladies in Brampton whose hearts prompted
      them, when they called on the new teacher, to speak a kindly word of
      warning and advice; but somehow, when they were seated before her in the
      little sitting room of the John Billings house, their courage failed them.
      There was something about this daughter of the Coniston storekeeper and
      ward of Jethro Bass that made them pause. So much for the ladies of
      Brampton. What they said among themselves would fill a chapter, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, at this time, a singular falling-off in the attendance of the
      Brampton Club. Ephraim sat alone most of the day in his Windsor chair by
      the stove, pretending to read newspapers. But he did not mention this fact
      to Cynthia. He was more lonesome than ever on the Saturdays and Sundays
      which she spent with Jethro Bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass! It is he who might be made the theme of the music of the
      snarling trumpets. What was he about during those six weeks? That is what
      the state at large was beginning to wonder, and the state at large was
      looking on at a drama, too. A rumor reached the capital and radiated
      thence to every city and town and hamlet, and was followed by other rumors
      like confirmations. Jethro Bass, for the first time in a long life of
      activity, was inactive: inactive, too, at this most critical period of his
      career, the climax of it, with a war to be waged which for bitterness and
      ferocity would have no precedent; with the town meetings at hand, where
      the frontier fighting was to be done, and no quarter given. Lieutenants
      had gone to Coniston for further orders and instructions, and had come
      back without either. Achilles was sulking in the tannery house&mdash;some
      said a broken Achilles. Not a word could be got out of him, or the sign of
      an intention. Jake Wheeler moped through the days in Rias Richardson's
      store, too sore at heart to speak to any man, and could have wept if tears
      had been a relief to him. No more blithe errands over the mountain to
      Clovelly and elsewhere, though Jake knew the issue now and itched for the
      battle, and the vassals of the hill-Rajah under a jubilant Bijah Bixby
      were arming cap-a-pie. Lieutenant-General-and-Senator Peleg Hartington of
      Brampton, in his office over the livery stable, shook his head like a
      mournful stork when questioned by brother officers from afar. Operations
      were at a standstill, and the sinews of war relaxed. Rural givers of
      mortgages, who had not had the opportunity of selling them or had feared
      to do so, began (mirabile dictu) to express opinions. Most ominous sign of
      all&mdash;the proprietor of the Pelican Hotel had confessed that the
      Throne Room had not been engaged for the coming session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that Jethro Bass lay crushed under the weight of the
      accusations which had been printed, and were still being printed, in the
      Newcastle Guardian? He did not answer them, or retaliate in other
      newspapers, but Jethro Bass had never made use of newspapers in this way.
      Still, nothing ever printed about him could be compared with those
      articles. Had remorse suddenly overtaken him in his old age? Such were the
      questions people we're asking all over the state&mdash;people, at least,
      who were interested in politics, or in those operations which went by the
      name of politics: yes, and many private citizens&mdash;who had
      participated in politics only to the extent of voting for such candidates
      as Jethro in his wisdom had seen fit to give them, read the articles and
      began to say that boss domination was at an end. A new era was at hand,
      which they fondly (and very properly) believed was to be a golden era. It
      was, indeed, to be a golden era&mdash;until things got working; and then
      the gold would cease. The Newcastle Guardian, with unconscious irony,
      proclaimed the golden era; and declared that its columns, even in other
      days and under other ownership, had upheld the wisdom of Jethro Bass. And
      he was still a wise man, said the Guardian, for he had had sense enough to
      give up the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he given up the fight? Cynthia fervently hoped and prayed that he had,
      but she hoped and prayed in silence. Well she knew, if the event in the
      tannery shed had not made him abandon his affairs, no appeal could do so.
      Her happiest days in this period were the Saturdays and Sundays spent with
      him in Coniston, and as the weeks went by she began to believe that the
      change, miraculous as it seemed, had indeed taken place. He had given up
      his power. It was a pleasure that made the weeks bearable for her. What
      did it matter&mdash;whether he had made the sacrifice for the sake of his
      love for her? He had made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On these Saturdays and Sundays they went on long drives together over the
      hills, while she talked to him of her life in Brampton or the books she
      was reading, and of those she had chosen for him to read. Sometimes they
      did not turn homeward until the delicate tracery of the branches on the
      snow warned them of the rising moon. Jethro was often silent for hours at
      a time, but it seemed to Cynthia that it was the silence of peace&mdash;of
      a peace he had never known before. There came no newspapers to the tannery
      house now: during the mid-week he read the books of which she had spoken
      William Wetherell's books; or sat in thought, counting, perhaps; the days
      until she should come again. And the boy of those days for him was more
      pathetic than much that is known to the world as sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what did Coniston think? Coniston, indeed, knew not what to think,
      when, little by little, the great men ceased to drive up to the door of
      the tannery house, and presently came no more. Coniston sank then from its
      proud position as the real capital of the state to a lonely hamlet among
      the hills. Coniston, too, was watching the drama, and had had a better
      view of the stage than Brampton, and saw some reason presently for the
      change in Jethro Bass. Not that Mr. Satterlee told, but such evidence was
      bound, in the end, to speak for itself. The Newcastle Guardian had been
      read and debated at the store&mdash;debated with some heat by Chester
      Perkins and other mortgagors; discussed, nevertheless, in a political
      rather than a moral light. Then Cynthia had returned home; her face had
      awed them by its sorrow, and she had begun to earn her own living. Then
      the politicians had ceased to come. The credit belongs to Rias Richardson
      for hawing been the first to piece these three facts together, causing him
      to burn his hand so severely on the stove that he had to carry it bandaged
      in soda for a week. Cynthia Wetherell had reformed Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the village loved and revered Cynthia, Coniston as a whole did not
      rejoice in that reform. The town had fallen from its mighty estate, and
      there were certain envious ones who whispered that it had remained for a
      young girl who had learned city ways to twist Jethro around her finger;
      that she had made him abandon his fight with Isaac D. Worthington because
      Mr. Worthington had a son&mdash;but there is no use writing such scandal.
      Stripped of his power&mdash;even though he stripped himself&mdash;Jethro
      began to lose their respect, a trait tending to prove that the human race
      may have had wolves for ancestors as well as apes. People had small
      opportunity, however, of showing a lack of respect to his person, for in
      these days he noticed no one and spoke to none.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the lion is crippled, the jackals begin to range. A jackal
      reconnoitered the lair to see how badly the lion was crippled, and
      conceived with astounding insolence the plan of capturing the lion's
      quarry. This jackal, who was an old one, well knew how to round up a
      quarry, and fled back over the hills to consult with a bigger jackal, his
      master. As a result, two days before March town-meeting day, Mr. Bijah
      Bixby paid a visit to the Harwich bank and went among certain Coniston
      farmers looking over the sheep, his clothes bulging out in places when he
      began, and seemingly normal enough when he had finished. History repeats
      itself, even among lions and jackals. Thirty-six years before there had
      been a town-meeting in Coniston and a surprise. Established Church, decent
      and orderly selectmen and proceedings had been toppled over that day,
      every outlying farm sending its representative through the sleet to do it.
      And now retribution was at hand. This March-meeting day was mild, the
      grass showing a green color on the south slopes where the snow had melted,
      and the outlying farmers drove through mud-holes up to the axles. Drove,
      albeit, in procession along the roads, grimly enough, and the sheds Jock
      Hallowell had built around the meeting-house could not hold the horses;
      they lined the fences and usurped the hitching posts of the village
      street, and still they came. Their owners trooped with muddy boots into
      the meeting-house, and when the moderator rapped for order the Chairman of
      the Board of Selectmen, Jethro Bass, was not in his place; never, indeed,
      would be there again. Six and thirty years he had been supreme in that
      town&mdash;long enough for any man. The beams and king posts would know
      him no more. Mr. Amos Cuthbert was elected Chairman, not without a gallant
      and desperate but unsupported fight of a minority led by Mr. Jake Wheeler,
      whose loyalty must be taken as a tribute to his species. Farmer Cuthbert
      was elected, and his mortgage was not foreclosed! Had it been, there was
      more money in the Harwich bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no telegraph to Coniston in these days, and so Mr. Sam Price,
      with his horse in a lather, might have been seen driving with unseemly
      haste toward Brampton, where in due time he arrived. Half an hour later
      there was excitement at Newcastle, sixty-five miles away, in the office of
      the Guardian, and the next morning the excitement had spread over the
      whole state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass was dethroned in Coniston&mdash;discredited in his own town!
    </p>
    <p>
      And where was Jethro? Did his heart ache, did he bow his head as he
      thought of that supremacy, so hardly won, so superbly held, gone forever?
      Many were the curious eyes on the tannery house that day, and for days
      after, but its owner gave no signs of concern. He read and thought and
      chopped wood in the tannery shed as usual. Never, I believe, did man,
      shorn of power, accept his lot more quietly. His struggle was over, his
      battle was fought, a greater peace than he had ever thought to hope for
      was won. For the opinion and regard of the world he had never cared. A
      greater reward awaited him, greater than any knew&mdash;the opinion and
      regard and the praise of one whom he loved beyond all the world. On Friday
      she came to him, on Friday at sunset, for the days were growing longer,
      and that was the happiest sunset of his life. She said nothing as she
      raised her face to his and kissed him and clung to him in the little
      parlor, but he knew, and he had his reward. So much for earthly power
      Cynthia brought the little rawhide trunk this time, and came to Coniston
      for the March vacation&mdash;a happy two weeks that was soon gone. Happy
      by comparison, that is, with what they both had suffered, and a haven of
      rest after the struggle and despair of the wilderness. The bond between
      them had, in truth, never been stronger, for both the young girl and the
      old man had denied themselves the thing they held most dear. Jethro had
      taken refuge and found comfort in his love. But Cynthia! Her greatest love
      had now been bestowed elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there were letters for the tannery house, Milly Skinner, who made it a
      point to meet the stage, brought them. And there were letters during
      Cynthia's sojourn,&mdash;many of them, bearing the Cambridge postmark. One
      evening it was Jethro who laid the letter on the table beside her as she
      sat under the lamp. He did not look at her or speak, but she felt that he
      knew her secret&mdash;felt that he deserved to have from her own lips what
      he had been too proud&mdash;yes&mdash;and too humble to ask. Whose
      sympathy could she be sure of, if not of his? Still she had longed to keep
      this treasure to herself. She took the letter in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not answer them, Uncle Jethro, but&mdash;I cannot prevent his
      writing them,&rdquo; she faltered. She did not confess that she kept them, every
      one, and read them over and over again; that she had grown, indeed, to
      look forward to them as to a sustenance. &ldquo;I&mdash;I do love him, but I
      will not marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she could be sure of Jethro's sympathy, though he could not express
      it in words. Yet she had not told him for this. She had told him, much as
      the telling had hurt her, because she feared to cut him more deeply by her
      silence.

      It was a terrible moment for Jethro, and never had he desired the gift of
      speech as now. Had it not been for him; Cynthia might have been Robert
      Worthington's wife. He sat down beside her and put his hand over hers that
      lay on the letter in her lap. It was the only answer he could make, but
      perhaps it was the best, after all. Of what use were words at such a time!
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days afterward, on a Monday morning, she went back to Brampton to
      begin the new term.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same Monday a circumstance of no small importance took place in
      Brampton&mdash;nothing less than the return, after a prolonged absence in
      the West and elsewhere, of its first citizen. Isaac D. Worthington was
      again in residence. No bells were rung, indeed, and no delegation of
      citizens as such, headed by the selectmen, met him at the station; and
      other feudal expressions of fealty were lacking. No staff flew Mr.
      Worthington's arms; nevertheless the lord of Brampton was in his castle
      again, and Brampton felt that he was there. He arrived alone, wearing the
      silk hat which had become habitual with him now, and stepping into his
      barouche at the station had been driven up Brampton Street behind his
      grays, looking neither to the right nor left. His reddish chop whiskers
      seemed to cling a little more closely to his face than formerly, and long
      years of compression made his mouth look sterner than ever. A hawk-like
      man, Isaac Worthington, to be reckoned with and feared, whether in a frock
      coat or in breastplate and mail.
    </p>
    <p>
      His seneschal, Mr. Flint, was awaiting him in the library. Mr. Flint was
      large and very ugly, big-boned, smooth-shaven, with coarse features all
      askew, and a large nose with many excrescences, and thick lips. He was
      forty-two. From a foreman of the mills he had risen, step by step, to his
      present position, which no one seemed able to define. He was, indeed, a
      seneschal. He managed the mills in his lord's absence, and&mdash;if the
      truth be told&mdash;in his presence; knotty questions of the Truro
      Railroad were brought to Mr. Flint and submitted to Mr. Worthington, who
      decided them, with Mr. Flint's advice; and, within the last three months,
      Mr. Flint had invaded the realm of politics, quietly, as such a man would,
      under the cover of his patron's name and glory. Mr. Flint it was who had
      bought the Newcastle Guardian, who went occasionally to Newcastle and
      spoke a few effective words now and then to the editor; and, if the truth
      will out, Mr. Flint had largely conceived that scheme about the railroads
      which was to set Mr. Worthington on the throne of the state, although the
      scheme was not now being carried out according to Mr. Flint's wishes. Mr.
      Flint was, in a sense, a Bismarck, but he was not as yet all powerful.
      Sometimes his august master or one of his fellow petty sovereigns would
      sweep Mr. Flint's plans into the waste basket, and then Mr. Flint would be
      content to wait. To complete the character sketch, Mr. Flint was not above
      hanging up his master's hat and coat, Which he did upon the present
      occasion, and went up to Mr. Worthington's bedroom to fetch a pocket
      handkerchief out of the second drawer. He even knew where the
      handkerchiefs were kept. Lucky petty sovereigns sometimes possess Mr.
      Flints to make them emperors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The august personage seated himself briskly at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that scoundrel Bass is actually discredited at last,&rdquo; he said, blowing
      his nose in the pocket handkerchief Mr. Flint had brought him. &ldquo;I lose
      patience when I think how long we've stood the rascal in this state. I
      knew the people would rise in their indignation when they learned the
      truth about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint did not answer this. He might have had other views.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder we did not think of it before,&rdquo; Mr. Worthington continued. &ldquo;A
      very simple remedy, and only requiring a little courage and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
       (Mr. Worthington was going to say money, but thought better of it) &ldquo;and
      the chimera disappears. I congratulate you, Flint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Congratulate yourself,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint; &ldquo;that would not have been my
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I congratulate myself,&rdquo; said the august personage, who was in
      too good a humor to be put out by the rejection of a compliment. &ldquo;You
      remember what I said: the time was ripe, just publish a few biographical
      articles telling people what he was, and Jethro Bass would snuff out like
      a candle. Mr. Duncan tells me the town-meeting results are very good all
      over the state. Even if we hadn't knocked out Jethro Bass, we'd have a
      fair majority for our bill in the next legislature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Bass's saying,&rdquo; answered Mr. Flint, &ldquo;You can hitch that kind of
      a hoss, but they won't always stay hitched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington; &ldquo;don't croak, Flint. We can buy
      more hitch ropes, if necessary. Well, what's the outlay up to the present?
      Large, I suppose. Well, whatever it is, it's small compared to what we'll
      get for it.&rdquo; He laughed a little and rubbed his hands, and then he
      remembered that capacity in which he stood before the world. Yes, and he
      stood before himself in the same capacity. Isaac Worthington may have
      deceived himself, but he may or may not have been a hero to his seneschal.
      &ldquo;We have to fight fire with fire,&rdquo; he added, in a pained voice. &ldquo;Let me
      see the account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tabulated the expense in the different cities and towns,&rdquo; answered
      Mr. Flint; &ldquo;I will show you the account in a little while. The expenses in
      Coniston were somewhat greater than the size of the town justified,
      perhaps. But Sutton thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Worthington, &ldquo;if it had cost as much to carry
      Coniston as Newcastle, it would have been worth it&mdash;for the moral
      effect alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moral effect! Mr. Flint thought of Mr. Bixby with his bulging pockets
      going about the hills, and smiled at the manner in which moral effects are
      sometimes obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any news, Flint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No news yet, Mr. Flint might have answered. In a few minutes there might
      be news, and plenty of it, for it lay ready to be hatched under Mr.
      Worthington's eye. A letter in the bold and upright hand of his son was on
      the top of the pile, placed there by Mr. Flint himself, who had examined
      Mr. Worthington's face closely when he came in to see how much he might
      know of its contents. He had decided that Mr. Worthington was in too good
      a humor to know anything of them. Mr. Flint had not steamed the letter
      open, and read the news; but he could guess at them pretty shrewdly, and
      so could have the biggest fool in Brampton. That letter contained the
      opening scene of the next act in the drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington cut the envelope and began to read, and while he did so
      Mr. Flint, who was not afraid of man or beast, looked at him. It was a
      manly and straight forward letter, and Mr. Worthington, no matter what his
      opinions on the subject were, should have been proud of it. Bob announced,
      first of all, that he was going to marry Cynthia Wetherell; then he
      proceeded with praiseworthy self-control (for a lover) to describe
      Cynthia's character and attainments: after which he stated that Cynthia
      had refused him&mdash;twice, because she believed that Mr. Worthington
      would oppose the marriage, and had declared that she would never be the
      cause of a breach between father and son. Bob asked for his father's
      consent, and hoped to have it, but he thought it only right to add that he
      had given his word and his love, and did not mean to retract either. He
      spoke of his visit to Brampton, and explained that Cynthia was teaching
      school there, and urged his father to see her before he made a decision.
      Mr. Worthington read it through to the end, his lips closing tighter and
      tighter until his mouth was but a line across his face. There was pain in
      the face, too, the kind of pain which anger sends, and which comes with
      the tottering of a pride that is false. Of what gratification now was the
      overthrow of Jethro Bass?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at the letter for a moment after he had finished it, and his
      face grew a dark red. Then he seized the paper and tore it slowly,
      deliberately, into bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dudley Worthington was not thinking then&mdash;not he!&mdash;of the young
      man in the white beaver who had called at the Social Library many years
      before to see a young woman whose name, too, had been Cynthia.&mdash;He
      was thinking, in fact, for he was a man to think in anger, whether it were
      not possible to remove this Cynthia from the face of the earth&mdash;at
      least to a place beyond his horizon and that of his son. Had he worn the
      chain mail instead of the frock coat he would have had her hung outside
      the town walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he exclaimed. And the words sounded profane indeed as he fixed
      his eyes upon Mr. Flint. &ldquo;You knew that Robert had been to Brampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Flint, &ldquo;the whole village knew it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Mr. Worthington again, &ldquo;why was I not informed of this?
      Why was I not warned of this? Have I no friends? Do you pretend to look
      after my interests and not take the trouble to write me on such a
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I could have prevented it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Flint, very calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You allow this&mdash;this woman to come here to Brampton and teach school
      in a place where she can further her designs? What were you about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the prudential committee appointed her, nothing of this was known,
      Mr. Worthington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but now&mdash;now! What are you doing, what are they doing to allow
      her to remain? Who are on that committee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint named the men. They had been reelected, as usual, at the recent
      town-meeting. Mr. Errol, who had also been reelected, had returned but had
      not yet issued the certificate or conducted the examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send for them, have them here at once,&rdquo; commanded Mr. Worthington,
      without listening to this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you take my advice, you will do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint,
      who, as usual, had the whole situation at his fingers' ends. He had taken
      the trouble to inform himself about the girl, and he had discovered,
      shrewdly enough, that she was the kind which might be led, but not driven.
      If Mr. Flint's advice had been listened to, this story might have had
      quite a different ending. But Mr. Flint had not reached the stage where
      his advice was always listened to, and he had a maddened man to deal with
      now. At that moment, as if fate had determined to intervene, the housemaid
      came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dodd to see you, sir,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show him in,&rdquo; shouted Mr. Worthington; &ldquo;show him in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodd was not a man who could wait for a summons which he had felt in
      his bones was coming. He was ordinarily, as we have seen, officious. But
      now he was thoroughly frightened. He had seen the great man in the
      barouche as he drove past the hardware store, and he had made up his mind
      to go up at once, and have it over with. His opinions were formed now, He
      put a smile on his face when he was a foot outside of the library door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a great pleasure, Mr. Worthington, a great pleasure, to see you
      back,&rdquo; he said, coming forward. &ldquo;I callated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the great man sat in his chair, and made no attempt to return the
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dodd, I thought you were my friend,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodd went all to pieces at this reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I be, Mr. Worthington&mdash;so I be,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That's why I'm here
      now. I've b'en a friend of yours ever since I can remember&mdash;never
      fluctuated. I'd rather have chopped my hand off than had this happen&mdash;so
      I would. If I could have foreseen what she was, she'd never have had the
      place, as sure as my name's Levi Dodd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Dodd had taken the trouble to look at the seneschal's face, he
      would have seen a well-defined sneer there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that you know what she is,&rdquo; cried Mr. Worthington, rising and
      smiting the pile of letters on his desk, &ldquo;why do you keep her there an
      instant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodd stopped to pick up the letters, which had flown over the floor.
      But the great man was now in the full tide of his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the letters,&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;tell me why you keep her there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We callated we'd wait and see what steps you'd like taken,&rdquo; said the
      trembling townsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steps! Steps! Good God! What kind of man are you to serve in such a place
      when you allow the professed ward of Jethro Bass&mdash;of Jethro Bass, the
      most notoriously depraved man in this state, to teach the children of this
      town. Steps! How soon can you call your committee together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right away,&rdquo; answered Mr. Dodd, breathlessly. He would have gone on to
      exculpate himself, but Mr. Worthington's inexorable finger was pointing at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are a friend of mine,&rdquo; said that gentleman, &ldquo;and if you have any
      regard for the fair name of this town, you will do so at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodd departed precipitately, and Mr. Worthington began to pace the
      room, clasping his hands now in front of him, now behind him, in his
      agony: repeating now and again various appellations which need not be
      printed here, which he applied in turn to the prudential committee, to his
      son, and to Cynthia Wetherell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll run her out of Brampton,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint, who had been watching him apparently unmoved,
      &ldquo;you may have Jethro Bass on your back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass?&rdquo; shouted Mr. Worthington, with a laugh that was not pleasant
      to hear, &ldquo;Jethro Bass is as dead as Julius Caesar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was one thing for Mr. Dodd to promise so readily a meeting of the
      committee, and quite another to decide how he was going to get through the
      affair without any more burns and scratches than were absolutely
      necessary. He had reversed the usual order, and had been in the fire&mdash;now
      he was going to the frying-pan. He stood in the street for some time,
      pulling at his tuft, and then made his way to Mr. Jonathan Hill's feed
      store. Mr. Hill was reading &ldquo;Sartor Resartus&rdquo; in his little office, the
      temperature of which must have been 95, and Mr. Dodd was perspiring when
      he got there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's come,&rdquo; said Mr. Dodd, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's come?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Hill, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isaac D.'s come, that's what,&rdquo; said Mr. Dodd. &ldquo;I hain't b'en sleepin'
      well of nights, lately. I can't think what we was about, Jonathan, puttin'
      that girl in the school. We'd ought to've knowed she wahn't fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with her?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter with her!&rdquo; exclaimed his fellow-committeeman, &ldquo;she lives with
      Jethro Bass&mdash;she's his ward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; said Mr. Hill, who never bothered himself about gossip
      or newspapers, or indeed about anything not between the covers of a book,
      except when he couldn't help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Dodd, &ldquo;he's the most notorious, depraved man in
      the state. Hain't we got to look out for the fair name of Brampton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hill sighed and closed his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I'd hoped we were through with that. Let's go up and see
      what Judge Graves says about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Mr. Dodd, seizing the feed dealer by the coat, &ldquo;we've got
      to get it fixed in our minds what we're goin' to do, first. We can't allow
      no notorious people in our schools. We've got to stand up to the jedge,
      and tell him so. We app'inted her on his recommendation, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the girl,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hill. &ldquo;I don't think we ever had a better
      teacher. She's quiet, and nice appearin', and attends to her business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodd pulled his tuft, and cocked his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington holds a note of yours, don't he, Jonathan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hill reflected. He said he thought perhaps Mr. Worthington did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Dodd, &ldquo;I guess we might as well go along up to the jedge
      now as any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when they got there Mr. Dodd's knock was so timid that he had to
      repeat it before the judge came to the door and peered at them over his
      spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, what can I do for you?&rdquo; he asked, severely, though he
      knew well enough. He had not been taken by surprise many times during the
      last forty years. Mr. Dodd explained that they wished a little meeting of
      the committee. The judge ushered them into his bedroom, the parlor being
      too good for such an occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us get down to business. Mr. Worthington
      arrived here to-day, he has seen Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Dodd has seen Mr. Hill.
      Mr. Worthington is a political opponent of Jethro Bass, and wishes Miss
      Wetherell dismissed. Mr. Dodd and Mr. Hill have agreed, for various
      reasons which I will spare you, that Miss Wetherell should be dismissed.
      Have I stated the case, gentlemen, or have I not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Graves took off his spectacles and wiped them, looking from one to the
      other of his very uncomfortable fellow-members. Mr. Hill did not attempt
      to speak; but Mr. Dodd, who was not sure now that this was not the fire
      and the other the frying-pan, pulled at his tuft until words came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jedge,&rdquo; he said finally, &ldquo;I must say I'm a mite surprised. I must say
      your language is unwarranted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is never unwarranted,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the sake of the fair name of Brampton,&rdquo; began Mr. Dodd, &ldquo;we cannot
      allow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dodd,&rdquo; interrupted the judge, &ldquo;I would rather have Mr. Worthington's
      arguments from Mr. Worthington himself, if I wanted them at all. There is
      no need of prolonging this meeting. If I were to waste my breath until six
      o'clock, it would be no use. I was about to say that your opinions were
      formed, but I will alter that, and say that your minds are fixed. You are
      determined to dismiss Miss Wetherell. Is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you'd hear me, Jedge,&rdquo; said Mr. Dodd, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly answer me yes or no to that question,&rdquo; said the judge;
      &ldquo;my time is valuable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you put it that way, I guess we are agreed that she hadn't ought
      to stay. Not that I've anything against her personally&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the judge, with a calmness that made them tremble. They
      had never bearded him before. &ldquo;All right, you are two to one and no
      certificate has been issued. But I tell you this, gentlemen, that you will
      live to see the day when you will bitterly regret this injustice to an
      innocent and a noble woman, and Isaac D. Worthington will live to regret
      it. You may tell him I said so. Good day, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jedge,&rdquo; began Mr. Dodd again, &ldquo;I don't think you've been quite fair with
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair!&rdquo; repeated the judge, with unutterable scorn. &ldquo;Good day, gentlemen.&rdquo;
       And he slammed the door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked down the street some distance before either of them spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goliah,&rdquo; said Mr. Dodd, at last, &ldquo;did you ever hear such talk? He's got
      the drattedest temper of any man I ever knew, and he never callates to
      make a mistake. It's a little mite hard to do your duty when a man talks
      that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure we've done it,&rdquo; answered Mr. Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not sure!&rdquo; ejaculated the hardware dealer, for he was now far enough away
      from the judge's house to speak in his normal tone, &ldquo;and she connected
      with that depraved&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Mr. Hill, with an astonishing amount of spirit for him,
      &ldquo;I've heard that before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodd looked at him, swallowed the wrong way and began to choke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hain't wavered, Jonathan?&rdquo; he said, when he got his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't,&rdquo; said Mr. Hill, sadly; &ldquo;but I wish to hell I had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodd looked at him again, and began to choke again. It was the first
      time he had known Jonathan Hill to swear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a-goin' to stick by what you agreed&mdash;by your principles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to stick by my bread and butter,&rdquo; said Mr. Hill, &ldquo;not by my
      principles. I wish to hell I wasn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so saying that gentleman departed, cutting diagonally across the
      street through the snow, leaving Mr. Dodd still choking and pulling at his
      tuft. This third and totally-unexpected shaking-up had caused him to feel
      somewhat deranged internally, though it had not altered the opinions now
      so firmly planted in his head. After a few moments, however, he had
      collected himself sufficiently to move on once more, when he discovered
      that he was repeating to himself, quite unconsciously, Mr. Hill's
      profanity &ldquo;I wish to hell I wasn't.&rdquo; The iron mastiffs glaring at him
      angrily out of the snow banks reminded him that he was in front of Mr.
      Worthington's door, and he thought he might as well go in at once and
      receive the great man's gratitude. He certainly deserved it. But as he put
      his hand on the bell Mr. Worthington himself came out of the house, and
      would actually have gone by without noticing Mr. Dodd if he had not
      spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got that little matter fixed, Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;called the
      committee, and we voted to discharge the&mdash;the young woman.&rdquo; No, he
      did not deliver Judge Graves's message.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Dodd,&rdquo; answered the great man, passing on so that Mr. Dodd
      was obliged to follow him in order to hear, &ldquo;I'm glad you've come to your
      senses at last. Kindly step into the library and tell Miss Bruce from me
      that she may fill the place to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certain,&rdquo; said Mr. Dodd, with his hand to his chin. He watched the great
      man turn in at his bank in the new block, and then he did as he was bid.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time school was out that day the news had leaped across Brampton
      Street and spread up and down both sides of it that the new teacher had
      been dismissed. The story ran fairly straight&mdash;there were enough
      clews, certainly. The great man's return, the visit of Mr. Dodd, the call
      on Judge Graves, all had been marked. The fiat of the first citizen had
      gone forth that the ward of Jethro Bass must be got rid of; the designing
      young woman who had sought to entrap his son must be punished for her
      amazing effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia came out of school happily unaware that her name was on the lips
      of Brampton: unaware, too, that the lord of the place had come into
      residence that day. She had looked forward to living in the same town with
      Bob's father as an evil which was necessary to be borne, as one of the
      things which are more or less inevitable in the lives of those who have to
      make their own ways in the world. The children trooped around her, and the
      little girls held her hand, and she talked and laughed with them as she
      came up the street in the eyes of Brampton,&mdash;came up the street to
      the block of new buildings where the bank was. Stepping out of the bank,
      with that businesslike alertness which characterized him, was the first
      citizen&mdash;none other. He found himself entangled among the romping
      children and&mdash;horror of horrors he bumped into the schoolmistress
      herself! Worse than this, he had taken off his hat and begged her pardon
      before he looked at her and realized the enormity of his mistake. And the
      schoolmistress had actually paid no attention to him, but with merely
      heightened color had drawn the children out of his way and passed on
      without a word. The first citizen, raging inwardly, but trying to appear
      unconcerned, walked rapidly back to his house. On the street of his own
      town, before the eyes of men, he had been snubbed by a school-teacher. And
      such a schoolteacher!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington, as he paced his library burning with the shame of this
      occurrence, remembered that he had had to glance at her twice before it
      came over him who she was. His first sensation had been astonishment. And
      now, in spite of his bitter anger, he had to acknowledge that the face had
      made an impression on him&mdash;a fact that only served to increase his
      rage. A conviction grew upon him that it was a face which his son, or any
      other man, would not be likely to forget. He himself could not forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Cynthia had reached her home, her cheeks still smarting,
      conscious that people had stared at her. This much, of course, she knew&mdash;that
      Brampton believed Bob Worthington to be in love with her: and the
      knowledge at such times made her so miserable that the thought of Jethro's
      isolation alone deterred her from asking Miss Lucretia Penniman for a
      position in Boston. For she wrote to Miss Lucretia about her life and her
      reading, as that lady had made her promise to do. She sat down now at the
      cherry chest of drawers that was also a desk, to write: not to pour out
      her troubles, for she never had done that,&mdash;but to calm her mind by
      drawing little character sketches of her pupils. But she had only written
      the words, &ldquo;My dear Miss Lucretia,&rdquo; when she looked out of the window and
      saw Judge Graves coming up the path, and ran to open the door for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Judge?&rdquo; she said, for she recognized Mr. Graves as one of
      her few friends in Brampton. &ldquo;I have sent to Boston for the new reader,
      but it has not come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge took her hand and pressed it and led her into the little sitting
      room. His face was very stern, but his eyes, which had flung fire at Mr.
      Dodd, looked at her with a vast compassion. Her heart misgave her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;it was long since the judge had called any woman
      &ldquo;my dear,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I have bad news for you. The committee have decided that
      you cannot teach any longer in the Brampton school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Judge,&rdquo; she answered, trying to force back the tears which would
      come, &ldquo;I have tried so hard. I had begun to believe that I could fill the
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fill the place!&rdquo; cried the judge, startling her with his sudden anger.
      &ldquo;No woman in the state can fill it better than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why am I dismissed?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge looked at her in silence, his blue lips quivering. Sometimes
      even he found it hard to tell the truth. And yet he had come to tell it,
      that she might suffer less. He remembered the time when Isaac D.
      Worthington had done him a great wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are dismissed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because Mr. Worthington has come home, and
      because the two other members of the committee are dogs and cowards.&rdquo; Mr.
      Graves never minced matters when he began, and his voice shook with
      passion. &ldquo;If Mr. Errol had examined you, and you had your certificate, it
      might have been different. Errol is not a sycophant. Worthington does not
      hold his mortgage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mortgage!&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia. The word always struck terror to her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington holds Mr. Hill's mortgage,&rdquo; said Mr. Graves, more than
      ever beside himself at the sight of her suffering. &ldquo;That man's tyranny is
      not to be borne. We will not give up, Cynthia. I will fight him in this
      matter if it takes my last ounce of strength, so help me God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mortgage! Cynthia sank down in the chair by the desk. In spite of the
      misery the news had brought, the thought that his father, too, who was
      fighting Jethro Bass as a righteous man, dealt in mortgages and coerced
      men to do his will, was overwhelming. So she sat for a while staring at
      the landscape on the old wall paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go to Coniston to-night,&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried the judge, seizing her shoulder in his excitement, &ldquo;no. Do you
      think that I have been your friend&mdash;that I am your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Judge Graves&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then stay here, where you are. I ask it as a favor to me. You need not go
      to the school to-morrow&mdash;indeed, you cannot. But stay here for a day
      or two at least, and if there is any justice left in a free country, we
      shall have it. Will you stay, as a favor to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will stay, since you ask it,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;I will do what you think
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was firmer than he expected&mdash;much firmer. He glanced at her
      quickly, with something very like admiration in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a good woman, and a brave woman,&rdquo; he said, and with this somewhat
      surprising tribute he took his departure instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was left to her thoughts, and these were harassing and sorrowful
      enough. One idea, however, persisted through them all. Mr. Worthington,
      whose power she had lived long enough in Brampton to know, was an unjust
      man and a hypocrite. That thought was both sweet and bitter: sweet, as a
      retribution; and bitter, because he was Bob's father. She realized, now,
      that Bob knew these things, and she respected and loved him the more, if
      that were possible, because he had refrained from speaking of them to her.
      And now another thought came, and though she put it resolutely from her,
      persisted. Was she not justified now in marrying him? The reasoning was
      false, so she told herself. She had no right to separate Bob from his
      father, whatever his father might be. Did not she still love Jethro Bass?
      Yes, but he had renounced his ways. Her heart swelled gratefully as she
      spoke the words to herself, and she reflected that he, at least, had never
      been a hypocrite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of one thing she was sure, now. In the matter of the school she had right
      on her side, and she must allow Judge Graves to do whatever he thought
      proper to maintain that right. If Isaac D. Worthington's character had
      been different, this would not have been her decision. Now she would not
      leave Brampton in disgrace, when she had done nothing to merit it. Not
      that she believed that the judge would prevail against such mighty odds.
      So little did she think so that she fell, presently, into a despondency
      which in all her troubles had not overtaken her&mdash;the despondency
      which comes even to the pure and the strong when they feel the unjust
      strength of the world against them. In this state her eyes fell on the
      letter she had started to Miss Lucretia Penniman, and in desperation she
      began to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a short letter, reserved enough, and quite in character. It was
      right that she should defend herself, which she did with dignity, saying
      that she believed the committee had no fault to find with her duties, but
      that Mr. Worthington had seen fit to bring influence to bear upon them
      because of her connection with Jethro Bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the whole truth, but Cynthia could not bring herself to write
      of that other reason. At the end she asked, very simply, if Miss Lucretia
      could find her something to do in Boston in case her dismissal became
      certain. Then she put on her coat, and walked to the postoffice to post
      the letter, for she resolved that there could be no shame without reason
      for it. There was a little more color in her cheeks, and she held her head
      high, preparing to be slighted. But she was not slighted, and got more
      salutations, if anything, than usual. She was, indeed, in the right not to
      hide her head, and policy alone would have forbade it, had Cynthia thought
      of policy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Public opinion is like the wind&mdash;it bloweth where it listeth. It
      whistled around Brampton the next day, whirling husbands and wives apart,
      and families into smithereens. Brampton had a storm all to itself&mdash;save
      for a sympathetic storm raging in Coniston&mdash;and all about a
      school-teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Cynthia been a certain type of woman, she would have had all the men
      on her side and all of her own sex against her. It is a decided point to
      be recorded in her favor that she had among her sympathizers as many women
      as men. But the excitement of a day long remembered in Brampton began, for
      her, when a score or more of children assembled in front of the little
      house, tramping down the snow on the grass plots, shouting for her to come
      to school with them. Children give no mortgages, or keep no hardware
      stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, trying to read in front of the fire, was all in a tremble at the
      sound of the high-pitched little voices she had grown to love, and she
      longed to go out and kiss them, every one. Her nature, however, shrank
      from any act which might appear dramatic or sensational. She could not
      resist going to the window and smiling at them, though they appeared but
      dimly&mdash;little dancing figures in a mist. And when they shouted, the
      more she shook her head and put her finger to her lips in reproof and
      vanished from their sight. Then they trooped sadly on to school, resolved
      to make matters as disagreeable as possible for poor Miss Bruce, who had
      not offended in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two other episodes worthy of a place in this act of the drama occurred
      that morning, and one had to do with Ephraim. Poor Ephraim! His way had
      ever been to fight and ask no questions, and in his journey through the
      world he had gathered but little knowledge of it. He had limped home the
      night before in a state of anger of which Cynthia had not believed him
      capable, and had reappeared in the sitting room in his best suit of blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, Cousin Eph?&rdquo; Cynthia had asked suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do mind,&rdquo; she said, catching hold of his sleeve. &ldquo;I won't let you
      go until you confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a-goin' to tell Isaac Worthington what I think of him, that's whar
      I'm a-goin',&rdquo; cried Ephraim &ldquo;what I always hev thought of him sence he
      sent a substitute to the war an' acted treasonable here to home talkin'
      ag'in' Lincoln.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cousin Eph, you mustn't,&rdquo; said Cynthia, clinging to him with all her
      strength in her dismay. It had taken every whit of her influence to
      persuade him to relinquish his purpose. Cynthia knew very well that
      Ephraim meant to lay hands on Mr. Worthington, and it would indeed have
      been a disastrous hour for the first citizen if the old soldier had ever
      got into his library. Cynthia pointed out, as best she might, that it
      would be an evil hour for her, too, and that her cause would be greatly
      injured by such a proceeding; she knew very well that it would ruin
      Ephraim, but he would not have listened to such an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing he wished to do was to go to Coniston and rouse Jethro.
      Cynthia's heart stood still when he proposed this, for it touched upon her
      greatest fear,&mdash;which had impelled her to go to Coniston. But she had
      hoped and believed that Jethro, knowing her feelings, would do nothing&mdash;since
      for her sake he had chosen to give up his power. Now an acute attack of
      rheumatism had come to her rescue, and she succeeded in getting Ephraim
      off to bed, swathed in bandages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he had insisted upon hobbling away to the postoffice,
      where in due time he was discovered by certain members of the Brampton
      Club nailing to the wall a new engraving of Abraham Lincoln, and draping
      it with a little silk flag he had bought in Boston. By which it will be
      seen that a potion of the Club were coming back to their old haunt. This
      portion, it may be surmised, was composed of such persons alone as were
      likely to be welcomed by the postmaster. Some of these had grievances
      against Mr. Worthington or Mr. Flint; others, in more prosperous
      circumstances, might have been moved by envy of these gentlemen; still
      others might have been actuated largely by righteous resentment at what
      they deemed oppression by wealth and power. These members who came that
      morning comprised about one-fourth of those who formerly had been in the
      habit of dropping in for a chat, and their numbers were a fair indication
      of the fact that those who from various motives took the part of the
      schoolteacher in Brampton were as one to three.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to repeat their expressions of indignation and
      sympathy. There was a certain Mr. Gamaliel Ives in the town, belonging to
      an old Brampton family, who would have been the first citizen if that
      other first citizen had not, by his rise to wealth and power, so
      completely overshadowed him. Mr. Ives owned a small mill on Coniston Water
      below the town. He fairly bubbled over with civic pride, and he was an
      authority on all matters pertaining to Brampton's history. He knew the
      &ldquo;Hymn to Coniston&rdquo; by heart. But we are digressing a little. Mr. Ives,
      like that other Gamaliel of old, had exhorted his fellow-townsmen to wash
      their hands of the controversy. But he was an intimate of Judge Graves,
      and after talking with that gentleman he became a partisan overnight; and
      when he had stopped to get his mail he had been lured behind the window by
      the debate in progress. He was in the midst of some impromptu remarks when
      he recognized a certain brisk step behind him, and Isaac D. Worthington
      himself entered the sanctum!
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be explained that Mr. Worthington sometimes had an important
      letter to be registered which he carried to the postoffice with his own
      hands. On such occasions&mdash;though not a member of the Brampton Club&mdash;he
      walked, as an overlord will, into any private place he chose, and
      recognized no partitions or barriers. Now he handed the letter (addressed
      to a certain person in Cambridge, Massachusetts) to the postmaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will kindly register that and give me a receipt, Mr. Prescott,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ephraim turned from his contemplation of the features of the martyred
      President, and on his face was something of the look it might have worn
      when he confronted his enemies over the log-works at Five Forks. No, for
      there was a vast contempt in his gaze now, and he had had no contempt for
      the Southerners, and would have shaken hands with any of them the moment
      the battle was over. Mr. Worthington, in spite of himself, recoiled a
      little before that look, fearing, perhaps, physical violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't a-goin' to hurt you, Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; Ephraim said, &ldquo;but I am
      a-goin' to ask you to git out in front, and mighty quick. If you hev any
      business with the postmaster, there's the window,&rdquo; and Ephraim pointed to
      it with his twisted finger. &ldquo;I don't allow nobody but my friends here, Mr.
      Worthington, and people I respect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington looked&mdash;well, eye-witnesses give various versions as
      to how he looked. All agree that his lip trembled; some say his eyes
      watered: at any rate, he quailed, stood a moment undecided, and then swung
      on his heel and walked to the partition door. At this safe distance he
      turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Prescott,&rdquo; he said, his voice quivering with passion and perhaps
      another emotion, &ldquo;I will make it my duty to report to the
      postmaster-general the manner in which this office is run. Instead of
      attending to your business, you make the place a resort for loafers and
      idlers. Good morning, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later Mr. Flint himself came to register the letter. But it
      was done at the window, and the loafers and idlers were still there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain had risen again, indeed, and the action was soon fast enough
      for the most impatient that day. No sooner had the town heard with bated
      breath of the expulsion of the first citizen from the inner sanctuary of
      the post-office, than the news of another event began to go the rounds.
      Mr. Worthington had other and more important things to think about than
      minor postmasters, and after his anger and&mdash;yes, and momentary fear
      had subsided, he forgot the incident except to make a mental note to
      remember to deprive Mr. Prescott of his postmastership, which he believed
      could be done readily enough now that Jethro Bass was out of the way. Then
      he had stepped into the bank, which he had come to regard as his own bank,
      as he regarded most institutions in Brampton. He had, in the old days,
      been president of it, as we know. He stepped into the bank, and then&mdash;he
      stepped out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most people have experienced that sickly feeling of the diaphragm which
      sometimes comes from a sadden shock. Mr. Worthington had it now as he
      hurried up the street, and he presently discovered that he was walking in
      the direction opposite to that of his own home. He crossed the street,
      made a pretence of going into Mr. Goldthwaite's drug store, and hurried
      back again. When he reached his own library, he found Mr. Flint busy there
      at his desk. Mr. Flint rose. Mr. Worthington sat down and began to pull
      the papers about in a manner which betrayed to his seneschal (who knew
      every mood of his master) mental perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flint,&rdquo; he said at last, striving his best for an indifferent accent,
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass is here&mdash;I ran across him just now drawing money in the
      bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have told you that this morning,&rdquo; answered Mr. Flint. &ldquo;Wheeler,
      who runs errands for him in Coniston, drove him in this morning, and he's
      been with Peleg Hartington for two hours over Sherman's livery stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An interval of silence followed, during which Mr. Worthington shuffled
      with his letters and pretended to read them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Graves has called a mass meeting to-night, I understand,&rdquo; he remarked in
      the same casual way. &ldquo;The man's a demagogue, and mad as a loon. I believe
      he sent back one of our passes once, didn't he? I suppose Bass has come in
      to get Hartington to work up the meeting. They'll be laughed out of the
      town hall, or hissed out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you'll find Bass has come down for something else,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Flint, looking up from a division report.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Worthington, changing his attitude to one
      of fierceness. But he was well aware that whatever tone he took with his
      seneschal, he never fooled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean what I told you yesterday,&rdquo; said Flint, &ldquo;that you've stirred up
      the dragon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Mr. Flint did not know how like a knell his words sounded in Isaac
      Worthington's ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you're talking nonsense, Flint. We maimed him too
      thoroughly for that. He hasn't power enough left to carry his own town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the seneschal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; said his master, with extreme irritation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean what I said yesterday, that we haven't maimed him at all. He had
      his own reasons for going into his hole, and he never would have come out
      again if you hadn't goaded him. Now he's out, and we'll have to step
      around pretty lively, I can tell you, or he'll maim us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All of which goes to show that Mr. Flint had some notion of men and
      affairs. He became, as may be predicted, the head of many material things
      in later days, and he may sometime reappear in company with other
      characters in this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sickly feeling in Mr. Worthington's diaphragm had now returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will find you are mistaken, Flint,&rdquo; he said, attempting
      dignity now. &ldquo;Very much mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Flint, &ldquo;perhaps I am. But I believe you'll find he left
      for the capital on the eleven o'clock, and if you take the trouble to
      inquire from Bedding you will probably learn that the Throne Room is
      bespoken for the session.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All of that which Mr. Flint had predicted turned out to be true. The
      dragon had indeed waked up. It all began with the news Milly Skinner had
      got from the stage driver, imparted to Jethro as he sat reading about
      Hiawatha. And terrible indeed had been that awakening. This dragon did not
      bellow and roar and lash his tail when he was roused, but he stood up, and
      there seemed to emanate from him a fire which frightened poor Milly
      Skinner, upset though she was by the news of Cynthia's dismissal. O,
      wondrous and paradoxical might of love, which can tame the most powerful
      of beasts, and stir them again into furies by a touch!
    </p>
    <p>
      Coniston was the first to tremble, as though the forces stretching
      themselves in the tannery house were shaking the very ground, and the name
      of Jethro Bass took on once more, as by magic, a terrible meaning. When
      Vesuvius is silent, pygmies may make faces on the very lip of the crater,
      and they on the slopes forget the black terror of the fiery hail. Jake
      Wheeler himself, loyal as he was, did not care to look into the crater now
      that he was summoned; but a force pulled him all the way to the tannery
      house. He left behind him an awe-stricken gathering at the store, composed
      of inhabitants who had recently spoken slightingly of the volcano.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are getting a little mixed in our metaphors between lions and dragons
      and volcanoes, and yet none of them are too strong to represent Jethro
      Bass when he heard that Isaac Worthington had had the teacher dismissed
      from Brampton lower school. He did not stop to reason then that action
      might distress her. The beast in him awoke again; the desire for vengeance
      on a man whom he had hated most of his life, and who now had dared to
      cause pain to the woman whom he loved with all his soul, and even idolize,
      was too great to resist. He had no thought of resisting it, for the waters
      of it swept over his soul like the Atlantic over a lost continent. He
      would crush Isaac Worthington if it took the last breath from his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jake went to the tannery house and received his orders&mdash;orders of
      which he made a great mystery afterward at the store, although they
      consisted simply of directions to be prepared to drive Jethro to Brampton
      the next morning. But the look of the man had frightened Jake. He had
      never seen vengeance so indelibly written on that face, and he had never
      before realized the terrible power of vengeance. Mr. Wheeler returned from
      that meeting in such a state of trepidation that he found it necessary to
      accompany Rias to a certain keg in the cellar; after which he found his
      tongue. His description of Jethro's appearance awed his hearers, and Jake
      declared that he would not be in Isaac Worthington's shoes for all of
      Isaac Worthington's money. There were others right here in Coniston, Jake
      hinted, who might now find it convenient to emigrate to the far West.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro's face had not changed when Jake drove him out of Coniston the next
      morning. Good Mr. Satterlee saw it, and felt that the visit he had wished
      to make would have been useless; Mr. Amos Cuthbert and Mr. Sam Price saw
      it, from a safe distance within the store, and it is a fact that Mr. Price
      seriously thought of taking Mr. Wheeler's advice about a residence in the
      West; Mr. Cuthbert, of a sterner nature, made up his mind to be hung and
      quartered. A few minutes before Jethro walked into his office over the
      livery stable, Senator Peleg Hartington would have denied, with that
      peculiar and mournful scorn of which he was master, that Jethro Bass could
      ever again have any influence over him. Peleg was, indeed, at that moment
      preparing, in his own way, to make overtures to the party of Isaac D.
      Worthington. Jethro walked into the office, leaving Jake below with Mr.
      Sherman; and Senator Hartington was very glad he had not made the
      overtures. And when he accompanied Jethro to the station when he left for
      the capital, the senator felt that the eyes of men were upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Cynthia? Happily, Cynthia passed the day in ignorance that Jethro had
      gone through Brampton. Ephraim, though he knew of it, did not speak of it
      when he came home to his dinner; Mr. Graves had called, and informed her
      of the meeting in the town hall that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our only chance,&rdquo; he said obdurately, in answer to her protests.
      &ldquo;We must lay the case before the people of Brampton. If they have not the
      courage to right the wrong, and force your reinstatement through public
      opinion, there is nothing more to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Cynthia, the idea of having a mass meeting concerning herself was
      particularly repellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Judge Graves!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if there isn't any other way, please drop
      the matter. There are plenty of teachers who will&mdash;be acceptable to
      everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;I can understand that this publicity is very
      painful to you. I beg you to remember that we are contending for a
      principle. In such cases the individual must be sacrificed to the common
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cannot go to the meeting&mdash;I cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the judge; &ldquo;I don't think that will be necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After he was gone, she could think of nothing but the horror of having her
      name&mdash;yes, and her character&mdash;discussed in that public place;
      and it seemed to her, if she listened, she could hear a clatter of tongues
      throughout the length of Brampton Street, and that she must fain stop her
      ears or go mad. The few ladies who called during the day out of kindness
      or curiosity, or both, only added to her torture. She was not one who
      could open her heart to acquaintances: the curious ones got but little
      satisfaction, and the kind ones thought her cold, and they did not
      perceive that she was really grateful for their little attentions.
      Gratitude, on such occasions, does not always consist in pouring out one's
      troubles in the laps of visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the visitors went home, wondering whether it were worth while after all
      to interest themselves in the cause of such a self-contained and
      self-reliant young woman. In spite of all her efforts, Cynthia had never
      wholly succeeded in making most of the Brampton ladies believe that she
      did not secretly deem herself above them. They belonged to a reserved race
      themselves; but Cynthia had a reserve which was even different from their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      As night drew on the predictions of Mr. Worthington seemed likely to be
      fulfilled, and it looked as if Judge Graves would have a useless bill to
      pay for gas in the new town hall. The judge had never been a man who could
      compel a following, and he had no magnetism with which to lead a cause:
      the town tradesmen, especially those in the new brick block, would be
      chary as to risking the displeasure of their best customer. At half-past
      seven Mr. Graves: came in, alone, and sat on the platform staring grimly
      at his gas. Is there a lecturer, or, a playwright, or a politician, who
      has not, at one time or another, been in the judge's place? Who cannot
      sympathize with him as he watched the thin and hesitating stream of people
      out of the corner of his eye as they came in at the door? The judge
      despised them with all his soul, but it is human nature not to wish to sit
      in a hall or a theatre that is three-quarters empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sixteen minutes to eight a mild excitement occurred, an incident of
      some significance which served to detain many waverers. Senator Peleg
      Hartington walked up the aisle, and the judge rose and shook him by the
      hand, and as Deacon Hartington he was invited to sit on the platform. The
      senator's personal influence was not to be ignored; and it had sufficed to
      carry his district in the last election against the Worthington forces, in
      spite of the abdication of Jethro Bass. Mr. Page, the editor of the
      Clarion, Senator Hartington's organ, was also on the platform. But where
      was Mr. Ives? Where was that Gamaliel who had been such a warm partisan in
      the postoffice that morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw him outside the hall&mdash;wahn't but ten minutes ago,&rdquo; said Deacon
      Hartington, sadly; &ldquo;thought he was a-comin' in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eight o'clock came, and no Mr. Ives; ten minutes past&mdash;fifteen
      minutes past. If the truth must be told, Mr. Ives had been on the very
      threshold of the hall, and one glance at the poor sprinkling of people
      there had decided him. Mr. Ives had a natural aversion to being laughed
      at, and as he walked back on the darker side of the street he wished
      heartily that he had stuck to his original Gamaliel-advocacy of no
      interference, of allowing the Supreme Judge to decide. Such opinions were
      inevitably just, Mr. Ives was well aware, though not always handed down
      immediately. If he were to humble the first citizen, Mr. Ives reflected
      that a better opportunity might present itself. The whistle of the
      up-train served to strengthen his resolution, for he was reminded thereby
      that his mill often had occasion to ask favors of the Truro Railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime it was twenty minutes past eight in the town hall, and Mr.
      Graves had not rapped for order. Deacon Hartington sat as motionless as a
      stork on the borders of a glassy lake at sunrise, the judge had begun
      seriously to estimate the gas bill, and Mr. Page had chewed up the end of
      a pencil. There was one, at least, in the audience of whom the judge could
      be sure. A certain old soldier in blue sat uncompromisingly on the front
      bench with his hands crossed over the head of his stick; but the ladies
      and gentlemen nearest the door were beginning to vanish, one by one,
      silently as ghosts, when suddenly the judge sat up. He would have rubbed
      his eyes, had he been that kind of a man. Four persons had entered the
      hall&mdash;he was sure of it&mdash;and with no uncertain steps as if
      frightened by its emptiness. No, they came boldly. And after them trooped
      others, and still others were heard in the street beyond, not whispering,
      but talking in the unmistakable tones of people who had more coming behind
      them. Yes, and more came. It was no illusion, or delusion: there they were
      filling the hall as if they meant to stay, and buzzing with excitement.
      The judge was quivering with excitement now, but he, too, was only a
      spectator of the drama. And what a drama, with a miracle-play for
      Brampton!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Page rose from his chair and leaned over the edge of the platform that
      something might be whispered in his ear. The news, whatever it was, was
      apparently electrifying, and after the first shock he turned to impart it
      to Mr. Graves; but turned too late, for the judge had already rapped for
      order and was clearing his throat. He could not account for this
      extraordinary and unlooked-for audience, among whom he spied many who had
      thought it wiser not to protest against the dictum of the first citizen,
      and many who had professed to believe that the teacher's connection with
      Jethro Bass was a good and sufficient reason for dismissal. The judge was
      prepared to take advantage of the tide, whatever its cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I take the liberty of calling this
      meeting to order. And before a chairman be elected, I mean to ask your
      indulgence to explain my purposes in requesting the use of this hall
      to-night. In our system of government, the inalienable and most precious
      gift&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the gift was, the judge never explained. He paused at the words,
      and repeated them, and stopped altogether because no one was paying any
      attention to him. The hall was almost full, the people had risen, with a
      hum, and as one man had turned toward the door. Mr. Gamaliel Ives was
      triumphantly marching down the aisle, and with him was&mdash;well, another
      person. Nay, personage would perhaps be the better word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us go back for a moment. There descended from that train of which we
      have heard the whistle a lady with features of no ordinary moulding, with
      curls and a string bonnet and a cloak that seemed strangely to harmonize
      with the lady's character. She had the way of one in authority, and Mr.
      Sherman himself ran to open the door of his only closed carriage, and the
      driver galloped off with her all the way to the Brampton House. Once
      there, the lady seized the pen as a soldier seizes the sword, and wrote
      her name in most uncompromising characters on the register, Miss Lucretia
      Penniman, Boston. Then she marched up to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia Penniman, author of the &ldquo;Hymn to Coniston,&rdquo; in the reflected
      glory of whose fame Brampton had shone for thirty years! Whose name was
      lauded and whose poem was recited at every Fourth of July celebration,
      that the very children might learn it and honor its composer!
      Stratford-on-Avon is not prouder of Shakespeare than Brampton of Miss
      Lucretia, and now she was come back, unheralded, to her birthplace. Mr.
      Raines, the clerk, looked at the handwriting on the book, and would not
      believe his own sight until it was vouched for by sundry citizens who had
      followed the lady from the station&mdash;on foot. And then there was a
      to-do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Send for Mr. Gamaliel Ives; send for Miss Bruce, the librarian; send for
      Mr. Page, editor of the Clarion, and notify the first citizen. He, indeed,
      could not be sent for, but had he known of her coming he would undoubtedly
      have had her met at the portals and presented with the keys in gold. Up
      and down the street flew the news which overshadowed and blotted out all
      other, and the poor little school-teacher was forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these notables was at hand, though he did not deserve to be. Mr.
      Gamaliel Ives sent up his card to Miss Lucretia, and was shown
      deferentially into the parlor, where he sat mopping his brow and growing
      hot and cold by turns. How would the celebrity treat him? The celebrity
      herself answered the question by entering the room in such stately manner
      as he had expected, to the rustle of the bombazine. Whereupon Mr. Ives
      bounced out of his chair and bowed, though his body was not formed to bend
      that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Penniman,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;what an honor for Brampton! And what a
      pleasure, the greater because so unexpected! How cruel not to have given
      us warning, and we could have greeted you as your great fame deserves! You
      could never take time from your great duties to accept the invitations of
      our literary committee, alas! But now that you are here, you will find a
      warm welcome, Miss Penniman. How long it has been&mdash;thirty years,&mdash;you
      see I know it to a day, thirty years since you left us. Thirty years, I
      may say, we have kept burning the vestal fire in your worship, hoping for
      this hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia may have had her own ideas about the propriety of the
      reference to the vestal fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gamaliel,&rdquo; she said sharply, &ldquo;straighten up and don't talk nonsense to
      me. I've had you on my knee, and I knew your mother and father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gamaliel did straighten up, as though Miss Lucretia had applied a lump of
      ice to the small of his back. So it is when the literary deities, vestal
      or otherwise, return to their Stratfords. There are generally surprises in
      store for the people they have had on their knees, and for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gamaliel,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, &ldquo;I want to see the prudential committee
      for the village district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prudential committee!&rdquo; Mr. Ives fairly shrieked the words in his
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried to speak plainly,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia. &ldquo;Who are on that
      committee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezra Graves,&rdquo; said Mr. Ives, as though mechanically compelled, for his
      head was spinning round. &ldquo;Ezra Graves always has run it, until now. But
      he's in the town hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's he doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ives was no fool. Some inkling of the facts began to shoot through his
      brain, and he saw his chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He called a mass meeting to protest against the dismissal of a teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gamaliel,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, &ldquo;you will conduct me to that meeting. I
      will get my cloak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ives wasted no time in the interval, and he fairly ran out into the
      office. Miss Lucretia Penniman was in town, and would attend the mass
      meeting. Now, indeed, it was to be a mass meeting. Away flew the tidings,
      broadcast, and people threw off their carpet slippers and dressing gowns,
      and some who had gone to bed got up again. Mr. Dodd heard it, and changed
      his shoes three times, and his intentions three times three. Should he go,
      or should he not? Already he heard in imagination the first distant note
      of the populace, and he was not of the metal to defend a Bastille or a
      Louvre for his royal master with the last drop of his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Gamaliel Ives was conducting Miss Lucretia toward the town
      hall, and speaking in no measured tones of indignation of the cringing,
      truckling qualities of that very Mr. Dodd. The injustice to Miss
      Wetherell, which Mr. Ives explained as well as he could, made his blood
      boil: so he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      And note we are back again at the meeting, when the judge, with his hand
      on his Adam's apple, is pronouncing the word &ldquo;gift.&rdquo; Mr. Ives is
      triumphantly marching down the aisle, escorting the celebrity of Brampton
      to the platform, and quite aware of the heart burnings of his
      fellow-citizens on the benches. And Miss Lucretia, with that stern
      composure with which celebrities accept public situations, follows up the
      steps as of right and takes the chair he assigns her beside the chairman.
      The judge, still grasping his Adam's apple, stares at the newcomer in
      amazement, and recognizes her in spite of the years, and trembles. Miss
      Lucretia Penniman! Blucher was not more welcome to Wellington, or
      Lafayette to Washington, than was Miss Lucretia to Ezra Graves as he
      turned his back on the audience and bowed to her deferentially. Then he
      turned again, cleared his throat once more to collect his senses, and was
      about to utter the familiar words, &ldquo;We have with us tonight,&rdquo; when they
      were taken out of his mouth&mdash;taken out of his mouth by one who had in
      all conscience stolen enough thunder for one man,&mdash;Mr. Gamaliel Ives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; said Mr. Ives, taking a slight dropping of the judge's
      lower jaw for recognition, &ldquo;and ladies and gentlemen of Brampton. It is
      our great good fortune to have with us to-night, most unexpectedly, one of
      whom Brampton is, and for many years has been, justly proud.&rdquo; (Cheers.)
      &ldquo;One whose career Brampton has followed with a mother's eyes and with a
      mother's heart. One who has chosen a broader field for the exercise of
      those great powers with which Nature endowed her than Brampton could give.
      One who has taken her place among the luminaries of literature of her
      time.&rdquo; (Cheers.) &ldquo;One who has done more than any other woman of her
      generation toward the uplifting of the sex which she honors.&rdquo; (Cheers and
      clapping of hands.) &ldquo;And one who, though her lot has fallen among the
      great, has not forgotten the home of her childhood. For has she not
      written those beautiful lines which we all know by heart?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Ah, Coniston! Thy lordly form I see
     Before mine eyes in exile drear.'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman and fellow-townsmen and women, I have the extreme honor of
      introducing to you one whom we all love and revere, the author of the
      'Hymn to Coniston,' the editor of the Woman's Hour, Miss Lucretia
      Penniman.'&rdquo; (Loud and long-continued applause.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Well might Brampton be proud, too, of Gamaliel Ives, president of its
      literary club, who could make such a speech as this on such short notice.
      If the truth be told, the literary club had sent Miss Lucretia no less
      than seven invitations, and this was the speech Mr. Ives had intended to
      make on those seven occasions. It was unquestionably a neat speech, and
      Judge Graves or no other chairman should cheat him out of making it. Mr.
      Ives, with a wave of his hand toward the celebrity, sat down by no means
      dissatisfied with himself. What did he care how the judge glared. He did
      not see how stiffly Miss Lucretia sat in her chair. She could not take him
      on her knee then, but she would have liked to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia rose, and stood quite as stiffly as she had sat, and the
      judge rose, too. He was very angry, but this was not the time to get even
      with Mr. Ives. As it turned out, he did not need to bother about getting
      even.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in the absence of any other chairman I
      take pleasure in introducing to you Miss Lucretia Penniman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More applause was started, but Miss Lucretia put a stop to it by the
      lifting of a hand. Then there was a breathless silence. Then she cast her
      eyes around the hall, as though daring any one to break that silence, and
      finally they rested upon Mr. Ives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Chairman,&rdquo; she said, with an inclination toward the judge, &ldquo;my
      friends&mdash;for I hope you will be my friends when I have finished&rdquo;
       (Miss Lucretia made it quite clear by her tone that it entirely depended
      upon them whether they would be or not), &ldquo;I understood when I came here
      that this was to be a mass meeting to protest against an injustice, and
      not a feast of literature and oratory, as Gamaliel Ives seems to suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and when the first shock of amazement was past an audible
      titter ran through the audience, and Mr. Ives squirmed visibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I right, Mr. Chairman?&rdquo; asked Miss Lucretia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are unquestionably right, Miss Penniman,&rdquo; answered the chairman,
      rising, &ldquo;unquestionably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will proceed,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia. &ldquo;I wrote the Hymn to Coniston'
      many years ago, when I was younger, and yet it is true that I have always
      remembered Brampton with kindly feelings. The friends of our youth are
      dear to us. We look indulgently upon their failings, even as they do on
      ours. I have scanned the faces here in the hall to-night, and there are
      some that have not changed beyond recognition in thirty years. Ezra Graves
      I remember, and it is a pleasure to see him in that chair.&rdquo; (Mr. Graves
      inclined his head, reverently. None knew how the inner man exulted.) &ldquo;But
      there was one who was often in Brampton in those days,&rdquo; Miss Lucretia
      continued, &ldquo;whom we all loved and with whom we found no fault, and I
      confess that when I have thought of Brampton I have oftenest thought of
      her. Her name,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, her hand now in the reticule, &ldquo;her
      name was Cynthia Ware.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a decided stir among the audience, and many leaned forward to
      catch every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even old people may have an ideal,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, &ldquo;and you will
      forgive me for speaking of mine. Where should I speak of it, if not in
      this village, among those who knew her and among their children? Cynthia
      Ware, although she was younger than I, has been my ideal, and is still.
      She was the daughter of the Rev. Samuel Ware of Coniston, and a descendant
      of Captain Timothy Prescott, whom General Stark called 'Honest Tim.' She
      was, to me, all that a woman should be, in intellect, in her scorn of all
      that is ignoble and false, and in her loyalty to her friends.&rdquo; Here the
      handkerchief came out of the reticule. &ldquo;She went to Boston to teach
      school, and some time afterward I was offered a position in New York, and
      I never saw her again. But she married in Boston a man of learning and
      literary attainments, though his health was feeble and he was poor,
      William Wetherell.&rdquo; (Another stir.) &ldquo;Mr. Wetherell was a gentleman&mdash;Cynthia
      Ware could have married no other&mdash;and he came of good and honorable
      people in Portsmouth. Very recently I read a collection of letters which
      he wrote to the Newcastle Guardian, which some of you may know. I did not
      trust my own judgment as to those letters, but I took them to an author
      whose name is known wherever English is spoken, but which I will not
      mention. And the author expressed it as his opinion, in writing to me,
      that William Wetherell was undoubtedly a genius of a high order, and that
      he would have been so recognized if life had given him a chance. Mr.
      Wetherell, after his wife died, was taken in a dying condition to
      Coniston, where he was forced, in order to earn his living, to become the
      storekeeper there. But he took his books with him, and found time to write
      the letters of which I have spoken, and to give his daughter an early
      education such as few girls have.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, I am rejoiced to see that the spirit of justice and the sense
      of right are as strong in Brampton as they used to be&mdash;strong enough
      to fill this town hall to overflowing because a teacher has been wrongly&mdash;yes,
      and iniquitously&mdash;dismissed from the lower school.&rdquo; (Here there was a
      considerable stir, and many wondered whether Miss Lucretia was aware of
      the irony in her words.) &ldquo;I say wrongly and iniquitously, because I have
      had the opportunity in Boston this winter of learning to know and love
      that teacher. I am not given to exaggeration, my friends, and when I tell
      you that I know her, that her character is as high and pure as her
      mother's, I can say no more. I am here to tell you this to-night because I
      do not believe you know her as I do. During the seventy years I have lived
      I have grown to have but little faith in outward demonstration, to believe
      in deeds and attainments rather than expressions. And as for her fitness
      to teach, I believe that even the prudential committee could find no fault
      with that.&rdquo; (I wonder whether Mr. Dodd was in the back of the hall.) &ldquo;I
      can find no fault with it. I am constantly called upon to recommend
      teachers, and I tell you I should have no hesitation in sending Cynthia
      Wetherell to a high school, young as she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my friends, why was she dismissed? I have heard the facts,
      though not from her. Cynthia Wetherell does not know that I have come to
      Brampton, unless somebody has told her, and did not know that I was
      coming. I have heard the facts, and I find it difficult to believe that so
      great a wrong could be attempted against a woman, and if the name of
      Cynthia Wetherell had meant no more to me than the letters in it I should
      have travelled twice as far as Brampton, old as I am, to do my utmost to
      right that wrong. I give you my word of honor that I have never been so
      indignant in my life. I do not come here to stir up enmities among you,
      and I will mention no more names. I prefer to believe that the prudential
      committee of this district has made a mistake, the gravity of which they
      must now realize, and that they will reinstate Cynthia Wetherell
      to-morrow. And if they should not of their own free will, I have only to
      look around this meeting to be convinced that they will be compelled to.
      Compelled to, my friends, by the sense of justice and the righteous
      indignation of the citizens of Brampton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia sat down, her strong face alight with the spirit that was in
      her. Not the least of the compelling forces in this world is righteous
      anger, and when it is exercised by a man or a woman whose life has been a
      continual warfare against the pests of wrong, it is well-nigh
      irresistible. While you could count five seconds the audience sat silent,
      and then began such tumult and applause as had never been seen in Brampton&mdash;all
      started, so it is said, by an old soldier in the front row with his stick.
      Isaac D. Worthington, sitting alone in the library of his mansion, heard
      it, and had no need to send for Mr. Flint to ask what it was, or who it
      was had fired the Third Estate. And Mr. Dodd heard it. He may have been in
      the hall, but now he sat at home, seeing visions of the lantern, and he
      would have fled to the palace had he thought to get any sympathy from his
      sovereign. No, Mr. Dodd did not hold the Bastille or even fight for it.
      Another and a better man gave up the keys, for heroes are sometimes hidden
      away in meek and retiring people who wear spectacles and have a stoop to
      their shoulders. Long before the excitement died away a dozen men were on
      their feet shouting at the chairman, and among them was the tall, stooping
      man with spectacles. He did not shout, but Judge Graves saw him and made
      up his mind that this was the man to speak. The chairman raised his hand
      and rapped with his gavel, and at length he had obtained silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am going to recognize Mr. Hill of the
      prudential committee, and ask him to step up on the platform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There fell another silence, as absolute as the first, when Mr. Hill walked
      down the aisle and climbed the steps. Indeed, people were stupefied, for
      the feed dealer was a man who had never opened his mouth in town-meeting;
      who had never taken an initiative of any kind; who had allowed other men
      to take advantage of him, and had never resented it. And now he was going
      to speak. Would he defend the prudential committee, or would he declare
      for the teacher? Either course, in Mr. Hill's case, required courage, and
      he had never been credited with any. If Mr. Hill was going to speak at
      all, he was going to straddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the platform, bowed irresolutely to the chairman, and then
      stood awkwardly with one knee bent, peering at his audience over his
      glasses. He began without any address whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say,&rdquo; he began in a low voice, &ldquo;that I had no intention of
      coming to this meeting. And I am going to confess&mdash;I am going to
      confess that I was afraid to come.&rdquo; He raised his voice a little defiantly
      a the words, and paused. One could almost hear the people breathing. &ldquo;I
      was afraid to come for fear that I should do the very thing I am going to
      do now. And yet I was impelled to come. I want to say that my conscience
      has not been clear since, as a member of the prudential committee, I gave
      my consent to the dismissal of Miss Wetherell. I know that I was
      influenced by personal and selfish considerations which should have had no
      weight. And after listening to Miss Penniman I take this opportunity to
      declare, of my own free will, that I will add my vote to that of Judge
      Graves to reinstate Miss Wetherell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hill bowed slightly, and was about to descend the steps when the
      chairman, throwing parliamentary dignity to the winds, arose and seized
      the feed dealer's hand. And the people in the hall almost as one man
      sprang to their feet and cheered, and some&mdash;Ephraim Prescott among
      these&mdash;even waved their hats and shouted Mr. Hill's name. A New
      England audience does not frequently forget itself, but there were few
      present who did not understand the heroism of the man's confession, who
      were not carried away by the simple and dramatic dignity of it. He had no
      need to mention Mr. Worthington's name, or specify the nature of his
      obligations to that gentleman. In that hour Jonathan Hill rose high in the
      respect of Brampton, and some pressed into the aisle to congratulate him
      on his way back to his seat. Not a few were grateful to him for another
      reason. He had relieved the meeting of the necessity of taking any further
      action: of putting their names, for instance, in their enthusiasm to a
      paper which the first citizen might see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Graves, whose sense of a climax was acute, rapped for order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, in a voice not wholly free from emotion,
      &ldquo;you will all wish to pay your respects to the famous lady, who is with
      us. I see that the Rev. Mr. Sweet is present, and I suggest that we
      adjourn, after he has favored us with a prayer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the minister came forward, Deacon Hartington dropped his head and began
      to flutter his eyelids. The Rev. Mr. Sweet prayed, and so was brought to
      an end the most exciting meeting ever held in Brampton town hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Lucretia did not like being called &ldquo;a famous lady.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Miss Lucretia was standing, unwillingly enough, listening to the
      speeches that were poured into her ear by various members of the audience,
      receiving the incense and myrrh to which so great a celebrity was
      entitled, the old soldier hobbled away to his little house as fast as his
      three legs would carry him. Only one event in his life had eclipsed this
      in happiness&mdash;the interview in front of the White House. He rapped on
      the window with his stick, thereby frightening Cynthia half out of her
      wits as she sat musing sorrowfully by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Ephraim,&rdquo; she said, taking off his corded hat, &ldquo;what in the
      world's the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a schoolmarm again, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lucretia Penniman done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lucretia Penniman!&rdquo; Cynthia began to think his rheumatism was
      driving him out of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet. 'Long toward the openin' of the engagement there wahn't scarcely
      anybody thar but me, and they was a-goin'. But they come fast enough when
      they l'arned she was in town, and she blew 'em up higher'n the Petersburg
      crater. Great Tecumseh, there's a woman! Next to General Grant, I'd sooner
      shake her hand than anybody's livin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say that Miss Lucretia is in Brampton and spoke at the
      mass meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoke!&rdquo; exclaimed Ephraim, &ldquo;callate she did&mdash;some. Tore 'em all up.
      They'd a hung Isaac D. Worthington or Levi Dodd if they'd a had 'em thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, striving to be calm herself, got him into a chair and took his
      stick and straightened out his leg, and then Ephraim told her the story,
      and it lost no dramatic effect in his telling. He would have talked all
      night. But at length the sound of wheels was heard in the street, Cynthia
      flew to the door, and a familiar voice came out of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not wait, Gamaliel. No, thank you, I think I will stay at the
      hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gamaliel was still protesting when Miss Lucretia came in and seized
      Cynthia in her arms, and the door was closed behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Lucretia, why did you come?&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;if I had known you
      would do such a thing, I should never have written that letter. I have
      been sorry to-day that I did write it, and now I'm sorrier than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you glad to see me?&rdquo; demanded Miss Lucretia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lucretia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are friends for?&rdquo; asked Miss Lucretia, patting her hand. &ldquo;If you had
      known how I wished to see you, Cynthia, and I thought a little trip would
      be good for such a provincial Bostonian as I am. Dear, dear, I remember
      this house. It used to belong to Gabriel Post in my time, and right across
      from it was the Social Library, where I have spent so many pleasant hours
      with your mother. And this is Ephraim Prescott. I thought it was, when I
      saw him sitting in the front row, and I think he must have been very
      lonesome there at one time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am,&rdquo; said Ephraim, giving her his gnarled fingers; &ldquo;I was just
      sayin' to Cynthy that I'd ruther shake your hand than anybody's livin'
      exceptin' General Grant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'd rather shake yours than the General's,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, for
      the Woman's Hour had taken the opposition side in a certain recent public
      question concerning women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'd a fit with him, you wouldn't say that, Miss Lucrety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't a word to say against his fighting qualities,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess the General might say the same of you,&rdquo; said Ephraim. &ldquo;If you'd a
      b'en a man, I callate you'd a come out of the war with two stars on your
      shoulder. Godfrey, Miss Lucrety, you'd ought to've b'en a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man!&rdquo; cried Miss Lucretia, &ldquo;and 'stars on my shoulder'! I think this
      kind of talk has gone far enough, Ephraim Prescott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Eph,&rdquo; said Cynthia, laughing, &ldquo;you're no match for Miss Lucretia,
      and it's long past your bedtime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man!&rdquo; repeated Miss Lucretia, after he had retired, and after Cynthia
      had tried to express her gratitude and had been silenced. They sat side by
      side in front of the chimney. &ldquo;I suppose he meant that as a compliment. I
      never yet saw the man I couldn't back down, and I haven't any patience
      with a woman who gives in to them.&rdquo; Miss Lucretia poked vigorously a log
      which had fallen down, as though that were a man, too, and she was putting
      him back in his proper place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, strange to say, did not reply to this remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, abruptly, &ldquo;you don't mean to say that you
      are in love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia drew a long breath, and grew as red as the embers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Lucretia!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in astonishment and dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Miss Lucretia said, &ldquo;I should have thought you could have gotten
      along, for a while at least, without anything of that kind. My dear,&rdquo; she
      said leaning toward Cynthia, &ldquo;who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia turned away. She found it very hard to speak of her troubles, even
      to Miss Lucretia, and she would have kept this secret even from Jethro,
      had it been possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must let him know his place,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, &ldquo;and I hope he is
      in some degree worthy of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not intend to marry him,&rdquo; said Cynthia, with head still turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now Miss Lucretia who was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came near getting married once,&rdquo; she said presently, with
      characteristic abruptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; cried Cynthia, looking around in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I am franker than you, my dear&mdash;though I never told any one
      else. I believe you can keep a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I can. Who&mdash;was it anyone in Brampton, Miss Lucretia?&rdquo; The
      question was out before Cynthia realized its import. She was turning the
      tables with a vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Ezra Graves,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezra Graves!&rdquo; And then Cynthia pressed Miss Lucretia's hand in silence,
      thinking how strange it was that both of them should have been her
      champions that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia poked the fire again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was shortly after that, when I went to Boston, that I wrote the 'Hymn
      to Coniston.' I suppose we must all be fools once or twice, or we should
      not be human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;weren't you ever&mdash;sorry?&rdquo; asked Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again there was a silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not have done the work I have had to do in the world if I had
      married. But I have often wondered whether that work was worth the while.
      Such a feeling must come over all workers, occasionally. Yes,&rdquo; said Miss
      Lucretia, &ldquo;there have been times when I have been sorry, my dear, though I
      have never confessed it to another soul. I am telling you this for your
      own good&mdash;not mine. If you have the love of a good man, Cynthia, be
      careful what you do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears had come into Cynthia's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have told you, Miss Lucretia,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;If I could have
      married him, it would have been easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can't you marry him?&rdquo; demanded Miss Lucretia, sharply&mdash;to hide
      her own emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;is Bob Worthington:&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isaac Worthington's son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another silence, Miss Lucretia being utterly unable to say anything for a
      space.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a good man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was on the point of indignant-protest, but she stopped herself in
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you what he has done,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and then you shall
      judge for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she told Miss Lucretia, simply, all that Bob had done, and all that
      she herself had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is like his mother, Sarah Hollingsworth; I knew her well,&rdquo; said Miss
      Lucretia. &ldquo;If Isaac Worthington were a man, he would be down on his knees
      begging you to marry his son. He tried hard enough to marry your own
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia, who had never believed that rumor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, &ldquo;and you may thank your stars he didn't
      succeed. I mistrusted him when he was a young man, and now I know that he
      hasn't changed. He is a coward and a hypocrite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia could not deny this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; she said, after a moment's silence, &ldquo;I am sure you will say
      that I have been right. My own conscience tells me that it is wrong to
      deprive Bob of his inheritance, and to separate him from his father,
      whatever his father&mdash;may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see what happens in five years,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five years!&rdquo; said Cynthia, in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jacob served seven for Rachel,&rdquo; answered Miss Lucretia; &ldquo;that period is
      scarcely too short to test a man, and you are both young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;I cannot marry him, Miss Lucretia. The world would
      accuse me of design, and I feel that I should not be happy. I am sure that
      he would never reproach me, even if things went wrong, but&mdash;the day
      might come when&mdash;when he would wish that it had been otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Lucretia kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very young, my dear,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;and none of us may say what
      changes time may bring forth. And now I must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia insisted upon walking with her friend down the street to the hotel&mdash;an
      undertaking that was without danger in Brampton. And it was only a step,
      after all. A late moon floated in the sky, throwing in relief the shadow
      of the Worthington mansion against the white patches of snow. A light was
      still burning in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning after breakfast Miss Lucretia appeared at the little
      house, and informed Cynthia that she would walk to school with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have not yet been notified by the Committee,&rdquo; said Cynthia. There
      was a knock at the door, and in walked Judge Ezra Graves. Miss Lucretia
      may have blushed, but it is certain that Cynthia did. Never had she seen
      the judge so spick and span, and he wore the broadcloth coat he usually
      reserved for Sundays. He paused at the threshold, with his hand on his
      Adam's apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, ladies,&rdquo; he said, and looked shyly at Miss Lucretia and
      cleared his throat, and spoke with the elaborate decorum he used on
      occasions, &ldquo;Miss Penniman, I wish to thank you again for your noble action
      of last evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't 'Miss Penniman' me, Ezra Graves,&rdquo; retorted Miss Lucretia; &ldquo;the only
      noble action I know of was poor Jonathan Hill's&mdash;unless it was paying
      for the gas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the way in which Miss Lucretia treated her lover after thirty
      years! Cynthia thought of what the lady had said to her a few hours since,
      by this very fire, and began to believe she must have dreamed it. Fires
      look very differently at night&mdash;and sometimes burn brighter then. The
      judge parted his coat tails, and seated himself on the wooden edge of a
      cane-bottomed chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucretia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you haven't changed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have, Ezra,&rdquo; she replied, looking at the Adam's apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm an old man,&rdquo; said Ezra Graves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia could not help thinking that he was a very different man, in Miss
      Lucretia's presence, than when at the head of the prudential committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezra,&rdquo; said Miss Lucretia, &ldquo;for a man you do very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Lucretia,&rdquo; said he. He seemed to appreciate the full extent of
      the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Graves,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;I can tell you how good you are, at least,
      and thank you for your great kindness to me, which I shall never forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his withered hands from his knees and pressed them. He returned
      the pressure, and then searched his coat tails, found a handkerchief, and
      blew his nose violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely did my duty, Miss Wetherell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I would not wilfully
      submit to a wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You called me Cynthia yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;so I did.&rdquo; Then he looked at Miss Lucretia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezra,&rdquo; said that lady, smiling a little, &ldquo;I don't believe you have
      changed, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What she meant by that nobody knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had thought, Cynthia,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;that it might be more
      comfortable for you to have me go to the school with you. That is the
      reason for my early call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Graves, I do appreciate your kindness,&rdquo; said Cynthia; &ldquo;I hope you
      won't think I'm rude if I say I'd rather go alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, my dear,&rdquo; replied the judge, &ldquo;I think I can understand
      and esteem your feeling in the matter, and it shall be as you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I think I had better be going,&rdquo; said Cynthia. The judge rose in
      alarm at the words, but she put her hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;Won't you sit
      down and stay,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;you haven't seen Miss Lucretia for how many
      years,&mdash;thirty, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he glanced at Miss Lucretia, uncertainly. &ldquo;Sit down, Ezra,&rdquo; she
      commanded, &ldquo;and for goodness' sake don't be afraid of the cane bottom. You
      won't go through it. I should like to talk to you, and most of the gossips
      of our day are dead. I shall stay in Brampton to-day, Cynthia, and eat
      supper with you here this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, as she went out of the door, wondered what they would talk about.
      Then she turned toward the school. It was not the March wind that burned
      her cheeks; as she thought of the mass meeting the night before, which was
      all about her, she wished she might go to school that morning through the
      woods and pasture lots rather than down Brampton Street. What&mdash;what
      would Bob say when he heard of the meeting? Would he come again to
      Brampton? If he did, she would run away to Boston with Miss Lucretia.
      Every day it had been a trial to pass the Worthington house, but she could
      not cross the wide street to avoid it. She hurried a little,
      unconsciously, when she came to it, for there was Mr. Worthington on the
      steps talking to Mr. Flint. How he must hate her now, Cynthia reflected!
      He did not so much as look up when she passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other citizens whom she met made up for Mr. Worthington's coldness,
      and gave her a hearty greeting, and some stopped to offer their
      congratulations. Cynthia did not pause to philosophize: she was learning
      to accept the world as it was, and hurried swiftly on to the little
      schoolhouse. The children saw her coming, and ran to meet her and escorted
      her triumphantly in at the door. Of their welcome she could be sure. Thus
      she became again teacher of the lower school.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the judge and Miss Lucretia got along that morning, Cynthia never
      knew. Miss Lucretia spent the day in her old home, submitting to
      hero-worship, and attended an evening party in her honor at Mr. Gamaliel
      Ives's house&mdash;a mansion not so large as the first citizen's, though
      it had two bay-windows and was not altogether unimposing. The first
      citizen, needless to say, was not there, but the rest of the elite
      attended. Mr. Ives will tell you all about the entertainment if you go to
      Brampton, but the real reason Miss Lucretia consented to go was to please
      Lucy Baird, who was Gamaliel's wife, and to chat with certain old friends
      whom she had not seen. The next morning she called at the school to bid
      Cynthia good-by, and to whisper something in her ear which made her very
      red before all the scholars. She shook her head when Miss Lucretia said
      it, for it had to do with an incident in the 29th chapter of Genesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Jonathan Hill was being made a hero of in the little two-by-four
      office of the feed store the morning after the mass meeting (though nobody
      offered to take over his mortgage), Mr. Dodd was complaining to his wife
      of shooting pains, and &ldquo;callated&rdquo; he would stay at home that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shootin' fiddlesticks!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dodd. &ldquo;Get along down to the store and
      face the music, Levi Dodd. You'd have had shootin' pains if you'd a went
      to the meetin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might stop by at Mr. Worthington's house and explain how powerless I
      was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness' sake git out, Levi. I guess he knows how powerless you are
      with your shootin' pains. If you only could forget Isaac D. Worthington
      for three minutes, you wouldn't have 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodd's two clerks saw him enter the store by the back door and he was
      very much interested in the new ploughs which were piled up in crates
      outside of it. Then he disappeared into his office and shut the door, and
      supposedly became very much absorbed in book-keeping. If any one called,
      he was out&mdash;any one. Plenty of people did call, but he was not
      disturbed&mdash;until ten o'clock. Mr. Dodd had a very sensitive ear, and
      he could often recognize a man by his step, and this man he recognized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Mr. Dodd?&rdquo; demanded the owner of the step, indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's out, Mr. Worthington. Anything I can do for you, Mr. Worthington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can tell him to come up to my house the moment he comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately Mr. Dodd in the office had got into a strained position. He
      found it necessary to move a little; the day-book fell heavily to the
      floor, and the perspiration popped out all over his forehead. Come out,
      Levi Dodd. The Bastille is taken, but there are other fortresses still in
      the royal hands where you may be confined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's in the office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, sir,&rdquo; answered the clerk, winking at his companion, who was
      sorting nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three strides the great man had his hand on the office door and had
      flung it open, disclosing the culprit cowering over the day-book on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dodd,&rdquo; cried the first citizen, &ldquo;what do you mean by&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some natures, when terrified, are struck dumb. Mr. Dodd's was the kind
      which bursts into speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't help it, Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;they would have it. I
      don't know what got into 'em. They lost their senses, Mr. Worthington,
      plumb lost their senses. If you'd a b'en there, you might have brought 'em
      to. I tried to git the floor, but Ezry Graves&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound Ezra Graves, and wait till I have done, can't you,&rdquo; interrupted
      the first citizen, angrily. &ldquo;What do you mean by putting a bath-tub into
      my house with the tin loose, so that I cut my leg on it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dodd nearly fainted from sheer relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll put a new one in to-day, right now,&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that you do,&rdquo; said the first citizen, &ldquo;and if I lose my leg, I'll sue
      you for a hundred thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was a-goin' to explain about them losin' their heads at the mass
      meetin'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn their heads!&rdquo; said the first citizen. &ldquo;And yours, too,&rdquo; he may have
      added under his breath as he stalked out. It was not worth a swing of the
      executioner's axe in these times of war. News had arrived from the state
      capital that morning of which Mr. Dodd knew nothing. Certain feudal chiefs
      from the North Country, of whose allegiance Mr. Worthington had felt sure,
      had obeyed the summons of their old sovereign, Jethro Bass, and had come
      South to hold a conclave under him at the Pelican. Those chiefs of the
      North Country, with their clans behind them as one man, what a power they
      were in the state! What magnificent qualities they had, in battle or
      strategy, and how cunning and shrewd was their generalship! Year after
      year they came down from their mountains and fought shoulder to shoulder,
      and year after year they carried back the lion's share of the spoils
      between them. The great South, as a whole, was powerless to resist them,
      for there could be no lasting alliance between Harwich and Brampton and
      Newcastle and Gosport. Now their king had come back, and the North Country
      men were rallying again to his standard. No wonder that Levi Dodd's head,
      poor thing that it was, was safe for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Organize what you have left, and be quick about it,&rdquo; said Mr. Flint, when
      the news had come, and they sat in the library planning a new campaign in
      the face of this evident defection. There was no time to cry over spilt
      milk or reinstated school-teachers. The messages flew far and wide to the
      manufacturing towns to range their guilds into line for the railroads. The
      seneschal wrote the messages, and sent the summons to the sleek men of the
      cities, and let it be known that the coffers were full and not too tightly
      sealed, that the faithful should not lack for the sinews of war. Mr. Flint
      found time, too, to write some carefully worded but nevertheless
      convincing articles for the Newcastle Guardian, very damaging to certain
      commanders who had proved unfaithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flint,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, when they had worked far into the night,
      &ldquo;if Bass beats us, I'm a crippled man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you postpone the fight now that you have begun it? What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer, Mr. Worthington knew, was the same either way. He did not
      repeat it. He went to his bed, but not to sleep for many hours, and when
      he came down to his breakfast in the morning, he was in no mood to read
      the letter from Cambridge which Mrs. Holden had put on his plate. But he
      did read it, with what anger and bitterness may be imagined. There was the
      ultimatum,&mdash;respectful, even affectionate, but firm. &ldquo;I know that you
      will, in all probability, disinherit me as you say, and I tell you
      honestly that I regret the necessity of quarrelling with you more than I
      do the money. I do not pretend to say that I despise money, and I like the
      things that it buys, but the woman I love is more to me than all that you
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington laid the letter down, and there came irresistibly to his
      mind something that his wife had said to him before she died, shortly
      after they had moved into the mansion. &ldquo;Dudley, how happy we used to be
      together before we were rich!&rdquo; Money had not been everything to Sarah
      Worthington, either. But now no tender wave of feeling swept over him as
      he recalled those words. He was thinking of what weapon he had to prevent
      the marriage beyond that which was now useless&mdash;disinheritance. He
      would disinherit Bob, and that very day. He would punish his son to the
      utmost of his power for marrying the ward of Jethro Bass. He wondered
      bitterly, in case a certain event occurred, whether he would have much to
      alienate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Flint arrived, fresh as usual in spite of the work he had
      accomplished and the cigars he had smoked the night before, Mr.
      Worthington still had the letter in his hand, and was pacing his library
      floor, and broke into a tirade against his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all I have done for him, building up for him a position and a
      fortune that is only surpassed by young Duncan's, to treat me in this way,
      to drag down the name of Worthington in the mire. I'll never forgive him.
      I'll send for Dixon and leave the money for a hospital in Brampton. Can't
      you suggest any way out of this, Flint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Flint, &ldquo;not now. The only chance you have is to ignore the
      thing from now on. He may get tired of her&mdash;I've known such things to
      happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When she hears that I've disinherited him, she will get tired of him,&rdquo;
       declared Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it and see, if you like,&rdquo; said Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Flint, if the woman has a spark of decent feeling, as you seem
      to think, I'll send for her and tell her that she will ruin Robert if she
      marries him.&rdquo; Mr. Worthington always spoke of his son as &ldquo;Robert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have thought of that before the mass meeting. Perhaps it
      would have done some good then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because this Penniman woman has stirred people up&mdash;is that what you
      mean? I don't care anything about that. Money counts in the long run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If money counted with this school-teacher, it would be a simple matter. I
      think you'll find it doesn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've known you to make some serious mistakes,&rdquo; snapped Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you ask for my advice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send for her, and appeal to her better nature,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Worthington, with an unconscious and sublime irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flint gave no sign that he heard. Mr. Worthington seated himself at his
      desk, and after some thought wrote on a piece of note-paper the following
      lines: &ldquo;My dear Miss Wetherell, I should be greatly obliged if you would
      find it convenient to call at my house at eight o'clock this evening,&rdquo; and
      signed them, &ldquo;Sincerely Yours.&rdquo; He sealed them up in an envelope and
      addressed it to Miss Wetherell, at the schoolhouse; and handed it to Mr.
      Flint. That gentleman got as far as the door, and then he hesitated and
      turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is just one way out of this for you, that I can see, Mr.
      Worthington,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's a desperate measure, but it's worth thinking
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took some courage for Mr. Flint, to make the suggestion. &ldquo;The girl's a
      good girl, well educated, and by no means bad looking. Bob might do a
      thousand times worse. Give your consent to the marriage, and Jethro Bass
      will go back to Coniston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was wisdom such as few lords get from their seneschals, but Isaac D.
      Worthington did not so recognize it. His anger rose and took away his
      breath as he listened to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will never give my consent to it, never&mdash;do you hear?&mdash;never.
      Send that note!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint walked out, sent the note, and returned and took his place
      silently at his own table. He was a man of concentration, and he put his
      mind on the arguments he was composing to certain political leaders. Mr.
      Worthington merely pretended to work as he waited for the answer to come
      back. And presently, when it did come back, he tore it open and read it
      with an expression not often on his lips. He flung the paper at Mr. Flint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is what Mr. Flint read: &ldquo;Miss Wetherell begs to inform Mr. Isaac D.
      Worthington that she can have no communication or intercourse with him
      whatsoever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint handed it back without a word. His opinion of the school-teacher
      had risen mightily, but he did not say so. Mr. Worthington took the note,
      too, without a word. Speech was beyond him, and he crushed the paper as
      fiercely as he would have liked to have crushed Cynthia, had she been in
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      One accomplishment which Cynthia had learned at Miss Sadler's school was
      to write a letter in the third person, Miss Sadler holding that there were
      occasions when it was beneath a lady's dignity to write a direct note. And
      Cynthia, sitting at her little desk in the schoolhouse during her recess,
      had deemed this one of the occasions. She could not bring herself to
      write, &ldquo;My dear Mr. Worthington.&rdquo; Her anger, when the note had been handed
      to her, was for the moment so great that she could not go on with her
      classes; but she had controlled it, and compelled Silas to stand in the
      entry until recess, when she sat with her pen in her hand until that happy
      notion of the third person occurred to her. And after Silas had gone she
      sat still; though trembling a little at intervals, picturing with some
      satisfaction Mr. Worthington's appearance when he received her answer. Her
      instinct told her that he had received his son's letter, and that he had
      sent for her to insult her. By sending for her, indeed, he had insulted
      her irrevocably, and that is why she trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Cynthia! her troubles came thick and fast upon her in those days.
      When she reached home, there was the letter which Ephraim had left on the
      table addressed in the familiar, upright handwriting, and when Cynthia saw
      it, she caught her hand sharply at her breast, as if the pain there had
      stopped the beating of her heart. Well it was for Bob's peace of mind that
      he could not see her as she read it, and before she had come to the end
      there were drops on the sheets where the purple ink had run. How precious
      would have been those drops to him! He would never give her up. No mandate
      or decree could separate them&mdash;nothing but death. And he was happier
      now so he told her&mdash;than he had been for months: happy in the thought
      that he was going out into the world to win bread for her, as became a
      man. Even if he had not her to strive for, he saw now that such was the
      only course for him. He could not conform.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a manly letter,&mdash;how manly Bob himself never knew. But Cynthia
      knew, and she wept over it and even pressed it to her lips&mdash;for there
      was no one to see. Yes, she loved him as she would not have believed it
      possible to love, and she sat through the afternoon reading his words and
      repeating them until it seemed that he were there by her side, speaking
      them. They came, untrammelled and undefiled, from his heart into hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that he had quarrelled with his father for her sake, and was bent
      with all the determination of his character upon making his own way in the
      world, what was she to do? What was her duty? Not one letter of the
      twoscore she had received (so she kept their count from day to day)&mdash;not
      one had she answered. His faith had indeed been great. But she must answer
      this: must write, too, on that subject of her dismissal, lest it should be
      wrongly told him. He was rash in his anger, and fearless; this she knew,
      and loved him for such qualities as he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must stay in Brampton and do her work,&mdash;so much was clearly her
      duty, although she longed to flee from it. And at last she sat down and
      wrote to him. Some things are too sacred to be set forth on a printed
      page, and this letter is one of those things. Try as she would, she could
      not find it in her heart at such a time to destroy his hope,&mdash;or her
      own. The hope which she would not acknowledge, and the love which she
      strove to conceal from him seeped up between the words of her letter like
      water through grains of sand. Words, indeed, are but as grains of sand to
      conceal strong feelings, and as Cynthia read the letter over she felt that
      every line betrayed her, and knew that she could compose no lines which
      would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing of the summons which she had received that morning, or of
      her answer; and her account of the matter of the dismissal and
      reinstatement was brief and dignified, and contained no mention of Mr.
      Worthington's name or agency. It was her duty, too, to rebuke Bob for the
      quarrel with his father, to point out the folly of it, and the wrong, and
      to urge him as strongly as she could to retract, though she felt that all
      this was useless. And then&mdash;then came the betrayal of hope. She could
      not ask him never to see her again, but she did beseech him for her sake,
      and for the sake of that love which he had declared, not to attempt to see
      her: not for a year, she wrote, though the word looked to her like
      eternity. Her reasons, aside from her own scruples, were so obvious, while
      she taught in Brampton, that she felt that he would consent to banishment&mdash;until
      the summer holidays in July, at least: and then she would be in Coniston,&mdash;and
      would have had time to decide upon future steps. A reprieve was all she
      craved,&mdash;a reprieve in which to reflect, for she was in no condition
      to reflect now. Of one thing she was sure, that it would not be right at
      this time to encourage him although she had a guilty feeling that the
      letter had given him encouragement in spite of all the prohibitions it
      contained. &ldquo;If, in the future years,&rdquo; thought Cynthia, as she sealed the
      envelope, &ldquo;he persists in his determination, what then?&rdquo; You, Miss
      Lucretia, of all people in the world, have planted the seeds with your
      talk about Genesis!
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was signed &ldquo;One who will always remain your friend, Cynthia
      Wetherell.&rdquo; And she posted it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ephraim came home to supper that evening, he brought the Brampton
      Clarion, just out, and in it was an account of Miss Lucretia Penniman's
      speech at the mass meeting, and of her visit, and of her career. It was
      written in Mr. Page's best vein, and so laudatory was it that we shall
      have to spare Miss Lucretia in not repeating it here: yes, and omit the
      encomiums, too, on the teacher of the Brampton lower school. Mr.
      Worthington was not mentioned, and for this, at least, Cynthia drew along
      breath of relief, though Ephraim was of the opinion that the first citizen
      should have been scored as he deserved, and held up to the contempt of his
      fellow-townsmen. The dismissal of the teacher, indeed, was put down to a
      regrettable misconception on the part of &ldquo;one of the prudential
      committee,&rdquo; who had confessed his mistake in &ldquo;a manly and altogether
      praiseworthy speech.&rdquo; The article was as near the truth, perhaps, as the
      Clarions may come on such matters&mdash;which is not very near. Cynthia
      would have been better pleased if Mr. Page had spared his readers the
      recital of her qualities, and she did not in the least recognize the
      paragon whom Miss Lucretia had befriended and defended. She was thankful
      that Mr. Page did pot state that the celebrity had come up from Boston on
      her account. Miss Penniman had been &ldquo;actuated by a sudden desire to see
      once more the beauties of her old home, to look into the faces of the old
      friends who had followed her career with such pardonable pride.&rdquo; The
      speech of the president of the literary club, you may be sure, was printed
      in full, for Mr. Ives himself had taken the trouble to write it out for
      the editor&mdash;by request, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia turned over the sheet, and read many interesting items: one
      concerning the beauty and fashion and intellect which attended the party
      at Mr. Gamaliel Ives's; in the Clovelly notes she saw that Miss Judy
      Hatch, of Coniston, was visiting relatives there; she learned the output
      of the Worthington Mills for the past week. Cynthia was about to fold up
      the paper and send it to Miss Lucretia, whom she thought it would amuse,
      when her eyes were arrested by the sight of a familiar name.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;Jethro Bass come to life again.
          From the State Tribune.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      That was the heading. &ldquo;One of the greatest political surprises in many
      years was the arrival in the capital on Wednesday of Judge Bass, whom it
      was thought, had permanently retired from politics. This, at least, seems
      to have been the confident belief of a faction in the state who have at
      heart the consolidation of certain lines of railroads. Judge Bass was
      found by a Tribune reporter in the familiar Throne Room at the Pelican,
      but, as usual, he could not be induced to talk for publication. He was in
      conference throughout the afternoon with several well-known leaders from
      the North Country. The return of Jethro Bass to activity seriously
      complicates the railroad situation, and many prominent politicians are
      freely predicting to-night that, in spite of the town-meeting returns, the
      proposed bill for consolidation will not go through. Judge Bass is a man
      of such remarkable personality that he has regained at a stroke much of
      the influence that he lost by the sudden and unaccountable retirement
      which electrified the state some months since. His reappearance, the news
      of which was the one topic in all political centres yesterday, is equally
      unaccountable. It is hinted that some action on the part of Isaac D.
      Worthington has brought Jethro Bass to life. They are known to be bitter
      enemies, and it is said that Jethro Bass has but one object in returning
      to the field&mdash;to crush the president of the Truro Railroad. Another
      theory is that the railroads and interests opposed to the consolidation
      have induced Judge Bass to take charge of their fight for them. All
      indications point to the fiercest struggle the state has ever seen in
      June, when the Legislature meets. The Tribune, whose sentiments are well
      known to be opposed to the iniquity of consolidation, extends a hearty
      welcome to the judge. No state, we believe, can claim a party leader of a
      higher order of ability than Jethro Bass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia dropped the paper in her lap, and sat very still. This, then, was
      what happened when Jethro had heard of her dismissal&mdash;he had left
      Coniston without writing her a word and passed through Brampton without
      seeing her. He had gone back to that life which he had abandoned for her
      sake; the temptation had been too strong, the desire for vengeance too
      great. He had not dared to see her. And yet the love for her which had
      been strong enough to make him renounce the homage of men, and even incur
      their ridicule, had incited him to this very act of vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      What should she do now, indeed? Had those peaceful and happy Saturdays and
      Sundays in Coniston passed away forever? Should she follow him to the
      capital and appeal to him? Ah no, she felt that were a useless pain to
      them both. She believed, now, that he had gone away from her for all time,
      that the veil of limitless space was set between, them. Silently she
      arose,&mdash;so silently that Ephraim, dozing by the fire, did not awake.
      She went into her own room and wept, and after many hours fell into a
      dreamless sleep of sheer exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days passed, and the weeks; the snow ran from the brown fields, and
      melted at length even in the moist crotches under the hemlocks of the
      northern slopes; the robin and bluebird came, the hillsides were mottled
      with exquisite shades of green, and the scent of fruit blossom and balm of
      Gilead was in the air. June came as a maiden and grew into womanhood. But
      Jethro Bass did not return to Coniston.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The legends which surround the famous war which we are about to touch upon
      are as dim as those of Troy or Tuscany. Decorous chronicles and
      biographies and monographs and eulogies exist, bound in leather and
      stamped in gold, each lauding its own hero: chronicles written in really
      beautiful language, and high-minded and noble, out of which the heroes
      come unstained. Horatius holds the bridge, and not a dent in his armor;
      and swims the Tiber without getting wet or muddy. Castor and Pollux fight
      in the front rank at Lake Regillus, in the midst of all that gore and
      slaughter, and emerge all white and pure at the end of the day&mdash;but
      they are gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the classic wars to which we have referred sprang the great Roman
      Republic and Empire, and legend runs into authentic and written history.
      Just so, parva componere magnis, out of the cloud-wrapped conflicts of the
      five railroads of which our own Gaul is composed, emerged one imperial
      railroad, authentically and legally written down on the statute books, for
      all men to see. We cannot go behind that statute except to collect the
      legends and write homilies about the heroes who held the bridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we were not in mortal terror of the imperial power, and a little
      fearful, too, of tiring our readers, we would write out all the legends we
      have collected of this first fight for consolidation, and show the blood,
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the statute books of a certain state may be found a number of laws
      setting forth the various things that a railroad or railroads may do, and
      on the margin of these pages is invariably printed a date, that being the
      particular year in which these laws were passed. By a singular coincidence
      it is the very year at which we have now arrived in our story. We do not
      intend to give a map of the state, or discuss the merits or demerits of
      the consolidation of the Central and the Northwestern and the Truro
      railroads. Such discussions are not the province of a novelist, and may
      all be found in the files of the Tribune at the State Library. There were,
      likewise, decisions without number handed down by the various courts
      before and after that celebrated session,&mdash;opinions on the validity
      of leases, on the extension of railroads, on the rights of individual
      stockholders&mdash;all dry reading enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the risk of being picked to pieces by the corporation lawyers who may
      read these pages, we shall attempt to state the situation and with all
      modesty and impartiality&mdash;for we, at least, hold no brief. When Mr.
      Isaac D. Worthington obtained that extension of the Truro Railroad (which
      we have read about from the somewhat verdant point of view of William
      Wetherell), that railroad then formed a connection with another road which
      ran northward from Harwich through another state, and with which we have
      nothing to do. Having previously purchased a line to the southward from
      the capital, Mr. Worthington's railroad was in a position to compete with
      Mr. Duncan's (the &ldquo;Central&rdquo;) for Canadian traffic, and also to cut into
      the profits of the &ldquo;Northwestern,&rdquo; Mr. Lovejoy's road. In brief, the Truro
      Railroad found itself very advantageously placed, as Mr. Worthington and
      Mr. Flint had foreseen. There followed a period of bickering and
      recrimination, of attempts of the other two railroads to secure
      representation in the Truro directorate, of suits and injunctions and
      appeals to the Legislature and I know not what else&mdash;in all of which
      affairs Mr. Bijah Bixby and other gentlemen we could name found both
      pleasure and remuneration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, that those halcyon days of the little wars would come again, when a
      captain could ride out almost any time at the held of his band of
      mercenaries and see honest fighting and divide honest spoils! There was
      much knocking about of men and horses, but very little bloodshed, so we
      are told. Mr. Bixby will sit on the sunny side of his barns in Clovelly
      and tell you stories of that golden period with tears in his eyes, when he
      went to conventions with a pocketful of proxies from the river towns, and
      controlled in the greatest legislative year of all a &ldquo;block&rdquo; which
      included the President of the Senate, for which he got the fabulous sum of&mdash;&mdash;.
      He will tell you, but I won't. Mr. Bixby's occupation is gone now. We have
      changed all that, and we are ruled from imperial Rome. If you don't do
      right, they cut off your (political) head, and it is of no use to run
      away, because there is no one to run to.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Isaac D. Worthington&mdash;or shall we say Mr. Flint?&mdash;who was
      responsible for this pernicious change for the worse, who conceived the
      notion of leasing for the Truro the Central and the Northwestern,&mdash;thus
      making one railroad out of the three. If such a gigantic undertaking could
      be got through, Mr. Worthington very rightly deemed that the other
      railroads of the state would eventually fall like ripe fruit into their
      caps&mdash;owning the ground under the tree, as they would. A movement,
      which we need not go unto, was first made upon the courts, and for a while
      adverse decisions came down like summer rain. A genius by the name of
      Jethro Bass had for many years presided (in the room of the governor and
      council at the State House) at the political birth of justices of the
      Supreme Court. None of them actually wore livery, but we have seen one of
      them&mdash;along time ago&mdash;in a horse blanket. None of them were
      favorable to the plans of Mr. Worthington and Mr. Duncan.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have listened to the firing on the skirmish lines for a long time, and
      now the real battle is at hand. It is June, and the Legislature is
      meeting, and Bijah Bixby has come down to the capital at the head of his
      regiment of mercenaries, of which Mr. Sutton is the honorary colonel; the
      clans are here from the north, well quartered and well fed; the Throne
      Room, within the sacred precincts of which we have been before, is
      occupied. But there is another headquarters now, too, in the Pelican House&mdash;a
      Railroad Room; larger than the Throne Room, with a bath-room leading out
      of it. Another old friend of ours, Judge Abner Parkinson of Harwich, he
      who gave the sardonic laugh when Sam Price applied for the post of road
      agent, may often be seen in that Railroad Room from now on. The fact is
      that the judge is about to become famous far beyond the confines of
      Harwich; for he, and none other, is the author of the Consolidation Bill
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint is the generalissimo of the allied railroads, and sits in his
      headquarters early and late, going over the details of the campaign with
      his lieutenants; scanning the clauses of the bill with Judge Parkinson for
      the last time, and giving orders to the captains of mercenaries as to the
      disposition of their forces; writing out passes for the deserving and the
      true. For these latter, also, and for the wavering there is a claw-hammer
      on the marble-topped mantel wielded by Mr. Bijah Bixby, pro tem chief of
      staff&mdash;or of the hammer, for he is self-appointed and very useful. He
      opens the mysterious packing cases which come up to the Railroad Room
      thrice a week, and there is water to be had in the bath-room&mdash;and
      glasses. Mr. Bixby also finds time to do some of the scouting about the
      rotunda and lobbies, for which he is justly celebrated, and to drill his
      regiment every day. The Honorable Heth Sutton, M.C.,&mdash;who held the
      bridge in the Woodchuck Session,&mdash;is there also, sitting in a corner,
      swelled with importance, smoking big Florizel cigars which come from&mdash;somewhere.
      There are, indeed, many great and battle-scarred veterans who congregate
      in that room&mdash;too numerous and great to mention; and saunterers in
      the Capitol Park opposite know when a council of war is being held by the
      volumes of smoke which pour out of the window, just as the Romans are made
      cognizant by the smoking of a chimney of when another notable event takes
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who, then, are left to frequent the Throne Room? Is that ancient seat of
      power deserted, and does Jethro Bass sit there alone behind the curtains,
      in his bitterness, thinking of other bright June days that are gone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all those who had been amazed when Jethro Bass suddenly emerged from
      his retirement and appeared in the capital some months before, none were
      more thunderstruck than certain gentlemen who had been to Coniston
      repeatedly, but in vain, to urge him to make this very fight. The most
      important of these had been Mr. Balch, president of the &ldquo;Down East&rdquo; Road,
      and the representatives of two railroads of another state. They had at
      last offered Jethro fabulous sums to take charge of their armies in the
      field&mdash;sums, at least, that would seem fabulous to many people, and
      had seemed so to them. When they heard that the lion had roused and shaken
      himself and had unaccountably come forth of his own accord, they hastened
      to the state capital to renew their offers. Another shock, but of a
      different kind, was in store for them. Mr. Balch had not actually driven
      the pack-mules, laden with treasure, to the door of the Pelican House,
      where Jethro might see them from his window; but he requested a private
      audience, and it was probably accidental that the end of his personal
      check-book protruded a little from his pocket. He was a big,
      coarse-grained man, Mr. Balch, who had once been a brakeman, and had risen
      by what is known as horse sense to the presidency of his road. There was a
      wonderful sunset beyond the Capitol, but Mr. Balch did not talk about the
      sunset, although Jethro was watching it from behind the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are willing to undertake this fight against consolidation,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Balch, &ldquo;we are ready to talk business with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't know what you're going to, do,&rdquo; answered Jethro; &ldquo;I'm going to
      prevent consolidation, if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Balch, smiling. He regarded this reply as one of
      Jethro's delicate euphemisms. &ldquo;We're prepared to give that same little
      retainer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro did not look up. Mr. Balch went to the table and seized a pen and
      filled out a check for an amount that shall be nameless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made it payable to bearer, as usual,&rdquo; he said, and he handed it to
      Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro took it, and absently tore it into little pieces, and threw the
      pieces on the floor. Mr. Balch watched him in consternation. He began to
      think the report that Jethro had reached his second childhood was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in Halifax are you doing, Bass?&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-want to stop this consolidation, don't you&mdash;want' to stop it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-goin' to do all you can to stop it hain't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I-I'll help you,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help us!&rdquo; exclaimed Balch. &ldquo;Great Scott, we want you to take charge of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I-I'll do all I can, but I won't guarantee it&mdash;w-won't guarantee
      it,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't ask you to guarantee it. If you'll do all you can, that's
      enough. You won't take a retainer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-won't take anything,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say you don't want anything for your for your time and your
      services if the bill is defeated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-that's about it, Ed. Little p-private matter with both of us. You don't
      want consolidation, and I don't. I hain't offered to give you a retainer&mdash;have
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the astounded Mr. Balch. He scratched his head and fingered the
      leaves of his check-book. The captains over the tens and the captains over
      the hundreds would want little retainers&mdash;and who was to pay these?
      &ldquo;How about the boys?&rdquo; asked Mr. Balch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-still got the same office in the depot&mdash;hain't you, Ed, s-same
      office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess the boys hev b'en there before,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Balch went away, meditating upon those sayings, and took the train for
      Boston. If he had waked up of a fine morning to find himself at the head
      of some benevolent and charitable organization, instead of the &ldquo;Down East&rdquo;
       Railroad, he could not have been more astonished than he had been at the
      unaccountable change of heart of Jethro Bass. He did not know what to make
      of it, and told his colleagues so; and at first they feared one of two
      things,&mdash;treachery or lunacy. But a little later a rumor reached Mr.
      Balch's ears that Jethro's hatred of Isaac D. Worthington was at the
      bottom of his reappearance in public life, although Jethro himself never
      mentioned Mr. Worthington's name. Jethro sat in the Throne Room,
      consulting, directing day after day, and when the Legislature assembled,
      &ldquo;the boys&rdquo; began to call at Mr. Balch's office. But Mr. Balch never again
      broached the subject of money to Jethro Bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have to sing the song of sixpence for the last time in these pages; and
      as it is an old song now, there will be no encores. If you can buy one
      member of the lower house for ten dollars, how many members can you buy
      for fifty? It was no such problem in primary arithmetic that Mr. Balch and
      his associates had to solve&mdash;theirs was in higher mathematics, in
      permutations and combinations, and in least squares. No wonder the old
      campaigners speak with tears in their eyes of the days of that ever
      memorable summer. There were spoils to be picked up in the very streets
      richer than the sack of the thirty cities; and as the session wore on it
      is affirmed by men still living that money rained down in the Capitol Park
      and elsewhere like manna from the skies, if you were one of a chosen band.
      If you were, all you had to do was to look in your vest pockets when you
      took your clothes off in the evening and extract enough legal tender to
      pay your bill at the Pelican for a week. Mr. Lovejoy having been overheard
      one day to make a remark concerning the diet of hogs, the next morning
      certain visitors to the capital were horrified to discover trails of corn
      leading from the Pelican House to their doorways. Men who had never seen a
      receiving teller opened bank accounts. No, it was not a problem in simple
      arithmetic, and Mr. Balch and Mr. Flint, and even Mr. Duncan and Mr.
      Worthington, covered whole sheets with figures during the stifling days in
      July. Some men are so valuable that they can be bought twice, or even
      three times, and they make figuring complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro Bass did no calculating. He sat behind the curtains, and he must
      have kept the figures in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle had closed in earnest, and for twelve long, sultry weeks it
      raged with unabated fierceness. Consolidation had a terror for the rural
      mind, and the state Tribune skilfully played its stream upon the
      constituents of those gentlemen who stood tamely at the Worthington
      hitching-posts, and the constituents flocked to the capital; that able
      newspaper, too, found space to return, with interest, the attacks of Mr.
      Worthington's organ, the Newcastle Guardian. These amenities are much too
      personal to reproduce here, now that the smoke of battle has rolled away.
      An epic could be written upon the conflict, if there were space: Canto
      One, the first position carried triumphantly, though at some expense, by
      the Worthington forces, who elect the Speaker. That had been a crucial
      time before the town meetings, when Jethro abdicated. The Worthington
      Speaker goes ahead with his committees, and it is needless to say that Mr.
      Chauncey Weed is not made Chairman of the Committee on Corporations. As an
      offset to this, the Jethro forces gain on the extreme right, where the
      Honorable Peleg Hartington is made President of the Senate, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      For twelve hot weeks, with a public spirit which is worthy of the highest
      praise, the Committee sit in their shirt sleeves all day long and listen
      to arguments for and against consolidation; and ask learned questions that
      startle rural witnesses; and smoke big Florizel cigars (a majority of
      them). Judge Abner Parkinson defends his bill, quoting from the
      Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and the Bible; a
      celebrated lawyer from the capital riddles it, using the same authorities,
      and citing the Federalist and the Golden Rule in addition. The Committee
      sit open-minded, listening with laudable impartiality; it does not become
      them to arrive at a hasty decision on a question of such magnitude. In the
      meantime the House passes an important bill dealing with the bounty on
      hedgehogs, and there are several card games going on in the cellar, where
      it is cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor of the state is a free lance, and may be seen any afternoon
      walking through the park, consorting with no one. He may be recognized
      even at a distance by his portly figure, his silk hat, and his dignified
      mien. Yes, it is an old and valued friend, the Honorable Alva Hopkins,
      patron of the drama, and sometimes he has a beautiful young woman (still
      unattached) by his side. He lives in a suite of rooms at the Pelican. It
      is a well-known fact (among Mr. Worthington's supporters) that the
      Honorable Alva promised in January, when Mr. Bass retired, to sign the
      Consolidation Bill, and that he suddenly became open-minded in March, and
      has remained open-minded ever since, listening gravely to arguments, and
      giving much study to the subject. He is an executive now, although it is
      the last year of his term, and of course he is never seen either in the
      Throne Room or the Railroad Room. And besides, he may become a senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      August has come, and the forces are spent and panting, and neither side
      dares to risk the final charge. The reputation of Jethro Bass is at stake.
      Should he risk and lose, he must go back to Coniston a beaten man, subject
      to the contempt of his neighbors and his state. People do not know that he
      has nothing now to go back to, and that he cares nothing for contempt. As
      he sits in his window day after day he has only one thought and one wish,&mdash;to
      ruin Isaac D. Worthington. And he will do it if he can. Those who know&mdash;and
      among them is Mr. Balch himself&mdash;say that Jethro has never conducted
      a more masterly campaign than this, and that all the others have been mere
      childish trials of strength compared to it. So he sits there through those
      twelve weeks while the session slips by, while his opponents grumble, and
      while even his supporters, eager for the charge, complain. The truth is
      that in all the years of his activity be has never had such an antagonist
      as Mr. Flint. Victory hangs in the balance, and a false move will throw it
      to either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Victory hangs now, to be explicit, upon two factors. The first and most
      immediate of these is a certain canny captain of many wars whose regiment
      is still at the disposal of either army&mdash;for a price, a regiment
      which has hitherto remained strictly neutral. And what a regiment it is! A
      block of river towns and a senator, and not a casualty since they marched
      boldly into camp twelve weeks ago. Mr. Batch is getting very much worried
      about this regiment, and beginning to doubt Jethro's judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, Bass,&rdquo; he said one evening, &ldquo;if you allow him to run around
      loose much longer, we're lost, that's all there is to it!&rdquo; (Mr. Batch
      referred to the captain in question.) &ldquo;They'll buy up his block at his
      figure&mdash;see, if they don't. They're getting desperate. Don't you
      think I'd better bid him in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-bid him in if you've a mind to; Ed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Jethro,&rdquo; said Mr. Batch, savagely biting off the end of a
      cigar, &ldquo;I'm beginning to think you don't care a continental about this
      business. Which side are you on, anyway?&rdquo; The heat and the length and the
      uncertainty of the struggle were telling on the nerves of the railroad
      president. &ldquo;You sit there from morning till night and won't say anything;
      and now, when there's only one block out, you won't give the word to buy
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-never told you to buy anything, did I&mdash;Ed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Mr. Batch, &ldquo;you haven't. I don't know what the devil's got
      into you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-done all the payin' without consultin' me, hain't you, Ed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have. What are you driving at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-done it if I hadn't b'en here, wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and more too,&rdquo; said Mr. Batch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-wouldn't make much difference to you if I wasn't here&mdash;would it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott, Jethro, what do you mean?&rdquo; cried the railroad president, in
      genuine alarm; &ldquo;you're not going to pull out, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-wouldn't make much odds if I did&mdash;would it, Ed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil it wouldn't!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Balch. &ldquo;If you pulled out, we'd
      lose the North Country, and Peleg, and Gosport, and nobody can tell which
      way Alva Hopkins will swing. I guess you know what he'll do&mdash;you're
      so d&mdash;d secretive I can't tell whether you do or not. If you pulled
      out, they'd have their bill on Friday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-hain't under any obligations to you, Ed&mdash;am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Batch, &ldquo;but I don't see why you keep harping on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;J-dust wanted to have it clear,&rdquo; said Jethro, and relapsed into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fireproof carpet on the Throne Room, and Mr. Batch flung down
      his cigar and stamped on it and went out. No wonder he could not
      understand Jethro's sudden scruples about money and obligations&mdash;about
      railroad money, that is. Jethro was spending some of his own, but not in
      the capital, and in a manner which was most effective. In short, at the
      very moment when Mr. Batch stamped on his cigar, Jethro had the victory in
      his hands&mdash;only he did not choose to say so. He had had a mysterious
      telegram that day from Harwich, signed by Chauncey Weed, and Mr. Weed
      himself appeared at the door of Number 7, fresh from his travels, shortly
      after Mr. Batch had gone out of it. Mr. Weed closed the door gently, and
      locked it, and sat down in a rocking chair close to Jethro and put his
      hand over his mouth. We cannot hear what Mr. Weed is saying. All is
      mystery here, and in order to preserve that mystery we shall delay for a
      little the few words which will explain Mr. Weed's successful mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Batch, angry and bewildered, descended into the rotunda, where he
      shortly heard two astounding pieces of news. The first was that the
      Honorable Heth Sutton had abandoned the Florizel cigars and had gone home
      to Clovelly. The second; that Mr. Bijah Bixby had resigned the claw-hammer
      and had ceased to open the packing cases in the Railroad Room.
      Consternation reigned in that room, so it was said (and this was true).
      Mr. Worthington and Mr. Duncan and Mr. Lovejoy were closeted there with
      Mr. Flint, and the door was locked and the transom shut, and smoke was
      coming out of the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Mr. Bijah Bixby is the canny captain of whom Mr. Balch spoke: he it
      is who owns that block of river towns, intact, and the one senator.
      Impossible! We have seen him opening the packing cases, we have seen him
      working for the Worthington faction for the last two years. Mr. Bixby was
      very willing to open boxes, and to make himself useful and agreeable; but
      it must be remembered that a good captain of mercenaries owes a sacred
      duty to his followers. At first Mr. Flint had thought he could count on
      Mr. Bixby; after a while he made several unsuccessful attempts to talk
      business with him; a particularly difficult thing to do, even for Mr.
      Flint, when Mr. Bixby did not wish to talk business. Mr. Balch had found
      it quite as difficult to entice Mr. Bixby away from the boxes and the
      Railroad Room. The weeks drifted on, until twelve went by, and then Mr.
      Bixby found himself, with his block of river towns and one senator, in the
      incomparable position of being the arbiter of the fate of the
      Consolidation Bill in the House and Senate. No wonder Mr. Balch wanted to
      buy the services of that famous regiment at any price!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Bixby, for once in his life, had waited too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Balch, rejoicing, but not a little indignant at not having been
      taken into confidence, ascended to the Throne Room after supper to
      question Jethro concerning the meaning of the things he had heard, he
      found Senator Peleg Hartington seated mournfully on the bed, talking at
      intervals, and Jethro listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up and eat out of my hand,&rdquo; said the senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Balch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bije,&rdquo; answered the senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott, do you mean to say you've got Bixby?&rdquo; exclaimed the railroad
      president. He felt as if he would like to shake the senator, who was so
      deliberate and mournful in his answers. &ldquo;What did you pay him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hartington appeared shocked by the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess Heth Sutton will settle with him,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heth Sutton! Why the&mdash;why should Heth pay him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess Heth'd like to make him a little present, under the circumstances.
      I was goin' through the barber shop,&rdquo; Mr. Hartington continued, speaking
      to Jethro and ignoring the railroad president, &ldquo;and I heard somebody
      whisperin' my name. Sound came out of that little shampoo closet; went in
      there and found Bije. 'Peleg,' says he, right into my ear, 'tell Jethro
      it's all right&mdash;you understand. We want Heth to go back&mdash;break
      his heart if he didn't&mdash;you understand. If I'd knowed last winter
      Jethro meant business, I wouldn't hev' helped Gus Flint out. Tell Jethro
      he can have 'em&mdash;you know what I mean.' Bije waited a little mite too
      long,&rdquo; said the senator, who had given a very fair imitation of Mr.
      Bixby's nasal voice and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm d&mdash;d!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Balch, staring at Jethro. &ldquo;How did
      you work it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sent Chauncey through the deestrict,&rdquo; said Mr. Hartington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chauncey Weed had, in truth, gone through a part of the congressional
      district of the Honorable Heth Sutton with a little leather bag. Mr. Weed
      had been able to do some of his work (with the little leather bag) in the
      capital itself. In this way Mr. Bixby's regiment, Sutton was the honorary
      colonel, had been attacked in the rear and routed. Here was to be a
      congressional convention that autumn, and a large part of Mr. Sutton's
      district lay in the North Country, which, as we have seen, was loyal to
      Jethro to the back bone. The district, too, was largely rural, and
      therefore anti-consolidation, and the inability of the Worthington forces
      to get their bill through had made it apparent that Jethro Bass was as
      powerful as ever. Under these circumstances it had not been very difficult
      for a gentleman of Mr. Chauncey Weed's powers of persuasion to induce
      various lieutenants in the district to agree to send delegates to the
      coming convention who would be conscientiously opposed to Mr. Sutton's
      renomination: hence the departure from the capital of Mr. Sutton; hence
      the generous offer of Mr. Bixby to put his regiment at the disposal of Mr.
      Bass&mdash;free of charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second factor on which victory hung (we can use the past tense now)
      was none other than his Excellency Alva Hopkins, governor of the state.
      The bill would never get to his Excellency now&mdash;so people said; would
      never get beyond that committee who had listened so patiently to the
      twelve weeks of argument. These were only rumors, after all, for the
      rotunda never knows positively what goes on in high circles; but the
      rotunda does figuring, too, when at length the problem is reduced to a
      simple equation, with Bijah Bixby as x. If it were true that Bijah had
      gone over to Jethro Bass, the Consolidation Bill was dead.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Jethro Bass walked out of the hotel that evening men looked at him,
      and made way for him, but none spoke to him. There was something in his
      face that forbade speech. He was a great man once more&mdash;a greater man
      than ever; and he had, if the persistent rumors were true, accomplished an
      almost incomprehensible feat, even for Jethro Bass. There was another
      reason, too, why they stared at him. In all those twelve weeks of that
      most trying of all sessions he had not once gone into the street, and he
      had been less than ever common in the eyes of men. Twice a day he had
      descended to the dining room for a simple meal&mdash;that was all; and
      fewer had gained entrance to Room Number 7 this session than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a river that flows by the capital, a wide and gentle river
      bordered by green meadows and fringed with willows; higher up, if you go
      far enough, a forest comes down to the water on the western side. Jethro
      walked through the hooded bridge, and up the eastern bank until he could
      see the forest like a black band between the orange sky and the orange
      river, and there he sat down upon a fallen log on the edge of the bank.
      But Jethro was thinking of another scene,&mdash;of a granite-ribbed
      pasture on Coniston Mountain that swings in limitless space, from either
      end of which a man may step off into eternity. William Wetherell, in one
      of his letters, had described that place as the Threshold of the Nameless
      Worlds, and so it had seemed to Jethro in the years of his desolation. He
      was thinking of it now, even as it had been in his mind that winter's
      evening when Cynthia had come to Coniston and had surprised him with that
      look of terrible loneliness on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, and he was thinking of Cynthia. When, indeed, had he not been
      thinking of her? How many tunes had he rehearsed the events in the tannery
      house&mdash;for they were the events of his life now. The triumphs over
      his opponents and enemies fell away, and the pride of power. Such had not
      been his achievements. She had loved him, and no man had reached a higher
      pinnacle than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why he had forfeited that love for vengeance, he could not tell. The
      embers of a man's passions will suddenly burst into flame, and he will
      fiddle madly while the fire burns his soul. He had avenged her as well as
      himself; but had he avenged her, now that he held Isaac Worthington in his
      power? By crushing him, had he not added to her trouble and her sorrow?
      She had confessed that she loved Isaac Worthington's son, and was not he
      (Jethro) widening the breach between Cynthia and the son by crushing the
      father? Jethro had not thought of this. But he had thought of her, night
      and day, as he had sat in his room directing the battle. Not a day had
      passed that he had not looked for a letter, hoping against hope. If she
      had written to him once, if she had come to him once, would he have
      desisted? He could not say&mdash;the fires of hatred had burned so
      fiercely, and still burned so fiercely, that he clenched his fists when it
      came over him that Isaac Worthington was at last in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      A white line above the forest was all that remained of the sunset when he
      rose up and took from his coat a silver locket and opened it and held it
      to the fading light. Presently he closed it again, and walked slowly along
      the river bank toward the little city twinkling on its hill. He crossed
      the hooded bridge and climbed the slope, stopping for a moment at a little
      stationery shop; he passed through the groups which were still loudly
      discussing this thing he had done, and gained his room and locked the
      door. Men came to it and knocked and got no answer. The room was in
      darkness, and the night breeze stirred among the trees in the park and
      blew in at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Jethro got up and lighted the gas and paused at the centre table.
      He was to violate more than one principle of his life that night, though
      not without a struggle; and he sat for a long while looking at the blank
      paper before him. Then he wrote, and sealed the letter&mdash;which
      contained three lines&mdash;and pulled the bell cord. The call was
      answered by a messenger who had been far many years in the service of the
      Pelican House, and who knew many secrets of the gods. The man actually
      grew pale when he saw the address on the envelope which was put in his
      hand and read the denomination of the crisp note under it that was the
      price of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-find the gentleman and give it to him yourself. Er&mdash;John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Bass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't find him, bring it&mdash;back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the man had gone, Jethro turned down the gas and went again to his
      chair by the window. For a while voices came up to him from the street,
      but at length the groups dispersed, one by one; and a distant clock boomed
      out eleven solemn strokes. Twice the clock struck again, at the half-hour
      and midnight, and the noises in the house&mdash;the banging of doors and
      the jangling of keys and the hurrying of feet in the corridors&mdash;were
      hushed. Jethro took no thought of these or of time, and sat gazing at the
      stars in the depths of the sky above the capital dome until a shadow
      emerged from the black mass of the trees opposite and crossed the street.
      In a few minutes there were footsteps in the corridor,&mdash;stealthy
      footsteps&mdash;and a knock on the door. Jethro got up and opened it, and
      closed it again and locked it. Then he turned up the gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;S-sit down,&rdquo; he said, and nodded his head toward the chair by the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaac Worthington laid his silk hat on the table, and sat down. He looked
      very haggard and worn in that light, very unlike the first citizen who had
      entered Brampton in triumph on his return from the West not many months
      before. The long strain of a long fight, in which he had risked much for
      which he had labored a life to gain, had told on him, and there were
      crow's-feet at the corners of, his eyes, and dark circles under them.
      Isaac Worthington had never lost before, and to destroy the fruits of such
      a man's ambition is to destroy the man. He was not as young as he had once
      been. But now, in the very hour of defeat, hope had rekindled the fire in
      the eyes and brought back the peculiar, tight-lipped, mocking smile to the
      mouth. An hour ago, when he had been pacing Alexander Duncan's library,
      the eyes and the mouth had been different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long habit asserts itself at the strangest moments. Jethro Bass took his
      seat by the window, and remained silent. The clock tolled the half-hour
      after midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to see me,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro nodded, almost imperceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, slowly, &ldquo;I suppose you are ready to
      sell out.&rdquo; He found it a little difficult to control his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jethro, &ldquo;r-ready to sell out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington was somewhat taken aback by this simple admission. He
      glanced at Jethro sitting motionless by the window, and in his heart he
      feared him: he had come into that room when the gas was low, afraid.
      Although he would not confess it to himself, he had been in fear of Jethro
      Bass all his life, and his fear had been greater than ever since the March
      day when Jethro had left Coniston. And could he have known, now, the fires
      of hatred burning in Jethro's breast, Isaac Worthington would have been in
      terror indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got to sell?&rdquo; he demanded sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess you know, or you wouldn't have come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What proof have I that you have it to sell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro looked at him for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-my word,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaac Worthington was silent for a while: he was striving to calm himself,
      for an indefinable something had shaken him. The strange stillness of the
      hour and the stranger atmosphere which seemed to surround this transaction
      filled him with a nameless dread. The man in the window had been his
      lifelong enemy: more than this, Jethro Bass, was not like ordinary men&mdash;his
      ways were enshrouded in mystery, and when he struck, he struck hard. There
      grew upon Isaac Worthington a sense that this midnight hour was in some
      way to be the culmination of the long years of hatred between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He believed Jethro: he would have believed him even if Mr. Flint had not
      informed him that afternoon that he was beaten, and bitterly he wished he
      had taken Mr. Flint's advice many months before. Denunciation sprang to
      his lips which he dared not utter. He was beaten, and he must pay&mdash;the
      pound of flesh. Isaac Worthington almost thought it would be a pound of
      flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Jethro looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-biggest price you can pay,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have made up your mind what you want. You've had time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-have made up my mind,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make your demand,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, &ldquo;and I'll give you my answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B-biggest price you can pay,&rdquo; said Jethro, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington's nerves could stand it no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he cried, rising in his chair, &ldquo;if you've brought me here to
      trifle with me, you've made a mistake. It's your business to get control
      of things that belong to other people, and sell them out. I am here to
      buy. Nothing but necessity brings me here, and nothing but necessity will
      keep me here a moment longer than I have to stay to finish this abominable
      affair. I am ready to pay you twenty thousand dollars the day that bill
      becomes a law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time Jethro did not look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P-pay me now,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will pay you the day the bill becomes a law. Then I shall know where I
      stand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro did not answer this ultimatum in any manner, but remained perfectly
      still looking out of the window. Mr. Worthington glanced at him, twice,
      and got his fingers on the brim of his hat, but he did not pick it up. He
      stood so for a while, knowing full well that if he went out of that room
      his chance was gone. Consolidation might come in other years, but he,
      Isaac Worthington, would not be a factor in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want a check, do you?&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;d-don't want a check.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in God's name do you want? I haven't got twenty thousand dollars in
      currency in my pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Isaac Worthington,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington sat down&mdash;out of sheer astonishment, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-want the consolidation&mdash;don't you? Want it bad&mdash;don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington did, not answer. Jethro stood over him now, looking down
      at him from the other side of the narrow table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know Cynthy Wetherell?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Isaac Worthington understood that his premonitions had been real. The
      pound of flesh was to be demanded, but strangely enough, he did not yet
      comprehend the nature of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that there is such a person,&rdquo; he answered, for his pride would not
      permit him to say more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-what do you know about her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaac Worthington was bitterly angry&mdash;the more so because he was
      helpless, and could not question Jethro's right to ask. What did he know
      about her? Nothing, except that she had intrigued to marry his son. Bob's
      letter had described her, to be sure, but he could not be expected to
      believe that: and he had not heard Miss Lucretia Penniman's speech. And
      yet he could not tell Jethro that he knew nothing about her, for he was
      shrewd enough to perceive the drift of the next question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kn-know anything against her?&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington leaned back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see what Miss Wetherell has to do with the present occasion,&rdquo; he
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H-had her dismissed by the prudential committee had her dismissed&mdash;didn't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They chose to act as they saw fit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-told Levi Dodd to dismiss her&mdash;didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was a matter of common knowledge in Brampton, having leaked out
      through Jonathan Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must decline to discuss this,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-wouldn't if I was you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say. T-told Levi Dodd to dismiss her, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did.&rdquo; Isaac Worthington had lost in self-esteem by not saying so
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Wahn't she honest? Wahn't she capable? Wahn't she a lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say that I know anything against Miss Wetherell's character, if
      that's what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-fit to teach&mdash;wahn't she&mdash;fit to teach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she has since qualified before Mr. Errol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fit to teach&mdash;wahn't fit to marry your son&mdash;was she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaac Worthington clutched the table and started from his chair. He grew
      white to his lips with anger, and yet he knew that he must control
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bass,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have something to sell, and I have something to
      buy&mdash;if the price is not ruinous. Let us confine ourselves to that.
      My affairs and my son's affairs are neither here nor there. I ask you
      again, how much do you want for this Consolidation Bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no money will buy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-consent to this marriage, c-consent to this marriage.&rdquo; There was yet
      room for Isaac Worthington to be amazed, and for a while he stared up at
      Jethro, speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that your price?&rdquo; he asked at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th-that's my price,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaac Worthington got up and went to the window and stood looking out
      above the black mass of trees at the dome outlined against the
      star-flecked sky. At first his anger choked him, and he could not think;
      he had just enough reason left not to walk out of the door. But presently
      habit asserted itself in him, too, and he began to reflect and calculate
      in spite of his anger. It is strange that memory plays so small a part in
      such a man. Before he allowed his mind to dwell on the fearful price, he
      thought of his ambitions gratified; and yet he did not think then of the
      woman to whom he had once confided those ambitions&mdash;the woman who was
      the girl's mother. Perhaps Jethro was thinking of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have been&mdash;I know not&mdash;that Isaac Worthington wondered at
      this revelation of the character of Jethro Bass, for it was a revelation.
      For this girl's sake Jethro was willing to forego his revenge, was willing
      at the end of his days to allow the world to believe that he had sold out
      to his enemy, or that he had been defeated by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he thought of the marriage, Isaac Worthington ground his teeth. A
      certain sentiment which we may call pride was so strong in him that he
      felt ready to make almost any sacrifice to prevent it. To hinder it he had
      quarrelled with his son, and driven him away, and threatened
      disinheritance. The price was indeed heavy&mdash;the heaviest he could
      pay. But the alternative&mdash;was not that heavier? To relinquish his
      dream of power, to sink for a while into a crippled state; for he had
      spent large sums, and one of those periodical depressions had come in the
      business of the mills, and those Western investments were not looking so
      bright now.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with his hands opening and closing in front of him, Isaac Worthington
      fought out his battle. A terrible war, that, between ambition and pride&mdash;a
      war to the knife. The issue may yet have been undecided when he turned
      round to Jethro with a sneer which he could not resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why doesn't she marry him without my consent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment Mr. Worthington knew he had gone too far. A certain kind of an
      eye is an incomparable weapon, and armed men have been cowed by those who
      possess it, though otherwise defenceless. Jethro Bass had that kind of an
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess you wouldn't understand if I was to tell you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington walked to the window again, perhaps to compose himself,
      and then came back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your proposition is,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;that if I give my consent to
      this marriage, we are to have Bixby and the governor, and the
      Consolidation Bill will become a law. Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Th-that's it,&rdquo; said Jethro, taking his accustomed seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this consent is to be given when the bill becomes a law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given now. T-to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington took another turn as far as the door, and suddenly came
      and stood before Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jethro nodded toward the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Er&mdash;pen and paper there,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;W-write to Bob&mdash;write to Cynthy. Nice letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is carrying matters with too high a hand, Mr. Bass. I will write the
      letters to-morrow morning.&rdquo; It was intolerable that he, the first citizen
      of Brampton, should have to submit to such humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write 'em now. W-want to see 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I give you my word they will be written and sent to you to-morrow
      afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;T-too late,&rdquo; said Jethro; &ldquo;sit down and write 'em now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington went irresolutely to the table, stood for a minute, and
      dropped suddenly into the chair there. He would have given anything
      (except the realization of his ambitions) to have marched out of the room
      and to have slammed the door behind him. The letter paper and envelopes
      which Jethro had bought stood in a little pile, and Mr. Worthington picked
      up the pen. The clock struck two as he wrote the date, as though to remind
      him that he had written it wrong. If Flint could see him now! Would Flint
      guess? Would anybody guess? He stared at the white paper, and his rage
      came on again like a gust of wind, and he felt that he would rather beg in
      the streets than write such a thing. And yet&mdash;and yet he sat there.
      Surely Jethro Bass must have known that he could have taken no more
      exquisite vengeance than this, to compel a man&mdash;and such a man&mdash;to
      sit down in the white heat of passion&mdash;and write two letters of
      forgiveness! Jethro sat by the window, to all appearances oblivious to the
      tortures of his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who has tried to write a note&mdash;the simplest note when his mind was
      harassed, will understand something of Isaac Worthington's sensations. He
      would no sooner get an inkling of what his opening sentence was to be than
      the flames of his anger would rise and sweep it away. He could not even
      decide which letter he was to write first: to his son, who had defied him
      and who (the father knew in his heart) condemned him? or to the
      schoolteacher, who was responsible for all his misery; who&mdash;Mr.
      Worthington believed&mdash;had taken advantage of his son's youth by
      feminine wiles of no mean order so as to gain possession of him. I can
      almost bring myself to pity the first citizen of Brampton as he sits there
      with his pen poised over the paper, and his enemy waiting to read those
      tender epistles of forgiveness which he has yet to write. The clock has
      almost got round to the half-hour again, and there is only the date&mdash;and
      a wrong one at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Miss Wetherell,&mdash;Circumstances (over which I have no
      control?)&rdquo;&mdash;ought he not to call her Cynthia? He has to make the
      letter credible in the eyes of the censor who sits by the window. &ldquo;My dear
      Miss Wetherell, I have come to the conclusion&rdquo;&mdash;two sheets torn up,
      or thrust into Mr. Worthington's pocket. By this time words have begun to
      have a colorless look. &ldquo;My dear Miss Wetherell,&mdash;Having become
      convinced of the sincere attachment which my son Robert has for you, I am
      writing him to-night to give my full consent to his marriage. He has given
      me to understand that you have hitherto persistently refused to accept him
      because I have withheld that consent, and I take this opportunity of
      expressing my admiration of this praiseworthy resolution on your part.&rdquo;
       (If this be irony, it is sublime! Perhaps Isaac Worthington has a little
      of the artist in him, and now that he is in the heat of creation has
      forgotten the circumstances under which he is composing.) &ldquo;My son's
      happiness and career in life are of such moment to me that, until the
      present, I could not give my sanction to what I at first regarded as a
      youthful fancy. Now that, my son, for your sake, has shown his
      determination and ability to make his own way in the world,&rdquo; (Isaac
      Worthington was not a little proud of this) &ldquo;I have determined that it is
      wise to withdraw my opposition, and to recall Robert to his proper place,
      which is near me. I am sure that my feelings in this matter will be clear
      to you, and that you will look with indulgence upon any acts of mine which
      sprang from a natural solicitation for the welfare and happiness of my
      only child. I shall be in Brampton in a day or two, and I shall at once
      give myself the pleasure of calling on you. Sincerely yours, Isaac D.
      Worthington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps a little formal and pompous for some people, but an admirable and
      conciliatory letter for the first citizen of Brampton. Written under such
      trying circumstances, with I know not how many erasures and false starts,
      it is little short of a marvel in art: neither too much said, nor too
      little, for a relenting parent of Mr. Worthington's character, and I doubt
      whether Talleyrand or Napoleon or even Machiavelli himself could have
      surpassed it. The second letter, now that Mr. Worthington had got into the
      swing, was more easily written. &ldquo;My dear Robert&rdquo; (it said), &ldquo;I have made
      up my mind to give my consent to your marriage to Miss Wetherell, and I am
      ready to welcome you home, where I trust I shall see you shortly. I have
      not been unimpressed by the determined manner in which you have gone to
      work for yourself, but I believe that your place is in Brampton, where I
      trust you will show the same energy in learning to succeed me in the
      business which I have founded there as you have exhibited in Mr. Broke's
      works. Affectionately, your Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very creditable and handsome letter for a forgiving father. When Mr.
      Worthington had finished it, and had addressed both the envelopes, his
      shame and vexation had, curious to relate, very considerably abated. Not
      to go too deeply into the somewhat contradictory mental and cardiac
      processes of Mr. Worthington, he had somehow tricked himself by that magic
      exercise of wielding his pen into thinking that he was doing a noble and
      generous action: into believing that in the course of a very few days&mdash;or
      weeks, at the most, he would have recalled his erring son and have given
      Cynthia his blessing. He would, he told himself, have been forced
      eventually to yield when that paragon of inflexibility, Bob, dictated
      terms to him at the head of the locomotive works. Better let the
      generosity be on his (Mr. Worthington's) side. At all events, victory had
      never been bought more cheaply. Humiliation, in Mr. Worthington's eyes,
      had an element of publicity in it, and this episode had had none of that
      element; and Jethro Bass, moreover, was a highwayman who had held a pistol
      to his head. In such logical manner he gradually bolstered up again his
      habitual poise and dignity. Next week, at the latest, men would point to
      him as the head of the largest railroad interests in the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed back his chair, and rose, merely indicating the result of his
      labors by a wave of his hand. And he stood in the window as Jethro Bass
      got up and went to the table. I would that I had a pen able to describe
      Jethro's sensations when he read them. Unfortunately, he is a man with few
      facial expressions. But I believe that he was artist enough himself to
      appreciate the perfections of the first citizen's efforts. After a much
      longer interval than was necessary for their perusal, Mr. Worthington
      turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-guess they'll do,&rdquo; said Jethro, as he folded them up. He was too
      generous not to indulge, for once, in a little well-deserved praise.
      &ldquo;Hain't underdone it, and hain't overdone it a mite hev you? M-man of
      resource. Callate you couldn't hev beat that if you was to take a week to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it only fair to tell you,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, picking up his
      silk hat, &ldquo;that in those letters I have merely anticipated a very little
      my intentions in the matter. My son having proved his earnestness, I was
      about to consent to the marriage of my own accord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-goin' to do it anyway&mdash;was you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had so determined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-always thought you was high-minded,&rdquo; said Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington was on the point of giving a tart reply to this, but
      restrained himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may look upon the matter as settled?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Consolidation
      Bill is to become a law?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jethro, &ldquo;you'll get your bill.&rdquo; Mr. Worthington had got his
      hand on the knob of the door when Jethro stopped him with a word. He had
      no facial expressions, but he had an eye, as we have seen&mdash;an eye
      that for the second time appeared terrible to his visitor. &ldquo;Isaac
      Worthington,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a-act up to it. No trickery&mdash;or look out&mdash;look
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, the incident being closed so far as he was concerned, Jethro went
      back to his chair by the window, but it is to be recorded that Isaac
      Worthington did not answer him immediately. Then he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to forget that you are talking to a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; answered Jethro, &ldquo;so you be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat where he was long after the sky had whitened and the stars had
      changed from gold to silver and gone out, and the sunlight had begun to
      glance upon the green leaves of the park. Perhaps he was thinking of the
      life he had lived, which was spent now: of the men he had ruled, of the
      victories he had gained from that place which would know him no more. He
      had won the last and the greatest of his victories there, compared to
      which the others had indeed been as vanities. Perhaps he looked back over
      the highway of his life and thought of the woman whom he had loved, and
      wondered what it had been if she had trod it by his side. Who will judge
      him? He had been what he had been; and as the Era was, so was he. Verily,
      one generation passeth away, and another generation cometh.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Isaac Worthington arrived at Mr. Duncan's house, where he was
      staying, at three o'clock in the morning, he saw to his surprise light
      from the library windows lying in bars across the lawn under the trees. He
      found Mr. Duncan in that room with Somers, his son, who had just returned
      from a seaside place, and they were discussing a very grave event. Miss
      Janet Duncan had that day eloped with a gentleman who&mdash;to judge from
      the photograph Somers held&mdash;was both handsome and romantic-looking.
      He had long hair and burning eyes, and a title not to be then verified,
      and he owned a castle near some place on the peninsula of Italy not on the
      map.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are back in Brampton, owning, as we do, an annual pass over the Truro
      Railroad. Cynthia has been there all the summer, and as it is now the
      first of September, her school has begun again. I do not by any means
      intend to imply that Brampton is not a pleasant place to spend the summer:
      the number of its annual visitors is a refutation of that; but to Cynthia
      the season had been one of great unhappiness. Several times Lem Hallowell
      had stopped the stage in front of Ephraim's house to beg her to go to
      Coniston, and Mr. Satterlee had come himself; but she could not have borne
      to be there without Jethro. Nor would she go to Boston, though urged by
      Miss Lucretia; and Mrs. Merrill and the girls had implored her to join
      them at a seaside place on the Cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia had made a little garden behind Ephraim's house, and she spent the
      summer there with her flowers and her books, many of which Lem had fetched
      from Coniston. Ephraim loved to sit there of an evening and smoke his pipe
      and chat with Ezra Graves and the neighbors who dropped in. Among these
      were Mr. Gamaliel Ives, who talked literature with Cynthia; and Lucy
      Baird, his wife, who had taken Cynthia under her wing. I wish I had time
      to write about Lucy Baird. And Mr. Jonathan Hill came&mdash;his mortgage
      not having been foreclosed, after all. When Cynthia was alone with Ephraim
      she often read to him,&mdash;generally from books of a martial flavor,&mdash;and
      listened with an admirable hypocrisy to certain narratives which he was in
      the habit of telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      They never spoke of Jethro. Ephraim was not a casuist, and his sense of
      right and wrong came largely through his affections. It is safe to say
      that he never made an analysis of the sorrow which he knew was afflicting
      the girl, but he had had a general and most sympathetic understanding of
      it ever since the time when Jethro had gone back to the capital; and
      Ephraim never brought home his Guardian or his Clarion now, but read them
      at the office, that their contents might not disturb her.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder that Cynthia was unhappy. The letters came, almost every day,
      with the postmark of the town in New Jersey where Mr. Broke's locomotive
      works were; and she answered them now (but oh, how scrupulously!), though
      not every day. If the waters of love rose up through the grains of sand,
      it was, at least, not Cynthia's fault. Hers were the letters of a friend.
      She was reading such and such a book&mdash;had he read it? And he must not
      work too hard. How could her letters be otherwise when Jethro Bass, her
      benefactor, was at the capital working to defeat and perhaps to ruin Bob's
      father? when Bob's father had insulted and persecuted her? She ought not
      to have written at all; but the lapses of such a heroine are very rare,
      and very dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Cynthia's life was very bitter that summer, with but little hope on
      the horizon of it. Her thoughts were divided between Bob and Jethro. Many
      a night she lay awake resolving to write to Jethro, even to go to him, but
      when morning came she could not bring herself to do so. I do not think it
      was because she feared that he might believe her appeal would be made in
      behalf of Bob's father. Knowing Jethro as she did, she felt that it would
      be useless, and she could not bear to make it in vain; if the memory of
      that evening in the tannery shed would not serve, nothing would serve. And
      again&mdash;he had gone to avenge her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was inevitable that she should hear tidings from the capital. Isaac
      Worthington's own town was ringing with it. And as week after week of that
      interminable session went by, the conviction slowly grew upon Brampton
      that its first citizen had been beaten by Jethro Bass. Something of Mr.
      Worthington's affairs was known: the mills, for instance, were not being
      run to their full capacity. And then had come the definite news that Mr.
      Worthington was beaten, a local representative having arrived straight
      from the rotunda. Cynthia overheard Lem Hallowell telling it to Ephraim,
      and she could not for the life of her help rejoicing, though she despised
      herself for it. Isaac Worthington was humbled now, and Jethro had humbled
      him to avenge her. Despite her grief over his return to that life, there
      was something to compel her awe and admiration in the way he had risen and
      done this thing after men had fallen from him. Her mother had had
      something of these same feelings, without knowing why.
    </p>
    <p>
      People who had nothing but praise for him before were saying hard things
      about Isaac Worthington that night. When the baron is defeated, the serfs
      come out of their holes in the castle rock and fling their curses across
      the moat. Cynthia slept but little, and was glad when the day came to take
      her to her scholars, to ease her mind of the thoughts which tortured it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, when she stopped at the post-office to speak to Ephraim on her
      way homeward in the afternoon, she heard men talking behind the partition,
      and she stood, as one stricken, listening beside the window. Other tidings
      had come in the shape of a telegram. The first rumor had been false.
      Brampton had not yet received the details, but the Consolidation Bill had
      gone into the House that morning, and would be a law before the week was
      out. A part of it was incomprehensible to Cynthia, but so much she had
      understood. She did not wait to speak to Ephraim, and she was going out
      again when a man rushed past her and through the partition door. Cynthia
      paused instinctively, for she recognized him as one of the frequenters of
      the station and a bearer of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro's come home, boys,&rdquo; he shouted; &ldquo;come in on the four o'clock, and
      went right off to Coniston. Guess he's done for, this time, for certain.
      Looks it. By Godfrey, he looks eighty! Callate his day's over, from the
      way the boys talked on the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia lingered to hear no more, and went out, dazed, into the September
      sunshine: Jethro beaten, and broken, and gone to Coniston. Resolution came
      to her as she walked. Arriving home, she wrote a little note and left it
      on the table for Ephraim; and going out again, ran by the back lane to Mr.
      Sherman's livery stable behind the Brampton House, and in half an hour was
      driving along that familiar road to Coniston, alone; for she had often
      driven Jethro's horses, and knew every turn of the way. And as she gazed
      at the purple mountain through the haze and drank in the sweet scents of
      the year's fulness, she was strangely happy. There was the village green
      in the cool evening light, and the flagstaff with its tip silvered by the
      departing sun. She waved to Rias and Lem and Moses at the store, but she
      drove on to the tannery house, and hitched the horse at the rough granite
      post, and went in, and through the house, softly, to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jethro was standing in the doorway, and did not turn. He may have thought
      she was Millicent Skinner. Cynthia could see his face. It was older,
      indeed, and lined and worn, but that fearful look of desolation which she
      had once surprised upon it, and which she in that instant feared to see,
      was not there. Jethro's soul was at peace, though Cynthia could not
      understand why it was so. She stole to him and flung her arms about his
      neck, and with a cry he seized her and held her against him for I know not
      how long. Had it been possible to have held her there always, he would
      never have let her go. At last he looked down into her tear-wet face, into
      her eyes that were shining with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-done wrong, Cynthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia did not answer that, for she remembered how she, too, had exulted
      when she had believed him to have accomplished Isaac Worthington's
      downfall. Now that he had failed, and she was in his arms, it was not for
      her to judge&mdash;only to rejoice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't look for you to come back&mdash;didn't expect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro!&rdquo; she faltered. Love for her had made him go, and she would
      not say that, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D-don't hate me, Cynthy&mdash;don't hate me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love me&mdash;a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She reached up her hands and brushed back his hair, tenderly, from his
      forehead. Such&mdash;a loving gesture was her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going to stay here always, now,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, &ldquo;you
      are never going away again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G-goin' to stay always,&rdquo; he answered. Perhaps he was thinking of the
      hillside clearing in the forest&mdash;who knows! &ldquo;You'll come-sometime,
      Cynthy&mdash;sometime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come every Saturday and Sunday, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said, smiling up
      at him. &ldquo;Saturday is only two days away, now. I can hardly wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y-you'll come sometime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro, do you think I'll be away from you, except&mdash;except
      when I have to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-come and read to me&mdash;won't you&mdash;come and read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;C-call to mind the first book you read to me, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was 'Robinson Crusoe,'&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'R-Robinson Crusoe.' Often thought of that book. Know some of it by
      heart. R-read it again, sometime, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him a little anxiously. His eyes were on the great hill
      opposite, across Coniston Water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, indeed, Uncle Jethro, if we can find it,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I can find it,&rdquo; said Jethro. &ldquo;R-remember when you saw him makin' a
      ship?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;and I had my feet in the pool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The book had made a profound impression upon Jethro, partly because
      Cynthia had first read it to him, and partly for another reason. The
      isolation of Crusoe; depicted by Defoe's genius, had been comparable to
      his own isolation, and he had pondered upon it much of late. Yes, and upon
      a certain part of another book which he had read earlier in life: Napoleon
      had ended his days on St. Helena.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked out under the trees to the brook-side and stood listening to
      the tinkling of the cowbells in the wood lot beyond. The light faded early
      on these September evenings, and the smoky mist had begun to rise from the
      water when they turned back again. The kitchen windows were already
      growing yellow, and through them the faithful Millicent could be seen
      bustling about in her preparations for supper. But Cynthia, having
      accomplished her errand, would not go in. She could not have borne to have
      any one drive back with her to Brampton then, and she must not be late
      upon the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come Friday evening, Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said, as she kissed him
      and gave one last, lingering look at his face. Had it been possible, she
      would not have left him, and on her way to Brampton through the gathering
      darkness she mused anxiously upon that strange calmness he had shown after
      defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove her horse on to the floor of Mr. Sherman's stable, that
      gentleman himself gallantly assisting her to alight, and walked homeward
      through the lane. Ephraim had not yet returned from the postoffice, which
      did not close until eight, and Cynthia smiled when she saw the utensils of
      his cooking-kit strewn on the hearth. In her absence he invariably
      unpacked and used it, and of course Cynthia at once set herself to
      cleaning and packing it again. After that she got her own supper&mdash;a
      very simple affair&mdash;and was putting the sitting room to rights when
      Ephraim came thumping in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I swan!&rdquo; he exclaimed when he saw her. &ldquo;I didn't look for you to
      come back so soon, Cynthy. Put up the kit&mdash;hev you?&rdquo; He stood in
      front of the fireplace staring with apparent interest at the place where
      the kit had been, and added in a voice which he strove to make quite
      casual, &ldquo;How be Jethro?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looks older, Cousin Eph,&rdquo; she answered, after a pause, &ldquo;and I think he
      is very tired. But he seems he seems more tranquil and contented than I
      hoped to find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to know,&rdquo; said Ephraim. &ldquo;I am glad to hear it. Glad you went up,
      Cynthy&mdash;you done right to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd have gone with you, if you'd only told me. I'll git a chance to go up
      Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an air of repressed excitement about the veteran which did not
      escape Cynthia. He held two letters in his hand, and, being a postmaster,
      he knew the handwriting on both. One had come from that place in New
      Jersey, and drew no comment. But the other! That one had been postmarked
      at the capital, and as he had sat at his counter at the post-office
      waiting for closing time he had turned it over and over with many
      ejaculations and futile guesses. Past master of dissimulation that he was,
      he had made up his mind&mdash;if he should find Cynthia at home&mdash;to
      lay the letters indifferently on the table and walk into his bedroom. This
      campaign he now proceeded to carry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia smiled again when he was gone, and shook her head and picked up
      the letters: Bob's was uppermost and she read that first, without a
      thought of the other one. And she smiled as she read for Bob had had a
      promotion. He was not yet at the head of the locomotive works, he hastened
      to add, for fear that Cynthia might think that Mr. Broke had resigned the
      presidency in his favor; and Cynthia never failed to laugh at these little
      facetious asides. He was now earning the princely sum of ninety dollars a
      month&mdash;not enough to marry on, alas! On Saturday nights he and Percy
      Broke scrubbed as much as possible of the grime from their hands and faces
      and went to spend Sunday at Elberon, the Broke place on the Hudson; from
      whence Miss Sally Broke, if she happened to be at home, always sent
      Cynthia her love. As Cynthia is still a heroine, I shall not describe how
      she felt about Sally Broke's love. There was plenty of Bob's own in the
      letter. Cynthia would got have blamed him if he bad fallen in love with
      Miss Broke. It seemed to her little short of miraculous that, amidst such
      surroundings, he could be true to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a period which was no briefer than that usually occupied by Bob's
      letters, Cynthia took the other one from her lap, and stared at it in much
      perplexity before she tore it open. We have seen its contents over Mr.
      Worthington's shoulder, and our hearts will not stop beating&mdash;as
      Cynthia's did. She read it twice before the full meaning of it came to
      her, and after that she could not well mistake it,&mdash;the language
      being so admirable in every way. She sat very still for a long while, and
      presently she heard Ephraim go out. But Cynthia did not move. Mr.
      Worthington relented and Bob recalled! The vista of happiness suddenly
      opened up, widened and widened until it was too bright for Cynthia's
      vision, and she would compel her mind to dwell on another prospect,&mdash;that
      of the father and son reconciled. Although her temples throbbed, she tried
      to analyze the letter. It implied that Mr. Worthington had allowed Bob to
      remain away on a sort of probation; it implied that it had been dictated
      by a strong paternal love mingled with a strong paternal justice. And then
      there was the appeal to her: &ldquo;You will look with indulgence upon any acts
      of mine which sprang from a natural solicitation for the welfare and
      happiness of my only child.&rdquo; A terrible insight is theirs to whom it is
      given to love as Cynthia loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly there came a knock which frightened her, for her mind was running
      on swiftly from point to point: had, indeed, flown as far as Coniston by
      now, and she was thinking of that strange look of peace on Jethro's face
      which had troubled her. One letter she thrust into her dress, but the
      other she laid aside, and her knees trembled under her as she rose and
      went into the entry and raised the latch and opened the door. There was a
      moon, and the figure in the frock coat and the silk hat was the one which
      she expected to see. The silk hat came off very promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope I am not disturbing you, Miss Wetherell,&rdquo; said the owner of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Cynthia, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia held open the door a little wider, and Mr. Worthington walked in.
      He seemed very majestic and out of place in the little house which Gabriel
      Post had built, and he carried into it some of the atmosphere of the
      walnut and high ceilings of his own mansion. His manner of laying his hat,
      bottom up, on the table, and of unbuttoning his coat, subtly indicated the
      honor which he was conferring upon the place. And he eyed Cynthia,
      standing before him in the lamplight, with a modification of the hawk-like
      look which was meant to be at once condescending and conciliatory. He did
      not imprint a kiss upon her brow, as some prospective fathers-in-law would
      have done. But his eyes, perhaps involuntarily, paid a tribute to her
      personal appearance which heightened her color. She might not, after all,
      be such a discredit to the Worthington family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I hope I may now be allowed to call you
      Cynthia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him, but sat down herself, and he followed her example;
      with his eyes still upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have doubtless received my letter,&rdquo; began Mr. Worthington. &ldquo;I only
      arrived in Brampton an hour ago, but I thought it best to come to you at
      once, under the circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Cynthia, &ldquo;I received the letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington. He was beginning to be a little taken
      aback by her calmness and her apparent absence of joy. It was scarcely the
      way in which a school-teacher should receive the advances of the first
      citizen, come to give a gracious consent to her marriage with his son. Had
      he known it, Cynthia was anything but calm. &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because
      I took pains to explain the exact situation in that letter, and to set
      forth my own sentiments. I hope you understood them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I understood them,&rdquo; said Cynthia, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was enigmatical, to say the least. But Mr. Worthington had come with
      such praiseworthy intentions that he was disposed to believe that the girl
      was overwhelmed by the good fortune which had suddenly overtaken her. He
      was therefore disposed to be a little conciliatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My conduct may have appeared harsh to you,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I will not
      deny that I opposed the matter at first. Robert was still in college, and
      he has a generous, impressionable nature which he inherits from his poor
      mother&mdash;the kind of nature likely to commit a rash act which would
      ruin his career. I have since become convinced that he has&mdash;ahem&mdash;inherited
      likewise a determination of purpose and an ability to get on in the world
      which I confess I had underestimated. My friend, Mr. Broke, has written me
      a letter about him, and tells me that he has already promoted him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear from him?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Worthington, giving her a quick glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cynthia, her color rising a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, slowly, &ldquo;I have been under the impression
      that you have persistently refused to marry him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot refrain from complimenting you, Cynthia, upon such rare
      conduct,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You will be glad to know that it has contributed more
      than anything else toward my estimation of your character, and has
      strengthened me in my resolution that I am now doing right. It may be
      difficult for you to understand a father's feelings. The complete
      separation from my only son was telling on me severely, and I could not
      forget that you were the cause of that separation. I knew nothing about
      you, except&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated, for she had turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except what?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington coughed. Mr. Flint had told him, that very morning, of her
      separation from Jethro, and of the reasons which people believed had
      caused it. Unfortunately, we have not time to go into that conversation
      with Mr. Flint, who had given a very good account of Cynthia indeed. After
      all (Mr. Worthington reflected), he had consented to the marriage, and
      there was no use in bringing Jethro's name into the conversation. Jethro
      would be forgotten soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not deny to You that I had other plans for my son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      had hoped that he would marry a daughter of a friend of mine. You must be
      a little indulgent with parents, Cynthia,&rdquo; he added with a little smile,
      &ldquo;we have our castles in the air, too. Sometimes, as in this case, by a
      wise provision of providence they go astray. I suppose you have heard of
      Miss Duncan's marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ran off with a worthless Italian nobleman. I believe, on the whole,&rdquo;
       he said, with what was an extreme complaisance for the first citizen,
      &ldquo;that I have reason to congratulate myself upon Robert's choice. I have
      made inquiries about you, and I find that I have had the pleasure of
      knowing your mother, whom I respected very much. And your father, I
      understand, came of very good people, and was forced by circumstances to
      adopt the means of livelihood he did. My attention has been called to the
      letters he wrote to the Guardian, which I hear have been highly praised by
      competent critics, and I have ordered a set of them for the files of the
      library. You yourself, I find, are highly thought of in Brampton&rdquo; (a, not
      unimportant factor, by the way); &ldquo;you have been splendidly educated, and
      are a lady. In short, Cynthia, I have come to give my formal consent to
      your engagement to my son Robert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am not engaged to him,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be here shortly, I imagine,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was trembling more than ever by this time. She was very angry, and
      she had found it very difficult to repress the things which she had been
      impelled to speak. She did not hate Isaac Worthington now&mdash;she
      despised him. He had not dared to mention Jethro, who had been her
      benefactor, though he had done his best to have her removed from the
      school because of her connection with Jethro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Worthington,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have not yet made up my mind whether I
      shall marry your son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To say that Mr. Worthington's breath was taken away when he heard these
      words would be to use a mild expression. He doubted his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he exclaimed, starting forward, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia hesitated a moment. She was not frightened, but she was trying to
      choose her words without passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I refused to marry him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because you withheld your consent,
      and I did not wish to be the cause of a quarrel between you. It was not
      difficult to guess your feelings toward me, even before certain things
      occurred of which I will not speak. I did my best, from the very first, to
      make Bob give up the thought of marrying me, although I loved and honored
      him. Loving him as I do, I do not want to be the cause of separating him
      from his father, and of depriving him of that which is rightfully his. But
      something was due to myself. If I should ever make up my mind to marry
      him,&rdquo; continued Cynthia, looking at Mr. Worthington steadfastly, &ldquo;it will
      not be because your consent is given or withheld.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you tell me this to my face?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Worthington, now in a rage
      himself at such unheard-of presumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To your face,&rdquo; said Cynthia, who got more self-controlled as he grew
      angry. &ldquo;I believe that that consent, which you say you have given freely,
      was wrung from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate that the first citizen might not always have Mr. Flint
      by him to restrain and caution him. But Mr. Flint could have no command
      over his master's sensations, and anger and apprehension goaded Mr.
      Worthington to indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jethro Bass told you this!&rdquo; he cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Cynthia answered, not in the least surprised by the admission, &ldquo;he
      did not tell me&mdash;but he will if I ask him. I guessed it from your
      letter. I heard that he had come back to-day, and I went to Coniston to
      see him, and he told me&mdash;he had been defeated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears came into her eyes at the remembrance of the scene in the tannery
      house that afternoon, and she knew now why Jethro's face had worn that
      look of peace. He had made his supreme sacrifice&mdash;for her. No, he had
      told her nothing, and she might never have known. She sat thinking of the
      magnitude of this thing Jethro had done, and she ceased to speak, and the
      tears coursed down her cheeks unheeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaac Worthington had a habit of clutching things when he was in a rage,
      and now he clutched the arms of the chair. He had grown white. He was
      furious with her, furious with himself for having spoken that which might
      be construed into a confession. He had not finished writing the letters
      before he had stood self-justified, and he had been self-justified ever
      since. Where now were these arguments so wonderfully plausible? Where were
      the refutations which he had made ready in case of a barely possible need?
      He had gone into the Pelican House intending to tell Jethro of his
      determination to agree to the marriage. That was one. He had done so&mdash;that
      was another&mdash;and he had written the letters that Jethro might be
      convinced of his good will. There were still more, involving Jethro's
      character for veracity and other things. Summoning these, he waited for
      Cynthia to have done speaking, but when she had finished&mdash;he said
      nothing. He looked a her, and saw the tears on her face, and he saw that
      she had completely forgotten his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the life of him, Isaac Worthington could not utter a word. He was a
      man, as we know, who did not talk idly, and he knew that Cynthia would not
      hear what he said; and arguments and denunciations lose their effect when
      repeated. Again, he knew that she would not believe him. Never in his life
      had Isaac Worthington been so ignored, so put to shame, as by this
      school-teacher of Brampton. Before, self-esteem and sophistry had always
      carried him off between them; sometimes, in truth, with a wound&mdash;the
      wound had always healed. But he had a feeling, to-night, that this woman
      had glanced into his soul, and had turned away from it. As he looked at
      her the texture of his anger changed; he forgot for the first time that
      which he had been pleased to think of as her position in life, and he
      feared her. He had matched his spirit against hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long the situation became intolerable to him, for Cynthia still sat
      silent. She was thinking of how she had blamed Jethro for going back to
      that life, even though his love for her had made him do it. But Isaac
      Worthington did not know of what she was thinking&mdash;he thought only of
      himself and his predicament. He could not remain, and yet he could not go&mdash;with
      dignity. He who had come to bestow could not depart like a whipped dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a fear transfixed him: suppose that this woman, from whom he
      could not hide the truth, should tell his son what he had done. Bob would
      believe her. Could he, Isaac Worthington, humble his pride and ask her to
      keep her suspicions to herself? He would then be acknowledging that they
      were more than suspicions. If he did so, he would have to appear to
      forgive her in spite of what she had said to him. And Bob was coming home.
      Could he tell Bob that he had changed his mind and withdrawn his consent
      to the marriage? There world be the reason, and again Bob would believe
      her. And again, if he withdrew his consent, there was Jethro to reckon
      with. Jethro must have a weapon still, Mr. Worthington thought, although
      he could not imagine what it might be. As Isaac Worthington sat there,
      thinking, it grew clear, to him at last that there was but one exit out of
      a very desperate situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Cynthia again, this time appraisingly. She had dried her
      eyes, but she made no effort to speak. After all, she would make such a
      wife for his son as few men possessed. He thought of Sarah Hollingsworth.
      She had been a good woman, but there had been many times when he had
      deplored&mdash;especially in his travels the lack of other qualities in
      his wife. Cynthia, he thought, had these qualities,&mdash;so necessary for
      the wife of one who would succeed to power&mdash;though whence she had got
      them Isaac Worthington could not imagine. She would become a personage;
      she was a woman of whom they had no need to be ashamed at home or abroad.
      Having completed these reflections, he broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry that you should have been misled into thinking such a thing as
      you have expressed, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I believe that I can
      understand something of the feelings which prompted you. It is natural
      that you should have a resentment against me after everything that has
      happened. It is perhaps natural, too, that I should lose my temper under
      the circumstances. Let us forget it. And I trust that in the future we
      shall grow into the mutual respect and affection which our nearer
      relationship will demand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and took up his hat, and Cynthia rose too. There was something
      very fine, he thought, about her carriage and expression as she stood in
      front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is my hand,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;&ldquo;will you take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take it,&rdquo; Cynthia answered, &ldquo;because you are Bob's father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Mr. Worthington went away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      I am able to cite one notable instance, at least, to disprove the saying a
      part of which is written above, and I have yet to hear of a case in which
      a gentleman ever hesitated a single instant on account of the first letter
      of a lady's last name. I know, indeed, of an occasion when locomotives
      could not go fast enough, when thirty miles an hour seemed a snail's pace
      to a young main who sat by the open window of a train that crept northward
      on a certain hazy September morning up the beautiful valley of a broad
      river which we know.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after three o'clock before he caught sight of the familiar crest of
      Farewell Mountain, and the train ran into Harwich. How glad he was to see
      everybody there, whether he knew them or not! He came near hugging the
      conductor of the Truro accommodation; who, needless to say, did not ask
      him for a ticket, or even a pass. And then the young man went forward and
      almost shook the arms off of the engineer and the fireman, and climbed
      into the cab, and actually drove the engine himself as far as Brampton,
      where it arrived somewhat ahead of schedule, having taken some of the
      curves and bridges at a speed a little beyond the law. The engineer was
      richer by five dollars, and the son of a railroad president is a
      privileged character, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, here was Brampton, and in spite of the haze the sun had never shone
      so brightly on the terraced steeple of the meeting-house. He leaped out of
      the cab almost before the engine had stopped, and beamed upon everybody on
      the platform,&mdash;even upon Mr. Dodd, who chanced to be there. In a
      twinkling the young man is in Mr. Sherman's hack, and Mr. Sherman
      galloping his horse down Brampton Street, the young man with his head out
      of the window, smiling; grinning would be a better word. Here are the iron
      mastiffs, and they seem to be grinning, too. The young man flings open the
      carriage door and leaps out, and the door is almost broken from its hinges
      by the maple tree. He rushes up the steps and through the hall, and into
      the library, where the first citizen and his seneschal are sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Father, you see I didn't waste any time,&rdquo; he cried; grasping his
      father's hand in a grip that made Mr. Worthington wince. &ldquo;Well, you are a
      trump, after all. We're both a little hot-headed, I guess, and do things
      we're sorry for,&mdash;but that's all over now, isn't it? I'm sorry. I
      might have known you'd come round when you found out for yourself what
      kind of a girl Cynthia was. Did you ever see anybody like her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flint turned his back, and started to walk out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go, Flint, old boy,&rdquo; Bob called out, seizing Mr. Flint's hand, too.
      &ldquo;I can't stay but a minute, now. How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Bob,&rdquo; answered Mr. Flint, with a curious, kindly look in his
      eyes that was not often there. &ldquo;I'm glad to see you home. I have to go to
      the bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Father,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;school must be out, and I imagine you know
      where I'm going. I just thought I'd stop in to&mdash;to thank you, and get
      a benediction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very happy to have you back, Robert,&rdquo; replied Mr. Worthington, and
      it was true. It would have been strange indeed if some tremor of sentiment
      had not been in his voice and some gleam of pride in his eye as he looked
      upon his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you saw her, and couldn't resist her,&rdquo; said Bob. &ldquo;Wasn't that how it
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Worthington sat down again at the desk, and his hand began to stray
      among the papers. He was thinking of Mr. Flint's exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not arrive at my decisions quite in that way, Robert,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have seen her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a hesitation, an uneasiness in his father's tone for which Bob
      could not account, and which he attributed to emotion. He did not guess
      that this hour of supreme joy could hold for Isaac Worthington another
      sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't she the finest girl in the world?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;How does she seem?
      How does she look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looks extremely well,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, who had now schooled his
      voice. &ldquo;In fact, I am quite ready to admit that Cynthia Wetherell
      possesses the qualifications necessary for your wife. If she had not, I
      should never have written you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob walked to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father;&rdquo; he said, speaking with a little difficulty, &ldquo;I can't tell you
      how much I appreciate your&mdash;your coming round. I wanted to do the
      right thing, but I just couldn't give up such a girl as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall let bygones be bygones, Robert,&rdquo; answered Mr. Worthington,
      clearing his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never would have me without your consent. By the way,&rdquo; he cried,
      turning suddenly, &ldquo;did she say she'd have me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Mr. Worthington, clearing his throat again, &ldquo;I believe
      she reserved her decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be off,&rdquo; said Bob, &ldquo;she goes to Coniston on Fridays. I'll drive
      her out. Good-by, Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flew out of the room, ran into Mrs. Holden, whom he astonished by
      saluting on the cheek, and astonished even more by asking her to tell
      Silas to drive his black horses to Gabriel Post's house&mdash;as the
      cottage was still known in Brampton. And having hastily removed some of
      the cinders, he flew out of the door and reached the park-like space in
      the middle of Brampton Street. Then he tried to walk decorously, but it
      was hard work. What if she should not be in?
    </p>
    <p>
      The door and windows of the little house were open that balmy afternoon,
      and the bees were buzzing among the flowers which Cynthia had planted on
      either side of the step. Bob went up the path, and caught a glimpse of her
      through the entry standing in the sitting room. She was, indeed, waiting
      for the Coniston stage, and she did not see him. Shall I destroy the
      mental image of the reader who has known her so long by trying to tell
      what she looked like? Some heroines grow thin and worn by the troubles
      which they are forced to go through. Cynthia was not this kind of a
      heroine. She was neither tall nor short, and the dark blue gown which she
      wore set off (so Bob thought) the curves of her figure to perfection. Her
      face had become a little more grave&mdash;yes, and more noble; and the
      eyes and mouth had an indescribable, womanly sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a moment outside the doorway gazing at her; hesitating to
      desecrate that revery, which seemed to him to have a touch of sadness in
      it. And then she turned her head, slowly, and saw him, and her lips
      parted, and a startled look came into her eyes, but she did not move. He
      came quickly into the room and stopped again, quivering from head to foot
      with the passion which the sight of her never failed to unloose within
      him. Still she did not speak, but her lip trembled, and the love leaping
      in his eyes kindled a yearning in hers,&mdash;a yearning she was powerless
      to resist. He may by that strange power have drawn her toward him&mdash;he
      never knew. Neither of them could have given evidence on that marvellous
      instant when the current bridged the space between them. He could not say
      whether this woman whom he had seized by force before had shown alike
      vitality in her surrender. He only knew that her arms were woven about his
      neck, and that the kiss of which he had dreamed was again on his lips, and
      that he felt once more her wonderful, supple body pressed against his, and
      her heart beating, and her breast heaving. And he knew that the strength
      of the love in her which he had gained was beyond estimation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus for a time they swung together in ethereal space, breathless with the
      motion of their flight. The duration of such moments is&mdash;in words&mdash;limitless.
      Now he held her against him, and again he held her away that his eyes
      might feast upon hers until she dropped her lashes and the crimson tide
      flooded into her face and she hid it again in the refuge she had longed
      for,&mdash;murmuring his name. But at last, startled by some sound without
      and so brought back to earth, she led him gently to the window at the side
      and looked up at him searchingly. He was tanned no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid you had been working too hard,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you do love me?&rdquo; was Bob's answer to this remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia smiled at him with her eyes: gravely, if such a thing may be said
      of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob, how can you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cynthia,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;if you knew what I have been through, you
      wouldn't have held out, I know it. I began to think I should never have
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have me now,&rdquo; she said, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you look like that?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled up at him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, have suffered, Bob,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I have thought of you night
      and day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, sweetheart,&rdquo; he cried, and kissed her again,&mdash;many
      times. &ldquo;It's all right now, isn't it? I knew my father would give his
      consent when he found out what you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The expression of pain which had troubled him crossed her face again, and
      she put her hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, dearest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I love you. I am doing this for you. You
      must understand that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, Cynthia, I understand it&mdash;of course I do,&rdquo; he answered,
      perplexed. &ldquo;I understand it, but I don't deserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to know,&rdquo; she continued in a low voice, &ldquo;that I should have
      married you anyway. I&mdash;I could not have helped it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were to go back to the locomotive works' tomorrow, I would marry
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On ninety dollars a month?&rdquo; exclaimed Bob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wanted me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wanted you! I could live in a log cabin with you the rest of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew down his face to hers, and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wished you to be reconciled with your father,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I could
      not bear to come between you. You&mdash;you are reconciled, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, we are,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad, Bob,&rdquo; she answered simply. &ldquo;I should not have been happy if I
      had driven you away from the place where you should be, which is your
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherever you are will be my home; sweetheart,&rdquo; he said, and pressed her
      to him once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, looking past his shoulder into the street, she saw Lem
      Hallowell pulling up the Brampton stage before the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I must go to Coniston and see Uncle Jethro. I promised
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bob's answer was to walk into the entry, where he stood waving the most
      joyous of greetings at the surprised stage driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you won't get anybody here, Lem,&rdquo; he called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Bob,&rdquo; protested Cynthia, from within, afraid to show her face just
      then, &ldquo;I have to go, I promised. And&mdash;and I want to go,&rdquo; she added
      when he turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm running a stage to Coniston to-day myself, Lem,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;and I'm
      going to steal your best passenger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lemuel immediately flung down his reins and jumped out of the stage and
      came up the path and into the entry, where he stood confronting Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hev you took him, Cynthy?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lem,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;won't you congratulate me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warm-hearted stage driver did congratulate her in a most unmistakable
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a sight of her, Bob,&rdquo; he said after he had shaken both of Bob's
      hands and brushed his own eyes with his coat sleeve. &ldquo;I've knowed her so
      long&mdash;&rdquo; Whereupon utterance failed him, and he ran down the path and
      jumped into his stage again and drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Cynthia sent Bob on an errand&mdash;not a very long one, and
      while he was gone, she sat down at the table and tried to realize her
      happiness, and failed. In less than ten minutes Bob had come back with
      Cousin Ephraim, as fast as he could hobble. He flung his arms around her,
      stick and all, and he was crying. It is a fact that old soldiers sometimes
      cry. But his tears did not choke his utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Tecumseh!&rdquo; said Cousin Ephraim, &ldquo;so you've went and done it,
      Cynthy. Siege got a little mite too hot. I callated she'd capitulate in
      the end, but she held out uncommon long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she did,&rdquo; exclaimed Bob, feelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I was tellin' Bob I hain't got nothin' against him,&rdquo; continued
      Ephraim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cousin Eph,&rdquo; said Cynthia, laughing in spite of herself, and glancing
      at Bob, &ldquo;is that all you can say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Eph's all right,&rdquo; said Bob, laughing too. &ldquo;We understand each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Callate we do,&rdquo; answered Ephraim. &ldquo;I'll go so far as to say there hain't
      nobody I'd ruther see you marry. Guess I'll hev to go back to the kit,
      now. What's to become of the old pensioner, Cynthy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old pensioner needn't worry,&rdquo; said Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then drove up Silas the Silent, with Bob's buggy and his black trotters.
      All of Brampton might see them now; and all of Brampton did see them.
      Silas got out,&mdash;his presence not being required,&mdash;and Cynthia
      was helped in, and Bob got in beside her, and away they went, leaving
      Ephraim waving his stick after them from the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is recorded against the black trotters that they made very poor time to
      Coniston that day, though I cannot discover that either of them was lame.
      Lem Hallowell, who was there nearly an hour ahead of them, declares that
      the off horse had a bunch of branches in his mouth. Perhaps Bob held them
      in on account of the scenery that September afternoon. Incomparable
      scenery! I doubt if two lovers of the renaissance ever wandered through a
      more wondrous realm of pleasance&mdash;to quote the words of the poet.
      Spots in it are like a park, laid out by that peerless landscape gardener,
      nature: dark, symmetrical pine trees on the sward, and maples in the
      fulness of their leaf, and great oaks on the hillsides, and, coppices; and
      beyond, the mountain, the evergreens massed like cloud-shadows on its
      slopes; and all-trees and coppice and mountain&mdash;flattened by the haze
      until they seemed woven in the softest of blues and blue greens into one
      exquisite picture of an ancient tapestry. I, myself, have seen these
      pictures in that country, and marvelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they drove on through that realm, which was to be their realm, and came
      all too soon to Coniston green. Lem Hallowell had spread the well-nigh
      incredible news, that Cynthia Wetherell was to marry the son of the
      mill-owner and railroad president of Brampton, and it seemed to Cynthia
      that every man and woman and child of the village was gathered at the
      store. Although she loved them, every one, she whispered something to Bob
      when she caught sight of that group on the platform, and he spoke to the
      trotters. Thus it happened that they flew by, and were at the tannery
      house before they knew it; and Cynthia, all unaided, sprang out of the
      buggy and ran in, alone. She found Jethro sitting outside of the kitchen
      door with a volume on his knee, and she saw that the print of it was
      large, and she knew that the book was &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia knelt down on the grass beside him and caught his hands in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going to marry Bob Worthington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Cynthy,&rdquo; he answered. And taking the initiative for the first time
      in his life, he stooped down and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew&mdash;you would be happy&mdash;in my happiness,&rdquo; she said, the
      tears brimming in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-never have been so happy, Cynthy,&mdash;never have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jethro, I never will desert you. I shall always take care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;R-read to me sometimes, Cynthy&mdash;r-read to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she could not answer him. She was sobbing on the pages of that book he
      had given her&mdash;long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to dwell on happiness, and I am reluctant to leave these people
      whom I have grown to love. Jethro Bass lived to take Cynthia's children
      down by the brook and to show them the pictures, at least, in that
      wonderful edition of &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe.&rdquo; He would never depart from the
      tannery house, but Cynthia went to him there, many times a week. There is
      a spot not far from the Coniston road, and five miles distant alike from
      Brampton and Coniston, where Bob Worthington built his house, and where he
      and Cynthia dwelt many years; and they go there to this day, in the
      summer-time. It stands in the midst of broad lands, and the ground in
      front of it slopes down to Coniston Water, artificially widened here by a
      stone dam into a little lake. From the balcony of the summer-house which
      overhangs the lake there is a wonderful view of Coniston Mountain, and
      Cynthia Worthington often sits there with her sewing or her book,
      listening to the laughter of her children, and thinking, sometimes, of
      bygone days.

    <h2>
      AFTERWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      The reality of the foregoing pages has to the author, at least, become so
      vivid that he regrets the necessity of having to add an afterword. Every
      novel is, to some extent, a compound of truth and fiction, and he has done
      his best to picture conditions as they were, and to make the spirit of his
      book true. Certain people who were living in St. Louis during the Civil
      War have been mentioned as the originals of characters in &ldquo;The Crisis,&rdquo;
       and there are houses in that city which have been pointed out as fitting
      descriptions in that novel. An author has, frequently, people, houses, and
      localities in mind when he writes; but he changes them, sometimes very
      materially, in the process of literary construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is inevitable, perhaps, that many people of a certain New England state
      will recognize Jethro Bass. There are different opinions extant concerning
      the remarkable original of this character; ardent defenders and detractors
      of his are still living, but all agree that he was a strange man of great
      power. The author disclaims any intention of writing a biography of him.
      Some of the things set down in this book he did, and others he did not do.
      Some of the anecdotes here related concerning him are, in the main, true,
      and for this material the author acknowledges his indebtedness
      particularly to Colonel Thomas B. Cheney of Ashland, New Hampshire, and to
      other friends who have helped him. Jethro Bass was typical of his Era, and
      it is of the Era that this book attempts to treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the locality where Jethro Bass was born and lived, it will and
      will not be recognized. It would have been the extreme of bad taste to
      have put into these pages any portraits which might have offended families
      or individuals, and in order that it may be known that the author has not
      done so he has written this Afterword. Nor has he particularly chosen for
      the field of this novel a state of which he is a citizen, and for which he
      has a sincere affection. The conditions here depicted, while retaining the
      characteristics of the locality, he believes to be typical of the Era over
      a large part of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the Puritans who came to New England were impelled to emigrate
      from the old country, no doubt, by an aversion to pulling the forelock as
      well as by religious principles, and the spirit of these men prevailed for
      a certain time after the Revolution was fought. Such men lived and ruled
      in Coniston before the rise of Jethro Bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-examination is necessary for the moral health of nations as well as
      men, and it is the most hopeful of signs that in the United States we are
      to-day going through a period of self-examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall do well to ascertain the causes which have led us gradually to
      stray from the political principles laid down by our forefathers for all
      the world to see. Some of us do not even know what those principles were.
      I have met many intelligent men, in different states of the Union, who
      could not even repeat the names of the senators who sat for them in
      Congress. Macaulay said, in 1852, &ldquo;We now know, by the clearest of all
      proof, that universal suffrage, even united with secret voting, is no
      security, against the establishment of arbitrary power.&rdquo; To quote James
      Russell Lowell, writing a little later: &ldquo;We have begun obscurely to
      recognize that... popular government is not in itself a panacea, is no
      better than any other form except as the virtue and wisdom of the people
      make it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Americans, we cannot but believe that our political creed goes down in
      its foundations to the solid rock of truth. One of the best reasons for
      our belief lies in the fact that, since 1776, government after government
      has imitated our example. We have, by our very existence and rise to
      power, made any decided retrogression from these doctrines impossible. So
      many people have tried to rule themselves, and are still trying, that one
      begins to believe that the time is not far distant when the United States,
      once the most radical, will become the most conservative of nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the duty rests to-day, more heavily than ever, upon each American
      citizen to make good to the world those principles upon which his
      government was built. To use a figure suggested by the calamity which has
      lately befallen one of the most beloved of our cities, there is a theory
      that earthquakes are caused by a necessary movement on the part of the
      globe to regain its axis. Whether or not the theory be true, it has its
      political application. In America to-day we are trying&mdash;whatever the
      cost&mdash;to regain the true axis established for us by the founders of
      our Republic.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
