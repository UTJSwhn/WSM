    <h2>
      ACT I
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The scene is the managing clerk's room, at the offices of James and
        Walter How, on a July morning. The room is old fashioned, furnished with
        well-worn mahogany and leather, and lined with tin boxes and estate
        plans. It has three doors. Two of them are close together in the centre
        of a wall. One of these two doors leads to the outer office, which is
        only divided from the managing clerk's room by a partition of wood and
        clear glass; and when the door into this outer office is opened there
        can be seen the wide outer door leading out on to the stone stairway of
        the building. The other of these two centre doors leads to the junior
        clerk's room. The third door is that leading to the partners' room. The
        managing clerk, COKESON, is sitting at his table adding up figures in a
        pass-book, and murmuring their numbers to himself. He is a man of sixty,
        wearing spectacles; rather short, with a bald head, and an honest,
        pugdog face. He is dressed in a well-worn black frock-coat and
        pepper-and-salt trousers.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. And five's twelve, and three -- fifteen, nineteen,
      twenty-three, thirty-two, forty-one-and carry four. [He ticks the page,
      and goes on murmuring] Five, seven, twelve, seventeen, twenty-four and
      nine, thirty-three, thirteen and carry one.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He again makes a tick. The outer office door is opened, and SWEEDLE, the
        office-boy, appears, closing the door behind him. He is a pale youth of
        sixteen, with spiky hair.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [With grumpy expectation] And carry one.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. There's a party wants to see Falder, Mr. Cokeson.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Five, nine, sixteen, twenty-one, twenty-nine -- and carry two.
      Send him to Morris's. What name?
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. Honeywill.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. What's his business?
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. It's a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. A lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. No, a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ask her in. Take this pass-book to Mr. James. [He closes the
      pass-book.]
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. [Reopening the door] Will you come in, please?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        RUTH HONEYWILL comes in. She is a tall woman, twenty-six years old,
        unpretentiously dressed, with black hair and eyes, and an ivory-white,
        clear-cut face. She stands very still, having a natural dignity of pose
        and gesture. SWEEDLE goes out into the partners' room with the
        pass-book.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Looking round at RUTH] The young man's out. [Suspiciously] State
      your business, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Who speaks in a matter-of-fact voice, and with a slight
      West-Country accent] It's a personal matter, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. We don't allow private callers here. Will you leave a message?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. I'd rather see him, please.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She narrows her dark eyes and gives him a honeyed look.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Expanding] It's all against the rules. Suppose I had my friends
      here to see me! It'd never do!
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [A little taken aback] Exactly! And here you are wanting to see a
      junior clerk!
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes, sir; I must see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Turning full round to her with a sort of outraged interest] But
      this is a lawyer's office. Go to his private address.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. He's not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Uneasy] Are you related to the party?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [In real embarrassment] I don't know what to say. It's no affair
      of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. But what am I to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Dear me! I can't tell you that.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        SWEEDLE comes back. He crosses to the outer office and passes through
        into it, with a quizzical look at Cokeson, carefully leaving the door an
        inch or two open.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Fortified by this look] This won't do, you know, this won't do
      at all. Suppose one of the partners came in!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        An incoherent knocking and chuckling is heard from the outer door of the
        outer office.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. [Putting his head in] There's some children outside here.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. They're mine, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. Shall I hold them in check?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. They're quite small, sir. [She takes a step towards COKESON]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. You mustn't take up his time in office hours; we're a clerk short
      as it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. It's a matter of life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Again outraged] Life and death!
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. Here is Falder.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FALDER has entered through the outer office. He is a pale, good-looking
        young man, with quick, rather scared eyes. He moves towards the door of
        the clerks' office, and stands there irresolute.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. Well, I'll give you a minute. It's not regular.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Taking up a bundle of papers, he goes out into the partners' room.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      RUTH. [In a low, hurried voice] He's on the drink again, Will. He tried to
      cut my throat last night. I came out with the children before he was
      awake. I went round to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I've changed my digs.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Is it all ready for to-night?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I've got the tickets. Meet me 11.45 at the booking office. For
      God's sake don't forget we're man and wife! [Looking at her with tragic
      intensity] Ruth!
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. You're not afraid of going, are you?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Have you got your things, and the children's?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Had to leave them, for fear of waking Honeywill, all but one bag. I
      can't go near home again.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Wincing] All that money gone for nothing. How much must you have?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Six pounds -- I could do with that, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Don't give away where we're going. [As if to himself] When I get
      out there I mean to forget it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. If you're sorry, say so. I'd sooner he killed me than take you
      against your will.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [With a queer smile] We've got to go. I don't care; I'll have you.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. You've just to say; it's not too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. It is too late. Here's seven pounds. Booking office 11.45
      to-night. If you weren't what you are to me, Ruth --  -- !
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Kiss me!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        They cling together passionately, there fly apart just as COKESON
        re-enters the room. RUTH turns and goes out through the outer office.
        COKESON advances deliberately to his chair and seats himself.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. This isn't right, Falder.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. It shan't occur again, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. It's an improper use of these premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. You quite understand-the party was in some distress; and, having
      children with her, I allowed my feelings --  -- [He opens a drawer
      and produces from it a tract] Just take this! "Purity in the Home." It's a
      well-written thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Taking it, with a peculiar expression] Thank you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. And look here, Falder, before Mr. Walter comes, have you finished
      up that cataloguing Davis had in hand before he left?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I shall have done with it to-morrow, sir -- for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. It's over a week since Davis went. Now it won't do, Falder.
      You're neglecting your work for private life. I shan't mention about the
      party having called, but --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Passing into his room] Thank you, sir.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        COKESON stares at the door through which FALDER has gone out; then
        shakes his head, and is just settling down to write, when WALTER How
        comes in through the outer Office. He is a rather refined-looking man of
        thirty-five, with a pleasant, almost apologetic voice.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WALTER. Good-morning, Cokeson.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Morning, Mr. Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. My father here?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Always with a certain patronage as to a young man who might be
      doing better] Mr. James has been here since eleven o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. I've been in to see the pictures, at the Guildhall.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Looking at him as though this were exactly what was to be
      expected] Have you now -- ye -- es. This lease of Boulter's -- am
      I to send it to counsel?
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. What does my father say?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. 'Aven't bothered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Well, we can't be too careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. It's such a little thing -- hardly worth the fees. I thought
      you'd do it yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Send it, please. I don't want the responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [With an indescribable air of compassion] Just as you like. This
      "right-of-way" case -- we've got 'em on the deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. I know; but the intention was obviously to exclude that bit of
      common ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. We needn't worry about that. We're the right side of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. I don't like it,
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [With an indulgent smile] We shan't want to set ourselves up
      against the law. Your father wouldn't waste his time doing that.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As he speaks JAMES How comes in from the partners' room. He is a
        shortish man, with white side-whiskers, plentiful grey hair, shrewd
        eyes, and gold pince-nez.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. Morning, Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. How are you, father?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Looking down his nose at the papers in his hand as though
      deprecating their size] I'll just take Boulter's lease in to young Falder
      to draft the instructions. [He goes out into FALDER'S room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. About that right-of-way case?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Oh, well, we must go forward there. I thought you told me yesterday
      the firm's balance was over four hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. So it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Holding out the pass-book to his son] Three -- five -- one,
      no recent cheques. Just get me out the cheque-book.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        WALTER goes to a cupboard, unlocks a drawer and produces a cheque-book.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. Tick the pounds in the counterfoils. Five, fifty-four, seven, five,
      twenty-eight, twenty, ninety, eleven, fifty-two, seventy-one. Tally?
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [Nodding] Can't understand. Made sure it was over four hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Give me the cheque-book. [He takes the check-book and cons the
      counterfoils] What's this ninety?
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Who drew it?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. You.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [Taking the cheque-book] July 7th? That's the day I went down to
      look over the Trenton Estate -- last Friday week; I came back on the
      Tuesday, you remember. But look here, father, it was nine I drew a cheque
      for. Five guineas to Smithers and my expenses. It just covered all but
      half a crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Gravely] Let's look at that ninety cheque. [He sorts the cheque
      out from the bundle in the pocket of the pass-book] Seems all right.
      There's no nine here. This is bad. Who cashed that nine-pound cheque?
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [Puzzled and pained] Let's see! I was finishing Mrs. Reddy's will -- only
      just had time; yes -- I gave it to Cokeson.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Look at that 't' 'y': that yours?
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [After consideration] My y's curl back a little; this doesn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [As COKESON re-enters from FALDER'S room] We must ask him. Just
      come here and carry your mind back a bit, Cokeson. D'you remember cashing
      a cheque for Mr. Walter last Friday week -- the day he went to Trenton?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es. Nine pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Look at this. [Handing him the cheque.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. No! Nine pounds. My lunch was just coming in; and of course I
      like it hot; I gave the cheque to Davis to run round to the bank. He
      brought it back, all gold -- you remember, Mr. Walter, you wanted some
      silver to pay your cab. [With a certain contemptuous compassion] Here, let
      me see. You've got the wrong cheque.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He takes cheque-book and pass-book from WALTER.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WALTER. Afraid not.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Having seen for himself] It's funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. You gave it to Davis, and Davis sailed for Australia on Monday.
      Looks black, Cokeson.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Puzzled and upset] why this'd be a felony! No, no! there's some
      mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I hope so.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. There's never been anything of that sort in the office the
      twenty-nine years I've been here.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Looking at cheque and counterfoil] This is a very clever bit of
      work; a warning to you not to leave space after your figures, Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [Vexed] Yes, I know -- I was in such a tearing hurry that
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Suddenly] This has upset me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. The counterfoil altered too -- very deliberate piece of
      swindling. What was Davis's ship?
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. 'City of Rangoon'.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. We ought to wire and have him arrested at Naples; he can't be there
      yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. His poor young wife. I liked the young man. Dear, oh dear! In
      this office!
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Shall I go to the bank and ask the cashier?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Grimly] Bring him round here. And ring up Scotland Yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Really?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He goes out through the outer office. JAMES paces the room. He stops and
        looks at COKESON, who is disconsolately rubbing the knees of his
        trousers.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. Well, Cokeson! There's something in character, isn't there?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Looking at him over his spectacles] I don't quite take you, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Your story, would sound d --  -- d thin to any one who didn't
      know you.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es! [He laughs. Then with a sudden gravity] I'm sorry for that
      young man. I feel it as if it was my own son, Mr. James.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. A nasty business!
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. It unsettles you. All goes on regular, and then a thing like this
      happens. Shan't relish my lunch to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. As bad as that, Cokeson?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. It makes you think. [Confidentially] He must have had temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Not so fast. We haven't convicted him yet.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        COKESON. I'd sooner have lost a month's salary than had this happen. [He
        broods.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. I hope that fellow will hurry up.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Keeping things pleasant for the cashier] It isn't fifty yards,
      Mr. James. He won't be a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. The idea of dishonesty about this office it hits me hard, Cokeson.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He goes towards the door of the partners' room.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. [Entering quietly, to COKESON in a low voice] She's popped up
      again, sir-something she forgot to say to Falder.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Roused from his abstraction] Eh? Impossible. Send her away!
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. What's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Nothing, Mr. James. A private matter. Here, I'll come myself. [He
      goes into the outer office as JAMES passes into the partners' room] Now,
      you really mustn't -- we can't have anybody just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Not for a minute, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Reely! Reely! I can't have it. If you want him, wait about; he'll
      be going out for his lunch directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        WALTER, entering with the cashier, passes RUTH as she leaves the outer
        office.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [To the cashier, who resembles a sedentary dragoon] Good-morning.
      [To WALTER] Your father's in there.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        WALTER crosses and goes into the partners' room.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. It's a nahsty, unpleasant little matter, Mr. Cowley. I'm quite
      ashamed to have to trouble you.
    </p>
    <p>
      COWLEY. I remember the cheque quite well. [As if it were a liver] Seemed
      in perfect order.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Sit down, won't you? I'm not a sensitive man, but a thing like
      this about the place -- it's not nice. I like people to be open and
      jolly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      COWLEY. Quite so.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Buttonholing him, and glancing toward the partners' room] Of
      course he's a young man. I've told him about it before now --  leaving
      space after his figures, but he will do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      COWLEY. I should remember the person's face -- quite a youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I don't think we shall be able to show him to you, as a matter of
      fact.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        JAMES and WALTER have come back from the partners' room.

    <p>
      JAMES. Good-morning, Mr. Cowley. You've seen my son and myself, you've
      seen Mr. Cokeson, and you've seen Sweedle, my office-boy. It was none of
      us, I take it.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The cashier shakes his head with a smile.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. Be so good as to sit there. Cokeson, engage Mr. Cowley in
      conversation, will you?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He goes toward FALDER'S room.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. Just a word, Mr. James.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. You don't want to upset the young man in there, do you? He's a
      nervous young feller.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. This must be thoroughly cleared up, Cokeson, for the sake of
      Falder's name, to say nothing of yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [With Some dignity] That'll look after itself, sir. He's been
      upset once this morning; I don't want him startled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. It's a matter of form; but I can't stand upon niceness over a thing
      like this -- too serious. Just talk to Mr. Cowley.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He opens the door of FALDER'S room.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. Bring in the papers in Boulter's lease, will you, Falder?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Bursting into voice] Do you keep dogs?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The cashier, with his eyes fixed on the door, does not answer.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. You haven't such a thing as a bulldog pup you could spare me, I
      suppose?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        At the look on the cashier's face his jaw drops, and he turns to see
        FALDER standing in the doorway, with his eyes fixed on COWLEY, like the
        eyes of a rabbit fastened on a snake.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Advancing with the papers] Here they are, sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Taking them] Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Do you want me, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. No, thanks!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FALDER turns and goes back into his own room. As he shuts the door JAMES
        gives the cashier an interrogative look, and the cashier nods.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. Sure? This isn't as we suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      COWLEY. Quite. He knew me. I suppose he can't slip out of that room?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Gloomily] There's only the window -- a whole floor and a
      basement.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The door of FALDER'S room is quietly opened, and FALDER, with his hat in
        his hand, moves towards the door of the outer office.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Quietly] Where are you going, Falder?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. To have my lunch, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Wait a few minutes, would you? I want to speak to you about this
      lease.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Yes, sir. [He goes back into his room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COWLEY. If I'm wanted, I can swear that's the young man who cashed the
      cheque. It was the last cheque I handled that morning before my lunch.
      These are the numbers of the notes he had. [He puts a slip of paper on the
      table; then, brushing his hat round] Good-morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Good-morning, Mr. Cowley!
    </p>
    <p>
      COWLEY. [To COKESON] Good-morning.

    <p>
      COKESON. [With Stupefaction] Good-morning.

    <blockquote>
      <p>

        chair, as though it were the only place left in the morass of his

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WALTER. What are you going to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Have him in. Give me the cheque and the counterfoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I don't understand. I thought young Davis --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. We shall see.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. One moment, father: have you thought it out?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Call him in!
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Rising with difficulty and opening FALDER'S door; hoarsely] Step
      in here a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Impassively] Yes, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Turning to him suddenly with the cheque held out] You know this
      cheque, Falder?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JADES. Look at it. You cashed it last Friday week.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Oh! yes, sir; that one -- Davis gave it me.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I know. And you gave Davis the cash?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. When Davis gave you the cheque was it exactly like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Yes, I think so, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. You know that Mr. Walter drew that cheque for nine pounds?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. No, sir -- ninety.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Nine, Falder.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Faintly] I don't understand, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. The suggestion, of course, is that the cheque was altered; whether
      by you or Davis is the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I -- I
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Take your time, take your time.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Regaining his impassivity] Not by me, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. The cheque was handed to -- Cokeson by Mr. Walter at one
      o'clock; we know that because Mr. Cokeson's lunch had just arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I couldn't leave it.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Exactly; he therefore gave the cheque to Davis. It was cashed by
      you at 1.15. We know that because the cashier recollects it for the last
      cheque he handled before his lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Yes, sir, Davis gave it to me because some friends were giving him
      a farewell luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Puzzled] You accuse Davis, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I don't know, sir -- it's very funny.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

    <p>
      JAMES. Davis was not here again after that Saturday, was he?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Anxious to be of assistance to the young man, and seeing faint
      signs of their all being jolly once more] No, he sailed on the Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Was he, Falder?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Very faintly] No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Very well, then, how do you account for the fact that this nought
      was added to the nine in the counterfoil on or after Tuesday?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Surprised] How's that?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FALDER gives a sort of lurch; he tries to pull himself together, but he
        has gone all to pieces.
      </p>

    <p>
      JAMES. [Very grimly] Out, I'm afraid, Cokeson. The cheque-book remained in
      Mr. Walter's pocket till he came back from Trenton on Tuesday morning. In
      the face of this, Falder, do you still deny that you altered both cheque
      and counterfoil?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. No, sir -- no, Mr. How. I did it, sir; I did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Succumbing to his feelings] Dear, dear! what a thing to do!
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I wanted the money so badly, sir. I didn't know what I was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. However such a thing could have come into your head!
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Grasping at the words] I can't think, sir, really! It was just a
      minute of madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. A long minute, Falder. [Tapping the counterfoil] Four days at
      least.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Sir, I swear I didn't know what I'd done till afterwards, and then
      I hadn't the pluck. Oh! Sir, look over it! I'll pay the money back -- I
      will, I promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Go into your room.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>

        silence.

    <p>
      JAMES. About as bad a case as there could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. To break the law like that-in here!
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. What's to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Nothing for it. Prosecute.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. It's his first offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Shaking his head] I've grave doubts of that. Too neat a piece of
      swindling altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I shouldn't be surprised if he was tempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Life's one long temptation, Cokeson.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es, but I'm speaking of the flesh and the devil, Mr. James.
      There was a woman come to see him this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. The woman we passed as we came in just now. Is it his wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. No, no relation. [Restraining what in jollier circumstances would
      have been a wink] A married person, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. How do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Brought her children. [Scandalised] There they were outside the
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. A real bad egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. I should like to give him a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I can't forgive him for the sneaky way he went to work -- 
      counting on our suspecting young Davis if the matter came to light. It was
      the merest accident the cheque-book stayed in your pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. It must have been the temptation of a moment. He hadn't time.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. A man doesn't succumb like that in a moment, if he's a clean mind
      and habits. He's rotten; got the eyes of a man who can't keep his hands
      off when there's money about.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [Dryly] We hadn't noticed that before.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Brushing the remark aside] I've seen lots of those fellows in my
      time. No doing anything with them except to keep 'em out of harm's way.
      They've got a blind spat.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. It's penal servitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. They're nahsty places-prisons.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Hesitating] I don't see how it's possible to spare him. Out of the
      question to keep him in this office -- honesty's the 'sine qua non'.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Hypnotised] Of course it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Equally out of the question to send him out amongst people who've
      no knowledge of his character. One must think of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. But to brand him like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. If it had been a straightforward case I'd give him another chance.
      It's far from that. He has dissolute habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I didn't say that -- extenuating circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Same thing. He's gone to work in the most cold-blooded way to
      defraud his employers, and cast the blame on an innocent man. If that's
      not a case for the law to take its course, I don't know what is.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. For the sake of his future, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Sarcastically] According to you, no one would ever prosecute.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [Nettled] I hate the idea of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. That's rather 'ex parte', Mr. Walter! We must have protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. This is degenerating into talk.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He moves towards the partners' room.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WALTER. Put yourself in his place, father.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. You ask too much of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. We can't possibly tell the pressure there was on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. You may depend on it, my boy, if a man is going to do this sort of
      thing he'll do it, pressure or no pressure; if he isn't nothing'll make
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. He'll never do it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Fatuously] S'pose I were to have a talk with him. We don't want
      to be hard on the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. That'll do, Cokeson. I've made up my mind. [He passes into the
      partners' room.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [After a doubtful moment] We must excuse your father. I don't
      want to go against your father; if he thinks it right.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Confound it, Cokeson! why don't you back me up? You know you feel --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [On his dignity] I really can't say what I feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. We shall regret it.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. He must have known what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [Bitterly] "The quality of mercy is not strained."
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Looking at him askance] Come, come, Mr. Walter. We must try and
      see it sensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. [Entering with a tray] Your lunch, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Put it down!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        While SWEEDLE is putting it down on COKESON's table, the detective,
        WISTER, enters the outer office, and, finding no one there, comes to the
        inner doorway. He is a square, medium-sized man, clean-shaved, in a
        serviceable blue serge suit and strong boots.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Hoarsely] Here! Here! What are we doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      WISTER. [To WALTER] From Scotland Yard, sir. Detective-Sergeant Blister.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [Askance] Very well! I'll speak to my father.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He goes into the partners' room. JAMES enters.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. Morning! [In answer to an appealing gesture from COKESON] I'm
      sorry; I'd stop short of this if I felt I could. Open that door. [SWEEDLE,
      wondering and scared, opens it] Come here, Mr. Falder.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As FALDER comes shrinkingly out, the detective in obedience to a sign
        from JAMES, slips his hand out and grasps his arm.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Recoiling] Oh! no, -- oh! no!
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Come, come, there's a good lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I charge him with felony.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALTER. Oh, sir! There's some one -- I did it for her. Let me be till
      to-morrow.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        JAMES motions with his hand. At that sign of hardness, FALDER becomes
        rigid. Then, turning, he goes out quietly in the detective's grip. JAMES
        follows, stiff and erect. SWEEDLE, rushing to the door with open mouth,
        pursues them through the outer office into the corridor. When they have
        all disappeared COKESON spins completely round and makes a rush for the
        outer office.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON: [Hoarsely] Here! What are we doing?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        There is silence. He takes out his handkerchief and mops the sweat from
        his face. Going back blindly to his table, sits down, and stares blankly
        at his lunch.
      </p>

    <h2>
      ACT II
    </h2>
    <p>
      A Court of Justice, on a foggy October afternoon crowded with barristers,
      solicitors, reporters, ushers, and jurymen. Sitting in the large, solid
      dock is FALDER, with a warder on either side of him, placed there for his
      safe custody, but seemingly indifferent to and unconscious of his
      presence. FALDER is sitting exactly opposite to the JUDGE, who, raised
      above the clamour of the court, also seems unconscious of and indifferent
      to everything. HAROLD CLEAVER, the counsel for the Crown, is a dried,
      yellowish man, of more than middle age, in a wig worn almost to the colour
      of his face. HECTOR FROME, the counsel for the defence, is a young, tall
      man, clean shaved, in a very white wig. Among the spectators, having
      already given their evidence, are JAMES and WALTER HOW, and COWLEY, the
      cashier. WISTER, the detective, is just leaving the witness-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. That is the case for the Crown, me lud!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Gathering his robes together, he sits down.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FROME. [Rising and bowing to the JUDGE] If it please your lordship and
      gentlemen of the jury. I am not going to dispute the fact that the
      prisoner altered this cheque, but I am going to put before you evidence as
      to the condition of his mind, and to submit that you would not be
      justified in finding that he was responsible for his actions at the time.
      I am going to show you, in fact, that he did this in a moment of
      aberration, amounting to temporary insanity, caused by the violent
      distress under which he was labouring. Gentlemen, the prisoner is only
      twenty-three years old. I shall call before you a woman from whom you will
      learn the events that led up to this act. You will hear from her own lips
      the tragic circumstances of her life, the still more tragic infatuation
      with which she has inspired the prisoner. This woman, gentlemen, has been
      leading a miserable existence with a husband who habitually ill-uses her,
      from whom she actually goes in terror of her life. I am not, of course,
      saying that it's either right or desirable for a young man to fall in love
      with a married woman, or that it's his business to rescue her from an
      ogre-like husband. I'm not saying anything of the sort. But we all know
      the power of the passion of love; and I would ask you to remember,
      gentlemen, in listening to her evidence, that, married to a drunken and
      violent husband, she has no power to get rid of him; for, as you know,
      another offence besides violence is necessary to enable a woman to obtain
      a divorce; and of this offence it does not appear that her husband is
      guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      JUDGE. Is this relevant, Mr. Frome?
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. My lord, I submit, extremely -- I shall be able to show your
      lordship that directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      JUDGE. Very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. In these circumstances, what alternatives were left to her? She
      could either go on living with this drunkard, in terror of her life; or
      she could apply to the Court for a separation order. Well, gentlemen, my
      experience of such cases assures me that this would have given her very
      insufficient protection from the violence of such a man; and even if
      effectual would very likely have reduced her either to the workhouse or
      the streets -- for it's not easy, as she is now finding, for an
      unskilled woman without means of livelihood to support herself and her
      children without resorting either to the Poor Law or -- to speak quite
      plainly -- to the sale of her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      JUDGE. You are ranging rather far, Mr. Frome.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. I shall fire point-blank in a minute, my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      JUDGE. Let us hope so.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Now, gentlemen, mark -- and this is what I have been leading up
      to -- this woman will tell you, and the prisoner will confirm her,
      that, confronted with such alternatives, she set her whole hopes on
      himself, knowing the feeling with which she had inspired him. She saw a
      way out of her misery by going with him to a new country, where they would
      both be unknown, and might pass as husband and wife. This was a desperate
      and, as my friend Mr. Cleaver will no doubt call it, an immoral
      resolution; but, as a fact, the minds of both of them were constantly
      turned towards it. One wrong is no excuse for another, and those who are
      never likely to be faced by such a situation possibly have the right to
      hold up their hands -- as to that I prefer to say nothing. But whatever
      view you take, gentlemen, of this part of the prisoner's story -- whatever
      opinion you form of the right of these two young people under such
      circumstances to take the law into their own hands -- the fact remains
      that this young woman in her distress, and this young man, little more
      than a boy, who was so devotedly attached to her, did conceive this -- if
      you like --  reprehensible design of going away together. Now, for
      that, of course, they required money, and -- they had none. As to the
      actual events of the morning of July 7th, on which this cheque was
      altered, the events on which I rely to prove the defendant's
      irresponsibility  -- I shall allow those events to speak for
      themselves, through the lips of my witness. Robert Cokeson. [He turns,
      looks round, takes up a sheet of paper, and waits.]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        COKESON is summoned into court, and goes into the witness-box, holding
        his hat before him. The oath is administered to him.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FROME. What is your name?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Robert Cokeson.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Are you managing clerk to the firm of solicitors who employ the
      prisoner?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. How long had the prisoner been in their employ?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Two years. No, I'm wrong there -- all but seventeen days.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Had you him under your eye all that time?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Except Sundays and holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Quite so. Let us hear, please, what you have to say about his
      general character during those two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Confidentially to the jury, and as if a little surprised at
      being asked] He was a nice, pleasant-spoken young man. I'd no fault to
      find with him -- quite the contrary. It was a great surprise to me when
      he did a thing like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Did he ever give you reason to suspect his honesty?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. No! To have dishonesty in our office, that'd never do.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. I'm sure the jury fully appreciate that, Mr. Cokeson.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Every man of business knows that honesty's 'the sign qua non'.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Do you give him a good character all round, or do you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Turning to the JUDGE] Certainly. We were all very jolly and
      pleasant together, until this happened. Quite upset me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Now, coming to the morning of the 7th of July, the morning on which
      the cheque was altered. What have you to say about his demeanour that
      morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [To the jury] If you ask me, I don't think he was quite compos
      when he did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. [Sharply] Are you suggesting that he was insane?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Not compos.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. A little more precision, please.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. [Smoothly] Just tell us, Mr. Cokeson.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Somewhat outraged] Well, in my opinion -- [looking at the
      JUDGE] -- such as it is -- he was jumpy at the time. The jury will
      understand my meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Will you tell us how you came to that conclusion?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es, I will. I have my lunch in from the restaurant, a chop and
      a potato -- saves time. That day it happened to come just as Mr. Walter
      How handed me the cheque. Well, I like it hot; so I went into the clerks'
      office and I handed the cheque to Davis, the other clerk, and told him to
      get change. I noticed young Falder walking up and down. I said to him:
      "This is not the Zoological Gardens, Falder."
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Do you remember what he answered?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es: "I wish to God it were!" Struck me as funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Did you notice anything else peculiar?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. What was that?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. His collar was unbuttoned. Now, I like a young man to be neat. I
      said to him: "Your collar's unbuttoned."
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. And what did he answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Stared at me. It wasn't nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. Stared at you? Isn't that a very common practice?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es, but it was the look in his eyes. I can't explain my
      meaning -- it was funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Had you ever seen such a look in his eyes before?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. No. If I had I should have spoken to the partners. We can't have
      anything eccentric in our profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. Did you speak to them on that occasion?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Confidentially] Well, I didn't like to trouble them about prime
      facey evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. But it made a very distinct impression on your mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es. The clerk Davis could have told you the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Quite so. It's very unfortunate that we've not got him here. Now
      can you tell me of the morning on which the discovery of the forgery was
      made? That would be the 18th. Did anything happen that morning?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [With his hand to his ear] I'm a little deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Was there anything in the course of that morning -- I mean
      before the discovery -- that caught your attention?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es -- a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. How is this relevant, Mr. Frome?
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. I am trying to establish the state of mind in which the prisoner
      committed this act, my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. I quite appreciate that. But this was long after the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Yes, my lord, but it contributes to my contention.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. Well!
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. You say a woman. Do you mean that she came to the office?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. What for?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Asked to see young Falder; he was out at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Did you see her?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I did.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Did she come alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Confidentially] Well, there you put me in a difficulty. I
      mustn't tell you what the office-boy told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Quite so, Mr. Cokeson, quite so --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Breaking in with an air of "You are young -- leave it to me"]
      But I think we can get round it. In answer to a question put to her by a
      third party the woman said to me: "They're mine, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. What are? What were?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Her children. They were outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. HOW do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Your lordship mustn't ask me that, or I shall have to tell you
      what I was told -- and that'd never do.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. [Smiling] The office-boy made a statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Egg-zactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. What I want to ask you, Mr. Cokeson, is this. In the course of her
      appeal to see Falder, did the woman say anything that you specially
      remember?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Looking at him as if to encourage him to complete the sentence]
      A leetle more, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Or did she not?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. She did. I shouldn't like you to have led me to the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. [With an irritated smile] Will you tell the jury what it was?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. "It's a matter of life and death."
    </p>
    <p>
      FOREMAN OF THE JURY. Do you mean the woman said that?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Nodding] It's not the sort of thing you like to have said to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. [A little impatiently] Did Falder come in while she was there?
      [COKESON nods] And she saw him, and went away?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ah! there I can't follow you. I didn't see her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Well, is she there now?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [With an indulgent smile] No!
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Thank you, Mr. Cokeson. [He sits down.]
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. [Rising] You say that on the morning of the forgery the prisoner
      was jumpy. Well, now, sir, what precisely do you mean by that word?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Indulgently] I want you to understand. Have you ever seen a dog
      that's lost its master? He was kind of everywhere at once with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. Thank you; I was coming to his eyes. You called them "funny."
      What are we to understand by that? Strange, or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es, funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Sharply] Yes, sir, but what may be funny to you may not be funny
      to me, or to the jury. Did they look frightened, or shy, or fierce, or
      what?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. You make it very hard for me. I give you the word, and you want
      me to give you another.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. [Rapping his desk] Does "funny" mean mad?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. Not mad, fun --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. Very well! Now you say he had his collar unbuttoned? Was it a hot
      day?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es; I think it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. And did he button it when you called his attention to it?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es, I think he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. Would you say that that denoted insanity?

    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. No, sir; not since July.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes, sir, two.

    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Looking at him] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. What was the nature of your relations with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. We were friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. Friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Simply] Lovers, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. [Sharply] In what sense do you use that word?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. We love each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. Yes, but --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Shaking her head] No, your lordship -- not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. 'Not yet! H'm! [He looks from RUTH to FALDER] Well!
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. What is your husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. And what was the nature of your married life?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Shaking her head] It don't bear talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Did he ill-treat you, or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Ever since my first was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. In what way?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. I'd rather not say. All sorts of ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. I am afraid I must stop this, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Pointing to FALDER] He offered to take me out of it, sir. We were
      going to South America.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. [Hastily] Yes, quite -- and what prevented you?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. I was outside his office when he was taken away. It nearly broke my
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. You knew, then, that he had been arrested?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes, sir. I called at his office afterwards, and [pointing to
      COKESON] that gentleman told me all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Now, do you remember the morning of Friday, July 7th?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. My husband nearly strangled me that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. Nearly strangled you!
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Bowing her head] Yes, my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. With his hands, or --  -- ?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes, I just managed to get away from him. I went straight to my
      friend. It was eight o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. In the morning? Your husband was not under the influence of
      liquor then?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. It wasn't always that.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. In what condition were you?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. In very bad condition, sir. My dress was torn, and I was half
      choking.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Did you tell your friend what had happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes. I wish I never had.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. It upset him?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Dreadfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Did he ever speak to you about a cheque?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Never.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROZE. Did he ever give you any money?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. When was that?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. On Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. The 8th?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. To buy an outfit for me and the children, and get all ready to
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Did that surprise you, or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. What, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. That he had money to give you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ring. Yes, because on the morning when my husband nearly killed me my
      friend cried because he hadn't the money to get me away. He told me
      afterwards he'd come into a windfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. And when did you last see him?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. The day he was taken away, sir. It was the day we were to have
      started.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Oh, yes, the morning of the arrest. Well, did you see him at all
      between the Friday and that morning? [RUTH nods] What was his manner then?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Dumb -- like -- sometimes he didn't seem able to say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. As if something unusual had happened to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Painful, or pleasant, or what?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Like a fate hanging over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. [Hesitating] Tell me, did you love the prisoner very much?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Bowing her head] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. And had he a very great affection for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Looking at FALDER] Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Now, ma'am, do you or do you not think that your danger and
      unhappiness would seriously affect his balance, his control over his
      actions?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. His reason, even?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. For a moment like, I think it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Was he very much upset that Friday morning, or was he fairly calm?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Dreadfully upset. I could hardly bear to let him go from me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Do you still love him?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [With her eyes on FALDER] He's ruined himself for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Thank you.

    <p>
      RUTH. No, sir.

      CLEAVER. Thank you; I've no further questions to ask you.

      RUTH. [Bending a little forward to the jury] I would have done the same
      for him; I would indeed.
    </p>

      THE JUDGE. Please, please! You say your married life is an unhappy one?
      Faults on both sides?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Only that I never bowed down to him. I don't see why I should, sir,
      not to a man like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. You refused to obey him?

    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. No; even after that.

      THE JUDGE. I ask, you know, because you seem to me to glory in this
      affection of yours for the prisoner.

    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Carry your mind, please, to the morning of Friday, July the 7th,
      and tell the jury what happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Turning to the jury] I was having my breakfast when she came. Her
      dress was all torn, and she was gasping and couldn't seem to get her
      breath at all; there were the marks of his fingers round her throat; her
      arm was bruised, and the blood had got into her eyes dreadfully. It
      frightened me, and then when she told me, I felt -- I felt -- well -- it
      was too much for me! [Hardening suddenly] If you'd seen it, having the
      feelings for her that I had, you'd have felt the same, I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. When she left me -- because I had to go to the office -- I
      was out of my senses for fear that he'd do it again, and thinking what I
      could do. I couldn't work -- all the morning I was like that -- simply
      couldn't fix my mind on anything. I couldn't think at all. I seemed to
      have to keep moving. When Davis -- the other clerk -- gave me the
      cheque -- he said: "It'll do you good, Will, to have a run with this.
      You seem half off your chump this morning." Then when I had it in my hand -- I
      don't know how it came, but it just flashed across me that if I put the
      'ty' and the nought there would be the money to get her away. It just came
      and went -- I never thought of it again. Then Davis went out to his
      luncheon, and I don't really remember what I did till I'd pushed the
      cheque through to the cashier under the rail. I remember his saying "Gold
      or notes?" Then I suppose I knew what I'd done. Anyway, when I got outside
      I wanted to chuck myself under a bus; I wanted to throw the money away;
      but it seemed I was in for it, so I thought at any rate I'd save her. Of
      course the tickets I took for the passage and the little I gave her's been
      wasted, and all, except what I was obliged to spend myself, I've restored.
      I keep thinking over and over however it was I came to do it, and how I
      can't have it all again to do differently!

    <p>
      FALDER. [Faintly] No, sir.

      the case, is this anything but an ordinary forgery? Come.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I was half frantic all that morning, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. Now, now! You don't deny that the 'ty' and the nought were so
      like the rest of the handwriting as to thoroughly deceive the cashier?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. It was an accident.
    </p>
    <p>

      you alter the counterfoil?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Hanging his head] On the Wednesday morning.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Faintly] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. To do that you had to watch your opportunity, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Almost inaudibly] Yes.

      CLEAVER. You don't suggest that you were suffering under great excitement
      when you did that?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I was haunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. With the fear of being found out?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Very low] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. Didn't it occur to you that the only thing for you to do was to
      confess to your employers, and restore the money?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I was afraid. [There is silence]
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. You desired, too, no doubt, to complete your design of taking
      this woman away?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. When I found I'd done a thing like that, to do it for nothing
      seemed so dreadful. I might just as well have chucked myself into the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. You knew that the clerk Davis was about to leave England  -- didn't
      it occur to you when you altered this cheque that suspicion would fall on
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. It was all done in a moment. I thought of it afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. And that didn't lead you to avow what you'd done?

      THE JUDGE. But in the meantime your innocent fellow clerk might have been
      prosecuted.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I knew he was a long way off, your lordship. I thought there'd be
      time. I didn't think they'd find it out so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROME. I might remind your lordship that as Mr. Walter How had the
      cheque-book in his pocket till after Davis had sailed, if the discovery
      had been made only one day later Falder himself would have left, and
      suspicion would have attached to him, and not to Davis, from the
      beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. The question is whether the prisoner knew that suspicion would
      light on himself, and not on Davis. [To FALDER sharply] Did you know that
      Mr. Walter How had the cheque-book till after Davis had sailed?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I -- I -- thought -- he --  --

    <p>
      FALDER. [Very low] No, my lord. I had no means of knowing.

      you to remember that? And you still persist in saying you don't remember

    <p>
      FROME. Now, as to the four minutes that elapsed between Davis's going out
      and your cashing the cheque: do you say that you recollect nothing during
      those four minutes?

    <p>
      FALDER. [After a moment] I remember thinking of Mr. Cokeson's face.

    <p>
      FROME. [Gathering up notes] If it please your lordship -- Gentlemen of
      the Jury, -- My friend in cross-examination has shown a disposition to
      sneer at the defence which has been set up in this case, and I am free to
      admit that nothing I can say will move you, if the evidence has not
      already convinced you that the prisoner committed this act in a moment
      when to all practical intents and purposes he was not responsible for his
      actions; a moment of such mental and moral vacuity, arising from the
      violent emotional agitation under which he had been suffering, as to
      amount to temporary madness. My friend has alluded to the "romantic
      glamour" with which I have sought to invest this case. Gentlemen, I have
      done nothing of the kind. I have merely shown you the background of "life" -- that
      palpitating life which, believe me -- whatever my friend may say -- always
      lies behind the commission of a crime. Now gentlemen, we live in a highly,
      civilized age, and the sight of brutal violence disturbs us in a very
      strange way, even when we have no personal interest in the matter. But
      when we see it inflicted on a woman whom we love -- what then? Just
      think of what your own feelings would have been, each of you, at the
      prisoner's age; and then look at him. Well! he is hardly the comfortable,
      shall we say bucolic, person likely to contemplate with equanimity marks
      of gross violence on a woman to whom he was devotedly attached. Yes,
      gentlemen, look at him! He has not a strong face; but neither has he a
      vicious face. He is just the sort of man who would easily become the prey
      of his emotions. You have heard the description of his eyes. My friend may
      laugh at the word "funny" -- I think it better describes the peculiar
      uncanny look of those who are strained to breaking-point than any other
      word which could have been used. I don't pretend, mind you, that his
      mental irresponsibility -- was more than a flash of darkness, in which
      all sense of proportion became lost; but to contend, that, just as a man
      who destroys himself at such a moment may be, and often is, absolved from
      the stigma attaching to the crime of self-murder, so he may, and
      frequently does, commit other crimes while in this irresponsible
      condition, and that he may as justly be acquitted of criminal intent and
      treated as a patient. I admit that this is a plea which might well be
      abused. It is a matter for discretion. But here you have a case in which
      there is every reason to give the benefit of the doubt. You heard me ask
      the prisoner what he thought of during those four fatal minutes. What was
      his answer? "I thought of Mr. Cokeson's face!" Gentlemen, no man could
      invent an answer like that; it is absolutely stamped with truth. You have
      seen the great affection [legitimate or not] existing between him and this
      woman, who came here to give evidence for him at the risk of her life. It
      is impossible for you to doubt his distress on the morning when he
      committed this act. We well know what terrible havoc such distress can
      make in weak and highly nervous people. It was all the work of a moment.
      The rest has followed, as death follows a stab to the heart, or water
      drops if you hold up a jug to empty it. Believe me, gentlemen, there is
      nothing more tragic in life than the utter impossibility of changing what
      you have done. Once this cheque was altered and presented, the work of
      four minutes -- four mad minutes  -- the rest has been silence. But
      in those four minutes the boy before you has slipped through a door,
      hardly opened, into that great cage which never again quite lets a man go -- the
      cage of the Law. His further acts, his failure to confess, the alteration
      of the counterfoil, his preparations for flight, are all evidence -- not
      of deliberate and guilty intention when he committed the prime act from
      which these subsequent acts arose; no -- they are merely evidence of
      the weak character which is clearly enough his misfortune. But is a man to
      be lost because he is bred and born with a weak character? Gentlemen, men
      like the prisoner are destroyed daily under our law for want of that human
      insight which sees them as they are, patients, and not criminals. If the
      prisoner be found guilty, and treated as though he were a criminal type,
      he will, as all experience shows, in all probability become one. I beg you
      not to return a verdict that may thrust him back into prison and brand him
      for ever. Gentlemen, Justice is a machine that, when some one has once
      given it the starting push, rolls on of itself. Is this young man to be
      ground to pieces under this machine for an act which at the worst was one
      of weakness? Is he to become a member of the luckless crews that man those
      dark, ill-starred ships called prisons? Is that to be his voyage-from
      which so few return? Or is he to have another chance, to be still looked
      on as one who has gone a little astray, but who will come back? I urge
      you, gentlemen, do not ruin this young man! For, as a result of those four
      minutes, ruin, utter and irretrievable, stares him in the face. He can be
      saved now. Imprison him as a criminal, and I affirm to you that he will be
      lost. He has neither the face nor the manner of one who can survive that
      terrible ordeal. Weigh in the scales his criminality and the suffering he
      has undergone. The latter is ten times heavier already. He has lain in
      prison under this charge for more than two months. Is he likely ever to
      forget that? Imagine the anguish of his mind during that time. He has had
      his punishment, gentlemen, you may depend. The rolling of the
      chariot-wheels of Justice over this boy began when it was decided to
      prosecute him. We are now already at the second stage. If you permit it to
      go on to the third I would not give -- that for him.

      The jury stir, and consult each other's faces; then they turn towards the
      counsel for the Crown, who rises, and, fixing his eyes on a spot that
      seems to give him satisfaction, slides them every now and then towards the
      jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLEAVER. May it please your lordship -- [Rising on his toes] Gentlemen
      of the Jury, -- The facts in this case are not disputed, and the
      defence, if my friend will allow me to say so, is so thin that I don't
      propose to waste the time of the Court by taking you over the evidence.
      The plea is one of temporary insanity. Well, gentlemen, I daresay it is
      clearer to me than it is to you why this rather -- what shall we call
      it? -- bizarre defence has been set up. The alternative would have been
      to plead guilty. Now, gentlemen, if the prisoner had pleaded guilty my
      friend would have had to rely on a simple appeal to his lordship. Instead
      of that, he has gone into the byways and hedges and found this -- er -- peculiar
      plea, which has enabled him to show you the proverbial woman, to put her
      in the box -- to give, in fact, a romantic glow to this affair. I
      compliment my friend; I think it highly ingenious of him. By these means,
      he has -- to a certain extent -- got round the Law. He has brought
      the whole story of motive and stress out in court, at first hand, in a way
      that he would not otherwise have been able to do. But when you have once
      grasped that fact, gentlemen, you have grasped everything. [With
      good-humoured contempt] For look at this plea of insanity; we can't put it
      lower than that. You have heard the woman. She has every reason to favour
      the prisoner, but what did she say? She said that the prisoner was not
      insane when she left him in the morning. If he were going out of his mind
      through distress, that was obviously the moment when insanity would have
      shown itself. You have heard the managing clerk, another witness for the
      defence. With some difficulty I elicited from him the admission that the
      prisoner, though jumpy [a word that he seemed to think you would
      understand, gentlemen, and I'm sure I hope you do], was not mad when the
      cheque was handed to Davis. I agree with my friend that it's unfortunate
      that we have not got Davis here, but the prisoner has told you the words
      with which Davis in turn handed him the cheque; he obviously, therefore,
      was not mad when he received it, or he would not have remembered those
      words. The cashier has told you that he was certainly in his senses when
      he cashed it. We have therefore the plea that a man who is sane at ten
      minutes past one, and sane at fifteen minutes past, may, for the purposes
      of avoiding the consequences of a crime, call himself insane between those
      points of time. Really, gentlemen, this is so peculiar a proposition that
      I am not disposed to weary you with further argument. You will form your
      own opinion of its value. My friend has adopted this way of saying a great
      deal to you -- and very eloquently -- on the score of youth,
      temptation, and the like. I might point out, however, that the offence
      with which the prisoner is charged is one of the most serious known to our
      law; and there are certain features in this case, such as the suspicion
      which he allowed to rest on his innocent fellow-clerk, and his relations
      with this married woman, which will render it difficult for you to attach
      too much importance to such pleading. I ask you, in short, gentlemen, for
      that verdict of guilty which, in the circumstances, I regard you as,
      unfortunately, bound to record.

    <p>
      THE JUDGE. [Bending a little towards the jury, and speaking in a
      business-like voice] Gentlemen, you have heard the evidence, and the
      comments on it. My only business is to make clear to you the issues you
      have to try. The facts are admitted, so far as the alteration of this
      cheque and counterfoil by the prisoner. The defence set up is that he was
      not in a responsible condition when he committed the crime. Well, you have
      heard the prisoner's story, and the evidence of the other witnesses -- so
      far as it bears on the point of insanity. If you think that what you have
      heard establishes the fact that the prisoner was insane at the time of the
      forgery, you will find him guilty, but insane. If, on the other hand, you
      conclude from what you have seen and heard that the prisoner was sane -- and
      nothing short of insanity will count -- you will find him guilty. In
      reviewing the testimony as to his mental condition you must bear in mind
      very carefully the evidence as to his demeanour and conduct both before
      and after the act of forgery -- the evidence of the prisoner himself,
      of the woman, of the witness -- er -- COKESON, and -- er -- of
      the cashier. And in regard to that I especially direct your attention to
      the prisoner's admission that the idea of adding the 'ty' and the nought
      did come into his mind at the moment when the cheque was handed to him;
      and also to the alteration of the counterfoil, and to his subsequent
      conduct generally. The bearing of all this on the question of
      premeditation [and premeditation will imply sanity] is very obvious. You
      must not allow any considerations of age or temptation to weigh with you
      in the finding of your verdict. Before you can come to a verdict of guilty
      but insane you must be well and thoroughly convinced that the condition of
      his mind was such as would have qualified him at the moment for a lunatic
      asylum. [He pauses, then, seeing that the jury are doubtful whether to
      retire or no, adds:] You may retire, gentlemen, if you wish to do so.

      anything to say for yourself, why the Court should not give you judgment
      according to law? [FALDER shakes his head]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE JUDGE. William Falder, you have been given fair trial and found
      guilty, in my opinion rightly found guilty, of forgery. [He pauses; then,
      consulting his notes, goes on] The defence was set up that you were not
      responsible for your actions at the moment of committing this crime. There
      is no, doubt, I think, that this was a device to bring out at first hand
      the nature of the temptation to which you succumbed. For throughout the
      trial your counsel was in reality making an appeal for mercy. The setting
      up of this defence of course enabled him to put in some evidence that
      might weigh in that direction. Whether he was well advised to so is
      another matter. He claimed that you should be treated rather as a patient
      than as a criminal. And this plea of his, which in the end amounted to a
      passionate appeal, he based in effect on an indictment of the march of
      Justice, which he practically accused of confirming and completing the
      process of criminality. Now, in considering how far I should allow weight
      to his appeal; I have a number of factors to take into account. I have to
      consider on the one hand the grave nature of your offence, the deliberate
      way in which you subsequently altered the counterfoil, the danger you
      caused to an innocent man -- and that, to my mind, is a very grave
      point -- and finally I have to consider the necessity of deterring
      others from following your example. On the other hand, I have to bear in
      mind that you are young, that you have hitherto borne a good character,
      that you were, if I am to believe your evidence and that of your
      witnesses, in a state of some emotional excitement when you committed this
      crime. I have every wish, consistently with my duty -- not only to you,
      but to the community -- to treat you with leniency. And this brings me
      to what are the determining factors in my mind in my consideration of your
      case. You are a clerk in a lawyer's office -- that is a very serious
      element in this case; there can be no possible excuse made for you on the
      ground that you were not fully conversant with the nature of the crime you
      were committing, and the penalties that attach to it. It is said, however,
      that you were carried away by your emotions. The story has been told here
      to-day of your relations with this -- er -- Mrs. Honeywill; on that
      story both the defence and the plea for mercy were in effect based. Now
      what is that story? It is that you, a young man, and she, a young woman,
      unhappily married, had formed an attachment, which you both say -- with
      what truth I am unable to gauge  -- had not yet resulted in immoral
      relations, but which you both admit was about to result in such
      relationship. Your counsel has made an attempt to palliate this, on the
      ground that the woman is in what he describes, I think, as "a hopeless
      position." As to that I can express no opinion. She is a married woman,
      and the fact is patent that you committed this crime with the view of
      furthering an immoral design. Now, however I might wish, I am not able to
      justify to my conscience a plea for mercy which has a basis inimical to
      morality. It is vitiated 'ab initio', and would, if successful, free you
      for the completion of this immoral project. Your counsel has made an
      attempt to trace your offence back to what he seems to suggest is a defect
      in the marriage law; he has made an attempt also to show that to punish
      you with further imprisonment would be unjust. I do not follow him in
      these flights. The Law is what it is -- a majestic edifice, sheltering
      all of us, each stone of which rests on another. I am concerned only with
      its administration. The crime you have committed is a very serious one. I
      cannot feel it in accordance with my duty to Society to exercise the
      powers I have in your favour. You will go to penal servitude for three
      years.

      ACT III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SCENE I
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        A prison. A plainly furnished room, with two large barred windows,
        overlooking the prisoners' exercise yard, where men, in yellow clothes
        marked with arrows, and yellow brimless caps, are seen in single file at
        a distance of four yards from each other, walking rapidly on serpentine
        white lines marked on the concrete floor of the yard. Two warders in
        blue uniforms, with peaked caps and swords, are stationed amongst them.
        The room has distempered walls, a bookcase with numerous
        official-looking books, a cupboard between the windows, a plan of the
        prison on the wall, a writing-table covered with documents. It is
        Christmas Eve. The GOVERNOR, a neat, grave-looking man, with a trim,
        fair moustache, the eyes of a theorist, and grizzled hair, receding from
        the temples, is standing close to this writing-table looking at a sort
        of rough saw made out of a piece of metal. The hand in which he holds it
        is gloved, for two fingers are missing. The chief warder, WOODER, a
        tall, thin, military-looking man of sixty, with grey moustache and
        melancholy, monkey-like eyes, stands very upright two paces from him.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [With a faint, abstracted smile] Queer-looking affair, Mr.
      Wooder! Where did you find it?
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER. In his mattress, sir. Haven't come across such a thing for two
      years now.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [With curiosity] Had he any set plan?
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER. He'd sawed his window-bar about that much. [He holds up his thumb
      and finger a quarter of an inch apart]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. I'll see him this afternoon. What's his name? Moaney! An old
      hand, I think?
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER. Yes, sir-fourth spell of penal. You'd think an old lag like him
      would have had more sense by now. [With pitying contempt] Occupied his
      mind, he said. Breaking in and breaking out -- that's all they think
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Who's next him?
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER. O'Cleary, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. The Irishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER. Next him again there's that young fellow, Falder -- star class -- and
      next him old Clipton.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Ah, yes! "The philosopher." I want to see him about his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER. Curious thing, sir: they seem to know when there's one of these
      tries at escape going on. It makes them restive -- there's a regular
      wave going through them just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Meditatively] Odd things -- those waves. [Turning to
      look at the prisoners exercising] Seem quiet enough out here!
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER. That Irishman, O'Cleary, began banging on his door this morning.
      Little thing like that's quite enough to upset the whole lot. They're just
      like dumb animals at times.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. I've seen it with horses before thunder -- it'll run
      right through cavalry lines.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The prison CHAPLAIN has entered. He is a dark-haired, ascetic man, in
        clerical undress, with a peculiarly steady, tight-lipped face and slow,
        cultured speech.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Holding up the saw] Seen this, Miller?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. Useful-looking specimen.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Do for the Museum, eh! [He goes to the cupboard and opens
      it, displaying to view a number of quaint ropes, hooks, and metal tools
      with labels tied on them] That'll do, thanks, Mr. Wooder.
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER. [Saluting] Thank you, sir. [He goes out]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Account for the state of the men last day or two, Miller?
      Seems going through the whole place.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. No. I don't know of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. By the way, will you dine with us on Christmas Day?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. To-morrow. Thanks very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Worries me to feel the men discontented. [Gazing at the saw]
      Have to punish this poor devil. Can't help liking a man who tries to
      escape. [He places the saw in his pocket and locks the cupboard again]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. Extraordinary perverted will-power -- some of them.
      Nothing to be done till it's broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. And not much afterwards, I'm afraid. Ground too hard for
      golf?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        WOODER comes in again.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WOODER. Visitor who's been seeing Q 3007 asks to speak to you, sir. I told
      him it wasn't usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. What about?
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER. Shall I put him off, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Resignedly] No, no. Let's see him. Don't go, Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER motions to some one without, and as the visitor comes in withdraws.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The visitor is COKESON, who is attired in a thick overcoat to the knees,
        woollen gloves, and carries a top hat.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. I'm sorry to trouble you. I've been talking to the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. We have a good many here.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Name of Falder, forgery. [Producing a card, and handing it to the
      GOVERNOR] Firm of James and Walter How. Well known in the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Receiving the card-with a faint smile] What do you want to
      see me about, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Suddenly seeing the prisoners at exercise] Why! what a sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Yes, we have that privilege from here; my office is being
      done up. [Sitting down at his table] Now, please!
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Dragging his eyes with difficulty from the window] I wanted to
      say a word to you; I shan't keep you long. [Confidentially] Fact is, I
      oughtn't to be here by rights. His sister came to me -- he's got no
      father and mother -- and she was in some distress. "My husband won't
      let me go and see him," she said; "says he's disgraced the family. And his
      other sister," she said, "is an invalid." And she asked me to come. Well,
      I take an interest in him. He was our junior -- I go to the same chapel -- and
      I didn't like to refuse. And what I wanted to tell you was, he seems
      lonely here.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Not unnaturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I'm afraid it'll prey on my mind. I see a lot of them about
      working together.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Those are local prisoners. The convicts serve their three
      months here in separate confinement, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. But we don't want to be unreasonable. He's quite downhearted. I
      wanted to ask you to let him run about with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [With faint amusement] Ring the bell-would you, Miller? [To
      COKESON] You'd like to hear what the doctor says about him, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. [Ringing the bell] You are not accustomed to prisons, it
      would seem, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. No. But it's a pitiful sight. He's quite a young fellow. I said
      to him: "Before a month's up" I said, "you'll be out and about with the
      others; it'll be a nice change for you." "A month!" he said  -- like
      that! "Come!" I said, "we mustn't exaggerate. What's a month? Why, it's
      nothing!" "A day," he said, "shut up in your cell thinking and brooding as
      I do, it's longer than a year outside. I can't help it," he said; "I try -- but
      I'm built that way, Mr. COKESON." And, he held his hand up to his face. I
      could see the tears trickling through his fingers. It wasn't nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. He's a young man with large, rather peculiar eyes, isn't he?
      Not Church of England, I think?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [To WOODER, who has come in] Ask the doctor to be good
      enough to come here for a minute. [WOODER salutes, and goes out] Let's
      see, he's not married?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. No. [Confidentially] But there's a party he's very much attached
      to, not altogether com-il-fa. It's a sad story.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. If it wasn't for drink and women, sir, this prison might be
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Looking at the CHAPLAIN over his spectacles] Ye-es, but I wanted
      to tell you about that, special. He had hopes they'd have let her come and
      see him, but they haven't. Of course he asked me questions. I did my best,
      but I couldn't tell the poor young fellow a lie, with him in here -- seemed
      like hitting him. But I'm afraid it's made him worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. What was this news then?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Like this. The woman had a nahsty, spiteful feller for a husband,
      and she'd left him. Fact is, she was going away with our young friend.
      It's not nice -- but I've looked over it. Well, when he was put in here
      she said she'd earn her living apart, and wait for him to come out. That
      was a great consolation to him. But after a month she came to me -- I
      don't know her personally -- and she said: "I can't earn the children's
      living, let alone my own -- I've got no friends. I'm obliged to keep
      out of everybody's way, else my husband'd get to know where I was. I'm
      very much reduced," she said. And she has lost flesh. "I'll have to go in
      the workhouse!" It's a painful story. I said to her: "No," I said, "not
      that! I've got a wife an' family, but sooner than you should do that I'll
      spare you a little myself." "Really," she said -- she's a nice creature -- "I
      don't like to take it from you. I think I'd better go back to my husband."
      Well, I know he's a nahsty, spiteful feller -- drinks -- but I
      didn't like to persuade her not to.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. Surely, no.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es, but I'm sorry now; it's upset the poor young fellow
      dreadfully. And what I wanted to say was: He's got his three years to
      serve. I want things to be pleasant for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. [With a touch of impatience] The Law hardly shares your
      view, I'm afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. But I can't help thinking that to shut him up there by himself'll
      turn him silly. And nobody wants that, I s'pose. I don't like to see a man
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. It's a very rare thing for them to give way like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Looking at him-in a tone of sudden dogged hostility] I keep
      dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. Indeed?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye-es. And I say this: I wouldn't shut one of them up all by
      himself, month after month, not if he'd bit me all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. Unfortunately, the criminal is not a dog; he has a sense of
      right and wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. But that's not the way to make him feel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. Ah! there I'm afraid we must differ.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. It's the same with dogs. If you treat 'em with kindness they'll
      do anything for you; but to shut 'em up alone, it only makes 'em savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. Surely you should allow those who have had a little more
      experience than yourself to know what is best for prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Doggedly] I know this young feller, I've watched him for years.
      He's eurotic -- got no stamina. His father died of consumption. I'm
      thinking of his future. If he's to be kept there shut up by himself,
      without a cat to keep him company, it'll do him harm. I said to him:
      "Where do you feel it?" "I can't tell you, Mr. COKESON," he said, "but
      sometimes I could beat my head against the wall." It's not nice.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        During this speech the DOCTOR has entered. He is a medium-Sized, rather
        good-looking man, with a quick eye. He stands leaning against the
        window.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. This gentleman thinks the separate is telling on Q 3007 -- Falder,
      young thin fellow, star class. What do you say, Doctor Clements?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR. He doesn't like it, but it's not doing him any harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. But he's told me.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR. Of course he'd say so, but we can always tell. He's lost no
      weight since he's been here.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. It's his state of mind I'm speaking of.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR. His mind's all right so far. He's nervous, rather melancholy.
      I don't see signs of anything more. I'm watching him carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Nonplussed] I'm glad to hear you say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. [More suavely] It's just at this period that we are able to
      make some impression on them, sir. I am speaking from my special
      standpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Turning bewildered to the GOVERNOR] I don't want to be
      unpleasant, but having given him this news, I do feel it's awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. I'll make a point of seeing him to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I'm much obliged to you. I thought perhaps seeing him every day
      you wouldn't notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Rather sharply] If any sign of injury to his health shows
      itself his case will be reported at once. That's fully provided for. [He
      rises]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Following his own thoughts] Of course, what you don't see
      doesn't trouble you; but having seen him, I don't want to have him on my
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. I think you may safely leave it to us, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Mollified and apologetic] I thought you'd understand me. I'm a
      plain man -- never set myself up against authority. [Expanding to the
      CHAPLAIN] Nothing personal meant. Good-morning.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As he goes out the three officials do not look at each other, but their
        faces wear peculiar expressions.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. Our friend seems to think that prison is a hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Returning suddenly with an apologetic air] There's just one
      little thing. This woman -- I suppose I mustn't ask you to let him see
      her. It'd be a rare treat for them both. He's thinking about her all the
      time. Of course she's not his wife. But he's quite safe in here. They're a
      pitiful couple. You couldn't make an exception?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Wearily] As you say, my dear sir, I couldn't make an
      exception; he won't be allowed another visit of any sort till he goes to a
      convict prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I see. [Rather coldly] Sorry to have troubled you. [He again goes
      out]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CHAPLAIN. [Shrugging his shoulders] The plain man indeed, poor fellow.
      Come and have some lunch, Clements?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He and the DOCTOR go out talking. The GOVERNOR, with a sigh, sits down
        at his table and takes up a pen.
      </p>

      SCENE II
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Part of the ground corridor of the prison. The walls are coloured with
        greenish distemper up to a stripe of deeper green about the height of a
        man's shoulder, and above this line are whitewashed. The floor is of
        blackened stones. Daylight is filtering through a heavily barred window
        at the end. The doors of four cells are visible. Each cell door has a
        little round peep-hole at the level of a man's eye, covered by a little
        round disc, which, raised upwards, affords a view o f the cell. On the
        wall, close to each cell door, hangs a little square board with the
        prisoner's name, number, and record. Overhead can be seen the iron
        structures of the first-floor and second-floor corridors. The WARDER
        INSTRUCTOR, a bearded man in blue uniform, with an apron, and some
        dangling keys, is just emerging from one of the cells.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      INSTRUCTOR. [Speaking from the door into the cell] I'll have another bit
      for you when that's finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. [Unseen -- in an Irish voice] Little doubt o' that, sirr.
    </p>
    <p>
      INSTRUCTOR. [Gossiping] Well, you'd rather have it than nothing, I s'pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. An' that's the blessed truth.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Sounds are heard of a cell door being closed and locked, and of
        approaching footsteps.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      INSTRUCTOR. [In a sharp, changed voice] Look alive over it!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He shuts the cell door, and stands at attention. The GOVERNOR comes
        walking down the corridor, followed by WOODER.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Anything to report?
    </p>
    <p>
      INSTRUCTOR. [Saluting] Q 3007 [he points to a cell] is behind with his
      work, sir. He'll lose marks to-day.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The GOVERNOR nods and passes on to the end cell. The INSTRUCTOR goes
        away.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. This is our maker of saws, isn't it?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He takes the saw from his pocket as WOODER throws open the door of the
        cell. The convict MOANEY is seen lying on his bed, athwart the cell,
        with his cap on. He springs up and stands in the middle of the cell. He
        is a raw-boned fellow, about fifty-six years old, with outstanding bat's
        ears and fierce, staring, steel-coloured eyes.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WOODER. Cap off! [MOANEY removes his cap] Out here! [MOANEY Comes to the
      door]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Beckoning him out into the corridor, and holding up the saw -- with
      the manner of an officer speaking to a private] Anything to say about
      this, my man? [MOANEY is silent] Come!
    </p>
    <p>
      MOANEY. It passed the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Pointing into the cell] Not enough to do, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOANEY. It don't occupy your mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Tapping the saw] You might find a better way than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOANEY. [Sullenly] Well! What way? I must keep my hand in against the time
      I get out. What's the good of anything else to me at my time of life?
      [With a gradual change to civility, as his tongue warms] Ye know that,
      sir. I'll be in again within a year or two, after I've done this lot. I
      don't want to disgrace meself when I'm out. You've got your pride keeping
      the prison smart; well, I've got mine. [Seeing that the GOVERNOR is
      listening with interest, he goes on, pointing to the saw] I must be doin'
      a little o' this. It's no harm to any one. I was five weeks makin' that
      saw -- a bit of all right it is, too; now I'll get cells, I suppose, or
      seven days' bread and water. You can't help it, sir, I know that -- I
      quite put meself in your place.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Now, look here, Moaney, if I pass it over will you give me
      your word not to try it on again? Think! [He goes into the cell, walks to
      the end of it, mounts the stool, and tries the window-bars]
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Returning] Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOANEY. [Who has been reflecting] I've got another six weeks to do in
      here, alone. I can't do it and think o' nothing. I must have something to
      interest me. You've made me a sporting offer, sir, but I can't pass my
      word about it. I shouldn't like to deceive a gentleman. [Pointing into the
      cell] Another four hours' steady work would have done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Yes, and what then? Caught, brought back, punishment. Five
      weeks' hard work to make this, and cells at the end of it, while they put
      anew bar to your window. Is it worth it, Moaney?
    </p>
    <p>
      MOANEY. [With a sort of fierceness] Yes, it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Putting his hand to his brow] Oh, well! Two days'
      cells-bread and water.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOANEY. Thank 'e, sir.

        WOODER opens the door of CLIPTON'S cell. CLIPTON is sitting on a stool
        just inside the door, at work on a pair of trousers. He is a small,
        thick, oldish man, with an almost shaven head, and smouldering little
        dark eyes behind smoked spectacles. He gets up and stands motionless in
        the doorway, peering at his visitors.

        CLIPTON, with a sort of dreadful quietness, comes into the corridor, the
        needle and thread in his hand. The GOVERNOR signs to WOODER, who goes
        into the cell and inspects it carefully.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. How are your eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      CLIFTON. I don't complain of them. I don't see the sun here. [He makes a
      stealthy movement, protruding his neck a little] There's just one thing,
      Mr. Governor, as you're speaking to me. I wish you'd ask the cove next
      door here to keep a bit quieter.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. What's the matter? I don't want any tales, Clipton.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLIPTON. He keeps me awake. I don't know who he is. [With contempt] One of
      this star class, I expect. Oughtn't to be here with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Quietly] Quite right, Clipton. He'll be moved when there's
      a cell vacant.
    </p>
    <p>
      CLIPTON. He knocks about like a wild beast in the early morning. I'm not
      used to it -- stops me getting my sleep out. In the evening too. It's
      not fair, Mr. Governor, as you're speaking to me. Sleep's the comfort I've
      got here; I'm entitled to take it out full.

      THE GOVERNOR. Which is the man who banged on his door this morning?

        WOODER throws open the door. O'CLEARY, who is seated at a little table
        by the door as if listening, springs up and stands at attention jest
        inside the doorway. He is a broad-faced, middle-aged man, with a wide,
        thin, flexible mouth, and little holes under his high cheek-bones.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Where's the joke, O'Cleary?
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. The joke, your honour? I've not seen one for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Banging on your door?
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. Oh! that!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. It's womanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. An' it's that I'm becoming this two months past.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Anything to complain of?
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. NO, Sirr.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. You're an old hand; you ought to know better.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. Yes, I've been through it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. You've got a youngster next door; you'll upset him.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. It cam' over me, your honour. I can't always be the same steady
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Work all right?
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. [Taking up a rush mat he is making] Oh! I can do it on me head.
      It's the miserablest stuff -- don't take the brains of a mouse.
      [Working his mouth] It's here I feel it -- the want of a little noise
       -- a terrible little wud ease me.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. You know as well as I do that if you were out in the shops
      you wouldn't be allowed to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. [With a look of profound meaning] Not with my mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Well, then?
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. But it's the great conversation I'd have.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [With a smile] Well, no more conversation on your door.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'CLEARY. No, sirr, I wud not have the little wit to repeat meself.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Turning] Good-night.

        hand; then, after scrutinising the record board, he opens the cell door.

      THE GOVERNOR. You know what I mean? It's no good running your head against
      a stone wall, is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. No, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Well, come.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I try, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Can't you sleep?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Very little. Between two o'clock and getting up's the worst time.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. How's that?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [His lips twitch with a sort of smile] I don't know, sir. I was
      always nervous. [Suddenly voluble] Everything seems to get such a size
      then. I feel I'll never get out as long as I live.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. That's morbid, my lad. Pull yourself together.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [With an equally sudden dogged resentment] Yes -- I've got to.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Think of all these other fellows?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. They're used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. They all had to go through it once for the first time, just
      as you're doing now.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Yes, sir, I shall get to be like them in time, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Rather taken aback] H'm! Well! That rests with you. Now
      come. Set your mind to it, like a good fellow. You're still quite young. A
      man can make himself what he likes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Wistfully] Yes, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Take a good hold of yourself. Do you read?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I don't take the words in. [Hanging his head] I know it's no good;
      but I can't help thinking of what's going on outside. In my cell I can't
      see out at all. It's thick glass, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. You've had a visitor. Bad news?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. You mustn't think about it.
    </p>

      FALDER. [Looking back at his cell] How can I help it, sir?

      WOODER. [Following] Sorry you should be troubled like this, sir. Very
      contented lot of men, on the whole.

    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. [Shortly] You think so?
    </p>
    <p>
      WOODER. Yes, sir. It's Christmas doing it, in my opinion.

      to have more holly?

    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR. I can't make anything much of him. He's nervous, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. Is there any sort of case to report? Quite frankly, Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR. Well, I don't think the separates doing him any good; but then
      I could say the same of a lot of them -- they'd get on better in the
      shops, there's no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. You mean you'd have to recommend others?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR. A dozen at least. It's on his nerves. There's nothing
      tangible. That fellow there [pointing to O'CLEARY'S cell], for instance -- feels
      it just as much, in his way. If I once get away from physical facts -- I
      shan't know where I am. Conscientiously, sir, I don't know how to
      differentiate him. He hasn't lost weight. Nothing wrong with his eyes. His
      pulse is good. Talks all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. It doesn't amount to melancholia?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DOCTOR. [Shaking his head] I can report on him if you like; but if I
      do I ought to report on others.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GOVERNOR. I see. [Looking towards FALDER'S cell] The poor devil must
      just stick it then.

      SCENE III
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FALDER's cell, a whitewashed space thirteen feet broad by seven deep,
        and nine feet high, with a rounded ceiling. The floor is of shiny
        blackened bricks. The barred window of opaque glass, with a ventilator,
        is high up in the middle of the end wall. In the middle of the opposite
        end wall is the narrow door. In a corner are the mattress and bedding
        rolled up [two blankets, two sheets, and a coverlet]. Above them is a
        quarter-circular wooden shelf, on which is a Bible and several little
        devotional books, piled in a symmetrical pyramid; there are also a black
        hair brush, tooth-brush, and a bit of soap. In another corner is the
        wooden frame of a bed, standing on end. There is a dark ventilator under
        the window, and another over the door. FALDER'S work [a shirt to which
        he is putting buttonholes] is hung to a nail on the wall over a small
        wooden table, on which the novel "Lorna Doone" lies open. Low down in
        the corner by the door is a thick glass screen, about a foot square,
        covering the gas-jet let into the wall. There is also a wooden stool,
        and a pair of shoes beneath it. Three bright round tins are set under
        the window. In fast-failing daylight, FALDER, in his stockings, is seen
        standing motionless, with his head inclined towards the door, listening.
        He moves a little closer to the door, his stockinged feet making no
        noise. He stops at the door. He is trying harder and harder to hear
        something, any little thing that is going on outside. He springs
        suddenly upright -- as if at a sound-and remains perfectly
        motionless. Then, with a heavy sigh, he moves to his work, and stands
        looking at it, with his head doom; he does a stitch or two, having the
        air of a man so lost in sadness that each stitch is, as it were, a
        coming to life. Then turning abruptly, he begins pacing the cell, moving
        his head, like an animal pacing its cage. He stops again at the door,
        listens, and, placing the palms of hip hands against it with his fingers
        spread out, leans his forehead against the iron. Turning from it,
        presently, he moves slowly back towards the window, tracing his way with
        his finger along the top line of the distemper that runs round the wall.
        He stops under the window, and, picking up the lid of one of the tins,
        peers into it. It has grown very nearly dark. Suddenly the lid falls out
        of his hand with a clatter -- the only sound that has broken the
        silence -- and he stands staring intently at the wall where the stuff
        of the shirt is hanging rather white in the darkness -- he seems to
        be seeing somebody or something there. There is a sharp tap and click;
        the cell light behind the glass screen has been turned up. The cell is
        brightly lighted. FALDER is seen gasping for breath. A sound from far
        away, as of distant, dull beating on thick metal, is suddenly audible.
        FALDER shrinks back, not able to bear this sudden clamour. But the sound
        grows, as though some great tumbril were rolling towards the cell. And
        gradually it seems to hypnotise him. He begins creeping inch by inch
        nearer to the door. The banging sound, travelling from cell to cell,
        draws closer and closer; FALDER'S hands are seen moving as if his spirit
        had already joined in this beating, and the sound swells till it seems
        to have entered the very cell. He suddenly raises his clenched fists.
        Panting violently, he flings himself at his door, and beats on it.

      <p>
        The scene is again COKESON'S room, at a few minutes to ten of a March
        morning, two years later. The doors are all open. SWEEDLE, now blessed
        with a sprouting moustache, is getting the offices ready. He arranges
        papers on COKESON'S table; then goes to a covered washstand, raises the
        lid, and looks at himself in the mirror. While he is gazing his full
        RUTH HONEYWILL comes in through the outer office and stands in the
        doorway. There seems a kind of exultation and excitement behind her
        habitual impassivity.

      RUTH. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. There's only me here! They don't waste their time hurrying down
      in the morning. Why, it must be two years since we had the pleasure of
      seeing you. [Nervously] What have you been doing with yourself?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Sardonically] Living.

      SWEEDLE. [Impressed] If you want to see him [he points to COKESON'S
      chair], he'll be here directly -- never misses -- not much.
      [Delicately] I hope our friend's back from the country. His time's been up
      these three months, if I remember. [RUTH nods] I was awful sorry about
      that. The governor made a mistake -- if you ask me.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. He did.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. He ought to have given him a chanst. And, I say, the judge ought
      to ha' let him go after that. They've forgot what human nature's like.
      Whereas we know. [RUTH gives him a honeyed smile]
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. They come down on you like a cartload of bricks, flatten you out,
      and when you don't swell up again they complain of it. I know 'em -- seen
      a lot of that sort of thing in my time. [He shakes his head in the
      plenitude of wisdom] Why, only the other day the governor --  -- 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        But COKESON has come in through the outer office; brisk with east wind,
        and decidedly greyer.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Drawing off his coat and gloves] Why! it's you! [Then motioning
      SWEEDLE out, and closing the door] Quite a stranger! Must be two years.
      D'you want to see me? I can give you a minute. Sit down! Family well?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes. I'm not living where I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Eyeing her askance] I hope things are more comfortable at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. I couldn't stay with Honeywill, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. You haven't done anything rash, I hope. I should be sorry if
      you'd done anything rash.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. I've kept the children with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Beginning to feel that things are not so jolly as ha had hoped]
      Well, I'm glad to have seen you. You've not heard from the young man, I
      suppose, since he came out?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes, I ran across him yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I hope he's well.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [With sudden fierceness] He can't get anything to do. It's dreadful
      to see him. He's just skin and bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [With genuine concern] Dear me! I'm sorry to hear that. [On his
      guard again] Didn't they find him a place when his time was up?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. He was only there three weeks. It got out.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I'm sure I don't know what I can do for you. I don't like to be
      snubby.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. I can't bear his being like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Scanning her not unprosperous figure] I know his relations
      aren't very forthy about him. Perhaps you can do something for him, till
      he finds his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Not now. I could have -- but not now.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I don't understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Proudly] I've seen him again -- that's all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Staring at her -- disturbed] I'm a family man -- I don't
      want to hear anything unpleasant. Excuse me -- I'm very busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. I'd have gone home to my people in the country long ago, but they've
      never got over me marrying Honeywill. I never was waywise, Mr. Cokeson,
      but I'm proud. I was only a girl, you see, when I married him. I thought
      the world of him, of course... he used to come travelling to our farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Regretfully] I did hope you'd have got on better, after you saw
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. He used me worse than ever. He couldn't break my nerve, but I lost
      my health; and then he began knocking the children about. I couldn't stand
      that. I wouldn't go back now, if he were dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Who has risen and is shifting about as though dodging a stream
      of lava] We mustn't be violent, must we?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Smouldering] A man that can't behave better than that --  [There
      is silence]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Fascinated in spite of himself] Then there you were! And what
      did you do then?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [With a shrug] Tried the same as when I left him before..., making
      skirts... cheap things. It was the best I could get, but I never made more
      than ten shillings a week, buying my own cotton and working all day; I
      hardly ever got to bed till past twelve. I kept at it for nine months.
      [Fiercely] Well, I'm not fit for that; I wasn't made for it. I'd rather
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. My dear woman! We mustn't talk like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. It was starvation for the children too -- after what they'd
      always had. I soon got not to care. I used to be too tired. [She is
      silent]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [With fearful curiosity] Why, what happened then?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [With a laugh] My employer happened then -- he's happened ever
      since.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Dear! Oh dear! I never came across a thing like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Dully] He's treated me all right. But I've done with that.
      [Suddenly her lips begin to quiver, and she hides them with the back of
      her hand] I never thought I'd see him again, you see. It was just a chance
      I met him by Hyde Park. We went in there and sat down, and he told me all
      about himself. Oh! Mr. Cokeson, give him another chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Greatly disturbed] Then you've both lost your livings! What a
      horrible position!
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. If he could only get here -- where there's nothing to find out
      about him!
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. We can't have anything derogative to the firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. I've no one else to go to.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I'll speak to the partners, but I don't think they'll take him,
      under the circumstances. I don't really.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. He came with me; he's down there in the street. [She points to the
      window.]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [On his dignity] He shouldn't have done that until he's sent for.
      [Then softening at the look on her face] We've got a vacancy, as it
      happens, but I can't promise anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. It would be the saving of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Well, I'll do what I can, but I'm not sanguine. Now tell him that
      I don't want him till I see how things are. Leave your address? [Repeating
      her] 83 Mullingar Street? [He notes it on blotting-paper] Good-morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Thank you.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        She moves towards the door, turns as if to speak, but does not, and goes
        away.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Wiping his head and forehead with a large white cotton
      handkerchief] What a business! [Then looking amongst his papers, he sounds
      his bell. SWEEDLE answers it]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Was that young Richards coming here to-day after the clerk's
      place?
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Well, keep him in the air; I don't want to see him yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. What shall I tell him, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [With asperity] invent something. Use your brains. Don't stump
      him off altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. Shall I tell him that we've got illness, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. No! Nothing untrue. Say I'm not here to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. Yes, sir. Keep him hankering?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Exactly. And look here. You remember Falder? I may be having him
      round to see me. Now, treat him like you'd have him treat you in a similar
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. I naturally should do.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. That's right. When a man's down never hit 'im. 'Tisn't necessary.
      Give him a hand up. That's a metaphor I recommend to you in life. It's
      sound policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. Do you think the governors will take him on again, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Can't say anything about that. [At the sound of some one having
      entered the outer office] Who's there?
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. [Going to the door and looking] It's Falder, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Vexed] Dear me! That's very naughty of her. Tell him to call
      again. I don't want --  -- 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He breaks off as FALDER comes in. FALDER is thin, pale, older, his eyes
        have grown more restless. His clothes are very worn and loose. SWEEDLE,
        nodding cheerfully, withdraws.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. Glad to see you. You're rather previous. [Trying to keep things
      pleasant] Shake hands! She's striking while the iron's hot. [He wipes his
      forehead] I don't blame her. She's anxious.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FALDER timidly takes COKESON's hand and glances towards the partners'
        door.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. No -- not yet! Sit down! [FALDER sits in the chair at the aide
      of COKESON's table, on which he places his cap] Now you are here I'd like
      you to give me a little account of yourself. [Looking at him over his
      spectacles] How's your health?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I'm alive, Mr. Cokeson.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Preoccupied] I'm glad to hear that. About this matter. I don't
      like doing anything out of the ordinary; it's not my habit. I'm a plain
      man, and I want everything smooth and straight. But I promised your friend
      to speak to the partners, and I always keep my word.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I just want a chance, Mr. Cokeson. I've paid for that job a
      thousand times and more. I have, sir. No one knows. They say I weighed
      more when I came out than when I went in. They couldn't weigh me here [he
      touches his head] or here [he touches -- his heart, and gives a sort of
      laugh]. Till last night I'd have thought there was nothing in here at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Concerned] You've not got heart disease?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Oh! they passed me sound enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. But they got you a place, didn't they?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALSER. Yes; very good people, knew all about it -- very kind to me. I
      thought I was going to get on first rate. But one day, all of a sudden,
      the other clerks got wind of it.... I couldn't stick it, Mr. COKESON, I
      couldn't, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Easy, my dear fellow, easy!
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I had one small job after that, but it didn't last.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. How was that?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. It's no good deceiving you, Mr. Cokeson. The fact is, I seem to be
      struggling against a thing that's all round me. I can't explain it: it's
      as if I was in a net; as fast as I cut it here, it grows up there. I
      didn't act as I ought to have, about references; but what are you to do?
      You must have them. And that made me afraid, and I left. In fact, I'm -- I'm
      afraid all the time now.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He bows his head and leans dejectedly silent over the table.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. I feel for you -- I do really. Aren't your sisters going to do
      anything for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. One's in consumption. And the other --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Ye...es. She told me her husband wasn't quite pleased with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. When I went there -- they were at supper -- my sister wanted
      to give me a kiss -- I know. But he just looked at her, and said: "What
      have you come for?" Well, I pocketed my pride and I said: "Aren't you
      going to give me your hand, Jim? Cis is, I know," I said. "Look here!" he
      said, "that's all very well, but we'd better come to an understanding.
      I've been expecting you, and I've made up my mind. I'll give you fifteen
      pounds to go to Canada with." "I see," I said -- "good riddance! No,
      thanks; keep your fifteen pounds." Friendship's a queer thing when you've
      been where I have.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I understand. Will you take the fifteen pound from me?
      [Flustered, as FALDER regards him with a queer smile] Quite without
      prejudice; I meant it kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I'm not allowed to leave the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Oh! ye...es -- ticket-of-leave? You aren't looking the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I've slept in the Park three nights this week. The dawns aren't
      all poetry there. But meeting her -- I feel a different man this
      morning. I've often thought the being fond of hers the best thing about
      me; it's sacred, somehow -- and yet it did for me. That's queer, isn't
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I'm sure we're all very sorry for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. That's what I've found, Mr. Cokeson. Awfully sorry for me. [With
      quiet bitterness] But it doesn't do to associate with criminals!
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Come, come, it's no use calling yourself names. That never did a
      man any good. Put a face on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. It's easy enough to put a face on it, sir, when you're
      independent. Try it when you're down like me. They talk about giving you
      your deserts. Well, I think I've had just a bit over.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Eyeing him askance over his spectacles] I hope they haven't made
      a Socialist of you.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FALDER is suddenly still, as if brooding over his past self; he utters a
        peculiar laugh.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. You must give them credit for the best intentions. Really you
      must. Nobody wishes you harm, I'm sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I believe that, Mr. Cokeson. Nobody wishes you harm, but they down
      you all the same. This feeling -- [He stares round him, as though at
      something closing in] It's crushing me. [With sudden impersonality] I know
      it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Horribly disturbed] There's nothing there! We must try and take
      it quiet. I'm sure I've often had you in my prayers. Now leave it to me.
      I'll use my gumption and take 'em when they're jolly. [As he speaks the
      two partners come in]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON [Rather disconcerted, but trying to put them all at ease] I didn't
      expect you quite so soon. I've just been having a talk with this young
      man. I think you'll remember him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [With a grave, keen look] Quite well. How are you, Falder?
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [Holding out his hand almost timidly] Very glad to see you again,
      Falder.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Who has recovered his self-control, takes the hand] Thank you,
      sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Just a word, Mr. James. [To FALDER, pointing to the clerks'
      office] You might go in there a minute. You know your way. Our junior
      won't be coming this morning. His wife's just had a little family.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FALDER, goes uncertainly out into the clerks' office.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Confidentially] I'm bound to tell you all about it. He's quite
      penitent. But there's a prejudice against him. And you're not seeing him
      to advantage this morning; he's under-nourished. It's very trying to go
      without your dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Is that so, COKESON?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I wanted to ask you. He's had his lesson. Now we know all about
      him, and we want a clerk. There is a young fellow applying, but I'm
      keeping him in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. A gaol-bird in the office, COKESON? I don't see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. "The rolling of the chariot-wheels of Justice!" I've never got
      that out of my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I've nothing to reproach myself with in this affair. What's he been
      doing since he came out?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. He's had one or two places, but he hasn't kept them. He's
      sensitive -- quite natural. Seems to fancy everybody's down on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Bad sign. Don't like the fellow -- never did from the first.
      "Weak character"'s written all over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. I think we owe him a leg up.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. He brought it all on himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. The doctrine of full responsibility doesn't quite hold in these
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Rather grimly] You'll find it safer to hold it for all that, my
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. For oneself, yes -- not for other people, thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Well! I don't want to be hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I'm glad to hear you say that. He seems to see something
      [spreading his arms] round him. 'Tisn't healthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. What about that woman he was mixed up with? I saw some one
      uncommonly like her outside as we came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. That! Well, I can't keep anything from you. He has met her.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Is she with her husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Falder living with her, I suppose?
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Desperately trying to retain the new-found jollity] I don't know
      that of my own knowledge. 'Tisn't my business.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. It's our business, if we're going to engage him, COKESON.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Reluctantly] I ought to tell you, perhaps. I've had the party
      here this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I thought so. [To WALTER] No, my dear boy, it won't do. Too shady
      altogether!
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. The two things together make it very awkward for you -- I see
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [Tentatively] I don't quite know what we have to do with his
      private life.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. No, no! He must make a clean sheet of it, or he can't come here.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Poor devil!
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. Will you -- have him in? [And as JAMES nods] I think I can get
      him to see reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Grimly] You can leave that to me, COKESON.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. [To JAMES, in a low voice, while COKESON is summoning FALDER] His
      whole future may depend on what we do, dad.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER comes in. He has pulled himself together, and presents a steady
      front.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Now look here, Falder. My son and I want to give you another
      chance; but there are two things I must say to you. In the first place:
      It's no good coming here as a victim. If you've any notion that you've
      been unjustly treated -- get rid of it. You can't play fast and loose
      with morality and hope to go scot-free. If Society didn't take care of
      itself, nobody would -- the sooner you realise that the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Yes, sir; but -- may I say something?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Well?
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I had a lot of time to think it over in prison. [He stops]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Encouraging him] I'm sure you did.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. There were all sorts there. And what I mean, sir, is, that if we'd
      been treated differently the first time, and put under somebody that could
      look after us a bit, and not put in prison, not a quarter of us would ever
      have got there.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Shaking his head] I'm afraid I've very grave doubts of that,
      Falder.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [With a gleam of malice] Yes, sir, so I found.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. My good fellow, don't forget that you began it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I never wanted to do wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Perhaps not. But you did.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [With all the bitterness of his past suffering] It's knocked me
      out of time. [Pulling himself up] That is, I mean, I'm not what I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. This isn't encouraging for us, Falder.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. He's putting it awkwardly, Mr. James.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Throwing over his caution from the intensity of his feeling] I
      mean it, Mr. Cokeson.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Now, lay aside all those thoughts, Falder, and look to the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Almost eagerly] Yes, sir, but you don't understand what prison
      is. It's here it gets you.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He grips his chest.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [In a whisper to James] I told you he wanted nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Yes, but, my dear fellow, that'll pass away. Time's merciful.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [With his face twitching] I hope so, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Much more gently] Now, my boy, what you've got to do is to put all
      the past behind you and build yourself up a steady reputation. And that
      brings me to the second thing. This woman you were mixed up with you must
      give us your word, you know, to have done with that. There's no chance of
      your keeping straight if you're going to begin your future with such a
      relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [Looking from one to the other with a hunted expression] But
      sir... but sir... it's the one thing I looked forward to all that time.
      And she too... I couldn't find her before last night.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        During this and what follows COKESON becomes more and more uneasy.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. This is painful, Falder. But you must see for yourself that it's
      impossible for a firm like this to close its eyes to everything. Give us
      this proof of your resolve to keep straight, and you can come back -- not
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [After staring at JAMES, suddenly stiffens himself] I couldn't
      give her up. I couldn't! Oh, sir!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I'm all she's got to look to. And I'm sure she's all I've got.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. I'm very sorry, Falder, but I must be firm. It's for the benefit of
      you both in the long run. No good can come of this connection. It was the
      cause of all your disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. But sir, it means-having gone through all that-getting broken up -- my
      nerves are in an awful state -- for nothing. I did it for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Come! If she's anything of a woman she'll see it for herself. She
      won't want to drag you down further. If there were a prospect of your
      being able to marry her -- it might be another thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. It's not my fault, sir, that she couldn't get rid of him  -- she
      would have if she could. That's been the whole trouble from the beginning.
      [Looking suddenly at WALTER]... If anybody would help her! It's only money
      wants now, I'm sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Breaking in, as WALTER hesitates, and is about to speak] I don't
      think we need consider that -- it's rather far-fetched.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [To WALTER, appealing] He must have given her full cause since;
      she could prove that he drove her to leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. I'm inclined to do what you say, Falder, if it can be managed.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Oh, sir!
    </p>
    <p>
      He goes to the window and looks down into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Hurriedly] You don't take me, Mr. Walter. I have my reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [From the window] She's down there, sir. Will you see her? I can
      beckon to her from here.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        WALTER hesitates, and looks from COKESON to JAMES.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. [With a sharp nod] Yes, let her come.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER beckons from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [In a low fluster to JAMES and WALTER] No, Mr. James. She's not
      been quite what she ought to ha' been, while this young man's been away.
      She's lost her chance. We can't consult how to swindle the Law.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        FALDER has come from the window. The three men look at him in a sort of
        awed silence.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FALDER. [With instinctive apprehension of some change -- looking from
      one to the other] There's been nothing between us, sir, to prevent it....
      What I said at the trial was true. And last night we only just sat in the
      Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE comes in from the outer office.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. Mrs. Honeywill. [There is silence]
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. Show her in.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        RUTH comes slowly in, and stands stoically with FALDER on one side and
        the three men on the other. No one speaks. COKESON turns to his table,
        bending over his papers as though the burden of the situation were
        forcing him back into his accustomed groove.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Sharply] Shut the door there. [SWEEDLE shuts the door] We've asked
      you to come up because there are certain facts to be faced in this matter.
      I understand you have only just met Falder again.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes -- only yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. He's told us about himself, and we're very sorry for him. I've
      promised to take him back here if he'll make a fresh start. [Looking
      steadily at RUTH] This is a matter that requires courage, ma'am.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH, who is looking at FALDER, begins to twist her hands in front of her
      as though prescient of disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Mr. Walter How is good enough to say that he'll help us to get you
      a divorce.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        RUTH flashes a startled glance at JAMES and WALTER.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. I don't think that's practicable, Falder.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. But, Sir --  -- !
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Steadily] Now, Mrs. Honeywill. You're fond of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Yes, Sir; I love him.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        She looks miserably at FALDER.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. Then you don't want to stand in his way, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [In a faint voice] I could take care of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. The best way you can take care of him will be to give him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Nothing shall make me give you up. You can get a divorce. There's
      been nothing between us, has there?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Mournfully shaking her head-without looking at him] No.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. We'll keep apart till it's over, sir; if you'll only help us -- we
      promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [To RUTH] You see the thing plainly, don't you? You see what I
      mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Just above a whisper] Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [To himself] There's a dear woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. The situation is impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. Must I, Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Forcing himself to look at her] I put it to you, ma'am. His future
      is in your hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      RUTH. [Miserably] I want to do the best for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [A little huskily] That's right, that's right!
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. I don't understand. You're not going to give me up -- after all
      this? There's something -- [Starting forward to JAMES] Sir, I swear
      solemnly there's been nothing between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I believe you, Falder. Come, my lad, be as plucky as she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. Just now you were going to help us. [He starts at RUTH, who is
      standing absolutely still; his face and hands twitch and quiver as the
      truth dawns on him] What is it? You've not been -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Father!
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Hurriedly] There, there! That'll do, that'll do! I'll give you
      your chance, Falder. Don't let me know what you do with yourselves, that's
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      FALDER. [As if he has not heard] Ruth?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        RUTH looks at him; and FALDER covers his face with his hands. There is
        silence.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Suddenly] There's some one out there. [To RUTH] Go in here.
      You'll feel better by yourself for a minute.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He points to the clerks' room and moves towards the outer office. FALDER
        does not move. RUTH puts out her hand timidly. He shrinks back from the
        touch. She turns and goes miserably into the clerks' room. With a
        brusque movement he follows, seizing her by the shoulder just inside the
        doorway. COKESON shuts the door.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Pointing to the outer office] Get rid of that, whoever it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      SWEEDLE. [Opening the office door, in a scared voice] Detective-Sergeant
      blister.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The detective enters, and closes the door behind him.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WISTER. Sorry to disturb you, sir. A clerk you had here, two years and a
      half ago: I arrested him in, this room.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. What about him?
    </p>
    <p>
      WISTER. I thought perhaps I might get his whereabouts from you. [There is
      an awkward silence]
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. [Pleasantly, coming to the rescue] We're not responsible for his
      movements; you know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. What do you want with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      WISTER. He's failed to report himself this last four weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. How d'you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      WISTER. Ticket-of-leave won't be up for another six months, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALTER. Has he to keep in touch with the police till then?
    </p>
    <p>
      WISTER. We're bound to know where he sleeps every night. I dare say we
      shouldn't interfere, sir, even though he hasn't reported himself. But
      we've just heard there's a serious matter of obtaining employment with a
      forged reference. What with the two things together -- we must have
      him.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Again there is silence. WALTER and COKESON steal glances at JAMES, who
        stands staring steadily at the detective.

    <p>
      COKESON. [Expansively] We're very busy at the moment. If you could make it
      convenient to call again we might be able to tell you then.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. [Decisively] I'm a servant of the Law, but I dislike peaching. In
      fact, I can't do such a thing. If you want him you must find him without
      us.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        As he speaks his eye falls on FALDER'S cap, still lying on the table,
        and his face contracts.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      WISTER. [Noting the gesture -- quietly] Very good, sir. I ought to warn
      you that, having broken the terms of his licence, he's still a convict,
      and sheltering a convict.
    </p>
    <p>
      JAMES. I shelter no one. But you mustn't come here and ask questions which
      it's not my business to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      WISTER. [Dryly] I won't trouble you further then, gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      COKESON. I'm sorry we couldn't give you the information. You quite
      understand, don't you? Good-morning!

        RUTH says: "Who's that?" WISTER has gone in. The three men look aghast
        at the door.

 Produced by David Widger

 Updated editions will replace the previous one -- the old editions
 will be renamed.

 Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
 one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
 (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
 Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
 charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
 do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
 rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
 such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
 research.  They may be modified and printed and given away -- you may do
 practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
 subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
 redistribution.

 *** START: FULL LICENSE ***

 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
 http://gutenberg.net/license).

 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic works

 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 States.

 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 copied or distributed:

 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 1.E.9.

 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm License.

 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 that

 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
      License.  You must require such a user to return or
      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
      Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
      of receipt of the work.

 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.

 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGE.

 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
 opportunities to fix the problem.

 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
 To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
 and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

 Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
 subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
