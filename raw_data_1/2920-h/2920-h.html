      HALL-MARKED
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The scene is the sitting-room and verandah of HER bungalow. The room is
        pleasant, and along the back, where the verandah runs, it seems all
        window, both French and casement. There is a door right and a door left.
        The day is bright; the time morning. [HERSELF, dripping wet, comes
        running along the verandah, through the French window, with a wet Scotch
        terrier in her arms. She vanishes through the door left. A little pause,
        and LADY ELLA comes running, dry, thin, refined, and agitated. She halts
        where the tracks of water cease at the door left. A little pause, and
        MAUD comes running, fairly dry, stolid, breathless, and dragging a
        bull-dog, wet, breathless, and stout, by the crutch end of her
        'en-tout-cas'].
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Don't bring Hannibal in till I know where she's put Edward!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Brutally, to HANNIBAL] Bad dog! Bad dog!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [HANNIBAL snuffles.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Maud, do take him out! Tie him up. Here! [She takes out a lace
      handkerchief ] No -- something stronger! Poor darling Edward! [To
      HANNIBAL] You are a bad dog!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [HANNIBAL snuffles.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAUD. Edward began it, Ella. [To HANNIBAL] Bad dog! Bad dog!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [HANNIBAL snuffles.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Tie him up outside. Here, take my scarf. Where is my poor
      treasure? [She removes her scarf] Catch! His ear's torn; I saw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Taking the scarf, to HANNIBAL] Now!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [HANNIBAL snuffles.] [She ties the scarf to his collar]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      He smells horrible. Bad dog -- getting into ponds to fight!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Tie him up, Maud. I must try in here.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [Their husbands, THE SQUIRE and THE RECTOR, come hastening along the
        verandah.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MAUD. [To THE RECTOR] Smell him, Bertie! [To THE SQUIRE] You might have
      that pond drained, Squire!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She takes HANNIBAL out, and ties him to the verandah. THE SQUIRE and
        RECTOR Come in. LADY ELLA is knocking on the door left.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HER VOICE. All right! I've bound him up!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. May I come in?
    </p>
    <p>
      HER VOICE. Just a second! I've got nothing on.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [LADY ELLA recoils. THE SQUIRE and RECTOR make an involuntary movement
        of approach.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Oh! There you are!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. [Doubtfully] I was just going to wade in --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Hannibal would have killed him, if she hadn't rushed in!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. Done him good, little beast!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Why didn't you go in, Tommy?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. Well, I would -- only she --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. I can't think how she got Edward out of Hannibal's awful mouth!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Without -- to HANNIBAL, who is snuffling on the verandah and
      straining at the scarf] Bad dog!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. We must simply thank her tremendously! I shall never forget the
      way she ran in, with her skirts up to her waist!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. By Jove! No. It was topping.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Her clothes must be ruined. That pond -- ugh! [She wrinkles
      her nose] Tommy, do have it drained.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. [Dreamily] I don't remember her face in church.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. Ah! Yes. Who is she? Pretty woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. I must get the Vet. to Edward. [To THE SQUIRE] Tommy, do exert
      yourself!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MAUD re-enters.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. All right! [Exerting himself] Here's a bell!
    </p>
    <p>
      HER VOICE. [Through the door] The bleeding's stopped. Shall I send him in
      to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Oh, please! Poor darling!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [They listen.] [LADY ELLA, prepares to receive EDWARD. THE SQUIRE and
        RECTOR stand transfixed. The door opens, and a bare arm gently pushes
        EDWARD forth. He is bandaged with a smooth towel. There is a snuffle -- HANNIBAL
        has broken the scarf, outside.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. [Aghast] Look! Hannibal's loose! Maud -- Tommy. [To THE
      RECTOR] You!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The THREE rush to prevent HANNIBAL from re-entering.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. [To EDWARD] Yes, I know -- you'd like to! You SHALL bite him
      when it's safe. Oh! my darling, you DO --  -- [She sniffs].
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [MAUD and THE SQUIRE re-enter.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Have you tied him properly this time?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. With Bertie's braces.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Oh! but --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. It's all right; they're almost leather.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [THE RECTOR re-enters, with a slight look of insecurity.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Rector, are you sure it's safe?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. [Hitching at his trousers] No, indeed, LADY Ella -- I --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Tommy, do lend a hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. All right, Ella; all right! He doesn't mean what you mean!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. [Transferring EDWARD to THE SQUIRE] Hold him, Tommy. He's sure
      to smell out Hannibal!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. [Taking EDWARD by the collar, and holding his own nose] Jove!
      Clever if he can smell anything but himself. Phew! She ought to have the
      Victoria Cross for goin' in that pond.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [The door opens, and HERSELF appears; a fine, frank, handsome woman, in
        a man's orange-coloured motor-coat, hastily thrown on over the substrata
        of costume.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SHE. So very sorry -- had to have a bath, and change, of course!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. We're so awfully grateful to you. It was splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Quite.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. [Rather holding himself together] Heroic! I was just myself
      about to --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. [Restraining EDWARD] Little beast will fight -- must
      apologise -- you were too quick for me --  -- 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He looks up at her. She is smiling, and regarding the wounded dog, her
        head benevolently on one side.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SHE. Poor dears! They thought they were so safe in that nice pond!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Is he very badly torn?
    </p>
    <p>
      SHE. Rather nasty. There ought to be a stitch or two put in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. I thought so. Tommy, do --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. All right. Am I to let him go?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. The fly's outside. Bertie, run and tell Jarvis to drive in for the
      Vet.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. [Gentle and embarrassed] Run? Well, Maud -- I --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      SHE. The doctor would sew it up. My maid can go round.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [HANNIBAL. appears at the open casement with the broken braces dangling
        from his collar.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Look! Catch him! Rector!
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Bertie! Catch him!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [THE RECTOR seizes HANNIBAL, but is seen to be in difficulties with his
        garments. HERSELF, who has gone out left, returns, with a leather strop
        in one hand and a pair of braces in the other.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      SHE. Take this strop -- he can't break that. And would these be any
      good to you?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [SHE hands the braces to MAUD and goes out on to the verandah and
        hastily away. MAUD, transferring the braces to the RECTOR, goes out,
        draws HANNIBAL from the casement window, and secures him with the strap.
        THE RECTOR sits suddenly with the braces in his hands. There is a
        moment's peace.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Splendid, isn't she? I do admire her.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. She's all there.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. [Feelingly] Most kind.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He looks ruefully at the braces and at LADY ELLA. A silence. MAUD
        reappears at the door and stands gazing at the braces.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. [Suddenly] Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. [Looking at his wife] Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. [Absorbed in EDWARD] Poor darling!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. [Bluntly] Ella, the Rector wants to get up!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. [Gently] Perhaps -- just for a moment --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Oh! [She turns to the wall.]
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [THE RECTOR, screened by his WIFE, retires on to the verandah to adjust
        his garments.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. [Meditating] So she's married!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. [Absorbed in EDWARD] Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. Braces.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Oh! Yes. We ought to ask them to dinner, Tommy.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. Ah! Yes. Wonder who they are?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [THE RECTOR and MAUD reappear.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. Really very good of her to lend her husband's -- I was -- 
      er -- quite --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. That'll do, Bertie.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [THEY see HER returning along the verandah, followed by a sandy,
        red-faced gentleman in leather leggings, with a needle and cotton in his
        hand.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      HERSELF. Caught the doctor just starting, So lucky!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Oh! Thank goodness!
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. How do, Lady Ella? How do, Squire? -- how do, Rector? [To MAUD]
      How de do? This the beastie? I see. Quite! Who'll hold him for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Oh! I!
    </p>
    <p>
      HERSELF. D'you know, I think I'd better. It's so dreadful when it's your
      own, isn't it? Shall we go in here, doctor? Come along, pretty boy!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She takes EDWARD, and they pass into the room, left.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. I dreaded it. She is splendid!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. Dogs take to her. That's a sure sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. Little things -- one can always tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. Something very attractive about her -- what! Fine build of
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. I shall get hold of her for parish work.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. Ah! Excellent -- excellent! Do!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. Wonder if her husband shoots? She seems quite-er -- quite --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. [Watching the door] Quite! Altogether charming; one of the
      nicest faces I ever saw.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [THE DOCTOR comes out alone.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Oh! Doctor -- have you? is it --  -- ?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Right as rain! She held him like an angel -- he just licked
      her, and never made a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. Poor darling! Can I --  -- 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She signs toward the door.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. Better leave 'em a minute. She's moppin' 'im off. [He wrinkles his
      nose] Wonderful clever hands!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. I say -- who is she?
    </p>
    <p>
      DOCTOR. [Looking from face to face with a dubious and rather quizzical
      expression] Who? Well -- there you have me! All I know is she's a
      first-rate nurse -- been helpin' me with a case in Ditch Lane. Nice
      woman, too -- thorough good sort! Quite an acquisition here. H'm!
      [Again that quizzical glance] Excuse me hurryin' off -- very late.
      Good-bye, Rector. Good-bye, Lady Ella. Good-bye!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He goes. A silence.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. H'm! I suppose we ought to be a bit careful.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [JARVIS, flyman of the old school, has appeared on the verandah.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      JARVIS. [To THE RECTOR] Beg pardon, sir. Is the little dog all right?
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      JARVIS. [Touching his hat] Seein' you've missed your train, m'm, shall I

    </p>
    <p>
      JARVIS. Challenger's the name I've driven 'em in, my lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. Challenger? Sounds like a hound. What's he like?
    </p>
    <p>
      JARVIS. [Scratching his head] Wears a soft 'at, sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. H'm! Ah!
    </p>
    <p>
      JARVIS. Very nice gentleman, very nice lady. 'Elped me with my old mare
      when she 'ad the 'ighsteria last week -- couldn't 'a' been kinder if
      they'd 'a' been angels from 'eaven. Wonderful fond o' dumb animals, the
      two of 'em. I don't pay no attention to gossip, meself.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. Gossip? What gossip?
    </p>
    <p>
      JARVIS. [Backing] Did I make use of the word, m'm? You'll excuse me, I'm
      sure. There's always talk where there's newcomers. I takes people as I
      finds 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE RECTOR. Yes, yes, Jarvis -- quite -- quite right!
    </p>
    <p>
      JARVIS. Yes, sir. I've -- I've got a 'abit that way at my time o' life.
    </p>
    <p>
      MAUD. [Sharply] How long have they been here, Jarvis?
    </p>
    <p>
      JARVIS. Well -- -er -- a matter of three weeks, m'm.

      THE RECTOR. [Abstracted] Three weeks --  -- I certainly haven't seen
      them in church.

    <p>
      MAUD. A trifle of a ring!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY ELLA. [Impulsively] Oh, bother! I'm sure she's all right. And if she
      isn't, I don't care. She's been much too splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SQUIRE. Must think of the village. Didn't quite like the doctor's way
      of puttin' us off.

      LADY ELLA. The poor darling owes his life to her.

      stinkin' pond.

      uncharitable thought.

      LADY ELLA. Yes. It's horrible not having the courage to take people as
      they are.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        CHARACTERS THE OFFICER. THE GIRL. DURING THE GREAT WAR. EVENING. An
        empty room. The curtains drawn and gas turned low. The furniture and
        walls give a colour-impression as of greens and beetroot. There is a
        prevalence of plush. A fireplace on the Left, a sofa, a small table; the
        curtained window is at the back. On the table, in a common pot, stands a
        little plant of maidenhair fern, fresh and green. Enter from the door on
        the Right, a GIRL and a YOUNG OFFICER in khaki. The GIRL wears a
        discreet dark dress, hat, and veil, and stained yellow gloves. The YOUNG
        OFFICER is tall, with a fresh open face, and kindly eager blue eyes; he
        is a little lame. The GIRL, who is evidently at home, moves towards the
        gas jet to turn it up, then changes her mind, and going to the curtains,
        draws them apart and throws up the window. Bright moonlight comes
        flooding in. Outside are seen the trees of a little Square. She stands
        gazing out, suddenly turns inward with a shiver.

      YOUNG OFF. Oh, not a bit; you're quite out! I assure you when we made the
      attack where I got wounded there wasn't a single man in my regiment who

    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. [With a laugh] You're a distrustful little soul; aren't you?
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. I haf reason to be, don't you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. Yes. I suppose you're bound to think us all brutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. [Sitting on a chair close to the window where the moonlight falls on
      one powdered cheek] Well, I haf a lot of reasons to be afraid all my time.
      I am dreadfully nervous now; I am not trusding anybody. I suppose you haf
      been killing lots of Germans?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. We never know, unless it happens to be hand to hand; I haven't
      come in for that yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. But you would be very glad if you had killed some.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. Oh, glad? I don't think so. We're all in the same boat, so far
      as that's concerned. We're not glad to kill each other -- not most of
      us. We do our job -- that's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. Oh! It is frightful. I expect I haf my brothers killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. Don't you get any news ever?
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. News? No indeed, no news of anybody in my country. I might not haf a
      country; all that I ever knew is gone; fader, moder, sisters, broders,
      all; never any more I shall see them, I suppose, now. The war it breaks
      and breaks, it breaks hearts. [She gives a little snarl] Do you know what
      I was thinking when you came up to me? I was thinking of my native town,
      and the river in the moonlight. If I could see it again I would be glad.
      Were you ever homeseeck?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. Yes, I have been -- in the trenches. But one's ashamed with
      all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. Ah! Yees! Yees! You are all comrades there. What is it like for me
      here, do you think, where everybody hates and despises me, and would catch
      me and put me in prison, perhaps. [Her breast heaves.]
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. [Leaning forward and patting her knee] Sorry -- sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. [In a smothered voice] You are the first who has been kind to me for
      so long! I will tell you the truth -- I am not Rooshian at all  -- I
      am German.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. [Staring] My dear girl, who cares. We aren't fighting against
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. [Peering at him] Another man said that to me. But he was thinkin' of
      his fun. You are a veree ni-ice boy; I am so glad I met you. You see the
      good in people, don't you? That is the first thing in the world -- because -- there
      is really not much good in people, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. [Smiling] You are a dreadful little cynic! But of course you
      are!
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. Cyneec? How long do you think I would live if I was not a cyneec? I
      should drown myself to-morrow. Perhaps there are good people, but, you
      see, I don't know them.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. I know lots.
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. [Leaning towards him] Well now -- see, ni-ice boy -- you haf
      never been in a hole, haf you?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. I suppose not a real hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. No, I should think not, with your face. Well, suppose I am still a
      good girl, as I was once, you know; and you took me to your mother and
      your sisters and you said: "Here is a little German girl that has no work,
      and no money, and no friends." They will say: "Oh! how sad! A German
      girl!" And they will go and wash their hands.

      GIRL. No. They would not take a German, even if she was good. Besides, I
      don't want to be good any more -- I am not a humbug; I have learned to
      be bad. Aren't you going to kees me, ni-ice boy?

      fixedly, with a curious inquiring stare] It's stupid. I don't know -- but
      you see, out there, and in hospital, life's different. It's -- it's -- it
      isn't mean, you know. Don't come too close.
    </p>

      GIRL. Oh! You are fun --  -- [She stops] Doesn't it light. No Zeps

      cheer. It is natural. Do you hate us veree much?
    </p>
    <p>
      YOUNG OFF. [Turning sharply] Hate? I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      GIRL. I don't hate even the English -- I despise them. I despise my
      people too; even more, because they began this war. Oh! I know that. I
      despise all the peoples. Why haf they made the world so miserable  -- why
      haf they killed all our lives -- hundreds and thousands and millions of
      lives -- all for noting? They haf made a bad world --  everybody
      hating, and looking for the worst everywhere. They haf made me bad, I
      know. I believe no more in anything. What is there to believe in? Is there
      a God? No! Once I was teaching little English children their prayers -- isn't
      that funnee? I was reading to them about Christ and love. I believed all
      those things. Now I believe noting at all -- no one who is not a fool
      or a liar can believe. I would like to work in a 'ospital; I would like to
      go and 'elp poor boys like you. Because I am a German they would throw me
      out a 'undred times, even if I was good. It is the same in Germany, in
      France, in Russia, everywhere. But do you think I will believe in Love and
      Christ and God and all that -- Not I! I think we are animals  -- that's
      all! Oh, yes! you fancy it is because my life has spoiled me. It is not
      that at all -- that is not the worst thing in life. The men I take are
      not ni-ice, like you, but it's their nature; and -- they help me to
      live, which is something for me, anyway. No, it is the men who think
      themselves great and good and make the war with their talk and their hate,
      killing us all -- killing all the boys like you, and keeping poor
      People in prison, and telling us to go on hating; and all these dreadful
      cold-blood creatures who write in the papers  -- the same in my country -- just
      the same; it is because of all of them that I think we are only animals.

      take to drinking; then I shall be "Kaput" veree quick. You see, I am

        hurrying feet, and voices crying: "'Eavy Defeat!" stands, in the centre
        of a pattern made by the fragments of the torn-up notes, staring out
        unto the moonlight, seeing not this hated room and the hated Square
        outside, but a German orchard, and herself, a little girl, plucking
        apples, a big dog beside her; and a hundred other pictures, such as the
        drowning see. Then she sinks down on the floor, lays her forehead on the
        dusty carpet, and presses her body to it. Mechanically, she sweeps
        together the scattered fragments of notes, assembling them with the dust
        into a little pile, as of fallen leaves, and dabbling in it with her
        fingers, while the tears run down her cheeks.

      better go.

    <p>
      THE MAN. Not I. I've not got the wind up. I've seen as much of hell as he
      has, any day. What like is he?

    <p>
      THE GIRL. [Dully] I dunno, just. I've not seen him these three years. I
      dunno no more, since I've known you.

      THE MAN. Big or little chap?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE GIRL. 'Bout your size. Oh! Jim, go along!

    <p>
      THE MAN. No fear! What's a blighter like that to old Fritz's shells? We
      didn't shift when they was comin'. If you'll go, I'll go; not else.

      like what we do. What's life, anyway? I've seen a thousand lives taken in
      five minutes. I've seen dead men on the wires like flies on a flypaper.
      I've been as good as dead meself a hundred times. I've killed a dozen men.
      It's nothin'. He's safe, if 'e don't get my blood up. If he does, nobody's

        from his arms, and looks behind her along the towing-path. THE MAN draws
        back against, the hedge, fingering his side, where the knife is hidden.
        The song comes nearer. "I'll be right there to-night, Where the fields
        are snowy white; Banjos ringing, darkies singing, All the world seems
        bright."

      I got out of it I'd laugh. Like as the sun itself I used to think of you,
      Daisy, when the trumps was comin' over, and the wind was up. D'you
      remember that last night in the wood? "Come back and marry me quick,
      Jack." Well, here I am -- got me pass to heaven. No more fightin', no
      more drillin', no more sleepin' rough. We can get married now, Daisy. We

      SCENE: The Stage of a Theatre.

    <p>
      Action continuous, though the curtain is momentarily lowered according to
      that action.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        PUNCH AND GO The Scene is the stage of the theatre set for the dress
        rehearsal of the little play: "Orpheus with his Lute." The curtain is up
        and the audience, though present, is not supposed to be. The set scene
        represents the end section of a room, with wide French windows, Back
        Centre, fully opened on to an apple orchard in bloom. The Back Wall with
        these French windows, is set only about ten feet from the footlights,
        and the rest of the stage is orchard. What is visible of the room would
        indicate the study of a writing man of culture. ( Note. -- If found
        advantageous for scenic purposes, this section of room can be changed to
        a broad verandah or porch with pillars supporting its roof.) In the
        wall, Stage Left, is a curtained opening, across which the curtain is
        half drawn. Stage Right of the French windows is a large armchair turned
        rather towards the window, with a book rest attached, on which is a
        volume of the Encyclopedia Britannica, while on a stool alongside are
        writing materials such as a man requires when he writes with a pad on
        his knees. On a little table close by is a reading-lamp with a dark
        green shade. A crude light from the floats makes the stage stare; the
        only person on it is MR FORESON, the stage manager, who is standing in
        the centre looking upwards as if waiting for someone to speak. He is a
        short, broad man, rather blank, and fatal. From the back of the
        auditorium, or from an empty box, whichever is most convenient, the
        producer, MR BLEWITT VANE, a man of about thirty four, with his hair
        brushed back, speaks.

        on the stand to his left-barricaded in fact by the article he is
        writing. He is reading a page over to himself, but the words are drowned
        in the sound of the song his WIFE is singing in the next room, partly
        screened off by the curtain. She finishes, and stops. His voice can then

    <p>
      PROF. [Startled] My dear, your song was helping me like anything to get
      the mood. This paper is the very deuce -- to balance between the
      historical and the natural.

    <p>

      beauty!

      to this day the call of Beauty! [He takes up his pen, while she continues
      to stare out at the moonlight. Yawning] Dash it! I get so sleepy; I wish
      you'd tell them to make the after-dinner coffee twice as strong.

      WIFE. I will.

    <p>
      PROF. How does this strike you? [Conning] "Many Renaissance pictures,
      especially those of Botticelli, Francesca and Piero di Cosimo were
      inspired by such legends as that of Orpheus, and we owe a tiny gem -- like
      Raphael 'Apollo and Marsyas' to the same Pagan inspiration."
    </p>
    <p>
      WIFE. We owe it more than that -- rebellion against the dry-as-dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      PROF. Quite. I might develop that: "We owe it our revolt against the
      academic; or our disgust at 'big business,' and all the grossness of
      commercial success. We owe --  -- ". [His voice peters out.]
    </p>
    <p>
      WIFE. It -- love.

      WIFE. I said: We owe it love.

      WIFE. [To herself and the moonlight] Orpheus with his lute!

      and the dew. [His hand takes up his pen, his face droops over his paper,
      while his wife looks at him with a very strange face] "How far we can
      trace the modern resurgence against the Christian virtues to the symbolic

        in the chair, and screwed a little more round towards the window. From
        behind the mossy boulder a faun-like figure uncurls itself and peeps
        over with ears standing up and elbows leaning on the stone, playing a
        rustic pipe; and there are seen two rabbits and a fox sitting up and
        listening. A shiver of wind passes, blowing petals from the
        apple-trees.] [The FAUN darts his head towards where, from Right, comes
        slowly the figure of a Greek youth, holding a lute or lyre which his
        fingers strike, lifting out little wandering strains as of wind
        whinnying in funnels and odd corners. The FAUN darts down behind the
        stone, and the youth stands by the boulder playing his lute. Slowly
        while he plays the whitened trunk of an apple-tree is seen, to dissolve
        into the body of a girl with bare arms and feet, her dark hair unbound,
        and the face of the PROFESSOR'S WIFE. Hypnotized, she slowly sways
        towards him, their eyes fixed on each other, till she is quite close.
        Her arms go out to him, cling round his neck and, their lips meet. But
        as they meet there comes a gasp and the PROFESSOR with rumpled hair is
        seen starting from his chair, his hands thrown up; and at his horrified
        "Oh!" the Stage is darkened with a black-out.] [The voice of FRUST is

      on his confounded lute, till he actually turned that tree there into you.

    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. Fleetway.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [FLEETWAY comes up.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FRUST. Mr Fleetway, I want to say I thought your Orphoos very remarkable.
      Fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      FLEETWAY. Thank you, sir, indeed -- so glad you liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. [A little balder in the eye] There wasn't much to it, but what
      there was was fine. Mr Toone.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [FLEETWAY melts out and TOONE is precipitated.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr Toone, I was very pleased with your Professor -- quite a
      character-study. [TOONE bows and murmurs] Yes, sir! I thought it fine.
      [His eye grows bald] Who plays the goat?
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS HOPK. [Appearing suddenly between the windows] I play the faun, Mr
      Frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      FORESON. [Introducing] Miss Maude 'Opkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. Miss Hopkins, I guess your fawn was fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS HOPK. Oh! Thank you, Mr Frost. How nice of you to say so. I do so
      enjoy playing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. [His eye growing bald] Mr Foreson, I thought the way you fixed that
      tree was very cunning; I certainly did. Got a match?
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [He takes a match from FORESON, and lighting a very long cigar, walks up
        Stage through the French windows followed by FORESON, and examines the
        apple-tree.] [The two Actors depart, but Miss HELLGROVE runs from where
        she has been lingering, by the curtain, to VANE, Stage Right.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      MISS H. Oh! Mr Vane -- do you think? He seemed quite -- Oh! Mr Vane
      [ecstatically] If only --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. [Pleased and happy] Yes, yes. All right -- you were splendid. He
      liked it. He quite --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      MISS H. [Clasping her hand] How wonderful Oh, Mr Vane, thank you!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [She clasps his hands; but suddenly, seeing that FRUST is coming back,
        fits across into the curtain and vanishes.] [The Stage, in the crude
        light, as empty now save for FRUST, who, in the French windows, Centre,
        is mumbling his cigar; and VANE, Stage Right, who is looking up into the
        wings, Stage Left.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      VANE. [Calling up] That lighting's just right now, Miller. Got it marked
      carefully?
    </p>
    <p>
      ELECTRICS. Yes, Mr Vane.
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. Good. [To FRUST who as coming down] Well, sir? So glad --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. Mr Vane, we got little Miggs on contract?
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. Well, I liked that little pocket piece fine. But I'm blamed if I
      know what it's all about.
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. [A little staggered] Why! Of course it's a little allegory. The
      tragedy of civilization -- all real feeling for Beauty and Nature kept
      out, or pent up even in the cultured.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. Ye-ep. [Meditatively] Little Miggs'd be fine in "Pop goes the
      Weasel."
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. Yes, he'd be all right, but --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. Get him on the 'phone, and put it into rehearsal right now.
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. What! But this piece -- I -- I --  -- !
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. Guess we can't take liberties with our public, Mr Vane. They want
      pep.
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. [Distressed] But it'll break that girl's heart. I -- really -- I
      can't --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. Give her the part of the 'tweeny in "Pop goes".
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. Mr Frust, I -- I beg. I've taken a lot of trouble with this
      little play. It's good. It's that girl's chance -- and I --  -- 
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. We-ell! I certainly thought she was fine. Now, you 'phone up Miggs,
      and get right along with it. I've only one rule, sir! Give the Public what
      it wants; and what the Public wants is punch and go. They've got no use
      for Beauty, Allegory, all that high-brow racket. I know 'em as I know my
      hand.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [During this speech MISS HELLGROVE is seen listening by the French
        window, in distress, unnoticed by either of them.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      VANE. Mr Frost, the Public would take this, I'm sure they would; I'm
      convinced of it. You underrate them.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. Now, see here, Mr Blewitt Vane, is this my theatre? I tell you, I
      can't afford luxuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. But it -- it moved you, sir; I saw it. I was watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      FRUST. [With unmoved finality] Mr Vane, I judge I'm not the average man.
      Before "Louisa Loses" the Public'll want a stimulant. "Pop goes the
      Weasel" will suit us fine. So -- get right along with it. I'll go get
      some lunch.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [As he vanishes into the wings, Left, MISS HELLGROVE covers her face
        with her hands. A little sob escaping her attracts VANE'S attention. He
        takes a step towards her, but she flies.]

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      VANE. [Dashing his hands through his hair till it stands up] Damnation!
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        [FORESON walks on from the wings, Right.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FORESON. Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. "Punch and go!" That superstition!
    </p>

      <p>
        [FORESON walks straight out into the wings, Left.]
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      VANE. Mr Foreson!
    </p>
    <p>
      FORESON. [Re-appearing] Sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      VANE. This is scrapped. [With savagery] Tell 'em to set the first act of
      "Louisa Loses," and put some pep into it.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

        hair.]

    <p>
      FORESON. Where's Charlie?

 Updated editions will replace the previous one -- the old editions
 will be renamed.

 Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
 one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
 (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
 Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
 charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
 do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
 rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
 such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
 research.  They may be modified and printed and given away -- you may do
 practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
 subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
 redistribution.

 *** START: FULL LICENSE ***

 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
 http://gutenberg.net/license).

 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic works

 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
 States.

 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
 copied or distributed:

 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
 re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
 1.E.9.

 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm License.

 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
 that

 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
      License.  You must require such a user to return or
      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
      Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
      of receipt of the work.

 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

 1.F.

 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
 your equipment.

 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
 people in all walks of life.

 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
 assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
 Literary Archive Foundation

 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 status with the IRS.

 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
 particular state visit http://pglaf.org

 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
 approach us with offers to donate.

 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

 Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
 works.

 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

 Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

      http://www.gutenberg.net

 This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
 including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
 Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
