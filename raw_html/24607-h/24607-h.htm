<p><span class="smcap">Chinese Ambassador</span>, <span class="smcap">Pundit</span> (<span class="smcap">Sruti-bhushan</span>)</p>

<p><i>The stage is on two levels: the higher, at the back, for the
Song-preludes alone, concealed by a purple curtain; the lower
only being discovered when the drop goes up. Diagonally across
the extreme left of the lower stage, is arranged the king's
court, with various platforms, for the various dignitaries
ascending to the canopied throne.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> The body of the stage is left
free for the "Play" when that develops.</i></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter some</i> <span class="smcap">Courtiers.</span>)</p>

<p class="center">[The names of the speakers are not given in the margin, as they
can easily be guessed.]</p>

<p>Hush! Hush!</p>

<p>What is the matter?</p>

<p>The King is in great distress.</p>

<p>How dreadful!</p>

<p>Who is that over there, playing on his flute?</p>

<p>Why? What's the matter?</p>

<p>The King is greatly disturbed.</p>

<p>How dreadful!</p>

<p>What are those wild children doing, making so much noise?</p>

<p>They are the Mandal family.</p>

<p>Then tell the Mandal family to keep their children quiet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Where can that Vizier have gone to?</p>

<p>Here I am. What's the matter?</p>

<p>Haven't you heard the news?</p>

<p>No, what?</p>

<p>The King is greatly troubled in his mind.</p>

<p>Well, I've got some very important news about the frontier war.</p>

<p>War we may have, but not the news.</p>

<p>Then the Chinese Ambassador is waiting to see His Majesty.</p>

<p>Let him wait. Anyhow he can't see the King.</p>

<p>Can't see the King?&mdash;Ah, here is the King at last. Look at him
coming this way, with a mirror in his hand. "Long live the King.
Long live the King."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>If it please Your Majesty, it is time to go to the Court.</p>

<p>Time to go? Yes, time to go, but not to the Court.</p>

<p>What does Your Majesty mean?</p>

<p>Haven't you heard? The bell has just been rung to dismiss the
Court.</p>

<p>When? What bell? We haven't heard any bell.</p>

<p>How could you hear? They have rung it in my ears alone.</p>

<p>Oh, Sire. No one can have had the impertinence to do that.</p>

<p>Vizier! They are ringing it now.</p>

<p>Pardon me, Sire, if I am very stupid; but I cannot understand.</p>

<p>Look at this, Vizier, look at this.</p>

<p>Your Majesty's hair&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Can't you see there's a bell-ringer there?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, Your Majesty. Are you playing a joke?</p>

<p>The joke is not mine, but His, who has got the whole world by the
ear, and is having His jest. Last night, when the Queen was
putting a garland of jasmines round my neck, she cried out with
alarm, "King, what is this? Here are two grey hairs behind your
ear."</p>

<p>Oh, please, Sire, don't worry so much about a little thing like
that. Why! The royal physician&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Vizier! The founder of our dynasty had his royal physician, too.
But what could he do? Death has left his card of invitation
behind my ear. The Queen wanted, then and there, to pluck out the
grey hairs. But I said, "Queen, what's the use? You may remove
Death's invitation, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> can you remove Death, the Inviter?" So,
for the present&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, Sire, for the present, let us attend to business.</p>

<p>Business, Vizier! I have no time for business. Send for the
Pundit. Send for Sruti-bhushan.</p>

<p>But, Sire, the General&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The General?&mdash;No, no, not the General. Send for the Pundit.</p>

<p>But, the news from the frontier&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Vizier, the news has come to me from the last great frontier of
all, the frontier of Death. Send for the Pundit.</p>

<p>But if Your Majesty will give me one moment, the Ambassador from
the great Emperor of China&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Vizier, a greater Emperor has sent his embassy to me. Call
Sruti-bhushan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Very well, Sire. But your father-in-law&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It is not my father-in-law whom I want now. Send for the Pundit.</p>

<p>But, if it please you to hear me this once. The poet,
Kabi-shekhar, is waiting with his new book called the <i>Garden of
Poesy</i>.</p>

<p>Let your poet disport himself, jumping about on the topmost
branches of his Garden of Poesy, but send for the Pundit.</p>

<p>Very well, Sire. I will send for him at once.</p>

<p>Tell him to bring his book of devotions with him, called the
<i>Ocean of Renunciation</i>.</p>

<p>Yes, Sire.</p>

<p>But, Vizier. Who are those outside making all that noise? Go out
and stop them at once. I must have peace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>If it please Your Majesty, there is a famine in Nagapatam and the
headmen of the villages are praying to be allowed to see your
face.</p>

<p>My time is short, Vizier. I must have peace.</p>

<p>They say their time is shorter. They are at death's door. They,
too, want peace,&mdash;peace from the burning of hunger.</p>

<p>Vizier! The burning of hunger is quenched at last on the funeral
pyre.</p>

<p>Then these wretched people&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Wretched!&mdash;Listen to the advice of a wretched King to his
wretched subjects. It is futile to be impatient, and try to break
through the net of the inexorable Fisherman. Sooner or later,
Death the Fisherman will have his haul.</p>

<p>Well then?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me have the Pundit, and his <i>Book of Renunciation</i>.</p>

<p>And in this scarcity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Vizier! The real scarcity is of time, and not of food. We are all
suffering from starvation of time. None of us has enough of it,
neither the King, nor his people.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then know, that our petitions for more time will all go to the
last fire of doom. So why strain our voice in prayer?&mdash;Ah, here
is Sruti-bhushan at last. My reverence to you.</p>

<p>Pundit, do tell the King that the Goddess of Fortune deserts him
who gives way to melancholy.</p>

<p>Sruti-bhushan, what is my Vizier whispering to you?</p>

<p>He tells me, King, to instruct you in the ways of fortune.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>What instruction can you give?</p>

<p>There is a verse in my book of devotions which runs as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fortune, as fickle as lotus-flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closes her favours when comes the hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, foolish man, how can you trust her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who comes of a sudden, and goes in a fluster?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ah, Pundit. One breath of your teaching blows out the false flame
of ambition. Our teacher has said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Teeth fall out, hair grows grey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet man clings to hope that plays him false."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Well, King, now that you have introduced the subject of hope, let
me give you another verse from the <i>Ocean of Renunciation</i>. It
runs as follows:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That fetters are binding, all are aware;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fetters of hope are strange, I declare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope's captive is tossed in the whirlpool's wake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only grows still when the fetters break.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ah, Pundit. Your words are priceless. Vizier, give him a hundred
gold sequins at once. What's that noise outside?</p>

<p>It is the famine-stricken people.</p>

<p>Tell them to hold their peace.</p>

<p>Let Sruti-bhushan, with his book of devotions, go and try to
bring them peace; and, in the meanwhile, Your Majesty might
discuss war matters&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>No, no. Let the war matters come later. I can't let Sruti-bhushan
go yet.</p>

<p>King, you said something to me, a moment ago, about a gift of
gold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> Now mere gold, by itself, does not confer any permanent
benefit. It is said in my book of devotions, called the <i>Ocean of
Renunciation</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He who gives gold, gives only pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the gold is spent grief comes again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a lakh, or crore, of gold is spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief only remains in the empty tent.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ah, Pundit. How exquisite. So you don't want any gold, my Master?</p>

<p>No, King, I don't want gold, but something more permanent, which
would make your merit permanent also. I should be quite content,
if you gave me the living of Kanchanpur. For it is said in the
<i>Renunciation</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>No, Pundit, I quite understand. You needn't quote scripture to
support your claim. I understand quite well&mdash;Vizier!</p>

<p>Yes, Your Majesty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>See that the rich province of Kanchanpur is settled on the
Pundit.&mdash;What's the matter now outside there? What are they
crying for?</p>

<p>If it please Your Majesty, it is the people.</p>

<p>Why do they cry so repeatedly?</p>

<p>Their cry is repeated, I admit, but the reason remains most
monotonously the same. They are starving.</p>

<p>But, King, I must tell you before I forget it. It is the one
desire of my wife to make her whole body jingle, from head to
foot, in praise of your munificence; but, alas, the sound is too
feeble for want of proper ornaments.</p>

<p>I understand you, Pundit. Vizier! Order ornaments from the Court
Jeweller for Sruti-bhushan's wife immediately.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>And, King, while he is about it, would you tell the Vizier, that
we are both of us distracted in our devotions by house-repairs.
Let him ask the royal masons to put up a thoroughly well-built
house, where we can practise our devotions in peace.</p>

<p>Very well, Pundit.&mdash;Vizier!</p>

<p>Yes, Your Majesty.</p>

<p>Give the order at once.</p>

<p>Sire, your treasury is empty. Funds are wanting.</p>

<p>Pooh! That's an old story. I hear that every year. It is your
business to increase the funds, and mine to increase the wants.
What do you say, Sruti-bhushan?</p>

<p>King, I cannot blame the Vizier. He is looking after your
treasures in this world. We are looking after your treasures in
the next. So where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> he sees want, we see wealth. Now, if you
would only let me dive deep once more into the <i>Ocean of
Renunciation</i> you will find it written as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That King's coffers are well stored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where wealth alone on worth is poured.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pundit, your company is most valuable.</p>

<p>Your Majesty, Sruti-bhushan knows its value to a farthing. Come,
Sruti-bhushan, make haste. Let us collect all the wealth you need
for your Treasury of Devotion. For wealth has the ugly habit of
diminishing fast. If we are not quick about it, little will
remain to enable us to observe our renunciation with all
splendour.</p>

<p>Yes, Vizier, let us go at once. (<i>To the King.</i>) When he is
making such a fuss about a tiny matter like this, it is best to
pacify him first and then return to you afterwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Pundit, I am afraid that, some day, you will leave my royal
protection altogether, and retire to the forest.</p>

<p>King, so long as I find contentment in a King's palace, it is as
good as a hermitage for my peace of mind. I must now leave you,
King. Vizier, let us go.</p>

<p class="f1">[<i>The Vizier and Pundit go out.</i></p>

<p>Oh, dear me! Whatever shall I do? Here's the Poet coming. I am
afraid he'll make me break all my good resolutions.&mdash;Oh, my grey
hairs, cover my ears, so that the Poet's allurements may not
enter.</p>

<p>Why, King, what's the matter? I hear you want to send away your
Poet.</p>

<p>What have I to do with poets, when poetry brings me this parting
message?</p>

<p>What parting message?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Look at this behind my ear. Don't you see it?</p>

<p>See what? Grey hairs? Why, King, don't you worry about that.</p>

<p>Poet, Nature is trying to rub out the green of youth, and to
paint everything white.</p>

<p>No, no, King. You haven't understood the artist. On that white
ground, Nature will paint new colours.</p>

<p>I don't see any sign of colours yet.</p>

<p>They are all within. In the heart of the white dwell all the
colours of the rainbow.</p>

<p>Oh, Poet, do be quiet. You disturb me when you talk like that.</p>

<p>King, if this youth fades, let it fade. Another Queen of Youth is
coming. And she is putting a garland of pure white jasmines round
your head, in order to be your bride. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> wedding festival is
being made ready, behind the scene.</p>

<p>Oh, dear, Poet. You will undo everything. Do go away. Ho there,
Guard. Go at once and call Sruti-bhushan.</p>

<p>What will you do with him, King, when he comes?</p>

<p>I will compose my mind, and practise my renunciation.</p>

<p>Ah, King, when I heard that news, I came at once. For I can be
your companion in this practice of renunciation.</p>

<p>You?</p>

<p>Yes, I, King. We Poets exist for this very purpose. We set men
free from their desires.</p>

<p>I don't understand you. You talk in riddles.</p>

<p>What? You don't understand me?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> And yet you have been reading my
poems all this while!&mdash;There is renunciation in our words,
renunciation in the metre, renunciation in our music. That is why
fortune always forsakes us; and we, in turn always forsake
fortune. We go about, all day long, initiating the youths in the
sacred cult of fortune-forsaking.</p>

<p>What does it say to us?</p>

<p>It says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, brothers, don't cling to your goods and chattels,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sit ever in the corner of your room.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come out, come out into the open world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come out into the highways of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come out, ye youthful Renouncers."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, Poet, do you really mean to say that the highway of the open
world is the pathway of renunciation?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Why not, King? In the open world all is change, all is life, all
is movement. And he who ever moves and journeys with this
life-movement, dancing and playing on his flute as he goes, he is
the true Renouncer. He is the true disciple of the minstrel Poet.</p>

<p>But how then can I get peace? I must have peace.</p>

<p>Oh, King, we haven't the least desire for peace. We are the
Renouncers.</p>

<p>But ought we not to get that treasure, which is said to be
never-changing?</p>

<p>No, we don't covet any never-changing treasures. We are the
Renouncers.</p>

<p>What do you mean? Oh, dear, Poet, you will undo everything, if
you talk like that. You are destroying my peace of mind. Call
Sruti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>-bhushan. Let some one call the Pundit.</p>

<p>What I mean, King, is this. We are the true Renouncers, because
change is our very secret. We lose, in order to find. We have no
faith in the never-changing.</p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p>Haven't you noticed the detachment of the rushing river, as it
runs splashing from its mountain cave? It gives itself away so
swiftly, and only thus it finds itself. What is never-changing,
for the river, is the desert sand, where it loses its course.</p>

<p>Ah, but listen, Poet&mdash;listen to those cries there outside. That
is your world. How do you deal with that?</p>

<p>King, they are your starving people.</p>

<p>My people, Poet? Why do you call them that? They are the world's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
people, not mine. Have I created their miseries? What can your
youthful Poet Renouncers do to relieve sufferings like theirs?
Tell me that.</p>

<p>King, it is we alone who can truly bear those sufferings, because
we are like the river that flows on in gladness, thus lightening
our burden, and the burden of the world. But the hard, metalled
road is fixed and never-changing. And so it makes the burden more
burdensome. The heavy loads groan and creak along it, and cut
deep gashes in its breast. We Poets call to every one to carry
all their joys and sorrows lightly, in a rhythmic measure. Our
call is the Renouncers' call.</p>

<p>Ah, Poet, now I don't care a straw for Sruti-bhushan. Let the
Pundit go hang. But, do you know what my trouble is now? Though I
can't, for the life of me, understand your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> words, the music
haunts me. Now, it's just the other way round with the Pundit.
His words are clear enough, and they obey the rules of syntax
quite correctly. But the tune!&mdash;No, it's no use telling you any
further.</p>

<p>King, our words don't speak, they sing.</p>

<p>Well, Poet, what do you want to do now?</p>

<p>King, I'm going to have a race through those cries, which are
rising outside your gate.</p>

<p>What do you mean? Famine relief is for men of business. Poets
oughtn't to have anything to do with things like that.</p>

<p>King, business men always make their business so out of tune.
That is why we Poets hasten to tune it.</p>

<p>Now come, my dear Poet, do speak in plainer language.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>King, they work, because they must. We work, because we are in
love with life. That is why they condemn us as unpractical, and
we condemn them as lifeless.</p>

<p>But who is right, Poet? Who wins? You, or they?</p>

<p>We, King, we. We always win.</p>

<p>But, Poet, your proof&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>King, the greatest things in the world disdain proof. But if you
could for a time wipe out all the poets and all their poetry from
the world, then you would soon discover, by their very absence,
where the men of action got their energy from, and who really
supplied the life-sap to their harvest-field. It is not those who
have plunged deep down into the Pundit's <i>Ocean of Renunciation</i>,
nor those who are always clinging to their possessions; it is not
those who have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> become adepts in turning out quantities of work,
nor those who are ever telling the dry beads of duty,&mdash;it is not
these who win at last. But it is those who love, because they
live. These truly win, for they truly surrender. They accept pain
with all their strength and with all their strength they remove
pain. It is they who create, because they know the secret of true
joy, which is the secret of detachment.</p>

<p>Well then, Poet, if that be so, what do you ask me to do now?</p>

<p>I ask you, King, to rise up and move. That cry outside yonder is
the cry of life to life. And if the life within you is not
stirred, in response to that call without, then there is cause
for anxiety indeed,&mdash;not because duty has been neglected, but
because you are dying.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>But, Poet, surely we must die, sooner or later?</p>

<p>No, King, that's a lie. When we feel for certain that we are
alive, then we know for certain that we shall go on living. Those
who have never put life to the test, in all possible ways, these
keep on crying out:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Life is fleeting, Life is waning,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Life is like a dew-drop on a lotus leaf.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, isn't life inconstant?</p>

<p>Only because its movement is unceasing. The moment you stop this
movement, that moment you begin to play the drama of Death.</p>

<p>Poet, are you speaking the truth? Shall we really go on living?</p>

<p>Yes, we shall really go on living.</p>

<p>Then, Poet, if we are going to go on living, we must make our
life worth its eternity. Is not that so?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Ho, Guard.</p>

<p>Yes, Your Royal Highness.</p>

<p>Call the Vizier at once.</p>

<p>Yes, Your Royal Highness.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Vizier enters.</i>)</p>

<p>What is Your Majesty's pleasure?</p>

<p>Vizier! Why on earth have you kept me waiting so long?</p>

<p>I was very busy, Your Majesty.</p>

<p>Busy? What were you busy about?</p>

<p>I was dismissing the General.</p>

<p>Why should you dismiss the General? We have got to discuss war
matters with him.</p>

<p>And arrangements had to be made for the state-departure of the
Chinese Ambassador.</p>

<p>What do you mean by his state-departure?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>If it please Your Majesty, you did not grant him an interview. So
he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Vizier! You surprise me. Is this the way you manage state
affairs? What has happened to you? Have you lost your senses?</p>

<p>Then, again. Sire, I was trying to find a way to pull down the
Poet's house. At first, no one would undertake it. Then, at last,
all the Pundits of the Royal School of Grammar and Logic came up
with their proper tools and set to work.</p>

<p>Vizier! Are you mad this morning? Pull down the Poet's house?
Why, you might as well kill all the birds in the garden and make
them up into a pie.</p>

<p>If it please Your Majesty, you need not be annoyed. We shan't have to
pull down the house after all; for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> moment Sruti-bhushan heard it
was to be demolished, he decided to take possession of it himself.</p>

<p>What, Vizier! That's worse still. Why! The Goddess of Music would
break her harp in pieces against my head, if she even heard of
such a thing. No, that can't be.</p>

<p>Then, Your Majesty, there was another thing to be got through. We
had to deliver over the province of Kanchanpur to the Pundit.</p>

<p>No, Vizier! What a mess you are making. That must go to our Poet.</p>

<p>To me, King? No. My poetry never accepts reward.</p>

<p>Well, well. Let the Pundit have it.</p>

<p>And, last of all, Sire. I have issued orders to the soldiers to
disperse the crowd of famine-stricken people.</p>

<p>Vizier, you are doing nothing but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> blunder. The best way to
disperse the famished people is with food, not force.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Guard enters.</i>)</p>

<p>May it please Your Royal Highness.</p>

<p>What's the matter, Guard?</p>

<p>May it please Your Royal Highness, here is Sruti-bhushan, the
Pundit, coming back with his <i>Book of Devotions</i>.</p>

<p>Oh, stop him, Vizier, stop him. He will undo everything. Don't
let him come upon me unawares like this. In a moment of weakness,
I may suddenly find myself out of my depths in the <i>Ocean of
Renunciation</i>. Poet! Don't give me time for that. Do something.
Do anything. Have you got anything ready to hand? Any play
toward? Any poem? Any masque? Any&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, King. I have got the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> thing. But whether it is a drama,
or a poem, or a play, or a masque, I cannot say.</p>

<p>Shall I be able to understand the sense of what you have written?</p>

<p>No, King, what a poet writes is not meant to have any sense.</p>

<p>What then?</p>

<p>To have the tune itself.</p>

<p>What do you mean? Is there no philosophy in it?</p>

<p>No, none at all, thank goodness.</p>

<p>What does it say, then?</p>

<p>King, it says "I exist." Don't you know the meaning of the first
cry of the new-born child? The child, when it is born, hears at
once the cries of the earth and water and sky, which surround
him,&mdash;and they all cry to him, "We exist," and his tiny little
heart responds, and cries out in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> turn, "I exist." My poetry
is like the cry of that new-born child. It is a response to the
cry of the Universe.</p>

<p>Is it nothing more than that, Poet?</p>

<p>No, nothing more. There is life in my song, which cries, "In joy
and in sorrow, in work and in rest, in life and in death, in
victory and in defeat, in this world and in the next, all hail to
the 'I exist.'"</p>

<p>Well, Poet, I can assure you, if your play hasn't got any
philosophy in it, it won't pass muster in these days.</p>

<p>That's true, King. The newer people, of this modern age, are more
eager to amass than to realize. They are, in their generation,
wiser than the children of light.</p>

<p>Whom shall we ask, then, for an audience? Shall we ask the young
students of our royal school?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>No, King, they cut up poetry with their logic. They are like the
young-horned deer trying their new horns on the flower-beds.</p>

<p>Whom should I ask, then?</p>

<p>Ask those whose hair is turning grey.</p>

<p>What do you mean, Poet?</p>

<p>The youth of these middle-aged people is a youth of detachment.
They have just crossed the waters of pleasure, and are in sight
of the land of pure gladness. They don't want to eat fruit, but
to produce it.</p>

<p>I, at least, have now reached that age of discretion, and ought
to be able to appreciate your songs. Shall I ask the General?</p>

<p>Yes, ask him.</p>

<p>And the Chinese Ambassador?</p>

<p>Yes, ask him too.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>I hear my father-in-law has come.</p>

<p>Well, ask him too, but I have my doubts about his youthful sons.</p>

<p>But don't forget his daughter.</p>

<p>Don't worry about her. She won't let herself be forgotten.</p>

<p>And Sruti-bhushan? Shall I ask him?</p>

<p>No, King, no. Decidedly, no. I have no grudge against him. Why
should I inflict this on him?</p>

<p>Very well, Poet. Off with you. Make your stage preparations.</p>

<p>No, King. We are going to act this play without any special
preparations. Truth looks tawdry when she is overdressed.</p>

<p>But, Poet, there must be some canvas for a background.</p>

<p>No. Our only background is the mind. On that we shall summon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> up
a picture with the magic wand of music.</p>

<p>Are there any songs in the play?</p>

<p>Yes, King. The door of each act will be opened by the key of
song.</p>

<p>What is the subject of the songs?</p>

<p>The Disrobing of Winter.</p>

<p>But, Poet, we haven't read about that in any Mythology.</p>

<p>In the world-myth this song comes round in its turn. In the play
of the seasons, each year, the mask of the Old Man, Winter, is
pulled off, and the form of Spring is revealed in all its beauty.
Thus we see that the old is ever new.</p>

<p>Well, Poet, so much for the songs: but what about the remainder?</p>

<p>Oh, that is all about life.</p>

<p>Life? What is life?</p>

<p>This is how it runs: A band of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> young companions has run off in
pursuit of one Old Man. They have taken a vow to catch him. They
enter into a cave; they take hold of him, and then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then, what? What did they see?</p>

<p>Ah. That will be told in its own good time.</p>

<p>But, I haven't understood one thing. Your drama and your
songs,&mdash;have they different subjects, or the same?</p>

<p>The same, King. The play of Spring in nature is the counterpart
of the play of Youth in our lives. It is simply from the lyrical
drama of the World Poet that I have stolen this plot.</p>

<p>Who, then, are the chief characters?</p>

<p>One is called the Leader.</p>

<p>Who is he, Poet?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>He is the guiding impulse in our life. Another is Chandra.</p>

<p>Who is he?</p>

<p>He who makes life dear to us.</p>

<p>And who else?</p>

<p>Then there is Dada, to whom duty is the essence of life, not joy.</p>

<p>Is there any one else?</p>

<p>Yes, the blind Minstrel.</p>

<p>Blind?</p>

<p>Because he does not see with his eyes, therefore he sees with his
whole body and mind and soul.</p>

<p>Who else is there, in your play, among the chief actors?</p>

<p>You are there, King.</p>

<p>I?</p>

<p>Yes, you, King. For if you stayed out of it, instead of coming
into it, then the King would begin to abuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> the Poet and send
for Sruti-bhushan again. And then there would be no hope of
salvation for him. For the World Poet himself would be defeated.
And the South Wind of Spring would have to retire, without
receiving its homage.</p>

towed against the current of his own pen and ink.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>But you mustn't give April all the credit for that. For I,
Chandra, have hidden the yellow leaves of his manuscript book
among the young buds of the <i>pial</i> forest, and Dada is out
looking for it.</p>

<p>The manuscript book banished! What a good riddance!</p>

<p>We ought to strip off Dada's grey philosopher's cloak also.</p>

<p>Yes, the very dust of the earth is tingling with youth, and yet
there's not a single touch of Spring in the whole of Dada's
body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

yourselves! We aren't children any longer.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>Dada, the age of this earth is scarcely less than yours; and yet
it is not ashamed to look fresh.</p>

<p>Dada, you are always struggling with those quatrains of yours,
full of advice that is as old as death, while the earth and the
water are ever striving to be new.</p>

<p>Dada, how in the world can you go on writing verses like that,
sitting in your den?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dada</i></p>

<p>Well, you see, I don't cultivate poetry, as an amateur gardener
cultivates flowers. <i>My</i> poems have substance and weight in
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, they are like the turnips, which cling to the ground.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dada</i></p>

<p>Well, then, listen to me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>How awful! Here's Dada going to run amuck with his quatrains.</p>

<p>Oh dear, oh dear! The quatrains are let loose. There's no holding
them in.</p>

<p>To all passers-by I give notice that Dada's quatrains have gone
mad, and are running amuck.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>Dada! Don't take any notice of their fun. Go on with your
reading. If no one else can survive it, I think I can. I am not a
coward like these fellows.</p>

<p>Come on, then, Dada. We won't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> be cowards. We will keep our
ground, and not yield an inch, but only listen.</p>

<p>We will receive the spear-thrusts of the quatrains on our breast,
not on our back.</p>

<p>But for pity's sake, Dada, give us only one&mdash;not more.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dada</i></p>

<p>Just one word to make you understand. It means, that if the

<p>No, Dada, we must not understand.</p>

<p>Dada, if you use force to make us understand we shall use force
to force ourselves not to understand.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dada</i></p>

<p>The gist of the quatrain is this, that if we do no good to the
world, then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then the world will be very greatly relieved.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dada</i></p>

<p>There is another verse that makes it clearer:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>But surely, Dada, you are talking nonsense. Time itself is Play.
Its only object is Pas-time.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dada</i></p>

<p>Then what is Work?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>Work is the dust raised by the passing of Time.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dada</i></p>

<p>Leader, you must give us your answers.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>No. I never give answers. I lead on from one question to another.
That is my leadership.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dada</i></p>

<p>Everything else has its limits, but your childishness is
absolutely unbounded.</p>

<p>Do you know the reason? It is because we are really nothing but
children. And everything else has its limitations except the
child.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Dada</i></p>

<p>Won't you ever attain Age?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>No, we shall never attain Age.</p>

<p>We shall die old, but never attain Age.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>When we meet Age, we shall shave his head, and put him on a
donkey, and send him across the river.</p>

<p>Oh, you can save yourself the trouble of shaving his head for Age
is bald.</p>

<p>We can tell, by his looks, that Dada will some day go to that Old
Man, to receive his lessons.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>Which Old Man?</p>

<p>The Old Man of the line of Adam.</p>

<p>He dwells in a cave, and never thinks of dying.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>Where did you learn about him?</p>

<p>Oh, every one talks about him, And it is in the books also.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>What does he look like?</p>

<p>Some say he is white, like the skull of a dead man. And some say
he is dark, like the socket of a skeleton's eye.</p>

<p>But haven't you heard any news of him, Leader?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>I don't believe in him at all.</p>

<p>Well, that goes entirely against current opinion. That Old Man is
more existent than anything else. He lives within the ribs of
creation.</p>

<p>According to our Pundit, it is we who have no existence. You
can't be certain whether we are, or are not.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>We? Oh, we are too brand new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> altogether. We haven't yet got our
credentials to prove that we exist.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>Have you really gone and opened communication with the Pundits?</p>

<p>Why? What harm is there in that, Leader?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>You will become pale, like the white mist in autumn. Even the
least colour of blood will disappear from your mind. I have a
suggestion.</p>

<p>What, Leader? What?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>You were looking out for a play?</p>

<p>Yes, yes, we got quite frantic about it.</p>

<p>We thought it over so vigorously, that people had to run to the
King's court to lodge a complaint.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>Well, I can suggest a play which will be new.</p>

<p>What?&mdash;What?&mdash;Tell us.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>Go and capture the Old Man.</p>

<p>That is new, no doubt, but we very much doubt if it's a play.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>I am sure you won't be able to do it.</p>

<p>Not do it? We shall.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>No, never.</p>

<p>Well then, suppose we do capture him, what will you give us?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>I shall accept you as my preceptor.</p>

<p>Preceptor! You want to make us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> grey, and cold, and old, before
our time.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>Then, what do you want me to do?</p>

<p>If we capture him, then we shall take away your leadership.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>That will be a great relief to me. You have made all my bones out
of joint already. Very well, then it's all settled?</p>

<p>Yes, settled. We shall bring him to you by the next full moon of
Spring.</p>

<p>But what are we going to do with him?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>You shall let him join in your Spring Festival.</p>

<p>Oh no, that will be outrageous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> Then the mango flowers will run
to seed at once.</p>

<p>And all the cuckoos will become owls.</p>

<p>And the bees will go about reciting Sanskrit verses, making the
air hum with m's and n's.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>And your skull will be so top-heavy with prudence, that it will
be difficult for you to keep on your feet.</p>

<p>How awful!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>And you will have rheumatics in all your joints.</p>

<p>How awful!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>And you will become your own elder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> brothers, pulling your own
ears to set yourselves right.</p>

<p>How awful!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>And&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>No more "ands." We are ready to surrender.</p>

<p>We will abandon our game of capturing the Old Man.</p>

<p>We will put it off till the cold weather. In this Springtime,
your company will be enough for us.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>Ah, I see! You have already got the chill of the Old Man in your
bones.</p>

<p>Why? What are the symptoms?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>You have no enthusiasm. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> back out at the very start. Why
don't you make a trial?</p>

<p>Very well. Agreed. Come on.</p>

<p>Let us go after the Old Man. We will pluck him out, like a grey
hair, wherever we find him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>But the Old Man is an adept in the business of plucking out. His
best weapon is the hoe.</p>

<p>You needn't try to frighten us like that. When we are out for
adventure, we must leave behind all fears, all quatrains, all
Pundits, and all Scriptures.</p>

kidnapper; and you want to kidnap him! It's midsummer madness.</p>

<p>The secret is out. It doesn't take long to discover that we are
mad.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Watchman</i></p>

<p>I am the Watchman. The people I see passing along the road are
all very much alike. Therefore, when I see anything queer, it
always strikes me.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Ferryman</i></p>

<p>Very good. Let us have it then.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Watchman</i></p>

<p>Our master used to tell us that there are plenty of men to say
good things, but very few to listen. That requires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> strength of
mind. Now, go on, Sir, go on.</p>

<p>I saw, in the street, one of the King's officers dragging along a
merchant. The King had made up a false charge, in order to get
his money. This gave me an inspiration. You must know that I
never write a single line which is not inspired by some actual
fact. You can put my verses to the test in the open streets and
markets&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Band of Youths</i></p>

<p>They all cry, "There, there," and when we look for it, we find
nothing but dust and dry leaves.</p>

<p>I thought I had a glimpse of the flag on his car through the
cloud.</p>

<p>It is difficult to follow his track. Now it seems East: now it
seems West.</p>

<p>And so we are tired, chasing shadows all day long. And the day
has been lost.</p>

<p>I tell you the truth. Fear comes more and more into my mind, as
the day passes.</p>

<p>We have made a mistake. The morning light whispered in our ears,
"Bravo, march on." And now, the evening light is mocking us for
that.</p>

<p>I am afraid we have been deceived. I am beginning to feel greater
respect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> for Dada's quatrains than before. We shall all be soon
sitting down on the ground composing quatrains.</p>

<p>And then the whole neighbourhood will come, swarming round us.
And they will get such immense benefit from our wisdom that they
will never leave us.</p>

<p>And we shall settle down like a great big boulder, cold and
immovable.</p>

<p>And they will cling to us, as we sit there, like a thick fog.</p>

<p>What would our Leader think of us, I wonder, if he could hear us
now?</p>

<p>I am sure it is our Leader, who has led us astray. He makes us
toil for nothing, while he himself remains idle.</p>

<p>Let us go back and fight with him. We will tell him that we won't
move a step further, but sit with our legs tucked under us. These
legs are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> wretched vagabonds. They are always trudging the road.</p>

<p>We will keep our hands fast behind our backs.</p>

<p>There is no mischief in the back; all the trouble is in the
front.</p>

<p>Of all our limbs, the back is the most truthful. It says to us,
"Lie down."</p>

<p>When we are young, that braggart breast is a great swell; but, in
the end, we can only rely on our back.</p>

<p>The little stream that flows past our village comes to my mind.
That morning we thought that it said to us, "Forward! Forward!"
But what it really said was, "False! False!" The world is all
false.</p>

<p>Our Pundit used to tell us that.</p>

<p>We shall go straight to the Pundit, when we get back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall never stir one step outside the limit of the Pundit's
Scriptures.</p>

<p>What a mistake we made. We thought that moving itself was
something heroic.</p>

<p>But really not to move, that is heroic, because it is defying the
whole moving world.</p>

<p>Brave rebels that we are, we shall <i>not</i> move. We shall have the
audacity to sit still, and never move an inch.</p>

<p>"Life and youth are fleeting," the Scripture says. Let life and
youth go to the dogs, we shall not move.</p>

<p>"Our minds and wealth are fleeting," adds the Scripture. "Give
them up and sit still," say we.</p>

<p>Let us go back to the point from which we started.</p>

<p>But that would be to move.</p>

<p>What then?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>There sit down, where we have come to.</p>

<p>And let us imagine that there we had been before we ever came
there.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, that will keep our minds still. If we know that we have
come from somewhere else, then the mind longs for that somewhere
else.</p>

<p>That land of somewhere else is a very dangerous place.</p>

only lives who does his duty and achieves fame."</p>

give." If this bond of union were to snap, then everything would

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>Don't you know that he has gone?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Gone?&mdash;Where?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>He said, I shall go and conquer him.</p>

<p>Whom?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>The One who is feared by all. He said, "Why else am I young?"</p>

<p>Ah, that was fine.&mdash;Dada goes to read his quatrains to the
village people, and Chandra has disappeared,&mdash;for what purpose
nobody knows.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>He said, "Men have always been fighting for a cause. It is the
shock of that, which ruffles the breeze of this Spring."</p>

<p>The shock?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>Yes, the message that man's fight is not yet over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Is this the message of Spring?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>Yes. Those, who have been made immortal by death, have sent their
message in these fresh leaves of Spring. It said, "We never
doubted the way. We never counted the cost: we rushed out: we
blossomed. If we had sat down to debate, then where would be the
Spring?"</p>

<p>Has that made Chandra mad?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>He said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">(<i>The Minstrel sings.</i>)</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Spring flowers have woven my wreath of victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The South wind breathes its breath of fire in my blood.<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span><span class="i2">Death stands before me, offering its crown.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But where has he gone to?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>He said, "I cannot keep waiting by the wayside any longer. I must
go and meet him, and conquer him."</p>

<p>But which way did he take?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>He has entered the cave.</p>

<p>How is that? It is so fearfully dark. Did he, without making any
enquiries&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>Yes, he went in to make enquiries himself.</p>

<p>When will he come back?</p>

<p>I don't believe he will ever come back.</p>

<p>But if Chandra leaves us, then life is not worth living.</p>

<p>What shall we say to our Leader?</p>

<p>The Leader also will leave us.</p>

<p>Didn't he leave any message for us before he disappeared?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>He said, "Wait for me. I shall return."</p>

<p>Return? How are we to know it?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>He said, "I will conquer, and then come back again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we shall wait for him all night.</p>

<p>But, Minstrel, where have we got to wait for him?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>Before that cave, from whence the stream of water comes flowing
out.</p>

<p>Which way did he go to get there?</p>

<p>The darkness there is like a dark sword.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>He followed the sound of the night-bird's wings.</p>

<p>Why did you not go with him?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>He left me behind to give you hope.</p>

<p>When did he go?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>In the first hour of the watch.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the third hour has passed, I think. The air is chilly.</p>

<p>I dreamt that three women, with their hair hanging loose&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, leave off your dream-women. I am sick of your dreams.</p>

<p>Everything appears darkly ominous. I didn't notice before the
hooting of the owl. But now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Do you hear that dog whining on the far bank of the river?</p>

<p>It seems as though a witch were riding upon him and lashing him.</p>

<p>Surely, if it had been possible, Chandra would have come back by
now.</p>

<p>How I wish this night were over.</p>

<p>Do you hear the woman's cry?</p>

<p>Oh, the women, the women. They are ever crying and weeping. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
they cannot turn those back, who must go forward.</p>

<p>It is getting unbearable to sit still like this. Men imagine all
sorts of things when they sit still. Let us go also. As soon as
we are started on our way fear will leave us.</p>

<p>But who will show us the way?</p>

<p>There is the blind Minstrel.</p>

<p>What do you say, Minstrel? Can you show us the way?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>But we can hardly believe you. How can you find out the path by
simply singing?</p>

<p>If Chandra never comes back, you shall.</p>

<p>We never knew that we loved Chandra so intensely. We made light
of him all these days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>When we are in the playing mood, we become so intent on the play,
that we neglect the playmate.</p>

<p>But, if he once comes back, we shall never neglect him any more.</p>

<p>I am afraid that we have often given him pain.</p>

<p>Yet his love rose above all that. We never knew how beautiful he
was, when we could see him every day.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>They sing.</i>)</p>

<span class="i0">When there was light in my world<br /></span>

<p>That Minstrel sits so still and silent. I don't like it.</p>

<p>He looks ominous,&mdash;like the lowering autumn cloud.</p>

<p>Let us dismiss him.</p>

<p>No, no. It gives us heart, when he sits there.</p>

<p>Don't you see that there is no sign of fear in his face?</p>

<p>It seems as if some messages were striking his forehead. His body
appears to espy some one in the distance. There seem to be eyes
on the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>Simply by watching him, we can see that some one is coming
through the dark.</p>

<p>Look. He is standing up. He is turning towards the East, and
making his obeisance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet there is nothing to be seen, not even a streak of light.</p>

<p>Why not ask him what it is that he sees?</p>

<p>No, don't disturb him.</p>

<p>Do you know, it seems to me that the morning has dawned in him.</p>

<p>As if the ferry-boat of light had reached the shore of his
forehead.</p>

<p>His mind is still, like the morning sky.</p>

<p>The storm of birds' songs will burst out presently.</p>

<p>He is striking his lute. His heart is singing.</p>

<p>Hush. He is singing.</p>

<p>Chandra! Come!</p>

<p>Chandra! How could you leave us for so long?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Have you been able to capture the Old Man?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>Yes, I have.</p>

<p>But we don't see him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>He is coming.</p>

<p>But what did you see in the cave? Tell us.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>No, I cannot tell you.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>If my mind were a voice, then I could tell you.</p>

<p>But could you see him, whom you captured? Was he the Old Man of
the World?</p>

<p>The Old Man who would like to drink up the sea of youth in his
insatiable thirst.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Was it the One who is like the dark night, whose eyes are fixed
on his breast, whose feet are turned the wrong way round, who
walks backwards?</p>

<p>Was it the One who wears the garland of skulls, and lives in the
burning-ground of the dead?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>I do not know, I cannot say. But he is coming. You shall see him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Minstrel</i></p>

<p>Yes, I see him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Those who saw you from behind imagined you in all kinds of
shapes.</p>

<p>We didn't recognize you through the dust.</p>

<p>You seemed old.</p>

<p>And then you came out of the cave,&mdash;and now you look like a boy.</p>

<p>It seems just as if we had seen you for the first time.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Chandra</i></p>

<p>You are first every time. You are first over and over again.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Leader</i></p>

<p>And then you will be without any means.</p>

<p>We shall put a garland of jasmine round your neck.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
