<p class='c007'>The Spanish theatre has for so long been out of fashion
that a revived interest in it would carry us into a sort
of renaissance. It is not virgin soil, like the drama of
the north which has so lately caught the ear of Europe.
This, perhaps, accounts for its lack of distinctive originality.
For even in Echegaray's notable plays, strong
and original as they are, there is an unmistakable ring
of the past. We feel it is more a revival than a youthful
outburst, with all the promise of novelty. True, it
is dominated by the modern need and its restless
searching note; it must prove its mission as something
more than the mere desire to divert. Not even a
sermon could be more remote than this theatre from
the old comedy of manners, of loose morals and
diverting intrigue, all weighing as lightly on the
dramatist's conscience as on the audience's. And it
may be questioned if Echegaray, a professor of mathematics
as well as a dramatist and poet, could be induced
to accept Mr. Stevenson's well-known and not inappropriate
classification of the artist as of the family
of Daughters of Joy. His is no neutral voice between
vice and virtue, concerned solely for the pleasure or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>interest of the hour, suing approbation through laughter
and wit, or sympathy through dramatic tears. Lest his
audience should fail to carry their musings on the
problems of life to the theatre in the proper modern
spirit, he starts by pricking their conscience and
exciting thought that as little relieves them from the
pressure of reality as one of Ibsen's plays—though
with the latter his having nothing else in common
but this determined purpose.</p>

<hr class='c008' />

<p class='c001'>José Echegaray was born at Madrid in 1832. The
years of childhood were passed in Murcia, where at
the university he studied and took out his degrees.
His tendency in youth was towards the exact sciences,
with which he still coquets in the same spirit of pride
that pushed Goethe to glory in his devotion to painting.
He more readily offers to his friends a volume of his
<cite>Modern Theories of Physics</cite> or the <cite>Union of Material
Forces</cite> by which he is known to a select few, than one
of his popular dramas. Of the scientific value of these
works I am not in a position to offer any opinion.
For career, he chose that of engineer, and, we are told,
gave evidence in this line of quite exceptional diligence
and quickness. Certain it is that in this department as
well as in others that followed, he has amply proved
that in individual circumstances the Don may be
carried into a permanent frenzy of industry. In 1853
his studies in engineering terminated. Echegaray was
appointed successively to posts in various provinces,
until he returned to Madrid as professor of the School
of Engineers. Here he taught theoretical and applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>mathematics, and while building up a serious reputation
in science, he found time to study political
economy, and devour every form of literature, thus
preparing for his future honours as poet and dramatist.
He took part in the revolution of 1868, and was
appointed Director of Public Works and Minister of
Commerce. This post he resigned in 1872, and
shortly afterwards that of Minister of Finances, which
he was forced to give up on proclamation of the
Republic. Then he emigrated to Paris, where he
composed his first play <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>El Libro Talonario</cite></span>. In 1874
the political situation permitted his return to Spain,
and he was nominated Minister for the third time.
After that he began to hold himself more and more
aloof from public life, and took to writing for the
theatre with prodigious activity. Well advanced in
middle age, he seems to have taken Lope de Vega for
his model in the matter of production. Within twenty
years he has written more than fifty plays. In a letter
before me, he offers me a choice of his recent plays
(whose appearance can only cover a couple of years, I
believe), and thus names them off:—<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>El Critico Incipiente</cite></span>,
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Los Dos Fanatismos</cite></span>, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>El Haroldo</cite></span>, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>El Milagro en Egipto</cite></span>,
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Siempre en Ridiculo</cite></span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Sic vos non vobis</em></span>, etc. etc., the double
etc. suggesting at least half a dozen more, I suppose.</p>

<p class='c001'>This fatal facility is one of the drawbacks of Spanish
talent. The race writes without difficulty, which perhaps
is the reason that it writes without finish or
distinction. Add to which in adopting French romanticism,
upon which wave it was irresistibly carried, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>did but accommodate the adoption of the natural bent of
its own still mediæval nature. For modern Spanish
romanticism belongs more probably to the sixteenth than
to the nineteenth century. It is interesting to note
the rebound with which Victor Hugo's bell cast this
semi-civilised and dreaming people back into their own
appropriate century. They prate to-day in Madrid
glibly enough of English improvements, clubs, electricity,
French vaudevilles, and all the pernicious refinements
of our modern civilisation. But these elements
are extraneous, a sort of diverting masquerade in their
daily life. At heart they are purely mediæval. In all
the great moments on and off the stage, they forget the
silk hat and coat of civilisation, and walk and talk as if
a sword still absurdly cocked the cloak of romance.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this hour, when foreign Shakespeares are springing
up around us with incredible profusion, it would be an
agreeable task to come forward with a Spanish Shakespeare.
But Don José Echegaray is no such thing. He
bears no resemblance to the new geniuses hailed with
such delight. He has none of the subtlety of Maeterlinck,
and certainly offers entertainment by means of
tricks less reminiscent of our start in modern languages.
His literary baggage reveals neither the depth nor the
flashes of luminous thought with which Ibsen startles
us through an obscurity of atmosphere, a childish baldness,
and an unconventional disregard of all the old-fashioned
theories upon which the laws of dramatic
criticism have been formed. But if Echegaray is less
original, he is creditably more sane. The lack of depth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>carries with it a corresponding absence of crudeness and
of an artlessness often so bewildering as to leave us
imperfectly capable of distinguishing the extreme fineness
of the line between genius and insanity. The
lucid air of the south clarifies thought, and produces
nothing less sober than Latin bombast and the high-phrased
moods of the Don.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is more to be deplored in Echegaray's plays is
the absence of French art. An artist in the polished,
complete sense he cannot be described. He has none
of the French dramatist's incision, none of his delicate
irony, his playfulness and humorous depravity, none of
his beautiful clarity of expression, still less of his polish,
his wit, and consummate dexterity. Poetry is his
favourite form of dramatic expression, but it is not the
suave measured poetry of M. Richepin; and while he
often takes his inspiration from the Middle Ages, he
offers us nothing like the ethereal and fanciful verse
of M. Armand Silvestre, when that author condescends
to forget that he is <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fin de siècle</em></span>, and seeks to please
through the sweetness and delicacy of some mediæval
legend. Echegaray is poet enough to delight in these
thrilling ages. But his treatment of them generally
leaves us cold. It lacks fancy and buoyancy. Sombre
passion does not adequately fill the place of absent
humour. It is often thin and false, and glaringly artificial,
like the mediæval romance of an inefficient author.
It is a remarkable fact that such a play as <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Mar sin
Orillas</cite></span> (Shoreless Sea) should have achieved popularity
in a town so imitatively, not intellectually, modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>as Madrid. It has no originality whatever, and offers
nothing as compensation for dulness. It is of the Middle
Ages, but without the captivating atmosphere of those
plumed and belted centuries. It runs complacently
along the old dusty highroad; swords clash, knights
march off to glory and the Turkish wars, and beauty
at home struggles with parental enmity, is sore distraught
and belied, and while we are reminded in the
high tone of the ancient singers, that</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>we are confused by the stupidity of everybody.</p>

<p class='c001'>This repertory is extended, but can hardly be called varied.
The one note of undiluted drama runs through all, and
while the poet declaims upon a lofty level, it may be said
that he chiefly reaches poetry through means of the felicitous
vocables of the language he has the privilege to write,
rather than by reason of any real genius as a poet. He is
concerned more with striking situations than with development
or revelation of character. In this line he is totally
lacking in diversity and subtlety. He apprehends woman
in none other but the crude, mediæval form. To him she is
simply a personality of divine and inexhaustible love—an
exalted and inalterable ideal; and whether she wears
modern raiment or the garb of remote centuries, she is
never anything but a spiritualised stain-glass outline,
which affords gross and barbaric males—Velasquez' heroes
and high-toned villains—much opportunity to rant of
saints and angels, and is a subject for continuous worship,
ill-treatment, misunderstanding, and devotion to death.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>The very titles of these plays have a fine melodramatic
ring—<cite>The Avenger's Bride</cite>, <cite>On the Sword's Point</cite>, <cite>In
the Bosom of Death</cite>, and <cite>Death upon the Lips</cite>, etc. In
Spanish the titles are beautiful and inspiring enough to
justify choice. <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>En el Seno de la Muerte</cite></span> is a particularly
impressive play, which rings imagination back into the
thirteenth century almost upon a thrill with its strong
Hugoesque tinge of romance. There is no fluted fervour
of lovers, no thrum of lute or impassioned sequidilla to
enliven the roll of solemn wedded passion and betrayal.
Remorse and stern hidalgic resentment stalk the stage
grandiloquently to the blare of trumpets, royal entrances
and exits, and the hum of the Roussillon wars. We have
the inevitable struggle between love and duty, the inevitable
sombre judgment and full-dress sentiments of virtue.
Echegaray has apparently no understanding of vice except
as subject for castigation. The bastard Manfred, beloved
of his legitimate brother and seignor, loves his sister-in-law
Beatrix. Don Jaime, the injured husband, has all the
noble and melancholy charm of a Velasquez portrait, the
model upon which the dramatist would seem to have
drawn his unvarying study of the Middle Ages Don.
They all carry their black velvet and plumes with the same
high air, seem equally unacquainted with smiles and the
lighter emotions, and breathe the same unapproachable
perfection in domestic life. For each one the wife is
sovereign lady, and if they betray anger, it is the anger
of heroes who never forget that they are hidalgoes, and
who are incapable of falling, upon any provocation, into
triviality or pleasantry of speech. Small blame to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>ladies of such lords if they sometimes forget their oath of
allegiance, and occasionally decline upon lesser natures.
However picturesque, as housemates these Velasquez
gentlemen are beyond endurance, and deserve to perish
victims of their own relentless nobility.</p>

<p class='c001'>Don Jaime adored his wife and loved his half-brother.
Both in turn loved him, and recognised to the full his
claim upon their mutual admiration. But this was
naturally no impediment to their own frailty, though not
even Echegaray's sinners are for one moment permitted
to give a cheerful aspect to sin. It is perhaps a double
unwisdom to stoop to folly when they mean to be so persistently
miserable over it. Certain it is, that in this case
the lady's choice cannot have been prompted by any desire
for a lively change. Manfred is only a more scowling,
discontented edition of the legitimate Don. 'You are
sadder than ever, and your hand avoids the touch of mine,'
he complains to Beatrix in the beginning of the second
act. And she replies: 'I am ever sad. Sorrow is throned
within my bosom, and so imperious is its possession, that
death alone can free its slave.' And then when Manfred
prays for death as a mutual deliverance, she reproaches
him: 'Does my love not then suffice you? If so, live and
enjoy it, or confess that of our sin the vase only contains
the bitterness, the shame and the disenchantment.'</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Manfred.</span> Your love is but a lie, since I strain in my embrace
naught but a cold and inert marble statue. While your soul,
your mind, yourself—all that I most fondly love eludes the
touch of my lips, and my heart hears the disdainful murmur:
'This is not for the bastard.'</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span><span class='sc'>Beatrix.</span> 'Tis not so. You do not understand me.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Manfred.</span> Yes, I understand you. You have only loved
Jaime.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Beatrix.</span> So deeply have I loved you, Manfred, that I have forsaken
Jaime, noble as he is, for you who are so base. I have
given myself to you, drawn by the attraction of the abyss
which is your love. And I thought that I could live and be
happy under cover of my sin, but it may not be. For ever
between my breast and your arms he interposes.</p>

<p class='c013'>They try to persuade themselves upon insufficient
evidence that Jaime is dead, but Beatrix, the more nervous
and impressionable of the two, endures the conviction of
her senses that her husband lives as the added torture
of fear to insistent remorse. Every sound that disturbs
the silence, as they sit together by the fire, carries menace
of his approach. 'Why are we not happy since we love
one another?' Manfred bitterly cries, interrupting her
terrified listening. Here is the keynote of Echegaray's
philosophy, whether he marshals the dead centuries before
us, or treats of the modern conscience. Even in the less
complex ages, when the world was younger and fresher,
he will not hear of obedience to instinct unpunished before
even the fruit has had time to turn to ashes.</p>

<p class='c001'>We understand that we are commanded to contemplate
unrelieved gloom of sentiment and situation upon the
entrance of Don Jaime, back from the Roussillon wars in
company with Don Pedro, king of Aragon. The guilty
lovers have an enemy in one Juana, the duenna and wife
of Roger, the squire, who, discovering Beatrix and Manfred
in a passionate embrace, is set upon by the infuriated
bastard and inadvertently driven upon the sword's point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>into the family vault, where the door slams upon him with
a secret spring. When Manfred has excited the king's
anger by scornful rejection of the favour of a name and
title that shall give him equality with his brother, we
realise that the hour is a favourable one for Juana's
accusation. Whatever rights a sovereign may arrogate
to himself in the matter of his own morals, he is usually
a keen arbitrator of the limitations of those of his subjects.
On this principle, Don Pedro shows himself merciless to
the sinners, though one happens to be his hostess and the
other his host's much-loved brother. A rational man
would have preferred to blink and turn away, with the
safe conclusion that it was, after all, none of his business.
But monarchs are allowed so many other attributes,
that even out of Spain they may be fitly dispensed with
reason. In an interview with the culprits, when a saner
man would have been touched with the generous strife
between them as to which should bear the blame and
punishment, he decides that both shall die. Upon Manfred's
petition, he consents that Jaime shall live in ignorance
of his wrong, but the poor fool, for all his crown, was
not sufficiently master of events to contrive this rash
promise. Spanish history may furnish a precedent of such
a situation, but we are not taught that the lives of the
monarchs of the land explain it adequately. When Jaime
enters and remonstrates with Don Pedro:—'I am her owner,
sir. All your power, your crown, your greatness, the glory
of Sicily and of the entire world—what are they against
Beatrix! But smoke and dust,'—the king commutes her
sentence to perpetual imprisonment, and orders the execution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>of Manfred in Barcelona. Upon this Jaime threatens
to carry both away with him, forswear his king and
country, and cross the frontier. A violent quarrel ensues
between him and the king, and in the midst of recriminations,
Don Pedro casts his dishonour in the teeth of his
angry subject. The unfortunate nobleman, dazed and
incredulous, reads Roger's letter, given him by Don Pedro,
and falls into a spiritless despair. He asks his sovereign's
pardon, and they part reconciled friends. Left alone by
the family vault at night, he bursts into a sonorous soliloquy.
We remember a somewhat similar situation in Victor
Hugo, and are irritated by the reminiscence. There is a
natural note in his simple cry to Beatrix to speak to him
before she dies—to lie, feign, accuse him,—only speak.
Also in the speech to Manfred that follows, when he
recalls the time they were playmates together, and then
tells bitterly the roll of his wrongs: 'It were kinder to
kill me at once,' Manfred cries impetuously. By a curious
ineffectuality, a lack of skill, it however falls just short of
real pathos. Echegaray is never simple enough to reach
pathos. The climax has a false ring. Manfred dies by
his own hand, and, following his example, Jaime stabs
himself, and falls near him, in the shadow of the tomb.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>D. Jaime.</span> Manfred, too, lies dead, and you shortly will follow
us. When you die, where will you fall?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Beatrix.</span> By your side.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Jaime.</span> Then come closer—'tis no lie? Answer. [<i>Clasps
her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Beatrix.</span> No.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Jaime.</span> And where will your tears flow?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span><span class='sc'>Beatrix.</span> Over your body.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Jaime.</span> Then see. You must embrace my inert body. Do
not cease weeping—so that—thus we drop into the bosom of
death.</p>

<p class='c013'><cite>Death on his Lips</cite> takes us into quite another atmosphere.
We are in foreign lands, on the distant shore of
Lake Geneva, in the heart of the Calvinist Inquisition.
The Don is introduced, but only as an exile, in the person
of Miguel Servet, a famous Aragonese doctor who was
martyred at Geneva in 1553. The Calvinists are painted
in befitting blackness by a Spaniard, naturally glad of an
opportunity to show that other lands had their Inquisition
as well as Spain, and cruelty in those days was to be
found as fierce elsewhere. It is a gloomy, a powerful,
but not a very interesting play. Servet is well contrasted
with the Genevese, the heaviness of the one race being
dexterously made to appear so much less amiable and
well-mannered than that of the other. The heroine,
Margarita (naturally), is the usual heroine of Echegaray's
choice—all heart, devotion, generosity, sincerity, and a
certain broad intelligence. He may be trusted not to
choose a fool, though he may never aspire to striking
originality in his portrayal of what he evidently regards
as the angelic sex.</p>

<p class='c001'><cite>On the Sword's Point</cite> attains a higher level of dramatic
thought. Doña Violante is married to Don Rodrigo—the
inevitable Velasquez, in plumes and black velvet. In the
first bloom of youth, a titled blackguard had surprised
and dishonoured her, and Fernando, her son, is the
unsuspected offspring of this shame. He is a fine-spirited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>young fellow, more fiery and blusterous than the implacably
dignified Rodrigo. He loves, and is beloved by,
Laura, the ward of his parents. An unconscious vein
of humour runs through the pompous scene, in which he
is found by these latter on his knees before the girl. Don
Rodrigo is shocked at such indelicate boldness—just like
the amusing Marquis in <cite>The Sorcerer</cite>. 'They love each
other,' Doña Violante expostulates. 'It is necessary to
be severe with youth,' the Don replies, repressing his
indignation at the bidding of his wife. Then he proceeds
to point out to Fernando that henceforth Laura's honour
must be as dear to him as his own, and after an eulogy on
the virtue of the ladies of his house, he explains that if
the stain of dishonour dimmed the splendour of the name
of Moncada in a woman, it would be the duty of her
husband, father, or brother to kill her on the spot. This
is not lively talk for Doña Violante, but life was not a
lively matter for women in those dull days—especially in
Spain, where it still is the reverse of exciting for them.
The young man's ardent youth puzzles Don Rodrigo, it is
so unlike his own, and these perplexities are disturbed by
the titled blackguard's sudden claim to Laura's hand—whom
he describes as a mixture of Turkish houri and
Christian virgin. Thereupon ensues a painful scene
between the victim and the wrong-doer. The titled
blackguard shows himself susceptible of the feelings of a
gentleman, and deplores the sin of his rash youth—does
he also not wear black velvet and a plumed cap? However,
he has no mind to renounce his claim to Laura's
hand though Doña Violante kneel to him, and Fernando
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>swagger about with unsheathed steel. The duenna and the
squire (from whom a little humour might not unreasonably
be expected if it were possible to convict so serious a
philosopher as the author with anything like deliberate
pleasantry) contrive to muddle the carriage of Doña
Violante's passionate letter to her betrayer, speaking of
the fatal night with lamentable lucidity, so that it falls
into Fernando's hands, who instantly believes that Laura
is the injured woman. Some spirited scenes ensue, and
Fernando interrupts an interview in the dark as he
believes between Laura and his rival. A light reveals his
mother's shame, and when Don Rodrigo enters after
Laura he does not hesitate to sacrifice himself and the
beloved by letting it appear that it was Laura he discovered
at a clandestine meeting instead of his mother.
The result is that Laura is condemned by the relentless
Moncada to marry the titled blackguard, being now too
damaged an article for the son of his house. This is a
delicate dilemma for a youth with such traditions to live
up to: to have to choose between his mother's death and
dishonour and the dishonour and loss of his bride. His
birth is only revealed to him by Doña Violante to prevent
the sacrilegious duel between him and his father, and to
guard the dreadful secret Fernando stabs himself. 'My
death, mother, blots out your dishonour.' The third act
hurries on through many strong effects, and the young
man's death we feel to have the appropriate majesty of
the inevitable. The situation is so poignant that there
could be no other solution, and even the titled blackguard
wins our sympathy in that last tragic scene.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>The same gloom and power pervade <cite>The Avenger's
Bride</cite>, the old story of Montague and Capulet. But here
the young Montague, one Don Carlos, slays the traditional
family enemy, who happens to be the father of a weak-sighted
maiden. She emerges into the strong sunlight
just in time to recognise her father's assassin, and then is
struck blind. Don Carlos woos her under another name,
and an old lover, who is an enlightened oculist of the
Middle Ages, restores her sight. Her lover Lorenzo had
promised to kill the man she should name her father's
murderer. When she cries out, 'Don Carlos,' he keeps
his word, and she falls upon his corpse 'the avenger's
bride.'</p>

<p class='c001'>What touches us more closely is Echegaray's manipulation
of the modern conscience, and its illimitable
scope for reflection, for conflict, and the many-sided
drama of temptation. This is familiar ground, and we
are ever pleased to welcome a new combatant. That
the Spanish dramatist brings a novel note may be
accepted after reading the curious prologue to his <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Gran
Galeoto</cite></span>. It is the best and most popular of Echegaray's
plays. In its printed form it is dedicated to <em>Everybody</em>,
which is the crowning insistance on the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>motif</em></span> of the
prologue, and there is an introduction by Señor Ignacio
José Escobar from which I copy an interesting statement.</p>

<p class='c001'>'And then came that unforgettable night the 19th
March 1881, the night of the first representation of <em>The
Great Galeoto</em>. There was neither strife nor contradiction,
nothing but a universal concert of congratulation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>praise, and applause. Here your treatment of a great
social problem had the good fortune to run on lines
that in all eyes seemed elevated and humane. What
a splendid and legitimate satisfaction for those among
us who had hesitated to share the general opinion!'</p>

<p class='c001'>The <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Epoca</cite></span> wrote next day:—'Don José Echegaray
has obtained an indisputable, an unanimous triumph.
He has treated a great social question in a masterly
manner. The great Galeoto felt the rod of shame upon
its cheek, but it applauded without a single exception.
The social vice exists, we know, and that vice was
whipped with all the vigorous energy of a Greek tragedy.
Everybody recognised the truth of the picture, though
none cared to accept it as personal: but the social
moral avenged by the creative genius of Señor Echegaray
owes him a reward and satisfaction, and that
reward and that satisfaction will be the union of all
classes, those who may have once in a way formed part
of the great Galeoto, and those who habitually protest
against the facile habit of slander—to show their gratitude
to the poet, the one for vengeance, and the other
for the lesson received.</p>

<p class='c001'>'A subscription not to exceed twenty reals (four
shillings), which will be devoted to some work of art,
will recall to Señor Echegaray while he lives that he may
obtain triumphs as great as last night's, seeking his
inspiration in the true sentiment of art.'</p>

<p class='c001'>To the extraordinary and self-conscious prelude of <cite>The
Great Galeoto</cite> which lifts a play quite out of the region of
diversion, and, as the sensible Don Julian remarks, plunges
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>us into philosophy, the written, not acted, prologue to
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>El Hijo de Don Juan</cite></span> (Don Juan's Son) may be added
as an excellent interpretation of Echegaray's personality,
revealed already with passable clearness in the dramatic
prologue quoted. He enumerates the conclusions of the
critics. That the play was inspired by Ibsen's celebrated
<cite>Ghosts</cite>. That the passions it deals with are more
appropriate to Northern climes than to the South. That
it treats of the problem of hereditary madness. That it
discusses the law of heredity. That it is gloomy and
lugubrious, with no other object than that of inspiring
horror. That it is a purely pathological drama. That it
contains nothing but the process of madness. That from
the moment it is understood that Lázaro will go mad, all
interest in the work ceases, and there remains nothing but
to follow step by step the shipwreck of enfeebled intelligence.
And so on. Echegaray regards all this as the
lamentable exercise of dramatic criticism. The underlying
thought of his work is different, but he declines to enter
into further explanation of it, each scene and each phrase
sufficiently explaining it already. To touch more closely
upon the matter would be perilous. Besides, he adds, it is
not his habit to defend his plays. Once written, he casts
them to their fate, without material or moral defence, and
the critics are free to tear themselves to pieces over them.
There is one phrase alone that he defends energetically,
because it is borrowed from Ibsen, and appears to him of
singular beauty: 'Mother, give me the sun.' This he
describes in his prologue as 'simple, infantile, half comical,
but enfolding a world of ideas, an ocean of feeling, a hell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>of sorrows, a cruel lesson, the supreme watchword of society—of
the family.' He continues, quite in the modern
spirit:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>'A generation consumed by vice, which carries in its marrow the
venom of impure love, in whose corrupted blood the red globules
are mixed with putrid matter, must ever fall by degrees into the
abysm of idiocy. Lázaro's cry is the last glimmer of a reason
dropping into the eternal darkness of imbecility. At that very
hour Nature awakes, and the sun rises; it is another twilight that
will soon be all light.</p>

<p class='c001'>'Both twilights meet, cross, salute in recognition of eternal
farewell, at the end of the drama. Reason, departing, is held in
the grip of corrupting pleasure. The sun, rising, with its immortal
call, is pushed forward by the sublime force of Nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>'Down with human reason, at the point of extinction: hail to
the sun that starts another day! 'Give me the sun,' Lázaro cries
to his mother. Don Juan also begs it through the tresses of the
girl of Tarifa.</p>

<p class='c001'>'On this subject there is much to be said; it provokes much
reflection. If indeed our society—but what the deuce am I
doing with philosophy? Let each one solve the problem as best
he can, and ask for the sun, the horns of the moon, or whatever
takes his fancy. And if nobody is interested in the matter, it
only proves that the modern Don Juan has engendered many
children without Lázaro's talent.</p>

<p class='c001'>'Respectful salutations to the children of Don Juan.'</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>From all this it will be understood that Echegaray
presses into the service of pleasure the desperate problems
of our natural history, and instead of laughter confronts us
with mournful gravity; asks us to stand aghast at inherited
injustice, and to doubt with him the wisdom of Providence
at sight of such undiminished and idle wickedness in man,
and such an accumulation of unmerited suffering. Now-a-days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>we are inordinately engrossed by such issues, and
life weighs more heavily upon our shoulders than it did
upon our fathers. The good old spirit of fun is fast being
trodden out of us by the pervading sense of a mission, and
the laborious duty of converting somebody to something.
We no longer go to the theatre to weep over fictitious
wrongs and smile at imaginary joys. We go to study
what we are pleased to call life; to sip at the founts of
philosophy, to hear a sermon. It is not exhilarating, but
we thankfully take the draught of wisdom offered us, and
go our ways without a murmur that we have been depressed
rather than entertained. Cervantes, with old-fashioned
sanity of judgment, condemned the practice of preaching
sermons through the veil of fiction. What sort of reflection
would the pathological novel and drama inspire in so wise
and witty an author? He might be led to create a type
of character even more mad than the Knight Errant.</p>

<p class='c001'><span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>El Hijo de Don Juan</cite></span> (Don Juan's Son) is an infinitely
crueller and more disagreeable play than <cite>Ghosts</cite> because
it is more lucid, more direct. The characters themselves
are more carefully drawn, and we have a closer actual
acquaintance with them. Here there is not one victim
only, but two. Don Juan, the middle-aged <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>roué</em></span>, has a friend,
also a middle-aged <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>roué</em></span>. The daughter of his friend,
Carmen, is consumptive, and is betrothed to his son,
Lázaro, who is subject to vertigo. The play opens with
three elderly <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>roués</em></span>, all ill-preserved after a life of scandal,
holding converse the reverse of edifying over tobacco and
alcohol. Here Echegaray shows how little he means to
mince matters by the remarks he puts into the mouth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>one of them in reply to Don Juan's boast that the genius of
his son is inherited from him. Paternal inheritance would
be nothing but rheum or neurosis—'the sediment of
pleasure and the residuum of alcohol.' Upon this Don
Juan launches into poetry and describes the single moment
in which his soul soared above material enjoyments and
sighed for the glorious and impossible. It was after an
orgy, and as his half-closed eyes saw the sun rise over the
Guadalquivir through the silky waves of a girl's hair, he
understood the beauty of poetry and Nature, and stretched
out a hand to clutch the splendid orb. This desire is afterwards
recalled to him in a moment of surprising horror,
when his brilliant and beloved son, sinking into imbecility,
sees the rising sun, and cries: 'How lovely! Mother, give
me the sun.' 'And I also wanted it once,' Don Juan
exclaims: 'My God! my son! Lázaro!'</p>

<p class='c001'>Don Juan, as might be inferred from his name, carries
on intrigues with ballet-girls and servant-maids under the
nose of his wife and son. Lázaro seems blind enough to
parental delinquencies. Not, as he explains himself when
complaining of broken health, that he has been a saint
because he has eschewed excesses. The scene where he
first appears ailing and stupid is singularly painful, above
all, towards the end, when, after an outburst of lucid
eloquence, he falls drowsily upon the sofa, and feeling sleep
upon him, begs that Carmen, his betrothed, should not be
permitted to see him in a ridiculous attitude.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Xavier.</span> Unless you are as beautiful as Endymion she shall not
enter. [<i>Pause. Xavier walks about; Lázaro begins to sleep.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> Xavier, Xavier!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span><span class='sc'>Xavier.</span> What?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> Now I am—half asleep—how do I look?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Xavier.</span> Very poetical.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> Good. Thanks—very poetical. [<i>Dreamily.</i>]</p>

<p class='c013'>The second act is somewhat livelier, and contains more
spirited contrasts. That Echegaray could excel in lighter
comedy may be seen in an amusing scene between the
serious son and the dissipated, good-natured father.</p>

<p class='c001'>Don Juan is alone with his son, who is walking restlessly
about. The father asks his son what he is thinking of,
and then apologises for disturbing weighty thought.
Lázaro listlessly replies that his imagination was wandering,
and he wandering after it. When he has received
many assurances of not being in the poet's way, Don Juan
calls for sherry, the Parisian newspapers, and <cite>Nana</cite>.
Caught laughing over <cite>Nana</cite>, he asserts his horror of
immoral books, and his conviction that literature is going
to the dogs.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> Zola is a great writer. Ah, I've caught the idea I was
seeking. [<i>Sits down to write.</i>]</p>

<p class='c013'>There is here a little humorous by-play between the
servant and Don Juan, and afterwards a reference to the
lugubrious theme in converse between her and Lázaro,
whose listlessness, courtesy and musing, make an admirable
relief against the alert and fussy affection and frivolity
of his father.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> Ha, ha! witty, exceedingly witty. Full of salt; hot
as red pepper. <cite>Gil Blas</cite> is the only paper worth reading.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> An interesting article? What is it about? Let me see.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> [<i>Hastily ramming the paper into his pocket.</i>] A dull
and shocking article. I must take it away, for the mischief
would be in it if it fell into Carmen's hands.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> You are quite right. [<i>Beginning to walk again.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> I hadn't finished it. I must finish it later.
[<i>Takes up 'Nana.'</i>] Stupendous! Monumental enough to
make one die of laughing. Lord! why do we read but
for amusement's sake? Then give us diverting books.
[<i>Laughing.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> Is it a witty book?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> [<i>In altered voice.</i>] Perhaps. But this light literature
soon wearies. [<i>Seeing Lázaro approach, he hides 'Nana' in
another pocket.</i>] Have you anything substantial to read—really
substantial?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> [<i>Looking through his books.</i>] Do you like Kant?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> Kant? Do you say Kant? The very thing. He
was always my favourite author. When I was young I fell
asleep every night over Kant. [<i>Aside.</i>] Who the deuce
is he?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> If you like I will—— [<i>Looking for a passage.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> No, my son. Any part will do, if it can be read in
divisions. Let me see. Don't trouble about me. Write,
my son, write. [<i>Lázaro begins to write, and Don Juan reads.</i>]
'Beneath the aspect of relation, third moment of taste, the
beautiful appears to us the final form of an object, without
semblance to finality.' The Devil! [<i>Holding book away and
contemplating it in terror.</i>] The devil! 'Or as a finality
without end.' There are people who understand this! 'Since
it is called the final form to the causality of any conception
with relation to the object.' Let me see [<i>holding book still
further off</i>]; 'final form to the causality.' 'Pon my word, I'm
perspiring. [<i>Wipes his forehead.</i>] 'Conscience is this finality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>without end, is the play of the cognitive forces.' What!
'The play of cognitive ... the play' ... If it were
play I should understand it. 'Conscience of this internal
causality is what constitutes æsthetic pleasure.' If I continue I
shall have congestion. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph! Only think
that Lázaro understands the finality without end, the causality
and the play of the cognitive forces. Heavens! what a
fellow! [<i>Reads again.</i>] 'The principle of the methodical
conformity of nature is the transcendental principle of the
strength of judgment.' [<i>Strikes the table.</i>] I should lose
myself if I read more. But what a fellow, who can read
such stuff and keep sane!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> Does it interest you?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> Immensely. What depth! [<i>Aside.</i>] I am five
minutes falling into it and haven't yet reached the bottom. I
should think it did interest me indeed. But, frankly, I
prefer——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> Hegel?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> Just so (<em>Nana</em>).</p>

<p class='c013'>After talk of Lázaro's health and engagement, Don
Juan, learning that the young man is pensive or preoccupied,
solely because he is projecting a drama, says he
will leave him to thought. Glancing into Kant, he
mutters, 'The—the—cognitive forces—the—the—finality,—yes,
the finality.' 'Work, my son, work. Above all,
write nothing immoral.' He drinks off a glass of sherry,
and regretfully remarks that this finality has an end; then
marches away with the bottle, <cite>Gil Blas</cite>, and <cite>Nana</cite> to
study in solitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the sole touch of comedy in a play of ever
increasing gloom, pervaded by the stupor of the hero and
the cough of the heroine. 'My father loves me dearly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>Carmen remarks to Dolores, Don Juan's embittered
wife. 'Then he ought to have given you stronger lungs,'
the elder woman retorts, with shocking directness. It is
indeed, as Echegaray complains the critics assert, a pathological
drama. When his friends are not discussing the
symptoms of Lázaro's strange malady, he himself is
enumerating them in merciless monologues. He talks of
his greatness, of his fame, of the popularity of his works,
and then falls into childish drivel and longs for playthings.
'His head is not firm,' says Don Nemesis to Carmen's
father, in dubiety before the prospect of the marriage;
'that is why he is so stupendous at times, and all the world
calls him a genius. Put no trust in geniuses, Timotheus.
A genius may walk down one street, and hear the people
cry, "The genius!" Let him round the corner into
another street, and he will hear the street arab shout after
him, "The lunatic!" Much talent is decidedly a dangerous
thing.' 'God defend us from it!' piously exclaims the
elderly <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>roué</em></span>. 'I have always been very careful not to
cultivate it.'</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be difficult to conceive a more needlessly disagreeable
scene than the interview between the celebrated
brain doctor and Lázaro, who, the night before, has been
consulted by Dolores on behalf of a nephew, and
innocently, but with terrible frankness, discusses the case
with the unfortunate victim himself. 'We cannot with impunity
corrupt the sources of life,' says Doctor Bermúdez,
in the high scientific manner, without noticing the increasing
emotion of his companion; 'the son of such a father
must soon fall into madness or idiocy.' 'Ah! No!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>What? My father! I—It is a lie!' Lázaro burst out, in
frantic horror. When the poor mother enters the scene
and brings her maternal note of despair to the son's
distracted terror, we feel that the modern drama has
reached a pitch of tragedy unapprehended in healthier and
more barbaric ages. 'Lose one's brains as one might lose
a hat!' exclaims Don Juan when enlightened. 'Bah!
idiots are born so.... but a man of genius! ... Lázaro,
who understands <em>the finality without end</em> as he knows the
<em>Paternoster</em>!'</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Dolores.</span> [<i>Despairingly.</i>] But if it were true? If it were true?
And then? Oh! why was I born? [<i>Approaching Don Juan who
retreats.</i>] Through you have I lost my illusions, stained my
youth, debased my life, forfeited my dignity—through you! And
after twenty years of sacrifices, to be worthy of Lázaro! ...
good for his sake, loyal for him, resigned for him, honourable
for him, and to-day! ... No, you have always been a
scoundrel; but for once you must be right. Impossible!
impossible! God could not will it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> Good, I have always been a scoundrel. What more?
But don't remember it now; above all, don't say it. Say that
you forgive me. Forgive me, Dolores.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dolores.</span> What does it matter?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> It matters to us both. If you should not forgive me,
and if God should remember to punish me, and punish me
through my Lázaro!</p>

<p class='c013'>Pitiful is the poor mother's wavering between softness
and bitterness. At one moment she pardons him with all
her heart, or only bargains that he shall help her to save
their boy. And then when he vows to do so with his
whole soul and the remainder of his life, she retorts cruelly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>'With what life you have left; what Heaven, in its mercy,
still grants you.' 'Dolores!' the poor wretch exclaims,
and again she softens: 'It is true; I had forgiven you.'
Upon this the elderly scapegoat brightens and mentions
Paris, Germany, England—'the English know so much.
Bah! there is a good deal of science scattered over the
world.' 'Then let us gather it all for Lázaro.'</p>

<p class='c001'>This desperate situation is relieved by the entrance of
Carmen's father in the black of etiquette, strictly solemn
as befits a Spanish father offering his daughter in marriage
to his old chum. He says reprovingly: 'Do not embrace
me. Don't you see that I am all in black—in the garb of
etiquette? It is a very solemn occasion. Call everybody
except Lázaro—him later. Solemnity above all.' The
afflicted parents have decided to conceal Lázaro's calamity
from the world, and make a heart-broken effort to welcome
the betrothal with delight, and the gloom of the situation
is deepened by the young man's miserable behaviour when
called to his beloved.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> Carmen! Mine, mine! I may take her, clasp her in
my arms! inflame her with my breath! drink her with my
eyes! I may if I like!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Juan.</span> Yes, yes, but enough.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> What infamy! What treason! Carmen!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Carmen.</span> [<i>Running to him.</i>] Lázaro!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Lázaro.</span> Go, away! Why do you come to me? You cannot be
mine. Never, never, never.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Carmen.</span> Do you give me up? Ah, I have already felt it.
Mother! [<i>Takes refuge in his mother's arms.</i>]</p>

<p class='c013'>Nobody understands. Carmen's father is indignant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>Lázaro's confidential friend asks if he has gone mad, and
Lázaro, bewildered, turns despairingly to Don Juan:
'Father, father. You are my father. Save me.' 'With
my life, my son.' 'You gave me life, but it is not enough.
Give me life to live, to love, to be happy. Give me life
for Carmen's sake. Give me more life, or cursed be that
which you have given me.'</p>

<p class='c001'>The third act is rendered more sombre if possible from
the shabby chatter and airs of aged rake on the part of
Carmen's father, with which it starts. We are introduced
to the Tarifa girl, Don Juan's old mistress, now pensioned
and respectably established on his estate on the banks of
the Guadalquivir. Deeper and deeper are we forced to
wade through unrelenting shadow. Now it is the frivolous
Don Timoteo, sipping his manzanilla, and sneering at the
young generation as personated by his daughter Carmen,
Lázaro, and Lázaro's friend, the girl with her affected
lungs, Lázaro with his dementia, and his friend formal and
headachy. 'Ah, in my day we were other,' he sighs.
'Perhaps,' retorts the friend, 'it is because you were—<em>other</em>
then that we are so now.' Then it is Lázaro, rough, distrustful,
and sly, completely altered, afraid to sleep because
he does not know how it might be upon his awakening or
if he should ever awake, with swift leaps from childish
drivel into the Don's plumed phrases, forgetful of modern
raiment, and swaggering through imagery and sonorous
syllables as if a sword clanked by his side and he carried
the spurs of chivalry. And then the poor victim falls to
drinking with his father's old mistress, and when half-drunk
and wholly mad, plots with her to carry off Carmen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>When she cries out that 'farewell' means tears, he
exclaims inconsequently: 'Then you, too, will cry. We
will all cry ... Laughing fatigues, crying rests.'</p>

<p class='c001'>Quite gay and reckless, he faces Carmen to propose
elopement to her. He laments the former coldness of
his words and moods, the insufficiency of the vulgar
tongue to express passion so burning and impetuous as
his, and terrifies her by his wild and flowery volubility.
There is night all around him except for the ray of
intense light that encircles her face. On that he concentrates
all that remains to him of life, of manhood, of
feeling, thought and love. He descends from this into
weak complaining. Her happiness is threatened by
inimical conspiracies, and yet how is he to defend her?
He fancies he is in a desert full of sand, plagued with
unquenchable thirst and menaced by a falling heaven.
He mixes up in the dreariest way the sands of the desert
and the old applause that greeted his genius, wonders if
either will have an end, then doubts the end of anything,
and implores Carmen to save him. 'Help me. Look
at me, speak, laugh, cry, do something, Carmen, to keep
me from wandering into the desert.' But already his
look is vague, and he has ceased to see her. In vain
she cries to him that she is near, weeps over him, holds
him to her. 'I am Carmen, look at me. The little head
you were wont to love so is close to your lips. I am
smiling at you. Laugh, Lázaro, answer me. Wake up!
Surely you hear me, you see me!' When his mother
comes in response to the girl's agonised cry, a glimmer
of intelligence gives a sort of dignity to his incoherent
words. He wants his mother to console him, for he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>to say 'a long, a sad, and solemn farewell to Carmen.'
The girl protests she will not leave him, when he irritably
orders her away—a great way off. He loved her much,
but now it is adieu eternally. He only wishes now to be
alone with his parents, until memory suddenly carries
him back into the time of quarrel, reproaches, and
jealousies of those two in his childhood. 'Don't contradict
me, father; you used to quarrel and make me afraid.'
He passionately orders him away, too, with Carmen, and
turns for comfort to his mother. Then he remembers
his school troubles, how his mother coldly parted with
him, and to guard against complete loneliness, calls for
Paca, his father's old mistress. 'Come, I am young and
wish to live,' he cries, and when we find Don Juan
aroused to indignation and threatening to fling the
Tarifa girl over the balcony into the river if she does
not instantly retire, we are ready to hail the mercifulness
of Ibsen. This is to carry a sermon to an intolerable
length, and drive us so out of love with both philosophy
and science as to paint unreason with a double allurement.
A father kneeling to his mad son to let an old
mistress go, and the son, struggling out of the gathering
torpor of intelligence to stare at the rising sun:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>'Mother, how lovely!'</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>sobs Don Juan.</p>
<p class='c016'>'For ever!'</p>
<p class='c015'>is the last lugubrious note of Dr. Bermúdez.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>It is a relief to turn from this ghastly tragedy to the
brighter movement of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>El Gran Galeoto</cite></span>. My printed
copy of this play shows it to have run to the twentieth
edition, which, for an unreading land like Spain, is an
enormous sale. Bright is perhaps a misleading term, for
the whole is tinged with the profound melancholy that
strikes us in the Spanish gaze, in its character and in the
tristful note of its popular songs and dances. The
English are supposed to take their pleasures sadly. The
saying were more appropriate to the rather dreary race
beyond the Pyrenees. Whatever may be their preoccupation
(generally speaking it is dulness or an empty
mind they are afflicted with rather than sadness) they
give the foreigner the impression of being the wholesale
victims of a shattered organ which we have the habit of
associating with the affections.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these two dramas—<cite>Don Juan's Son</cite> and <cite>The
Great Galeoto</cite>—enough will be understood of the passion
of gravity with which the Spanish dramatist enters into the
obscurer and less picturesque tragedies of life. Love with
him is not the sentimental sighing of maids and boys, as
he again shows in <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Lo Sublime en lo Vulgar</cite></span>, but the
great perplexed question of married infelicity and misunderstanding.
Don Julian dies broken-hearted and wilfully
deceived, and his deception it is that forges the
tempered happiness of his rival. In <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Lo Sublime en lo
Vulgar</cite></span> we have two diverse husbands: Richard, an airy
social success, full of elegant phrases, befittingly tailored,
and of manners the best—the sort of man destined to
float to the surface in all circumstances, and minuet with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>grace round the ugliest corner. Bernard, whom he betrays
and laughs at, is the commonplace, scarce presentable
husband, married by a refined and poetical creature for his
money, and blushed for by her at every moment while she
is solacing herself with the elegant improprieties of her
friend's husband, Richard. Here we have another picture
of marital jealousy, justifiable in this case, and perhaps for
that reason more merciful. Instead of turning from his
faithless wife, the insignificant and vulgar Bernard wins
her to him and to atonement by an unpretentious magnanimity,
and the play ends hopefully with Richard's cry to
his wife: 'Louisa, pardon!—and forget!' And Bernard,
turning to Inez, his wife, explains his generosity in sonorous
verse: 'Honour goes from the soul into the depth,
and in the world I put no trust. Since my honour is my
own, I understand it infinitely better than the world.'</p>

<p class='c001'>Not even Tolstoi, with all that delicacy and keenness of
the Russian conscience, that profound seriousness, which
move us so variously in his great books, has a nobler consciousness
of the dignity of suffering and virtue than this
Spanish dramatist. And not less capable is he of a jesting
survey of life. Echegaray writes in no fever of passion,
and wastes no talent on the niceties of art. The morality
and discontent that float from the meditative North have
reached him in his home of sunshine and easy emotions,
and his work is pervaded nobly by its spirit. And unlike
Ibsen, he illuminates thought with sane and connected
action. Discontent never leads him to the verge of extravagance.
Extravagance he conceives to be a part of
youth, addicted to bombast and wild words. Man trades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvi'>xxxvi</span>in other material than romantic language and rhodomontade.
Hence he brings emphasis and plain speech to bear
upon him when youth has had its fill through the long-winded,
high coloured phrases of his scribbling heroes.
Thought, perhaps, travels too persistently along the
shadowed paths, and we should be thankful to find our
world reflected through his strong glass, dappled with a
little of the uncertain but lovely sunshine that plays not
the least part in the April weather of our life here.</p>

<p class='c001'>The note of unwavering sadness depresses. But, at
least, it is not ignoble, and he conceives it borne with so
much resignation and dignity that if the picture carries
with it the colours of frailty, it brings a counterbalancing
conception of the inherent greatness of man.</p>

<h3 class='c019'><span class='large'>PROLOGUE</span></h3>

<p class='c011'><em>A study; to the left a balcony, on right a door; in the
middle a table strewn with papers and books, and a lighted
lamp upon it. Towards the right a sofa. Night.</em></p>
<h4 class='c020'>SCENE I</h4>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Seated at table and preparing to write.</i>] Nothing—impossible!
It is striving with the impossible.
The idea is there; my head is fevered with it; I feel it.
At moments an inward light illuminates it, and I see it.
I see it in its floating form, vaguely outlined, and
suddenly a secret voice seems to animate it, and I hear
sounds of sorrow, sonorous sighs, shouts of sardonic
laughter ... a whole world of passions alive and
struggling.... They burst forth from me, extend
around me, and the air is full of them. Then, then
I say to myself: ''Tis now the moment.' I take up my
pen, stare into space, listen attentively, restraining my
very heart-beats, and bend over the paper.... Ah,
but the irony of impotency! The outlines become
blurred, the vision fades, the cries and sighs faint away
... and nothingness, nothingness encircles me....
The monotony of empty space, of inert thought, of
dreamy lassitude! and more than all the monotony of
an idle pen and lifeless paper that lacks the life of
thought! Ah! How varied are the shapes of nothingness,
and how, in its dark and silent way, it mocks
creatures of my stamp! So many, many forms! Canvas
without colour, bits of marble without shape, confused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>noise of chaotic vibrations. But nothing more
irritating, more insolent, meaner than this insolent pen
of mine [<i>throws it away</i>], nothing worse than this white
sheet of paper. Oh, if I cannot fill it, at least I may
destroy it—vile accomplice of my ambition and my
eternal humiliation. Thus, thus ... smaller and still
smaller. [<i>Tears up paper. Pauses.</i>] And then! How
lucky that nobody saw me! For in truth such fury is
absurd and unjust. No, I will not yield. I will think
and think, until either I have conquered or am crushed.
No, I will not give up. Let me see, let me see ... if
in that way——</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE II</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><em>Ernest. Don Julian on the right, in evening-dress,</em></div>
    <div><em>with overcoat upon his arm.</em></div>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>At the door, without entering.</i>] I say, Ernest!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Don Julian!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Still working? Do I disturb you?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Rising.</i>] Disturb me! What a question, Don
Julian! Come in, come in. And Teodora?</p>
<div class='c021'>[<i>Don Julian enters.</i>]</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> We have just come from the Opera. She has
gone upstairs with my brother, to see something or
other that Mercedes has bought, and I was on my way
to my room when I saw your light, so I stopped to say
good-night.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Was there a good house?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> As usual. All our friends inquired after you.
They wondered you were not there too.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> That was kind of them.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Not more than you deserve. And how have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>you improved the shining hours of solitude and inspiration!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Solitude, yes; inspiration, no. It shuns me
though I call on it never so humbly and fondly.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> It has failed at the rendezvous?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> And not for the first time, either. But if I have
done nothing else, at least I have made a happy discovery.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> What?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> That I am a poor devil.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> The deuce! That's a famous discovery.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Nothing less.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> But why are you so out of sorts with yourself?
Is the play you talked of the other day not going on?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> How can it? The going on is done by me
going out of my wits.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> How is this? Both the drama and inspiration
are faithless to my poor friend.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> This is how I stand. When I first conceived
the idea, I imagined it full of promise, but when I
attempt to give it form, and vest it in an appropriate
stage garb, the result shows something extraordinary,
difficult, undramatic and impossible.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> How is it impossible? Come, tell me. You've
excited my curiosity. [<i>Sits down on the sofa.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Imagine the principal personage, one who creates
the drama and develops it, who gives it life and provokes
the catastrophe, who, broadly, fills and possesses it, and
yet who cannot make his way to the stage.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Is he so ugly, then? So repugnant or bad?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Not so. Bad as you or I may be—not worse.
Neither good nor bad, and truly not repugnant. I am
not such a cynic—neither a misanthrope, nor one so out
of love with life as to fall into such unfairness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> What, then, is the reason?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> The reason, Don Julian, is that there is no
material room in the Scenario for this personage.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Holy Virgin! What do you mean? Is it by
chance a mythological drama with Titans in it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Titans, yes, but in the modern sense of the word.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> That is to say——?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> That is to say, this person is ... <em>everybody</em>.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> <em>Everybody!</em> You are right. There is no room
for everybody on the stage. It is an incontrovertible
truth that has more than once been demonstrated.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Then you agree with me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Not entirely. Everybody may be condensed
in a few types and characters. This is matter beyond
my depth, but I have always understood that the
masters have more than once accomplished it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Yes, but in my case it is to condemn me, not to
write my drama.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Why?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> For many reasons it would be difficult to
explain,—above all, at this late hour.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Never mind. Give me a few.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Look! Each individual of this entire mass, each
head of this monster of a thousand heads, of this Titan
of the century, whom I call <em>everybody</em>, takes part in my
play for a flying moment, to utter but one word, fling a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>single glance. Perhaps his action in the tale consists of
a smile, he appears but to vanish. Listless and absent-minded,
he acts without passion, without anger, without
guile, often for mere distraction's sake.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> What then?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> These light words, these fugitive glances, these
indifferent smiles, all these evanescent sounds and this
trivial evil, which may be called the insignificant rays of
the dramatic light, condensed to one focus, to one group,
result in conflagration or explosion, in strife and in
victims. If I represent the whole by a few types or
symbolical personages, I bestow upon each one that
which is really dispersed among many, and such a result
distorts my idea. I must bring types on the stage
whose guile repels and is the less natural because evil in
them has no object. This exposes me to a worse consequence,
to the accusation of meaning to paint a cruel,
corrupted, and debased society, when my sole pretention
is to prove that not even the most insignificant actions
are in themselves insignificant or lost for good or evil.
For, concentrated by the mysterious influences of
modern life, they may reach to immense effects.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Say no more, my friend. All this is metaphysics.
A glimmer of light, perhaps, but through an
infinitude of cloud. However, you understand these
things better than I do. Letters of exchange, shares,
stock, and discount, now—that's another matter.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No, no; you've common sense, and that's the
chief thing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> You flatter me, Ernest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> But you follow me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Not in the least. There ought to be a way
out of the difficulty.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> If that were all!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> What! More?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Tell me what is the great dramatic spring?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> My dear fellow, I don't exactly know what
you mean by a dramatic spring. All I can tell you is
that I have not the slightest interest in plays where love
does not preponderate—above all unfortunate love, for
I have enough of happy love at home.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Good, very good! Then in my play there can
be little or no love.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> So much the worse. Though I know nothing
of your play, I suspect it will interest nobody.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> So I have been telling you. Nevertheless, it is
possible to put in a little love,—and jealousy too.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Ah, then, with an interesting intrigue skilfully
developed, and some effective situations——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No, nothing of the sort. It will be all simple,
ordinary, almost vulgar ... so that the drama will not
have any external action. The drama evolves within
the personages: it advances slowly: to-day takes hold
of a thought, to-morrow of a heart-beat, little by little,
undermines the will.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> But who understands all this? How are
these interior ravages manifested? Who recounts
them to the audience? In what way are they evident?
Must we spend a whole evening hunting for a glance, a
sigh, a gesture, a single word? My dear boy, this is not
amusement. To cast us into such depths is to hurl us
upon philosophy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> You but echo my own thought.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> I have no wish to discourage you. You best
know what you are about—there. Though the play
seems rather colourless, heavy, uninteresting, perhaps if
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>dénoûment</em></span> is sensational—and the explosion—eh?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Sensation! Explosion! Hardly, and that only
just upon the fall of the curtain.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Which means that the play begins when the
curtain falls?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I am inclined to admit it. But I will endeavour
to give it a little warmth.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> My dear lad, what you have to do is to
write the <em>second</em> play, the one that begins where the
first ends. For the other, according to your description,
would be difficult to write, and is not worth the trouble.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> 'Tis the conclusion I have come to myself.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Then we agree, thanks to your skill and
logic. And what is the name?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> That's another difficulty. I can find none.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> What do you say? No name either?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No, unless, as Don Hermogenes<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c006'><sup>[2]</sup></a> says, we could
put it into Greek for greater clarity.</p>

</div>
<hr class='c008' />
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Of a surety, Ernest, you were dozing when I
came in. You have been dreaming nonsense.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Dreaming! yes. Nonsense! perhaps. I talk
both dreams and nonsense. But you are sensible and
always right.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> In this case it does not require much
penetration. A drama in which the chief personage
cannot appear; in which there is hardly any love; in
which nothing happens but what happens every day;
that begins with the fall of the curtain upon the last
act, and which has no name. I don't know how it is to
be written, still less how it is to be acted, how it is to
find an audience, nor how it can be called a drama.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Nevertheless, it is a drama, if I could only give
it proper form, and that I can't do.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Do you wish to follow my advice?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Can you doubt it?—you, my friend, my benefactor,
my second father! Don Julian!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Come, come, Ernest, don't let us drop into a
sentimental drama on our own account instead of yours,
which we have declared impossible. I asked you if you
would take my advice.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> And I said yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Then leave aside your plays. Go to bed,
rest yourself, and come out shooting with me to-morrow.
Kill a few partridges, and that will be an excuse for
your not killing one or two characters, and not exposing
yourself to the same fate at the hands of the public.
After all, you may thank me for it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I'll do no such thing. I mean to write that
play.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> But, my poor fellow, you've conceived it in
mortal sin.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I don't know, but it is conceived. I feel it
stir in my brain. It clamours for life, and I must
give it to the world.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Can't you find another plot?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> But this idea?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Send it to the devil.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Ah, Don Julian, you believe that an idea which
has gripped the mind can be effaced and destroyed at
our pleasure. I wanted to think out another play, but
this accursed idea won't give it room, until it itself
has seen the light.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> God grant you a happy delivery.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> That's the question, as Hamlet says.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Couldn't you cast it into the literary foundling
hospital of anonymity?</p>
<div class='c021'>[<i>In a low voice with an air of comical mystery.</i>]</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Don Julian, I am a man of conscience. Good or

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Preparing to go.</i>] I have nothing more to

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Let Don Julian say what he will, I won't
abandon the undertaking. That would be signal
cowardice. Never retreat—always forward. [<i>Rises and
begins to walk about in an agitated way. Then
approaches the balcony.</i>] Protect me, night. In thy
blackness, rather than in the azure clearness of day, are
outlined the luminous shapes of inspiration. Lift your
roofs, you thousand houses of this great town, as well for
a poet in dire necessity as for the devil on two sticks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>who so wantonly exposed you. Let me see the men
and women enter your drawing-rooms and boudoirs in
search of the night's rest after fevered pleasures abroad.
Let my acute hearing catch the stray words of all those
who inquired for me of Don Julian and Teodora. As
the scattered rays of light, when gathered to a focus by
diaphanous crystal, strike flame, and darkness is forged
by the crossed bars of shadow; as mountains are made
from grains of earth, and seas from drops of water: so
will I use your wasted words, your vague smiles, your
eager glances, and build my play of all those thousand
trivialities dispersed in <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>cafés</cite></span>, at reunions, theatres, and
spectacles, and that float now in the air. Let the
modest crystal of my intelligence be the lens which
will concentrate light and shadow, from which will
spring the dramatic conflagration and the tragic explosion
of the catastrophe. Already my play takes shape. It
has even a title now, for there, under the lamp-shade,
I see the immortal work of the immortal Florentine.
It offers me in Italian what in good Spanish it would
be risky and futile audacity either to write on paper
or pronounce on the stage. Francesca and Paolo,

    <div><em>Teodora and Don Julian. Teodora near the balcony;</em></div>
    <div><em>Don Julian seated on the sofa, lost in thought.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> What a lovely sunset! what clouds and light,
and what a sky! Suppose it were true, as the poets
say, and our fathers believed, that our fate is stamped
upon the azure heaven! Were the mysterious secret of
human destiny traced by the stars upon the sapphire
sphere, and this splendid evening should hold the cipher
of ours, what happiness it must disclose! what a smiling
future! What a life in our life, and what radiance in our
heaven! Is it not so, Julian? [<i>She approaches Don
Julian.</i>] Ah, plunged in thought, I see! Come and
look out. What, no word for me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Absently.</i>] What is it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Coming near.</i>] You have not been listening
to me!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> You have my heart ever—who are its magnet
and its centre. But my mind is apt to be besieged by
preoccupations, cares, business——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> They are the plague of my life, since they rob
me, if not of my husband's affections, at least of some of
his attention. But what is the matter, Julian? [<i>Affectionately.</i>]
Something worries you. Is it serious, that
you are so solemn and so silent? If it should be trouble,
Julian, remember that I have a right to share it. My
joys are yours, and your sorrows are no less mine.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Sorrows! Troubles! Are you not happy?
Do I not possess in you the living embodiment of joy?
With those cheeks so ruddy in the glow of health, and
those dear eyes, clear like your soul and resplendent as
the sky, and I the owner of all you, could pain, or shadow,
or grief teach me I am other than the happiest man
alive?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> It is a business annoyance, perhaps?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Money never yet forced sleep or appetite to
forsake me. I have never felt aversion, much less contempt
for it, so it follows that the article has flowed easily
into my coffers. I was rich, I am rich; and until Don
Julian of Garagarga dies of old age, please God and his
own good fortune, he will remain, if not the wealthiest,
certainly the surest, banker of Madrid, Cadiz, and
Oporto.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Then what is your preoccupation?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> I was thinking—'tis a good thought, too.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Naturally, since 'tis yours.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Flatterer! you would spoil me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> But I am still unenlightened.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> There is an important matter I want to
achieve.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Connected with the new works?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> No; it has nothing to do with stone or iron.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> What, then?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> It is a question of kindness—a sacred debt of
old date.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Gleefully.</i>] Oh, I can guess now.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> So!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> You mean Ernest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> You are right.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Yes, yes, you must. Poor lad! he's so good
and noble and generous.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Quite his father's son—the model of a loyal
hidalgo.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> And then so clever! Only twenty-six, and a
prodigy! what doesn't he know?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Know! I should think he <em>did</em> know. That's
nothing—rather, that's the worst of it. While he is
wandering in the sphere of sublime thought, I fear he's
not likely to learn much of a world so deceptive and
prosaic as ours, which takes no interest in the subtleties
of the mind until three centuries after genius has been
buried.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> But with you for a guide, Julian—you don't
intend to abandon him yet a while, surely?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> God forbid. I should be black-hearted indeed
if I would so readily forget all I owe his father. Don
Juan of Acedo risked for my family name and wealth,
ay, almost his life. Should this lad need mine, he might
ask it, and welcome. 'Twould be but just payment of
the debt my name represents.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Well said, Julian. It is like you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> You remember, about a year ago, I heard my
good friend was dead, and his son was left badly off. I
lost no time, caught the train to Gerona, nearly used
force, and carried the boy back here. When he stood in
the middle of this room I said to him: 'You are master
here; you may command me and mine. Since I owe
your father everything, you must regard me in the light
of his representative. If I fall short, my desire is to
come as near as possible to him. As for the amount of
affection I have to dispose of—we'll see if I don't outrace
him there.'</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I remember it well. The soft-hearted fellow
burst out crying, and clung to you like a child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> He's but a child, as you say. That's why we
must think and plan for him. And 'twas of that I was
so seriously thinking a moment ago. I was meditating
a half-formed project, while you, dear, wanted me to
contemplate a panorama of radiant cloud and scarlet
sun that cannot compare with the sun that shines in
my own heaven.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I cannot divine your idea. What is it you
project doing for Ernest?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Those are my words.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> But is there something yet undone that you
expect to discover? He has lived with us for the past
year like one of ourselves. Were he your son, or a
brother of mine, could you show him more tenderness, I
more affection?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> It is much, but not enough.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Not enough! I fancy,——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> You are thinking of the present, and I of the
future.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Oh! the future! That is easily settled. See,
he lives here with us as long as he likes, for years. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>his home. Then when the just and natural law prompts
him to fall in love and desire another, we will marry
him. You will nobly share your wealth with him, and
we will lead them from the altar to their own house,—<em>he</em>
and <em>she</em>! The proverb, you know, says wisely, 'for each
wedded pair a house.' He will live just a little away
from us, but that will be no reason for our forgetting him,
or loving him less. I see it all distinctly. They are happy,
and we even happier. They have children, of course,
and we perhaps more—well, at least, one little girl, who
will fall in love with Ernest's son, and to whom we will
marry her by and by.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Ah, there is a but already.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Listen, Teodora. It is but a debt we owe to
look after the poor fellow as if he were a relative, and
obligation runs with the exactions of our affection. So
much for himself; so much for his father's son. But every
human action is complex, has two points of view, and
every medal has its reverse. Which means, Teodora,
that you must understand it is a very different matter to
give and receive favours; and that in the end Ernest
might feel my protection a humiliation. He's a high-spirited,
fine lad, a trifle haughty perhaps, and it is imperative
there should be an end to his present position.
We may, if we can, do more for him, but we must seem
to do less.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> How so?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> We'll see—but here he comes——[<i>Looks

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> You look as if something ailed you—your preoccupation

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Nonsense.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Nor disappointment?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> None whatever.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> I don't annoy you?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> You! good heavens! [<i>Rises and comes toward

and affection, and you read me through and through.
Yes, sir; there is indeed something the matter. I will
tell you, if you, and you also, Teodora, out of your pity,
will hold me excused. I am an ungrateful fool, a mere
boy, in truth, deserving neither of your kindness nor of
your affection. Possessing such a father and such a
sister, I ought to be happy, with no care for the morrow.
But it is not so. I blush to explain it,—can't you understand?—Yes,
yes, you must see how false my position is.
I live here on alms. [<i>With energy.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Such a word——</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I expressed myself ill—but it is so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> I say it is not so. If any one in this house
lives upon alms, and those no slight ones, it is I and
not you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I am acquainted, sir, with the story of two loyal
friends, and of some money matters long forgotten. It
does honour to my father and to his hidalgic race. But
I am shamed in profiting by it. I am young, Don
Julian, and although I may not be worth much, there
ought still to be some way for me to earn my bread.
It may be pride or folly, I cannot say. But I remember
what my father used to say: 'What you can do yourself,
never ask another to do. What you can earn,
never owe to any one else.'</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> So that my services humiliate and degrade
you. You count your friends importunate creditors.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Reason may be on your side, Ernest, and in
knowledge you are not deficient, but, believe me, in this
case the heart alone speaks with wisdom.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Your father did not find me so ungenerous or
so proud.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Ah, friendship was then a very different
thing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Teodora!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>To Don Julian.</i>] What a noble anxiety displays</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I know I seem ungrateful—I feel it—and an
idiot to boot. Forgive me, Don Julian.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> His head is a forge.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Also apart to Don Julian.</i>] He doesn't live
in this world.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Just so. He's full of depth and learning, and
lets himself be drowned in a pool of water.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Meditatively.</i>] True, I know little of life, and am
not well fitted to make my way through it But I
divine it, and shudder, I know not why. Shall I founder
on the world's pool as upon the high sea? I may not
deny that it terrifies me far more than the deep ocean.
The sea only reaches the limit set by the loose sand:
over all space travel the emanations of the pool. A
strong man's arms can struggle with the waves of the
sea, but no one can struggle against subtle miasma.
But if I fall, I must not feel the humiliation of defeat. I
wish and pray that at the last moment I may see the
approach of the sea that will bear me away at its will;
see the sword that is to pierce me, the rock against
which I am to be crushed. I must measure my adversary's
strength, and despise it falling, despise it dying,
instead of tamely breathing the venom scattered through
the ambient air.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>To Teodora.</i>] Didn't I tell you he was going
out of his mind?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> But, Ernest, where are you wandering?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Yes. What has all this to do with the
matter?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Sir, I have come to the conclusion that others,
seeing me housed and fed here, are saying of me what I
long have thought. They see me constantly driving out
with you, in the morning walking with Teodora or
Mercedes, in your opera-box, hunting on your lands, and
daily occupying the same place at your table. Though
you would like to think otherwise, in one way or another
the gossip runs: Who is he? Is he a relation? Not so.
The secretary? Still less. A partner? If a partner, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>may be accepted he brings little or nothing to the
general fund. So they chatter.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> By no means. You are raving.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I beg to contradict you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Then give me a name.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Sir?——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> One will do.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> There is one at hand—upstairs.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Name him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Don Severo.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> My brother?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Exactly, your brother? Will that suffice? or shall
we add his respected wife, Doña Mercedes? and Pepito,
their son? What have you to say then?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> That Severo is a fool, Mercedes an idle
chatterer, and the lad a puppy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> They only repeat what they hear.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> It is not true. This is false reasoning. Between
gentlemen, when the intention is honourable, what
can the opinion of the world really matter? The meaner
it is, the loftier our disdain of it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> 'Tis nobly said, and is what all well-bred men
feel. But I have been taught that gossip, whether
inspired by malice or not, which is according to each
one's natural tendency, begins in a lie and generally
ends in truth. Does gossip, as it grows, disclose the
hidden sin? Is it a reflex of the past, or does it invent
evil and give it existence? Does it set its accursed seal
upon an existent fault, or merely breed that which was
yet not, and furnish the occasion for wrong? Should we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>call the slanderer infamous or severe? the accomplice or
the divulger? the public avenger or the tempter? Does
he arrest or precipitate our fall? wound through taste or
duty? and when he condemns, is it from justice or from
spite? Perhaps both, Don Julian. Who can say?
though time, occasion, and facts may show.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> See here, Ernest, I don't understand an iota
of all this philosophising. I presume 'tis on such nonsense
you waste your intelligence. But I don't want
you to be vexed or worried. It's true—you really wish
for austere independence, to stand alone at a post of
honour?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Don Julian!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Answer me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Joyously</i>]. Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Then count it gained. At this very moment
I have no secretary. I am expecting one from London.
But nobody would suit me better than a certain young
fool, who is enamoured of poverty. [<i>Speaks in pleasant
reproach.</i>] His work and salary will, of course, be
settled as any one else's, though he be a son to
one who cherishes him as such.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Don Julian!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Affecting comical severity.</i>] Remember, I am
an exacting business man, and I have not the habit of
giving my money away for nothing. I intend to get as
much as possible out of you, and work you hard. In my
house the bread of just labour alone is consumed. By
the clock, ten hours, starting at daybreak, and when I
choose to be severe, you will see that Severo himself is
no match for me. So, before the world you pose as the
victim of my selfishness ... but in private, dear boy, ever
the same, the centre of my dearest affections. [<i>Unable
to maintain former tone, Don Julian breaks off, and holds
his hand out to Ernest.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Deeply moved.</i>] Don Julian!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> You accept, then?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I am yours to command.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>To Don Julian.</i>] At last you have tamed the
savage.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>To Don Julian.</i>] Anything for your sake.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> So would I have you always, Ernest. And
now I have to write to my London correspondent, and
thank him, and while recognising the extraordinary
merit of his Englishman, whom he extols to the skies,
regret that I have already engaged a young man. [<i>Walks
toward the first door on the right hand.</i>] This is how we
stand for the present; but in the future—it will be as
partners. [<i>Returns with an air of mystery.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Stop, Julian, I beg of you. Can't you see that
he will take alarm? [<i>Don Julian goes out on the right,
and laughs to himself, looking back at Ernest.</i>]</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE III</h4>

<p class='c011'><em>Teodora and Ernest. Towards the end of the last scene
twilight has fallen, so that at this moment the room is in
deep shadow.</em></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I am dazed by so much kindness. How can I
ever repay it? [<i>He sits down on the sofa, displaying
great emotion. Teodora walks over and stands beside him</i>.]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> By ejecting the spirit of pride and distrust; by
being sensible and believing that we truly love you, that
we will never change; and by putting full faith in all
Julian's promises. His word is sacred, Ernest, and in
him you will always have a father, in me a sister.</p>

latter remain standing behind as they enter. The room is
quite dark, save for a glimmer of light shed from the
balcony, whither Ernest and Teodora have moved.</em></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> How good you are!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> And you, what a boy! After to-day I hope you
have done with sadness—eh?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Quite.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Outside, speaking low.</i>] How dark it is!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> [<i>In same tone.</i>] Come away, Mercedes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Crossing the threshold.</i>] There is nobody here.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> [<i>Detaining her.</i>] Yes, there is. [<i>Both stand
a while peering.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Teodora, my whole life, a thousand lives would
still not be enough to offer you in return for your kindness.
Don't judge me by my morose temper. I cannot
lend a showy front to my affections, but, believe me, I do
know how to love—and hate as well. My heart can
beat to bursting under the lash of either sentiment.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>To Severo.</i>] What are they saying?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Something odd, but I hear imperfectly. [<i>Teodora
and Ernest go out on the balcony, speaking low.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> 'Tis Ernest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> And she—I suppose—is——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Teodora.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Their eternal tricks—always together. I can
stand no more of this. And their words? I mustn't
put it off any longer——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> True, Severo. Come away. It is certainly
your duty, since everybody is talking.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Yes, I must open Julian's eyes—to-day, at once.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> The fellow has impudence enough, and to
spare.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> By all that's holy—so has she.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Poor girl! She's but a child. Leave her to
me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Another house? Surely no. You wouldn't
leave us? What an idea! Julian would never consent.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> [<i>To Doña Mercedes.</i>] I should think not indeed,
neither would I. [<i>Aloud.</i>] Ah, Teodora, you didn't see
me? This is how you receive your guests.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Coming from the balcony.</i>] Don Severo! I am
delighted.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Is there no dinner this evening? It's near
the hour.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Mercedes too!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Yes, Teodora.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] She is a capital actress. What a
creature!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I must ring for lights. [<i>Touches the bell on the
table.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Quite so. Every one likes plenty of light.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> Madam?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Bring the lamps, Genaro. <span class='direction'>[<i>Exit servant.</i>]</span></p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> He who follows the narrow path of loyalty and

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> I suppose so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Hulloa, Don Ernest! what were you doing out
there? Were you with Teodora when we came in!
[<i>Speaks with marked intention.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Coldly.</i>] I was here as you see.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> The deuce you were! It is rather dark to see.
[<i>Approaches him with outstretched hand, looking fixedly at
him. Teodora and Mercedes converse apart. Aside.</i>] His
face is flushed, and he appears to have been crying. In
this world only children and lovers weep. [<i>Aloud.</i>] And
Julian?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> He went away to write a letter.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Though I have patience to spare, this
man tries me hard.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> [<i>To Teodora.</i>] I am going to see him. There
is still time before dinner?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Plenty.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Good. Then to work. [<i>Aside, rubbing his hands,

Such mystery! What can it mean?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> It is indeed very serious.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Concerning whom?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> All of you.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Then make haste.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] I should like to——but, no; I must
go gently in this unsavoury affair. [<i>Aloud.</i>] Listen,
Teodora. My husband is, after all, your husband's
brother, and in life and death our fortunes are one. So
that we owe one another in all things protection, help,
and advice,—is it not so? To-day it may be I who
offer assistance, and to-morrow, should I need it, I

step, but Severo urges me. 'It can't go on,' he insists.
'My brother's honour and my own self-esteem forbid
me to witness that which fills me with shame and sorrow.
On all sides am I assailed with innuendoes, with the
smiles, the covert glances and the reproaches of my
friends. There must be an end to this low gossip about us.'</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Tell me, what is the gossip?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> The murmuring of the river tells us that its

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Impetuously, rising.</i>] Julian! what a falsehood!
What wretch could say so? Julian would strike him!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Endeavouring to soothe her and make her sit
down.</i>] He would need a good many hands, then; for,
if report speak truly, he would have to strike the entire
town.</p>

mystery, and what is this talk of the town?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> So you're sorry?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I am sorry. But what is it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> You see, Teodora, you are quite a child. At
your age one is so often thoughtless and light, and then
such bitter tears are afterwards shed. You still don't
understand me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> No, what has such a case to do with me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> It is the story of a scoundrel and the story of
a lady——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Eagerly.</i>] Whose name——?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Her name——</p>

for one hour of pleasure, would thrust upon the woman
a life of sorrow: the husband's dishonour, the ruin of a
family, and she left shamed and condemned to social
penitence in the world's disdain, and to keener punishment
still at the whip of her own conscience.</p>

[<i>Aloud.</i>] This man is not worthy of you, Teodora.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> But, madam, what is the drift of all this blind
emotion? Do not imagine that my eyes are dimmed
with fear or horror or tears. They burn with the flame
of anger. To whom can such words be addressed?
What man do you mean? Is it, perchance——?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Ernest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Ah! [<i>Pause.</i>] And the woman I? Not so?
[<i>Mercedes nods and Teodora rises again.</i>] Then listen to
me, though I may offend you. I know not who is the viler,
the inventor of this tale or you who repeat it. Shame
upon the meanness that formed the idea, and shame
upon the villainy that spreads it! It is so abominable,
so fatal, that I almost feel myself criminal because I
cannot instantly reject the thought and forget it.
Heavens! could I suppose or credit such baseness?
Because of his misfortunes I loved him. He was like a
brother to me, and Julian was his providence. And he
so noble and thorough a gentleman! [<i>Stands staring at
Mercedes, then turns away her face. Aside.</i>] How she
inspects me! I scarcely like to say a good word for
him to her. My God! I am compelled already to act
a part.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Be calm, child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Raising her voice.</i>] Oh, what anguish! I feel
cold and inconsolable. Stained in this way by public
opinion! Oh, my dearest mother, and you, Julian, my
heart's beloved. [<i>She falls sobbing into a chair on the
left, and Mercedes strives to console her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> I did not imagine—forgive me—don't cry.
There, I didn't really believe it was serious. I knew your
past exonerated you. But as the case stands, you must
admit that out of every hundred a hundred would accuse
you and Julian of excessive rashness, or say you had
led the world to conclude the worst. You a girl of
twenty, Julian a man of forty, and Ernest between you,
with his head full of romantic thoughts. On the one
hand, a husband given up to business, on the other a
youth to dreams, every day bringing its opportunity, and
you there, unoccupied, in the flush of romance. It was
wrong for people to conclude the worst because they
saw you walking with him, and saw him so often at the
theatre with you. But, Teodora, in reason and justice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>I think that, if the world was bent on seeing evil, you
furnished the occasion. Permit me to point out to you
that the fault which society most fiercely chastises, pursues
most relentlessly and cruelly, and in every varied
imaginable way, both in man and woman is—don't
frown so, Teodora—is <em>temerity</em>.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Turning to Mercedes without having heard her.</i>]
And you say that Julian——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Is the laughing-stock of the town, and you——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Oh, I! That's no matter. But Julian!—Oh,
oh, so good, so chivalrous! If he only knew——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> He will know, for at this very moment Severo
is telling him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> What!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Julian.</span> [<i>Inside.</i>] That will do.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Oh, goodness!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Julian.</span> Let me alone.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Come away, quickly.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Rushing with Teodora towards first door on
the right.</i>] Yes, yes, quickly. What folly! [<i>Teodora
and Mercedes go to the right.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Stopping suddenly.</i>] But wherefore, since I
am not guilty? Not only does miserable calumny stain
us, but it degrades us. It is so steeped in evil, that,
against all evidence, its very breath takes the bloom off
our consciences. Why should an idle terror cast its
mean influence over me? [<i>At this moment Don Julian
appears on the threshold of the first door on the right hand
side, and behind him stands Don Severo.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Julian!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Teodora! [<i>She runs over to him, and he folds
her in a passionate embrace.</i>] Here in my arms, dearest.
It is the home of your honour.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Teodora, Doña Mercedes, Don Julian, Don Severo, Ernest

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Looking at Don Julian and Teodora. Aside.</i>]
He and she! It is no illusion. Can it be what I feared?
what that fool told me. [<i>Referring to Pepito, who at that

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Staring strangely about.</i>] My salutations to all,

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Thanks, Pepito. [<i>Accepts them mechanically.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>To Don Julian in a low voice.</i>] What's the
matter with Teodora?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>In same tone.</i>] She is pale, and has been crying.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Angrily.</i>] Don't busy yourself about my
wife. [<i>Pause. Don Julian and Ernest exchange glances.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] The wretches! They've completed
their work.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>In a low voice to his mother, pointing to Ernest.</i>]
He ought to have a strait-jacket. I quizzed him
about Teodora. Poof! 'Pon my word, I thought he'd
kill me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Aloud, with resolution and sadness.</i>] Don Julian,
I have thought over your generous offer, and much as
I've already abused your kindness, it goes sorely against
me to refuse it now. But, sir, I feel that I ought to
reject this post you offer me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Why?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Because I am so fashioned,—a poet and a
dreamer. My father, sir, trained me for no career. I
want to travel; I am restless and liable to revolt. I am
not capable of settling down like another. Like a new
Columbus, I am bitten by the spirit of adventure. But
we will appeal to Don Severo. He will decide if I am
right.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> You speak like the book of wisdom and like
a man of sense. I have been thinking as you do for a
long while.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Since when have you felt this itch for new
worlds and travel? When did you make up your mind
to leave us? And the means?—where are they?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> He wants to go away—to some place more
to his taste than here. To be just, Julian, the rest is
your affair. Give him as much as he wants, too, for this
is no time for economy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>To Don Severo.</i>] I don't traffic with dishonour,
nor receive alms. [<i>Pause.</i>] Well, it must be so; and as
our parting would be a sad one—for in this life, who
knows? I may never come back, and may not see them
again—it is better that we should shake hands now,
here, Don Julian, and have it over. Thus we snap the
tie, and you forgive my selfishness. [<i>Deeply moved.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] How they stare at one another!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] What a noble fellow!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>To Don Julian.</i>] Why do you withhold your
hand? It is our last adieu, Don Julian. [<i>Goes toward
him with outstretched hands. Don Julian embraces him.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> No, lad. The question well considered, this
is neither the first nor the last. It is the cordial embrace
of two honourable men. You must not mention your
mad project again.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Then he is not going away?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Never. I have not the habit of changing my
mind or the plans I have matured because of a boy's
caprice or a madman's folly. And I have still less
intention of weakly subjecting my actions to the town's
idle gossip.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Julian!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Enough. Dinner is served.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Father, I cannot——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> But what if I believe you can? Or does my
authority begin to bore you?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I beg you——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Come, dinner is ready. Give your arm to
Teodora, and take her in.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Looking at her, but holding back.</i>] To Teodora!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>With a similar emotion.</i>] Ernest!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Yes, as usual.
[<i>There is a movement of uncertainty on both sides; finally
Ernest approaches and Teodora takes his arm, but
neither dares to look at the other, and both are abrupt
and violently agitated.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>To Pepito.</i>] And you! The deuce, why
don't you offer your arm to your mother? My good
brother Severo will take mine. So, quite a family
party, and now let pleasure flow with the wine in our
glasses. So there are gossips about? Well, let them
chatter and scream. A farthing for all they can say.
I shouldn't object to a glass house, that they might have
the pleasure of staring in at Teodora and Ernest together,
and learn how little I care for their spite and
their calumnies. Each man to his fancy.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Mercedes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Teodora.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] He is looking at her, and there are
tears in her eyes. [<i>Teodora, walking unsteadily and
struggling with emotion, slowly follows the others inside.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>To Severo.</i>] Are they talking together?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> I don't know, but I think it very probable.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Why are they looking back at us? Both!
Did you notice? I wonder why.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> You see, you are growing reasonable at last!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> No, I've caught your madness. Ah, how sure
a thing is calumny! It pierces straight to the heart.</p>

    <div><i>Don Julian and Don Severo.</i></div>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> [<i>Looking round.</i>] How modest!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Poor is a better word.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo</span>. What a lodging! [<i>Opens the door and peeps in.</i>]
An alcove, this study, and an outer room—and that's all.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> And thereby hangs the devil's own tale of
human ingratitude, of bastard sentiment, of miserable
passions, and of blackguard calumny. And whether you
tell it quickly or at length, there's never an end to it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> It is the work of chance.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Not so, my dear fellow. It was the work of—well,
I know whom.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Meaning me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Yes, you as well. And before you the empty-pated
idlers whom it behoved to busy themselves
shamelessly about my honour and my wife's. And I,
coward, mean, and jealous, I let the poor fellow go,
despite my evidence of his upright nature. I responded
to his nobler conduct by black ingratitude. Yes,
ingratitude. You see my ostentatious wealth, the luxury
of my surroundings and equipages, and the credit of my
firm. Well, do you know where all that comes from?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> I have quite forgotten.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Justly said,—forgotten! Such is the natural
reward of every generous action, of every unusual
impulse that prompts one man to help another quietly,
without a flourish of trumpet or self-advertisement—just
for friendship's or for honesty's sake.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> You are unjust to yourself. To such an excess
have you pushed gratitude, that you have almost sacrificed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>honour and fortune to it. What more could be expected—even
of a saint? There's a limit to all things, good and
evil. He is proud and obstinate, and, however much you
may oppose him, 'tis none the less a fact that he's his
own master. If he chooses to leave your palace in a fit
of despair, for this shanty—'tis his right. I admit, my
dear boy, that it's very sad—but then, who could have
prevented it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> The world in general, if it would mind its own
business instead of tearing and rending reputations by
the movement of its tongue and the sign of its hand.
What did it matter to the public if we, fulfilling a sacred
duty, treated Ernest, I as a son, and Teodora as a
brother? Is it reason enough to assume the worst, and
trumpet scandal because a fine lad sits at my table, walks
out with my wife, and has his seat in my opera-box?
Is by chance impure love the sole supreme bond between
man and woman in this world of clay? Is there no
friendship, gratitude, sympathy, esteem, that youth and
beauty should only meet in the mire? And even
supposing that the conclusion of the fools was the right
one, is it their business to avenge me? I have my own
eyes to look after my own affairs, and to avenge my
wrongs have I not courage, steel, and my own right
hand?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Well, accepting that outsiders were wrong to
talk, did you expect me, who am of your blood and
bear your name, to hold my tongue?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> By heavens, no! But you should have been
more careful. You might have told me alone of this
sorry business, and not have set flame to a conflagration
under my very roof.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> I erred through excess of affection, I admit.
But while I confess that the world and I have done the
mischief—it by inventing the situation, and I by weakly
crediting, and by giving voice to the shabby innuendoes—you,
Julian [<i>approaches him and speaks with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>tender interest</i>], have nothing to reproach yourself with.
You have the consolation of having acted throughout as
a gentleman.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D Julian.</span> I cannot so easily console myself, while my
heart gives shelter to that same story which my lips and
my intelligence reject. I indignantly turn away from the
world's calumny, and to myself I say: 'What if it should
be no lie: if perchance the world should be right?' So
I stand in strife between two impulses, sometimes judge,
sometimes accomplice. This inward battle wears me
out, Severo. Doubt increases and expands, and my
heart groans, while before my bloodshot vision stretches
a reddened field.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Delirium!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> No, 'tis not raving. You see, I bare myself to
you as a brother. Think you Ernest would have left
my house if I had firmly stood in his way and opposed
his crossing the threshold? If so, why does a traitorous
voice keep muttering in my disturbed consciousness:
‘’twere wise to leave the door open to his exit, and lock
it well afterwards, for the confiding man is but a poor
guardian of honour’s fortress.’ In my heart I wish what
my lips deny. 'Come back, Ernest,' aloud, and to myself
'do not come back,' and while I show him a frank
front, I am a hypocrite and a coward, watchful and worn
with mistrust. No, Severo, this is not to act like an
honest man. [<i>He drops into the arm-chair beside the table
in deep dejection.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> It is how any husband would act who had a
beautiful young wife to look after, especially one with a
romantic temperament.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Don't speak so of Teodora. She is a mirror
that our breath tarnishes by any imprudent effort to
bring it to our level. It gave back the sun's pure light
before the million vipers of the earth gathered to stare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>at it. To-day they crawl within the glass in its divine
frame, but they are insubstantial shadows. My hand
can wave them away, and once more you will see the
clear blue of heaven.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> All the better.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> No, not so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Then what the deuce do you want?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Oh, so much. I told you that this inward
struggle of which I spoke is changing me to another
man. Now my wife finds me always sad, always distant.
I am not the man I was, and no effort will ever make
me so again. Seeing me so changed, she must ask,
'Where is Julian? this is not my dear husband; what
have I done to forfeit his confidence, and what shabby
feeling causes this aloofness?' a shadow lies between us,
ever deepening, and slowly, step by step, we move more
apart. None of the old dear confidence, none of the
old delightful talks; smiles frozen, tones embittered, in
me through unjust resentment, in her through tearful
grief,—I wounded in my love, and she, by my hand,
wounded in her woman's dignity. There's how we stand.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Then you stand upon the verge of perdition.
If you see your position so plainly, why don't you
remedy it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> 'Tis of no use. I know I am unjust to doubt
her, nay, worse still. I don't doubt her now. But who
will say that, I losing little by little, and he gaining
as steadily, the lie of to-day will not to-morrow be truth?
[<i>He seizes Don Severo by the arm, and speaks with voluble
earnestness and increasing bitterness.</i>] I, jealous, sombre,
unjust and hard, he noble and generous, resigned and
inalterably sweet-natured, with that halo of martyrdom
which, in the eyes of women, sits so becomingly on
the brow of a brave and handsome youth. Is it not
clear that his is the better part, and that my loss is his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>gain? while I can do nothing to alter the injustice of it.
You see it, too? And if the ignoble talk of the town
should compel those two to treason, though they may
now truthfully assert: 'we are not lovers,' the force of
repetition of the word may eventually drive them to
the fact.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> If that's how you feel about it, Julian, I think
the safest thing would be to let Ernest carry out his
project.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> That I've come to prevent.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Then you are insane. He purposes to go to
Buenos Ayres. Nothing could be better. Let him go—in
a sailing vessel, fresh wind to his sail, and good
speed.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Do you wish me to show myself so miserably
ungrateful and jealous before Teodora? Don't you
know, Severo, that a woman may despise a lover and
love him still, but not so a husband? Contempt is his
dishonour. You would not have my wife follow the unhappy
exile across the ocean with sad regrets? And I,
should I see the trace of a tear upon her cheek, the mere
thought that it might be for Ernest would drive me to
strangle her in my arms. [<i>Speaks with rancour and
rage.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> What is it then you do want?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> I must suffer. The care of unravelling the
knot belongs to the world that conceived the drama

    <div><i>Don Julian, Don Severo, and Pepito.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> You here?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] By Jove, I see they know all about it.
[<i>Aloud.</i>] We are all here. How do you do, uncle? How
do, father? [<i>Aside.</i>] Easy. They know what's in the
wind. [<i>Aloud.</i>] What brings you?—but I suppose you
are looking for Ernest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> What else could bring us here?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> I daresay you know what this madman is up
to?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> What he's up to! Well, yes—rather. I know as
much as another.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> And it's to-morrow?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> No, to-morrow he is going away, so it must be
to-day.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Surprised.</i>] What do you say?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> That's what Pepe Uceda told me last night at
the club. He is Nebreda's second, so he ought to know.
But why do you stare so oddly? Didn't you know——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Hastily covering his brother's movement.</i>]
Everything.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> We——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Hold your tongue, Severo.—He starts
to-morrow, and to-day he stakes his life—and we are
here, of course, to prevent both, the duel and the
departure. [<i>Don Julian makes it evident that he is only
sounding Pepito's knowledge of facts, and that he is only
aware of the pending departure.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> What duel?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Aside to Severo.</i>] I know nothing about it,
but I shall presently.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Come, I haven't been such a duffer after
all.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Speaking with an air of certainty.</i>] We know
there is a viscount——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> With whom Ernest proposes to fight—a
certain trustworthy person has informed us, who was at
once apprised of it. They say 'tis a serious matter
[<i>Pepito nods</i>], a disgraceful quarrel in the presence of
several witnesses [<i>Pepito nods again</i>]—the lie direct, and
a deluge of bad language——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Interrupts excitedly, glad of his more accurate information.</i>]
Language indeed!—a blow bigger than a
monument.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> On which side?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Ernest struck the viscount.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Of course Ernest struck the viscount. I
thought you knew that, Severo. The viscount insulted
him. Patience is not the lad's strong point—hence the
blow.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Confidently.</i>] I told you we knew the whole
story. [<i>Then anxiously.</i>] The affair is serious?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Most serious. I don't like discussing it, but since
you know so much, there is no need for further mystery.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> None whatever. [<i>He approaches Pepito eagerly.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>After a pause, adopts an ominous air to announce
bad news.</i>] It is a matter of life and death. [<i>Looks round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>triumphantly. Don Julian and Don Severo start.</i>] The
viscount is neither a chicken nor a skulk. He can
handle a sword.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> And the quarrel? What was it? Nebreda
is supposed to be——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> It was hardly a quarrel. I'll tell you the facts.
[<i>Both men draw near eagerly.</i>] Ernest, you know, means
to leave Madrid to-morrow, and take passage in the <cite>Cid</cite>
lying in Cadiz. Luiz Alcaráz had promised him a
letter of introduction, and the poor fellow went off to
meet him at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>café</em></span> and get it, with the best of
intentions. Luiz wasn't there, so he waited. Some of
the frequenters of Alcaráz's table, who did not know
him, were in the full swing of glorious slander, and
did not notice his clenched teeth. A name mentioned
meant a reputation blasted. Broad-handed, ready-tongued,
every living soul passed in their review. In
this asylum of charity, in the midst of more smoke than
an express train emits, between lifted glass and dropped
cigarette ashes, with here and there a lump of sugar, the
marble was converted for the nonce into a dissecting-table:
each woman dishonoured, another glass of the old tap:
a shout of laughter for each tippler's cut. In four clippings
these lads left reputations ragged and the ladies
rent to tatters. Yet what did it all come to? They but
echoed society at a <em>café</em>-table. I don't say all this for
myself, nor think it, but 'twas how Ernest spoke when
he recounted the quarrel to me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Well, make an end of it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> The end of it is, that between name and name,
there was mention of one that Ernest could not endure.
'Who dares to ridicule an honourable man?' he shouts.
Somebody retorts: 'a lady,' and names a woman. His
head was instantly on fire, and he flings himself upon
Nebreda. The poor viscount fell like a ninepin, and
there you have an Agramante's camp. The day's
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>business is now a duel—in a room somewhere—I don't
know where.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Seizing his arms.</i>] The man was I!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Sir?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> And Teodora the woman? How have we
fallen—she, myself, our love? [<i>Sits down and covers
his face with both hands.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> What have you done, you blockhead!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Didn't he say he knew all about it? and I
naturally believed him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Dishonoured, dishonoured!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> [<i>Approaching him.</i>] Julian, my dear fellow.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> It is true. I ought to be calm, I know.
But what heart can I have when faith is gone? [<i>Seizes
his brother's hand.</i>] Just heaven! Why are we so
disgraced? What reason have they to turn and throw
mud at us? No matter. I know my duty as a
gentleman. I can count on you, Severo?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> On me? Till death, Julian. [<i>They shake hands
cordially.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Julian.</span> [<i>To Pepito.</i>] The duel?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> For three o'clock.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Julian.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] I'll kill him—yes, kill him. Come. [<i>To
Severo.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Whither?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> To look for this viscount.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Do you mean——?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> I mean to do what I ought and can to
avenge myself and save Don Juan of Acedo's son.
Who are the seconds? [<i>To Pepito.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Alcaráz and Rueda.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> I know them both. Let him stay here
[<i>pointing to Pepito</i>], so that in the event of Ernest's
return——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Of course.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>To Pepito.</i>] Without arousing his suspicion,
find out where the duel takes place.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> You hear.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>To his brother.</i>] Come.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> What's the matter with you, Julian?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> 'Tis a long while since I've felt so overjoyed.
[<i>Catches Severo's arm feverishly.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> The deuce! overjoyed! You're beside yourself.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> I shall meet that fellow.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Nebreda?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Yes. Observe, until to-day calumny was
impalpable. There was no seizing its shape. I have
now discovered it, and it has taken a human form.
There it is at hand, in the person of a viscount.
Swallowing blood and gall for the past three months—the
devil!—and now—fancy, face to face—he and I!</p>

<div class='c021'>[<i>Exeunt Don Julian and Don Severo.</i>]</div>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Well, here we are in a nice fix, and all for
nothing! However, in spite of my uncle's belief, it was
little short of madness to leave a resplendent creature
under the same roof and in continual contact with a
handsome fellow like Ernest, with a soul on fire, or
given to romanticism. He swears there's nothing in
it, and that his feeling for her is pure affection, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>he loves her like a sister, and that my uncle is a
father to him. But I am a sly fox, and, young as I
am, I know a thing or two of this world. I've no faith
in this sort of relations, when the brother is young
and the sister is beautiful, and brotherhood between
them a fiction. But suppose it were as he says, all
square. What do outsiders know about that? Nobody
is under any obligation to think the best of his fellows.
The pair are seen everywhere together, and, seeing
them, haven't their neighbours a right to talk? No,
swears Ernest. <em>We hardly ever went out alone.</em> Once,
perhaps? That's enough. If a hundred persons saw
them on that occasion, it is quite the same as if they
had been seen in public a hundred times. Good Lord!
How are you going to confront all the witnesses to
prove whether it was once or often they chose to give
an airing to this pure sympathy and brotherly love?
'Tis absurd—neither just nor reasonable. What we
see we may mention—'tis no lie to say it. 'I saw
them once,' says one, 'and I,' another. One and one
make two. 'And I also'—that makes three. And
then a fourth, and a fifth, and so, summing which, you
soon enough reach infinity. We see because we look,
and our senses are there to help us to pass the time,
without any thought of our neighbour. He must
look out for himself, and remember that, if he shuns
the occasion, calumny and peril will shun him. [<i>Pause.</i>]
And take notice that I admit the purity of the affection,
and this makes it so serious a matter. Now, in my
opinion, the man who could be near Teodora, and not
fall in love with her, must be a stone. He may be
learned and philosophical, and know physics and
mathematics, but he has a body like another, and
she's there with a divine one, and, body of Bacchus!
that's sufficient to found an accusation on. Ah! if
these walls could speak. If Ernest's private thoughts,
scattered here, could take tangible form! By Jove!
what's this? An empty frame, and beside it Don
Julian's likeness in its fellow. Teodora was there,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the pendant of my respected uncle. Why has she
disappeared? To avoid temptation? [<i>Sits down at
the table.</i>] If that's the reason—it's bad. And still
worse if the portrait has left its frame for a more
honourable place near his heart. Come forth, suspected
imps that float about, and weave invisible meshes.
Ruthlessly denounce this mystic philosopher. [<i>Looks
about the table and sees the open Dante.</i>] Here's another.
I never come here but I find this divine book open
on Ernest's table. The Divine Comedy! His favourite
poem, and I note that he seems never to get beyond
the Francesca page. I conceive two explanations of
the fact. Either the fellow never reads it, or he never
reads any other. But there's a stain, like a tear-drop.
My faith! what mysteries and abysses! And what
a difficult thing it is to be married and live tranquilly.
A paper half burnt—[<i>picks it up</i>]—there's still a
morsel left. [<i>Goes over to the balcony trying to read it.
At this moment Ernest enters, and stands watching him.</i>]</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE V</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c024'>
    <div><i>Pepito and Ernest.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> What are you looking at?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Hulloa! Ernest. Only a paper I caught on the
wing. The wind blew it away.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Takes it and returns it after a short inspection.</i>]
I don't remember what it is.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Verses. You may remember [<i>reads with difficulty</i>]
'The flame that consumes me.' [<i>Aside.</i>] <em>Devora</em> rhymes
with <em>Teodora</em>.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> It is nothing important.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> No, nothing. [<i>Throws away the paper.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> That worthless bit of paper is a symbol of our
life—a few sobs of sorrow, and a little flake of ashes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Then they were verses?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Yes. When I've nothing better to do, sometimes—my
pen runs away with me—I write them at
night.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> And to prick enthusiasm, and get into harness,
you seek inspiration in the master's book.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> It would seem——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Say no more. 'Tis truly a gigantic work. The
episode of Francesca. [<i>Pointing to the page.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Ironically and impatiently.</i>] You can't guess
wrong to-day.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Not entirely, by Jove. Here, where the book is
open, I find something I can't guess, and you must
explain it to me. Reading a love-tale together to pass the
time, we are told that Francesca and Paolo reached
that part where the gallant author, proving himself no
amateur in the business, sings the loves of Launcelot
and Queen Guinevere. The match fell pat. The kiss
in the book was repeated by the passionate youth on
the girl's mouth. And at this point of the story, with
rare skill and sublime truth, the Florentine poet tells
us what happens. [<i>Points to the line.</i>] But this is
what I do not understand. <em>Galeoto was the book they
were reading, and they read no more.</em> They stopped
reading? That's easy enough to understand. But
this Galeoto, tell me where he comes in, and who
was he? You ought to know, since he has given his
name to the play that is to make you famous. Let
me see. [<i>Takes up the MS. and examines it.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Galeoto was the go-between for the Queen and
Launcelot and in all loves the <em>third</em> may be truthfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>nicknamed Galeoto, above all when we wish to suggest
an ugly word without shocking an audience.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> I see, but have we no Spanish word to express it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> We have one, quite suitable and expressive
enough. 'Tis an office that converts desires into ducats,
overcomes scruples, and is fed upon the affections. It
has a name, but to use it would be putting a fetter upon
myself, forcing myself to express what, after all, I would
leave unsaid. [<i>Takes the MS. from Pepito and flings it
upon the table.</i>] Each especial case, I have remarked,
has its own especial go-between. Sometimes it is the
entire social mass that is Galeoto. It then unconsciously
exercises the office under the influence of a vice of quite
another aspect, but so dexterously does it work against
honour and modesty that no greater Galeoto can ever be
found. Let a man and woman live happily, in tranquil
and earnest fulfilment of their separate duties. Nobody
minds them, and they float along at ease. But God be
praised, this is a state of things that does not last long
in Madrid. One morning somebody takes the trouble
to notice them, and from that moment, behold society
engaged in the business, without aim or object, on the
hunt for hidden frailty and impurity. Then it pronounces
and judges, and there is no logic that can convince
it, nor living man who can hope to persuade it, and
the honestest has not a rag of honour left. And the
terrible thing is, that while it begins in error it generally
ends in truth. The atmosphere is so dense, misery so
envelops the pair, such is the press and torrent of
slander, that they unconsciously seek one another, unite
lovelessly, drift toward their fall, and adore each other
until death. The world was the stumbling-stone of
virtue, and made clear the way for shame—was Galeoto
and—[<i>aside</i>] stay! what mad thought inflames me!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] If that's the way he discourses to Teodora,
heaven help poor Don Julian. [<i>Aloud.</i>] I suppose
last night's verses dealt with the subject.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Yes, they did.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> How can you waste your time so coolly, and sit
there so calm, doing nothing, when in another hour
you will be measuring swords with Nebreda, who, for all
his dandy's cane, is a man when put upon his mettle?
Wouldn't it be saner and wiser to practise fencing
instead of expounding questions of verse and rhyme?
You look so mighty cool that I almost doubt if you
regard your meeting with the viscount as serious.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No,—for a good reason. If I kill him, the world
gains; if he kill me, I gain.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Well, that's good.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Don't say any more about it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Now I must warily find out. [<i>Approaches
him and speaks in a low voice.</i>] Is it for to-day?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Yes, to-day.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Outside the town?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No, there's no time for that. Besides, we wish
to keep it quiet.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> In a house, then?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> So I proposed.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Where?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Upstairs. [<i>Speaks with cold indifference.</i>] There's
a room unlet upstairs, with a side window, through which
nobody can look. Under the circumstances it's better
than a field, and will be had for a handful of silver.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> And now all you need——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> The swords!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> I hear voices outside. Somebody is coming—the
seconds?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> May be.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> It sounds like a woman's voice. [<i>Approaches the
door.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Approaching also.</i>] But who's keeping them?</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> Really, sir, I can't say. It's very dark outside,

Good-bye and good luck. [<i>To the servant.</i>] What are

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> For orders to show the lady in.</p>

sad to lose a friend!—before Julian—before the whole
world—thinking only of our affection—I myself, Ernest,
would have held out my arms to you—in farewell.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Starts and quickly restrains himself.</i>] Oh,
Teodora!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> But now I suppose it is not the same thing.
There is a gulf between us.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> You are right, madam. We may no longer
care for one another, be no longer brother and sister.
The mutual touch of palm would leave our hands unclean.
'Tis all for ever past. What we have now to
learn is to hate one another.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>In naïve consternation.</i>] Hate! surely not!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Have I used that word—and to you! poor
child!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Don't heed me. If you needed my life, and the
occasion offered itself, claim it, Teodora, for, to give my
life for you would be——[<i>with passion</i>] it would be my
duty. [<i>With a sudden change of voice. Pause.</i>] Hate! if
my lips pronounced the word, I was thinking of the
misery,—I was thinking of the injury I have unwittingly
wrought one to whom I owe so much. Yes, you,
Teodora, must hate me—but I—ah, no!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Sadly.</i>] They have made me shed tears
enough; yes, you are right in that, Ernest [<i>with tenderness</i>],
but you I do not accuse. Who could condemn or
blame you for all this talk? You have nothing to do with
the venomous solicitude with which evil minds honour
us, nor with poor Julian's clouded temper. It is sorrow
that makes him restive, and his suffering wounds me,
for I know that it springs from doubt of my devotion.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> That is what I cannot understand [<i>angrily</i>], and
in him less than in another. It is what drives me wild:
by the living God, I protest it is not worthy of pity,
and there is no excuse for it. That the man should
exist who could doubt a woman like you!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Poor fellow, he pays a heavy price for his savage
distrust.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Horrified to find he has been blaming Don Julian
to Teodora.</i>] What have I said? I don't accuse him—no—I
meant——[<i>He hastens to exculpate Don Julian and
modify his former words.</i>] Anybody might feel the same,
that is, if he were very much in love. In our earthly
egoism, don't we doubt the very God in heaven? And
the owner of a treasure jealously watches it as gold, and
cannot but fear for it. I, too, in his place, would be full
of doubt,—yes—even of my own brother. [<i>Speaks with
increasing fervour, and again restrains himself, perceiving
that he is on the brink of a peril he would avoid. Teodora
hears voices outside and rushes to the door.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Whither are you leading me, rebel heart? What
depth have I stirred? I accuse the world of calumny,
and would now prove it right.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Do you hear? Somebody is coming.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Following her.</i>] It is hardly two o'clock. Can it
be——?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>With terror.</i>] It is Julian's voice.—He is
coming in!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No, they have prevented him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Turns to Ernest, still frightened.</i>] If it were
Julian? [<i>Moves towards the bedroom door. Ernest
detains her respectfully.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Should it be he, stay here. Loyalty is our
shield. Were it one of those who distrust us—then
there, Teodora. [<i>Points to the door.</i>] Ah, nobody.
[<i>Listening.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> How my heart throbs!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> You need not be afraid. The person who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>wanted to come in has gone away—or it was an illusion.
For God's sake, Teodora——! [<i>Advances up the stage.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I had so much to say to you, Ernest, and the
time has passed so quickly.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> The time has flown.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I wanted——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Teodora, pray forgive me—but is it prudent? If
any one came in—and, indeed, I fear some one will.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> That is why I came—to prevent it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> So that——?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I know everything, and I am stricken with
horror at the thought that blood should be shed on my
account. My head is on fire, my heart is bursting.
[<i>Strikes her breast.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> It is the affront that burns and shames you until
my hand has struck at Nebreda's life. He wanted mud!
Well, let him have it stained with blood.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> You would kill him?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Certainly. [<i>Represses Teodora's movement of supplication.</i>]
You can dispose of me in all else but in this
one thing. Do not ask me to feel compassion for a man
whose insult I remember.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Prayerfully, with a sob.</i>] For my sake!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> For your sake?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> It would be such a horrible scandal.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> That is possible.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> You can say it so coolly, and not endeavour
to avoid it, not even when it is I who implore you!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I cannot avoid it, but I can chastise it: so I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>think and say, and this is my business. Others will
look for the insult, I for the punishment.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Coming nearer and speaking softly, as if afraid
of her own voice.</i>] And Julian?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Well?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> If he were to know about it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> He will know about it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> What will he say?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> What?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> That only my husband, the man who loves me,
has a right to defend me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Every honourable man has the right to defend a
lady. He may not even know her, be neither a friend,
nor a relative, nor a lover. It is enough for him to hear
a woman insulted. Why do I fight this duel? Why do
I defend her? Because I heard the calumny. Because
I am myself. Who is so base as to give his protection
by scale and measure? Was I not there? Then whoever
it was—I or another—who was first on the scene——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Listens eagerly, dominated by him, and holds out
her hand to him.</i>] This is noble and honourable, and worthy
of you, Ernest [<i>then restrains herself and moves
backward</i>]. But it leaves Julian humiliated [<i>with conviction</i>].</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> He? humiliated!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Most surely.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Why?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> For no reason whatever.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Who will say so?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Everybody.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> But wherefore?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> When the world hears of the affront, and learns
that it was not my husband who avenged me, and above
all [<i>drops her eyes ashamed</i>] that it was you who took his
place—have we not then a new scandal topping the old?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Convinced but protests.</i>] If one had always to
think of what people will say, by Heaven there would be
no manner or means of living then!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> It is so, nevertheless.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Just so. 'Tis horrible.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Then yield.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Impossible.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I beseech you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No. Looking into the matter, as nobody can
know what will happen, it is better that I should face
Nebreda. For, after all, if the fellow lack a sense of
honour, he can use a sword.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Wounded and humiliated in the protection
Ernest seems to offer Don Julian.</i>] My husband is not
lacking in courage.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Fatality again! Either I have expressed myself
ill, or you do not understand me. I know his worth.
But when a desperate injury lies between men of courage,
who knows what may happen? which of them may fall,
and which may kill? And if this man's sword must
strike Don Julian or Ernest, can you doubt which it
ought to be? [<i>Questions her with sad sincerity.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>In anguish</i>] You!—oh, no—not that either.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Why? If it is my fate? Nobody loses by my
death, and I lose still less.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> For Heaven's sake, do not say <a id='corr61.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='that'>that.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_61.31'><ins class='correction' title='that'>that.</ins></a></span> [<i>Barely able
to repress her sobs.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> What do I leave behind me? Neither friendship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>nor strong love. What woman is there to follow my
corpse shedding a lover's tears?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Last night I prayed for you—and you say that
nobody——I could not bear you to die. [<i>Vehemently.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Ah, we pray for any one; we only weep for one.
[<i>With passion.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Startled.</i>] Ernest!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Terrified by his own words.</i>] What!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Moving further away.</i>] Nothing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Also moving away and looking nervously down.</i>]
I told you a little while ago I was half mad. Do not
heed me. [<i>Pause. Both remain silent and pensive, at
some distance, not looking at each other.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Starting and glancing anxiously down the
stage.</i>] Again!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Following her movement.</i>] Somebody has come.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> They are trying to get in.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Listening.</i>] There can be no doubt of it. There,
Teodora. [<i>Points to the bedroom door.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> My honour is my shield.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> But it is not your husband.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Not Julian?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Leading her to the door.</i>] No.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I hoped——[<i>Detains him with an air of supplication.</i>]
Will you give up this duel?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Give it up? When I've struck him!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I didn't know that. [<i>Despairingly, but understands
that nothing can be done.</i>] Then fly.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I fly!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> For my sake, for his sake—for God's sake!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Despairingly.</i>] You must loathe me to propose
such a thing to me. Never!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> One word only. Are they coming for you now?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> It is not yet time.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Swear it to me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Yes, Teodora. And you—say you don't hate
me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Never.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Outside.</i>] Nothing. I must see him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Quickly.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Yes. [<i>Hides in the bedroom.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Why do you prevent me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Ah, calumny is working to make the lie truth.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Go to the devil—I will go in—Ernest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> What has happened?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> I hardly know how to tell you—yet I must——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Speak.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> My head is in a whirl. Christ above, who would
think——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Quickly. A clear account of what has happened.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> What has happened? A great misfortune. Don
Julian heard of the duel. He came here to look for you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and you were out. He went away to find the seconds,
and marched them off to Nebreda's house.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Nebreda's! How?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> The Lord send you sense. Don Julian's way, of
course, who makes short work of convention and the
will of others.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Go on——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Going to the door.</i>] They're coming, I believe.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Who?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> They—they're carrying Don Julian.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> You terrify me. Explain at once. [<i>Catches his
arm violently, and drags him forward.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> He compelled him to fight. There was no way
out of it. The viscount cried: 'Very well, between us
two.' It was settled it should take place here. Don
Julian came upstairs. Your servant sent him away,
protesting you were engaged with a lady, and swearing
nobody could enter.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> And then?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Don Julian went downstairs muttering 'better so.
I have the day's work for myself.' And he, my father,
Nebreda and the seconds came back together, and went
upstairs.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> They fought?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Furiously, as men fight when their intent is
deadly, and their enemy's heart is within reach of the
sword's point.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> And Don Julian! No—it must be a lie.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Here they are.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> The crisis is past at last. I hear nothing. Poor
Don Julian! He's in a sad way. His life hangs in the
balance: on one side death awaits him, and on the other
another death, that of the soul, of honour—either
abyss deeper than hopeless love. The devil! All
this tragedy is making me more sentimental than
that fellow with his plays and verses. The tune
of disaster, scandal, death, treason, and disgrace, hums
in my brain. By Jove, what a day, and what a night!
and the worst is yet to come. Well, it certainly was
madness to move him in his condition; but when once
my uncle gets an idea into his head, there's no
reasoning with him. And, after all, he was right. No
honourable man, in his place, could have stayed, and
he is a man of spirit. Who is coming? my mother,
I believe—yes.        <span class='direction'>[<i>Enter Doña Mercedes.</i>]</span></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Where's Severo?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> He has not left my uncle for a moment. I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>no idea he was so attached to him. If what I fear
should happen——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> How is your uncle?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> He suffers greatly, but says nothing. Sometimes
he calls out 'Teodora' in a low harsh voice, and
sometimes 'Ernest'; and then he tugs violently at the
sheets, and lies quiet again as a statue, staring vacantly
into space. Now his brow is bathed in the cold sweat of
death, and then fever seizes him. He sits up in bed,
listens attentively, and shouts that <em>he</em> and <em>she</em> are waiting
for him. He tries to jump out of bed to rush at them,
and all my father's entreaties and commands barely
suffice to restrain him or soothe him. There's no
quieting him. Anger races hot through his veins,
and thought is a flame. It is shocking, mother, to
see the bitter way his lips contract, and how his fingers
close in a vice, with head all wild, and pupils dilated
as though they drank in with yearning and despair
every shadow that floats around the chamber.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> How does your father bear it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> He groans and breathes of vengeance. He, too,
mutters the names of Teodora and Ernest. I hope to
God he will not meet either, for if he should, small
chance there is of restraining his fury.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Your father is a good man.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Yes, but with a temper——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> It is not easily aroused, however. But when
he has cause——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> With all due respect, he's then a very tiger.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Only when provoked.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> I don't know about other occasions, but this
time he certainly has provocation enough. And
Teodora?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> She is upstairs. She wanted to come down—and
cried—like a Magdalen.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Already! Repentant or erring?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Don't speak so. Unhappy girl, she is but a
child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Who, innocent and candid, sweet and pure and
meek, kills Don Julian. So that, if I am to accept your
word, and regard her as a child, and such is her work
on the edge of infancy, we may pray God in his
mercy to guard us from her when she shall have put
on years.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> She is hardly to be blamed. The infamy lies
with your fine friend—he of the dramas, the poet and
dreamer. He it is who is the culprit.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> I don't deny it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Where is he?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Where is he? At this moment racing about
the streets and public places, flying from his conscience,
and unable to get away from it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> He has a conscience?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> So it would seem.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Oh, what a tragedy</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> A misfortune!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Such a deception!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> A cruel one.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> What shocking treason!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Unparalleled.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Poor Julian!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Melancholy fate!    <span class='direction'>[<i>Enter servant.</i>]</span></p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE IV</h4>

<p class='c011'><i>Doña Mercedes, Pepito, and Ernest. Doña Mercedes seated
in the arm-chair, Pepito standing, and Ernest behind,
whom neither salute nor look at.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Hostile silence, anger, and contempt
Through no fault of my own, I now appear to them a
prodigy of evil and insolence, and they all despise me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Listen to me, Ernest. [<i>Turns round to him and
speaks in a hard voice.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Well.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> I have to tell you——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> To go away, perhaps.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Changing his tone.</i>] Good heavens! What a
notion! I only—wanted to ask you—if it is true
[<i>hunts for something to say</i>] that you afterwards—the
viscount, you know?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Gloomily looking away.</i>] Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> How did it happen?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I ran downstairs—half mad—I found them—we
went upstairs again—locked the door. Two men—two
witnesses—two swords—and afterwards—I hardly
know what happened. Swords clashed—there was a
cry—a thrust—blood spouted—an assassin stood—and
a man lay stretched on the ground.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> The devil! Sharp work. Did you hear, mother?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> More blood shed.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Nebreda deserved it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Approaching her.</i>] Mercedes, for pity's sake—one
word—Don Julian? How is he? If you could
know what my anguish is—my sorrow—what do they
say?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> That the wound, since his removal, is mortal,
and it would be worse for him if you went near the
bed of suffering and death. Leave this house.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I must see him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Go, instantly.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I will not.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> What insolence!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> It is befitting. [<i>To Pepito.</i>] Pardon me,
madam [<i>turning respectfully to Mercedes</i>]; you see I
am achieving the general opinion of me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> For pity's sake, Ernest——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Listen, Mercedes. When a man such as I am
is abused, and for no reason on earth treated as a blackguard,
and finds himself snared, with crime thrust upon
him, 'tis indeed a perilous case,—for others rather than
for himself. I, in this fierce struggle with miserable
fate, have lost honour, friendship and love, and have now
nothing more to lose but the shabby shreds of an insipid
and dreary existence. I have come here solely to know
if there is any hope—only for that—and then—but you
cannot deny me so slight a consolation? [<i>Pleading.</i>]
One word!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Very well. They say—that he is better.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> True? You are not deceiving me? You are
sure—quite sure? Oh! you are merciful, you are kind.
It is true, quite true! May God spare him! Not his
death. Let him live and be happy once more; let him
forgive me and embrace me once again! Only let me
see him. [<i>Falls into the arm-chair beside the table sobbing,
and covers his face with his hands. Pause.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> If your father should hear—if he should
come out. Courage, Ernest, be sensible. [<i>Doña
Mercedes and Pepito endeavour to screen Ernest.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> These nervous creatures are terrible. They sob
and kill in the same breath.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> If you see me crying, while sobs shake my
throat in an hysterical convulsion, and I seem as weak
as a child, or a woman, believe me, it is not for myself,
but for him—for her—for their lost happiness, for this
indelible blot upon their name,—for the affront I am
the cause of, in return for all their love and kindness.
It is not my fault, but my utter misfortune. That is
why I weep. My God, if I could wipe out this
wretched past with tears, I would gladly weep away my
blood to the last drop.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Silence, I implore!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> There, we will discuss tears and sorrows another
time.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> If everybody else is discussing them to-day, why
should we too not speak of them? The whole town is
astir and on tiptoe with excitement. It has swallowed
up, devoured and blighted three reputations, three
names, three persons, and floated them on the froth of
laughter and a wave of degrading chatter down the
straits of human misery, into the social abysm of shame,
where for ever lie engulfed the conscience, and fame, and
future of the unfortunates.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Not so loud, Ernest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Why? since the others are not murmurs, but
voices, that thunder through the air? The tragic event
is known all over the town, and each one has his own
way of telling it. Wonderful! everything is known
except the truth. 'Tis fatality. [<i>Doña Mercedes and
Pepito exhibit keen interest in hearing the reports.</i>] Some
say that Don Julian discovered Teodora in my rooms,
and that I attacked him in blind fury and killed him on
the spot. Others—and these would seem to be my friends,
since they raise me from the rank of vulgar assassin
to the noble level of duellist—aver that we fought
loyally like gentlemen. And there are others, again,
who have the tale more accurately, and recount how
Don Julian took my place in the arranged meeting with
Nebreda—that I arrived late on the scene—either from
design or fear, or because I was in the arms——but, no;
it would burn my lips to give this version—the thought
of it sets my brain on fire. Seek the basest, the vilest,
that which most blackens—the filth of the mind, the mire
of the soul, the dross of degraded consciences; cast it to
the wind as it whistles along the streets upon bespattering
tongues, and you will have the tale, and may see
what reputation remains for an innocent woman and
two honest men when the town takes to jabbering about
them.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> It is sad, I admit; but perhaps public opinion
is not altogether to blame.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Teodora did go to your rooms—she was there——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> To prevent the duel with Nebreda.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Then why did she hide herself?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Because we feared her presence would be misconstrued.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> The explanation is easy and simple. The difficult
thing, Ernest, is to get us to believe it, for there is
another still more easy and simple.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Which dishonours more, and that's the beauty
of it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Well, at least, admit that Teodora was giddy, if
not really culpable.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Guilt is prudent and cautious. On the other
hand, how imprudent is innocence!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Look here, if your rule holds good for everybody,
the worst of us is an angel or a saint.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> You are right. What does it matter? What is
the weight or value of such calumny? The worst of it
is that thought is degraded by mean contact with a
mean idea. From force of dwelling upon a crime, the
conscience becomes familiar with it. It shows itself
terrible and repellent—<i>but it shows itself</i>—at night, in
dark solitude! Yes—[<i>aside</i>] but what! why are they
listening to me so strangely, almost in suspense? [<i>Aloud</i>]
I am myself; my name is an honourable one. If I
killed Nebreda solely because of a lie, what would I not
do to myself if guilt threatened to give the truth to
calumny?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Aside to Mercedes.</i>] He denied it! Why, it is as
clear as daylight.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Aside to Pepito.</i>] He's wandering.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> 'Tis only his confession he's making.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Aloud.</i>] That will do, Ernest. Go, now.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Impossible, madam. I should go mad if I had
to spend to-night away from this sick-room—out of my
mind.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> But if Severo came and found you?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> What do I care? He is a loyal gentleman.
Better still, let him come. We fly from fear, and only
the guilty are afraid. Nothing will make me run away,
or acknowledge fear.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Listening.</i>] Somebody is coming.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Is it he?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Going down the stage.</i>] No, 'tis Teodora.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Teodora! Teodora! I want to see her.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Sternly.</i>] Ernest!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Yes, I must ask her to forgive me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> You don't remember——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I remember everything and understand. We
two together! Ah, no. Enough. You need not fear.
For her would I shed my blood, lay down my life,
sacrifice my future, honour—all! But see her? never.
'Tis no longer possible. The mist of blood has risen
between us. [<i>Goes out on the left.</i>]</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Teodora.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> It is you. [<i>Advances to her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Courage! what good does crying do?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> How is he? how is he? the truth!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Much better.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Will he recover?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> I think so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> My God! My life for his.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Draws her affectionately forward.</i>] And then—I
have faith in your good sense. I can measure your
remorse by your tears and anxiety.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Yes [<i>Doña Mercedes sits down with a satisfied
air</i>], I did wrong, I know, in going to see him [<i>Doña
Mercedes looks disappointed the confession is no worse</i>], but
last night you told me about the outrage and the duel.
I was grateful to you for doing so, although I did not
then suspect the harm you did me, nor could I now
explain it to you. Oh, what a night! [<i>Crosses her
hands and glances upward.</i>] I have cried and raved,
thinking of Julian's plight, of the scandal, of the violent
quarrel and the bloodshed. Everything passed before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>my eyes—and then—poor Ernest dying, perhaps, for my
sake! But why do you look at me so strangely? there
can be no harm in it, surely! Or are you unconvinced,
and do you think as the rest do?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>drily.</i>] I think your fear for that fellow's life
altogether superfluous.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Why? with so skilled an antagonist! You have
seen it—Julian——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Julian has been avenged. The man who
killed him no longer lives, so that you have been wasting
your fears and your tears. [<i>With deliberate hardness.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Eagerly.</i>] It was Ernest——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Yes, Ernest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> He met the viscount?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Face to face.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Unable to restrain herself.</i>] How noble and
brave!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Teodora!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> What do you mean? Tell me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Sternly.</i>] I can read your thought.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> My thought!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Which?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> You know very well.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Have I no right to be glad because Julian is
avenged? Is that an impulse I could be expected to
repress?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> That was not your feeling.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> You know so much more about it than I do!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Pointedly.</i>] Believe me, admiration is not far
from love.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> What do I admire?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> This youth's courage.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> His nobility.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Quite so, but that's the beginning.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> What folly!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> It <em>is</em> folly—but on your side.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> You persist! Ever this accursed idea!—while
it is with immense, with infinite pity that I am filled.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> For whom?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> For whom else but Julian?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Have you never learnt, Teodora, that in a
woman's heart pity and forgetfulness may mean one and
the same thing?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I beseech you—Mercedes—silence!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> I wish to let light in upon the state of your
mind,—to turn upon it the lamp of truth, lit by my
experience.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I hear you, but while I listen, it seems no
longer a sister, a friend, a mother that speaks to me, so
hateful are your words. Your lips seem to speak at
inspiration of the devil's prompting. Why should you
strive to convince me that little by little I am ceasing
to love my husband, and that more and more I am imbued
with an impure tenderness, with a feeling that
burns and stains? I who love Julian as dearly as ever,
who would give the last drop of blood in my body for a
single breath of life for him—for him, from whom I am
now separated—[<i>points to his room</i>]—why, I should like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>to go in there this moment, if your husband did not bar
my way, and press Julian once more in my arms. I
would so inundate him with my tears, and so close him
round with the passion of my love, that its warmth
would melt his doubts, and his soul would respond to
the fervour of mine. But it is not because I adore my
husband that I am bound to abhor the faithful and
generous friend who so nobly risked his life for me.
And if I don't hate him, is that a reason to conclude that
I love him? The world can think such things. I hear
such strange stories, and such sad events have happened,
and calumny has so embittered me, that I find myself
wondering if public opinion can be true,—in doubt of
myself. Can it be that I really am the victim of a
hideous passion, unconsciously influenced by it? and in
some sad and weak moment shall I yield to the senses,
and be subjugated by this tyrannous fire?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> You are speaking the truth?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Can you doubt it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> You really do not love him?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Mercedes, what words have I that will convince
you? At another time, such a question would
drive the blood of anger to my brow, and to-day, you
see, I am discussing with you whether I am honest or
not. Yes, am I really so? To the depth of the soul?
No, for endurance of this humiliation proves me worthy
of it. [<i>Hides her face in her hands and flings herself down
in the arm-chair.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Do not cry so, Teodora. I believe in you.
Enough. No more tears. Let me but add one more
word, and there's an end to the matter. Ernest is not
what you believe him to be. He is not worthy of your
trust.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> He is good, Mercedes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> No.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> He is fond of Julian.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> He would betray him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Again! My God!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> I no longer accuse you of responding to his
passion, but I only assert—I would warn you that <em>he
loves you</em>.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Rising in anger.</i>] Loves me!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> It is known to everybody. In this very room,
a moment ago, before Pepito and me—you understand?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> No, explain at once—what?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> He openly confessed it. He made a violent
declaration, swore that he was ready to sacrifice life,
honour, soul and conscience for you. And when you
came, he wanted to see you. He only yielded to the
force of my entreaties and went away. I tremble lest
he should meet Severo and their encounter lead to an
explosion. And you—what have you to say now?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Who has listened to Mercedes intently, held in
an indefinable gloomy terror.</i>] Heavens above! Can it
be true? and I who felt—who professed so sincere an
affection for him!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> There, you are on the point of crying again.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> The heart has no tears for the manifold deceptions
of this miserable life. A lad so pure and finely
natured,—and to see him now so debased and spotted!
And you say that he actually uttered those words here—he!—Ernest.
Oh, oh, Mercedes! send him away from
this house.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Ah, that is what I wanted. Your energy
consoles me. [<i>With evidence of honest satisfaction.</i>] Pardon
me—now I fully believe you. [<i>Embraces her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> And before? No? [<i>The actress must strongly
accentuate this line.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Hush! He is coming back.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Impetuously.</i>] I will not see him. Tell him
so. Julian expects me. [<i>Goes to the right.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Detaining her.</i>] Impossible! You must
know it. He will not heed my orders, and now that I
understand so fully how you feel for him, I should be
glad to have him suffer at your hands the contempt he
has already endured at mine.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Then leave me.     <span class='direction'>[<i>Enter Ernest.</i>]</span></p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Teodora!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Aside to Teodora.</i>] It is late, do your duty
quickly. [<i>Aloud to Ernest.</i>] The command you heard a
little while ago from me, you will receive again from
Teodora's lips, and she is the mistress of this house.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>In a low voice to Mercedes.</i>] Don't go away.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>To Teodora.</i>] Are you afraid?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I afraid! I am afraid of nothing. [<i>Makes a sign
for her to go. Exit Doña Mercedes on the right.</i>]</p>

    <div><i>Teodora and Ernest.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> The command was—that I should go away.
[<i>Pause. Both remain silent without looking at each other.</i>]
And you? Are you going to repeat it? [<i>Teodora nods,
but still does not look at him.</i>] Have no fear, Teodora.
I will respect and obey your order. [<i>Submissively.</i>]
The others could not get me to obey them, little as they
may like to hear it [<i>harshly</i>], but nothing you could
say, even though you wound me—From you I will
endure anything! [<i>Sadly.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I wound you! No, Ernest, you cannot believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>that—— [<i>Still does not look at him, is half vexed and
afraid.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I do not believe it. [<i>Pause.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Adieu. I wish you all happiness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Adieu, Teodora. [<i>Remains waiting for a moment
to see if she will turn and offer him her hand. Then walks
down the stage, turns back again, and approaches her.
Teodora shows that she feels his movement, and is distressed,
but continues to keep her face averted.</i>] If with
my death at this very instant I could blot out all the
misery that lies to my account, not through any fault of
mine, but through an implacable fate, I should not now
be standing here alive. You may believe it on the word
of an honourable man. No shadow of the past would
remain,—neither sighs nor pain to remember, nor that
sorrowful pallor of your face [<i>Teodora starts and glances
at him in terror</i>], nor the grieved fear of those eyes, nor
sobs that tear the throat, nor tears that line the cheek.
[<i>Teodora sobs.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Aside, moving further away.</i>] Mercedes was
right, and I, blind and thoughtless that I was——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Bid me good-bye—once—for kindness's sake.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Good-bye! Yes; and I forgive you all the
injury you have done us.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I, Teodora!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Yes, you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> What a look! What a tone!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> No more, Ernest, I beseech you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> What have I done to deserve——?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> It is all over between us. Regard me as one
who no longer exists for you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Is this contempt?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Go.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Go? in this way?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> My husband is dying in there—and here I feel
as if I too were dying. [<i>Staggers back and clutches the
arm-chair to keep from falling.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Teodora. [<i>Rushes forward to support her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>Angrily drawing herself away.</i>] Don't touch
me. [<i>Pause.</i>] Ah, I breathe again more freely. [<i>Tries
to walk, staggers again weakly, and a second time Ernest
offers to assist her. She repulses him.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Why not, Teodora?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Your touch would soil me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I soil you!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Exactly.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I! [<i>Pause.</i>] What does she mean, Almighty
God! She also! Oh, it is not possible! Oh, death is preferable
to this—It cannot be true—I am raving—Say it
is not true, Teodora—only one word—for justice—one
word of pardon, of pity, of consolation, madam. I am
resigned to go away, never to see you again, although
'twere to break, and mutilate, and destroy my life. But
it will, at least, be bearable if I may carry into solitude
your forgiveness, your affection, your esteem—only your
pity, then. So that I still may think you believe me
loyal and upright—that I could not, that I have not
degraded you, much less be capable of insulting you. I
care nothing about the world, and despise its affronts.
Its passions inspire me with the profoundest disdain.
Whether its mood be harsh or cruel, however it may
talk of me and of what has happened, it will never
think so ill of me as I do of it. But you, the purest
dream of man's imagining—you for whom I would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>gladly give,—not only my life, but my right to heaven,
ay, a thousand times—eagerly, joyously,—You, to suspect
me of treason, of hypocrisy! Oh, this, Teodora—I
cannot bear! [<i>Deeply moved, speaks despairingly.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>With increasing nervousness.</i>] You have not
understood me, Ernest. We must part.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> But not like this!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Quickly, for mercy's sake. Julian suffers.
[<i>Points to the sick-room.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> I know it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Then we should not forget it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No; but I also suffer.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> You, Ernest! why?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Through your contempt.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I feel none.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> You have expressed it</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> It was a lie.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No; not entirely. So that our sufferings are
not equal. In this implacable strife <em>he</em> suffers as those
on earth suffer, <em>I</em> as those in hell.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Spare me, Ernest—my head is on fire.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> And my heart aches.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> That will do, Ernest. I entreat you to pity me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> That was all I asked of you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Mercy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Yes, mercy. But why should you claim it?
What is it you fear? of what are you thinking?
[<i>Approaches her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Forgive me if I have offended you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Offended me, no! The truth, that is what I
crave,—and I implore it on my knees. See, Teodora,
my eyes are wet. [<i>Bends his knee before her and takes
her hand. Don Julian's door opens, and Don Severo
stands staring at them.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Miserable pair!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Don Severo!</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE VIII</h4>

<p class='c011'><i>Teodora, Ernest, and Don Severo. Ernest stands apart on
the right. Don Severo places himself between him and
Teodora.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> [<i>In a low voice of concentrated anger, so that
Don Julian may not hear.</i>] I can find no word or epithet
adequate to the passion of contempt I would express, so
I must be content to call you a blackguard. Leave this
house at once.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Also in a low voice.</i>] My respect for Teodora,
for this house, and for the sick man lying in yonder
room, sir, compels me to put my retort—in silence.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> [<i>Ironically, under the impression that Ernest
is going.</i>] It's the best thing you can do—obey and
hold your tongue.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> You have not understood me. I do not intend
to obey.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> You remain?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Until Teodora commands me to go. I was on
the point of going away for ever a moment ago, but the
Almighty or the devil deterred me. Now you come and
order me out, and as if your insult were an infernal
message, it roots my heels to the floor in revolt.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> We'll see that. There are servants to kick you
out, and sticks if necessary.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Try it. [<i>Approaches Don Severo with a threatening
air. Teodora rushes between them.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Ernest! [<i>Turns commandingly to Don Severo.</i>]
You seem to forget that this is my house as long as my
husband lives and is its owner. Only one of us two has
the right to command here. [<i>Softens to Ernest.</i>] Not for
him—but for my sake, because I am unhappy——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Unable to contain his joy at hearing himself
defended by Teodora.</i>] You wish it, Teodora?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I beg it. [<i>Ernest bows and turns away.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Your audacity confounds and shocks me as much—no,
far more, than his. [<i>Strides menacingly towards her.
Ernest turns swiftly round, then makes a strong effort to
control himself and moves away again.</i>] You dare to
raise your head, wretched woman, and before me too!
Shame on you! [<i>Ernest repeats previous movements and
gestures, but this time more accentuated.</i>] You, so fearful
and cowardly, where have you found courage to display
this energy in his defence? How eloquent is passion!
[<i>Ernest stands, looking back.</i>] But you forget that, before
pitching him out, I had the authority to forbid the door
of this house to you, who have stained its threshold with
Julian's blood. Why have you returned? [<i>Seizes her
brutally and drags her roughly toward himself.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No, I can't stand this—I cannot! [<i>He thrusts
himself between Severo and Teodora.</i>] Off, you scoundrel.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Again!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Again.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> You have dared to return?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> You insolently affront Teodora. I still live.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>What do you expect me to do, if not return and chastise
you, and brand you as a coward?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Precisely.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> No!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> He has brought it on himself. I have seen him
lift his hand in anger to you—you, you! So now——
[<i>Seizes Don Severo violently.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> You impudent puppy!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> True, but I'll not release you. You loved and
respected your mother, I presume. For that reason
you must respect Teodora, and humbly bow before a
sorrow so immense as hers. This woman, sir, is purer,
more honest than the mother of such a man as you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> This to me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Yes, and I have not yet done.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> Your life——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Oh, my life, as much as you like—but afterwards.
[<i>Teodora endeavours to part them, but he pushes
her gently away, without releasing Don Severo.</i>] You
believe in a God—in a Maker—in hope. Well, then, as
you bend your knee before the altar of that God above,
so will I compel you to kneel to Teodora,—and that instantly,
sir. Down—in the dust.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> For mercy's sake——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> To the ground! [<i>Forces Don Severo to kneel.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Enough, Ernest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> A thousand thunders.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> At her feet!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> You!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Yes, I.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> For her?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> For her.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> That will do. Hush! [<i>She points in terror to
Don Julian's door. Ernest releases Don Severo, who rises
and moves backward. Teodora retreats and forms with
Ernest a group in the background.</i>]</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> It is the fever of your blood and the delirium of

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Fever, yes. And since fever is fire, it has

now!—but why these glances at one another? Why,

There are no tears in them to make them shine. Come
nearer—nearer to me. [<i>Draws Ernest to him, bends his

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Forgive me, forgive me!</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> My father.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Disloyal! Traitor!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> No, father.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Here is my shameful seal upon your cheek—To-day
with my hand—soon with steel—so! [<i>With a
supreme effort strikes Ernest. Ernest jumps up with a
terrible cry, and turns away, covering his face.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Oh!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> [<i>Stretches out his hand to Ernest.</i>] Justice.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> My God! [<i>Hides her face in both hands, and
drops on a chair.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> [<i>Turning to Ernest to exculpate Don Julian.</i>]
It was only delirium.</p>

<p class='c028'>[<i>These four exclamations very hurried. A moment of
stupor. Don Julian stands still staring at Ernest,
and Doña Mercedes and Don Severo endeavour to
calm him.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> It was not delirium, it was chastisement,
Heaven be praised. What did you think, ungrateful
boy?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> That will do.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Come, Julian.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian</span> Yes, I am going. [<i>Is led away with difficulty
between Don Severo and Dona Mercedes, and stops to look
back at Teodora and Ernest.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mercedes.</span> Quickly, Severo.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Look at them, the traitors! It was only
justice—was it not? Say so—at least I believe it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> For God's sake, Julian—well, at any rate, for
<i>mine</i>——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> Yes, for yours, Severo, only for yours. You
alone have loved me truly. [<i>Embraces him.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Yes, yes, it is so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>Stops at the door and looks back again.</i>] She
is crying for him—and does not follow me. Not even
a look. She does not see that I am dying—yes,
dying.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Julian, Julian!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Julian.</span> [<i>On the threshold.</i>] Wait, wait. Dishonour
for dishonour. Good-bye, Ernest.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Then I will. [<i>Rushes to the door.</i>]</p>

<h4 class='c020'>LAST SCENE</h4>

<p class='c011'><i>Teodora, Ernest, Don Severo and Pepito. Ernest stands on
the right in the middle of the stage, Teodora near the door
of Don Julian's room. Pepito and, behind him, Don
Severo, bar the way.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> Where are you going?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> [<i>In desperation.</i>] I must see him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> It is impossible.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> She cannot pass. This woman must not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>remain in my house—turn her out at once. [<i>To Pepito.</i>]
No compassion—this very moment.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> What!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> My mind is wandering.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Though your mother should stand in front
of that woman, Pepito, you have my orders. Obey
them. Never mind her prayers or supplications. If
she should cry—then let her cry. [<i>With concentrated
fury.</i>] Away with her, away—else I might kill her.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Julian orders——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Yes, Julian.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Her husband! It cannot be.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> I must see him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Very well. Look at him, once more—and
then—depart.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Interfering.</i>] Father——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> [<i>Pushing him away.</i>] Stop, sir.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> It can't be true.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> This is too horrible.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> It is a lie.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Come, Teodora—come and see. [<i>Seizes her
arm and leads her to the door.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Teodora.</span> Oh! My husband! Julian—dead. [<i>Staggers
shudderingly back, and falls half senseless.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Covering his face.</i>] My father! [<i>Pause. Don
Severo watches them rancorously.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> [<i>To his son.</i>] Turn her out.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> [<i>Placing himself before Teodora.</i>] What cruelty!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Doubting.</i>] Sir——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span><span class='sc'>Severo.</span> [<i>To Pepito.</i>] Such are my orders. Do you
doubt my word?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Pity.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> [<i>Pointing to the death-chamber.</i>] Yes, such
pity as she showed him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Fire races through my veins. I will leave
Spain, sir.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> It makes no difference.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> She will die.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> Life is short.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> For the last time——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> No more. [<i>To his son.</i>] Ring.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> But I tell you she is innocent. I swear it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Interceding.</i>] Father——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> [<i>With a contemptuous gesture.</i>] That fellow
lies.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> You impel me with the current. Then I will
not struggle against it. I go with it. I cannot yet
know what may be her opinion [<i>pointing to Teodora</i>] of
others, and of your outrages. Her lips are silent, mute
her thoughts. But what I think of it all—yes, I will
tell you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> It is useless. It won't prevent me from——
[<i>Approaches Teodora.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Pepito.</span> [<i>Restraining him.</i>] Father——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Stay. [<i>Pause.</i>] Let nobody touch this woman.
She is mine. The world has so desired it, and its
decision I accept. It has driven her to my arms.
Come, Teodora. [<i>He raises her, and sustains her.</i>] You
cast her forth from here. We obey you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span><span class='sc'>D. Severo.</span> At last, you blackguard!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ernest.</span> Yes; now you are right. I will confess now.
Do you want passion? Then passion and delirium.
Do you want love? Then love—boundless love. Do
you want more? Then more and more. Nothing
daunts me. Yours the invention, I give it shelter. So
you may tell the tale. It echoes through all this heroic
town. But should any one ask you who was the
infamous intermediary in this infamy, you will reply
'ourselves, without being aware of it, and with us the
stupid chatter of busybodies.' Come, Teodora; my
mother's spirit kisses your pure brow. Adieu, all. She
belongs to me, and let heaven choose its day to judge
between you and me. [<i>Gathers Teodora into his
embrace, with a glance of defiance around.</i>]</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Scene</span>—<i>Don Lorenzo's study, octagon form. Fire lighting,
over mantel-piece a large mirror in black frame L.
Below, a door. Door and window R. Principal entrance
in background. Book-shelves well filled R and L. Writing-desk

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE I</h4>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Seated at table reading attentively.</i>]
'Mercy, my niece,' replied Don Quixote, 'is that which
God this moment has shown me, despite my sins.
Already my mind is clear and free, unclogged of the
obscurities of ignorance, which my unhappy and incessant
readings of those detestable books of chivalry cast
upon me like a heavy shadow. Already have I sounded
the depth of their delusions and absurdities, and I now
regret nothing but that this awakening should have
come so late that I have no longer time to seek compensation
in reading those other books which are the
light of the soul. I feel myself on the point of death,
dear niece. I should like to depart in such a way that
my life would not appear so evil as to obtain for me the
reputation of madness; that, though it is true I have
been mad, my death should not confirm its truth.'
[<i>Stops reading, and remains a while in thought.</i>] Folly!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>To struggle without truce or rest in this fierce battle of
life for justice as Cervantes' immortal hero struggled
in the world of his imagining! Folly! To love with
an infinite love, and with the divine beauty of our desire
ever beyond our reach, as was the Dulcinea he so
passionately loved! Folly! To walk with the soul ever
fronting the ideal, along the rough and prosaic path of
human realities, which is like running after one of
heaven's stars through crags and rocky places. Folly!
Yes, so the doctors tell us; but of so inoffensive a form,
and, upon the face of it, so little likely to prove contagious,
that, to make an end of it, we do not need
another Quixote. [<i>Pause. Rises and walks to the middle
of the stage, where he stands thinking.</i>]</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE II</h4>

<p class='c011'><i>Don Lorenzo, Doña Ángela, and Dr. Tomás. The latter
two stand at door on R., half-hidden by the curtains, and
watch Don Lorenzo, whose back is toward them.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Look at him! as usual, reading and
thinking.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Madam, your husband is a sage, but wisdom
may be overdone. For, if the tenser be the cord, the
more piercing its notes, so the much easier is it to break.
And when it breaks, to the divine note succeeds eternal
silence. While the brain works in sublime spasms,
madness is on the watch—don't forget it. [<i>Pause.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Strange book! Book of inspiration!
How many problems Cervantes, unknowing perhaps,
has propounded therein! The hero was mad, yes, mad
[<i>pause</i>], he who only gave ear to the voice of duty upon
the march of life; he who ceaselessly subjugated his
passions, silenced his affections, and knew no other rule
than justice, no other law than truth—and to truth and
justice conformed each action: who, with a sacrilegious
ambition, strove to attain the perfection of God above.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>What a singular being he would appear in any human
society! A new Quixote among so many Sanchos!
Having to condemn the greed of this one, the vanity of
that, the good fortune of this other, the uncontrolled
appetites of another, and the frailties of all; in his own
family, like the Knight Errant's housekeeper and
niece; in his own friends not differing from the priest,
the barber, and Samson Carrasco. And strong men and
maidens, dukes and inn-keepers, Moors and Christians
with one voice declaring him mad, until he himself
should end by taking himself as such, or dying, feign to
think so, that at least he might be left to die in peace.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Approaches Lorenzo, and places an arm on his
shoulder. Doña Ángela also comes near.</i>] Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Turning round.</i>] Tomás!—Ángela!—you
were here?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Yes; we were listening to part of your philosophical
monologue. What has provoked these sublime
self-revealings of my good friend?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I have been reading <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Don Quixote</cite></span>, and
it has gone to my head, and there got mixed with the
other tags of modern philosophy which are floating
about, as my hard-hearted doctor would say, in the cells
of grey substance.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> So would anybody else say who wished to
talk the language of reason.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> How dreadful! Are you two going to
begin one of your interminable discussions on positivism,
idealism, and all the other <em>isms</em> of the dictionary, which
are so many abysses for common sense?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Don't be afraid, madam. I have something
more interesting to say to Lorenzo.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>To Dr. Tomás.</i>] And I have also something
more urgent to ask you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> I should think so indeed. Our child's
health is surely more interesting and urgent than the
follies and delusions with which your head is crammed.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Anxiously.</i>] How is my beloved girl
to-day?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Yes, how do you find Inés? [<i>Pause.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Do tell us. Don't keep us in suspense.
[<i>Pause. Dr. Tomás shakes his head ominously</i>.]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> For heaven's sake, doctor, tell me if there
be any danger.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What are you saying, Ángela? Don't
pronounce the word.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Softly, softly. You go too far. I don't, however,
say that it is nothing serious.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Oh, what <em>do</em> you mean?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What is the matter with her? Has the
illness a name?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> What are the remedies?—for I suppose
it is curable. Oh, Dr. Tomás, you must indeed cure my
child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> What is her malady? One of those that
causes the greatest misfortune to mankind. What is its
name? The poets call it love—we doctors give it
another name. How is it cured? This very day, with
the aid of the priest; and so excellent a specific is this,
that after a month's appliance neither of the wedded
pair retain a vestige of remembrance of the fatal sickness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> What nonsense you do talk, Dr. Tomás!
You had almost emptied my veins of their blood.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Well, to be serious. Given the condition
of the young lady, her nervous temperament, her
extreme susceptibility, and her romantic passion, the
malady must be regarded as grave. And if you
don't very speedily seek a remedy in the sweet security
of marriage, my friend, I am grieved to say it, but duty
compels me to inform you, that you need not count upon
Inés. [<i>Gravely.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Tomás!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> You really believe——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> I believe that Inés has inherited her father's
excitable and fantastical imagination. To-day the fever
of love runs like a fiery wave in her veins. If you don't
marry her to Edward,—and that very soon—and she
should be given to understand that her hopes are not
destined to be realised, though I cannot predict in what
way, I unhappily know that the delirium of fantasy,
and the violence of her affection will eventually
kill her.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Good God!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> My poor child!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> You have my opinion, and I have given it
in plain language as the urgency of the case demands,
as well as my friendship for you, and our joint affection
for the innocent child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>To Don Lorenzo in a resolute tone.</i>]
You have heard? We must marry Inés to Edward.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I would like it well indeed, Ángela.
Edward is a good fellow, very intelligent, and passionately
attached to our girl, but——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> But what? Are we not also noble, and
why should Edward's mother, the Duchess of Almonte,
oppose the union? And what matter if she does, since
it is he, and not she, that is to be married?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Ángela, think well upon it. Ought we
to encourage a son in revolt against his mother?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> <em>You</em> think well upon it. Lorenzo, ought
we to sacrifice our child to that woman's vanity?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> It is easy enough to lament vanity and
misfortune. The important thing is to find a remedy
against evil.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Why not speak to the duchess? They
say she is a kind woman, apart from her aristocratic
pretensions, and that she idolises Edward. Let us go
to her, and beseech and implore her.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I beseech! I implore! Humiliate
myself! It is certainly not my place to entreat for her
son's hand. She it is who should come to my house
and beg for that of my daughter. Social convention,
the respect of woman, and my own honour ordain it so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Here you see the philosopher, the sage,
the perfect man overflowing with vanity and pride.
[<i>Goes over to Dr. Tomás who is standing at table
reading.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You are unjust, Ángela. It is not pride,
but common dignity—yes, dignity. It is not honourable
to us to go a-begging on Inés' behalf the ducal coronet
another family chooses to withhold from her—she who
wears herself a far fairer crown. I repeat, it would not
be to our credit to go from door to door, still less to
emblazoned doors, with hands held out for the alms
of a name, when Inés bears my name, as good, as
untarnished and honourable as any other, however
great it may be.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Lorenzo is right—you, too, madam, are right.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Never mind, you need not go. Preserve
intact your dignity of sage and philosopher. I who
am only a poor mother will go. It will not hurt me to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>go from door to door a-begging, not coronets, nor
coats of arms, but the life and happiness of my child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Nor will it me, Ángela. You it is who
are right. Let the world say what it will. Let the
duchess think what she will, I will go. [<i>To Dr. Tomás.</i>]
It is my duty, is it not? Your judgment is upright
and austere, and you can pronounce dispassionately.
Give me your frank opinion.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Ah, what a man! Now don't stay to
discuss whether or no you ought to go. These things,
my lord philosopher and husband, are decided by the
heart, and not by the head. It is something to be
thankful for that you have not gone back to your
books to seek solution of the problem. It is a wonder
you are not hunting among the German metaphysicians,
or the Greek classics, or in that unintelligible tangle
of mathematics, to see if any author by chance has
treated of the future marriage of Miss Inés de
Avendaña with Edward de Almeida, Duke of Almonte,
proving the insuperable difficulties by <em>a</em> plus <em>b</em>, and for
the sake of <em>a</em> plus <em>b</em> you would meanwhile let my poor
child die.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Don't turn me into ridicule, Angela.
You know I adore Inés.</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE III</h4>

<p class='c011'><i>Don Lorenzo, Ángela, Dr. Tomás, and Inés. Inés enters by
door on R. as Don Lorenzo utters these words, and stands
still on hearing her own name.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> For her life! For her happiness! Why,
to dry one tear of her eyes would I give all those my
own could shed. For one bright hour for my Inés
would I gladly turn all the remaining hours of my life
into martyrdom. [<i>Inés, without being seen by the rest,
holds out her arms to her father lovingly, and kisses her</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span><i>hand to him.</i>] There, say no more upon the subject.
This very day will I go and see the duchess. I will
implore, supplicate, humiliate myself if necessary, and
she must yield. She won't? [<i>Joyous movement of Inés.
Doña Ángela effusively takes her husband's hand.</i>]
Well, if I have not got titles, I have at least a name,
which, though I may not be able to make it illustrious
by work and study——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> It is illustrious, my dear fellow.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Illustrious, no—but respectable, yes.
Besides, I have some millions that I have inherited,
and which I will make over to the duchess and to
Edward, that they may be enabled thereby to renovate
a coronet somewhat the worse for wear. So you may
be sure of it. Inés will be happy, and her happiness
will be ours.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> And yours—also ours, who live in you—you,
my husband, who are, when science does not blunt
your sense, the best, the kindest, and most loving of
men.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Oh, heavens! [<i>Gives signs of faintness, and leans
against door.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Rushes over to her.</i>] Inés, my child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Inés, Inés! What's the matter?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Approaching.</i>] Come, girl, what nonsense
is this?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>Sits down on sofa R., the rest stand around her.</i>]
Nothing. It's nothing—it is only—I feel I would like
to laugh, and tears instantly rise to my eyes—and then
I want to cry, and I feel so glad, so happy that I
cannot. It is because I am fond, very fond of you,
father. [<i>Embraces him affectionately.</i>] How kind you
are, and how good God has made you! I am happy,
very happy. [<i>Throws herself sobbingly into her mother's
arms.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> That's it, my girl, weep. It will do you
good. See how kind your father is. You must love
him dearly.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> With all my heart. When are you going? To-day?
Is it not so?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Laughing at her fond assurances.</i>] Ah,
selfish girl! We are very fond of papa when he does
something to please us? But if he did not go to the
duchess's, should we be quite so fond of him—quite!—as
now?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Just the same.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Doubtingly.</i>] Quite the same?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>Maliciously.</i>] It is possible I should be so sad
that I might not think of saying it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> I thought so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Before, I felt something weigh upon my breast,
and choke me. Now, without any effort—thus—spontaneously—as
delicious tears of happiness flow—endearing
words break from me. Before, I was only able to
say: 'unhappy I, father!' Now, I don't think of myself,
I think of him, and my heart rises to my lips upon a
cry of love—'how dear you are to me!' [<i>Again
embraces her father.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Inés, my daughter!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> And you also, mother, you also. [<i>Embraces Doña
Ángela. Don Lorenzo and Dr. Tomás move away from
sofa, where Doña Ángela and Inés remain seated, and come
to the middle of the stage.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Poor philosopher! Neither of those two
has read a single page of all your books, and both know
more than you do. You think yourself strong, and in
their hands you are as soft as wax. You think yourself
a sage, and in their arms you are an innocent, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to say a fool. You think yourself just and uncorruptible,
and upon the will of those two women you could
be led into any injustice or weakness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> No, Tomás. When I am sustained by
principle my will is iron.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> I don't say 'we shall see,' because they are
both angels—but, alas! if they were other! Permit
me to parody the great poet, and exclaim with him:
'Temptation, thy name is woman!'</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Energetically.</i>] 'Words, words, words,'
he said before that, doubtless, in prescience of the
parody.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> There you are, up on the rostrum already.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Don't tease papa.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> The doctor's sallies don't annoy me,
child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> This is where we stand—that for affection,
for friendship, for love, for what you call the mysterious
attraction of one soul for another, we can and should
arrive at——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Even sacrifice—yes. But never do
wrong.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> A pretty maxim for a book on morality.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> A still better one for the conscience.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> And are there no cases in which, to prevent
greater misfortunes, one may compromise with this
Cato's conscience, for just a little, a very little fault,
hardly as big as a grain of sand?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Once accepted, your grain would quickly
weigh as heavily as a mountain of granite.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Now, you are up the mountains. The rostrum
does not suffice.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> That will do, Dr. Tomás. You mustn't say such
things to papa.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Let us sum up the matter. It is war to the
knife against all evil under any form or disguise whatsoever.
Not so?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> So it is.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Then let us instantly apply your theory.
But truly I had forgotten it, and it is quite a romance.
Lend me your attention. Listen, ladies. [<i>Doña Ángela
and Inés approach.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What is it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> To-day a woman begged me to take you in
her name——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> A kiss.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> To him?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> To me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Yes. [<i>To Doña Ángela.</i>] But don't be alarmed,
dear madam. It is the kiss of an aged dame, and it comes
drenched in tears. 'Tis but the last and dolorous contraction
of dying lips,—the final adieu of a being who,
in a few brief hours, will have breathed her last.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I cannot imagine——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> She—this poor woman—sent for me this
morning. I mounted to the garret where she lies dying.
She named herself, otherwise I should never have recognised
her. She swore she was innocent, and all the
same begged me to intercede with you for her pardon.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You are talking a language not one word
of which do I understand.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Do you remember your mother's death?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What a question! I never knew my
father. He died when I was an infant. But my
mother! Ah, poor mother! [<i>With emotion.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Do you remember how, suddenly feeling herself
in the throes of death, she wanted to speak to you
and could not; and then in a kind of convulsion seized
the locket she always wore round her neck and put it
into your hands, fixing you with the supreme anguish of
her gaze already dimmed with the eternal shadow?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes, I remember. Continue.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Finally, you remember that upon your
mother's death you lost consciousness, when the locket
disappeared. You have not forgotten who was accused
of the robbery?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> She! It is she? my poor nurse, Juana!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Yes, it is indeed that same Juana who is
dying a few yards off in a miserable garret—Juana who
implores your pardon in the sad kiss she sends you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Juana, my second mother, who for
twenty-five years was a real mother to me. But why do
you speak of pardon? What compromise can there be
here with wrong? Forgiveness is no compromise, nor
does the poor old creature need my forgiveness. She
capable—impossible!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Not so impossible. When the maid who
had care of your mother's jewels notified the loss of the
magnificent locket in diamonds to the police, and the
first investigation was made, Juana denied having it, and
yet it was subsequently discovered that she had taken
it from you when you fainted. Two days afterwards
she was surprised concealing it behind a porcelain vase.
She was arrested, you remember, condemned, and
suffered imprisonment for the robbery, and only through
your influence and strong recommendation, recovered,
if not her lost honour, at least her liberty.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Firing.</i>] All the same, I persist in saying
that Juana accused, Juana on the bench of infamy,
Juana in shameful seclusion, was innocent, and that
human justice erred.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Appearances——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Not infrequently deceive.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Then how do you explain it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> There must be an explanation. There is
some mystery which we do not understand.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>To Doña Ángela.</i>] Now he is off on the
hunt of mysteries—in a search for a supernatural explanation
of an act that to my mind finds a very
natural and simple explanation in human frailty.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> But I know that my poor nurse was
incapable of an action so base. I would have defended
her if the illness that prostrated me after my mother's
death had not prevented me. And as soon as I obtained
her freedom, the poor woman disappeared, which fact
caused me many a bitter tear. God knows how unweariedly
I sought her everywhere. God knows how I
longed for her return to me—and she!—how cruel of
her! Why did she not come back? No, Juana, my
good friend, you must not die until I have clasped you
once more in my arms, until I have given you back
your farewell kiss. [<i>With increasing agitation touches a
bell and servant in livery appears.</i>] Say—a carriage—at
once—instantly—I am going to bring her back here—this
very moment. Do you not feel that it is my duty,
Ángela—and you, too, Inés?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> In any case it is a work of charity.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> It is a just reparation. [<i>Exit by door L.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> He is the best of men, and the most
credulous. He will believe, as an article of faith, anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>that the poor old creature may tell him. He
will even help her to invent some extravagant tale.
Ah, madam, we ought to make an examination
of this library like that great and witty one the
priest and barber made of the ingenious hidalgo's
library.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Oh, if I only could.</p>
<div class='c021'>[<i>Enter Don Lorenzo in out-door dress on L.</i>]</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Well, I'm off. You will come too, to help
me to bring her back. [<i>To Dr. Tomás.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> I am yours to command.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Do you think it safe to move her?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> The unfortunate woman is sinking rapidly.
She is just as likely to die in her garret as on the
cushions of your carriage, or crossing the threshold
of this, to her, enchanted palace. It is, however, quite
possible that joy may revive her, and lend her another
few hours of existence.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Then come along. Good-bye, Ángela;
good-bye, Inés.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Good-bye. [<i>Caressingly.</i>] And afterwards you will
go to see the duchess, won't you?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes, child, afterwards. You can wait, but
not so that poor woman. She comes first, Inés.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Apart to Dr. Tomás.</i>] Can you assure
me that my daughter runs no risks if we marry her?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Only those of marriage, madam, which are
none of the slightest.</p>

<p class='c032'>[<i>Exeunt Doña Ángela and Dr. Tomás by door C. talking

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> He will speak this very day to the duchess. He
has promised, and he may be relied upon, for he never
breaks his word. That is settled, then. He will see her,
and my father speaks so well! Why, is he not a man
of vast learning? He is certain to convince her. If
such a man as he were not able to persuade the duchess
that Edward and I ought to be married, of what avail
his having studied so much? Why possess so many
books in French, in Italian, in German, and even in
Greek? Such futile learning! But no, he will twist her
round his finger. Besides, they all say that she is a
saint. How could she be anything else, being Edward's
mother? A saint, do they say? But if, being such, she
refused to allow Edward to marry me, what sort of
sanctity would her's be? and of what its use? What
nonsense! of course we shall be married—why, we must,
and it is I who say it. [<i>Pause.</i>] It seems impossible—like
a dream. Good gracious, if it should prove a dream,
then let me never awake. But it is no dream. This is
my father's study. Those are his books. [<i>Approaches
the bookcase.</i>] Newton, Kant, Hegel, Humboldt, Shakespeare,
Lagrange, Plato, St. Thomas—It is very certain
that if it were a dream I should not remember all those
names, for what do I know of such illustrious gentlemen?
[<i>Looks over balcony.</i>] I can be sure that it is no dream,
for there is rain falling, falling. What a delightful thing
rain is! The air seems converted into little bars of
crystal. And in yonder mirror I can see myself. [<i>Goes
over to looking-glass with coquettish play.</i>] It is certainly
myself whom I know so well. I, with my oval face,
which Edward finds so perfect. Fancy his taste! with
my hazel eyes, which Edward finds so lovely. Was there
ever such another as he for telling pretty lies? But truly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>at this moment, what with delight and the heat of the fire,
my eyes do shine with an extraordinary brightness. I
should like to be pretty—prettier than ever—for his sake,
for his dear sake. But why does he not come? It is very
late. Now that I want so much to see him, he won't
come. You see he won't come—men are so selfish and
horrid.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Submissively.</i>] I always come at two o'clock.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Is it possible? [<i>Looks at his watch.</i>] No, my

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ines.</span> [<i>Authoritatively.</i>] It is three o'clock.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Shows her his watch.</i>] A quarter to two. Are
you convinced? [<i>Points to the clock on mantelpiece.</i>]
And look there—it is the same hour.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ines.</span> [<i>Offended.</i>] Well, I suppose you are right. What
an accomplished lover to haggle over minutes! It is
always too early to come, too late to stay with his Inés,

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Beseechingly.</i>] Inés.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Ines.</span> Go away, go away. It is not yet two—it still wants
fifteen minutes to the hour. Go and take a turn about
the streets, and look at the people, and come back at

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> That is your hour for coming. A nice thing indeed

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Do forgive me—I was wrong.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> No, the error was mine. Desire hastens onward the
hours for me, and you, to punish me, come and hold up
a watch before my eyes. [<i>Makes a quick movement and

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> I confess my fault. I repent and humbly beg
your pardon.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Ah, you admit it. That is better.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> You see I was so happy and delighted to come
that I quite lost knowledge of what I was saying, and
even now I scarcely know what it is I am saying.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> It was also wrong of me to scold you so, Edward.
But I was so gay, so wild with eagerness in my desire to
see you, that the moments seemed centuries to me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Ah, I have to tell you, my own——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>Pays no heed to him.</i>] I have such great news for

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Also does not heed her.</i>] At last we are within

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> I should think so—for life.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> How improbable it looks!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> My father has promised this day—this very day—you
understand?—But you are not listening.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Still not heeding her.</i>] My mother——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Your mother! What?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> She is coming here in half an hour to propose
our marriage.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> The duchess!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>With comic gravity.</i>] Her grace, the Duchess
of Almonte, will have the honour to beg this white hand
[<i>takes her hand</i>] of Mr. and Mrs. Avendaña for her son
Edward, although that same Edward has long since
possessed himself of it, and holds it warm against his
heart, and I have small faith in his being persuaded to
relinquish it, even should it be refused him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> She! really—she is coming! Ah, every one was right
to call that woman a saint.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> That woman is my mother. She loves me with
all her heart, and this morning I besought her with tears
in my eyes, and she, with answering tears, flung her arms
round me and yielded to my prayer. She attaches first
importance to the glorious deeds of her ancestors, and
worships honour fanatically, and would far sooner see
me dead than my name linked with one that bore the
slightest stain. But she fully appreciates the worth of
Don Lorenzo, his scientific renown—which is another
kind of glory—and his——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> That will do. We have enough of the tale—the
conclusion is that she comes here to-day, that we are to
be married, and that we are going to be immeasurably
happy—is it not so? That is the chief thing—at least
it is so for me—I cannot answer for you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Ungrateful girl! Do you doubt me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> I do not doubt you. But how lucky it is for me
that your mother has consented!——if not! You love me
dearly, I know—but you——a mother has a claim upon
your obedience. If she said 'No,' like a good son,
Edward—not so?—you would have spared her pain,
and despite your soul's deep sorrow, you would have left
your poor Inés, who so tenderly loves you. Don't listen,
bad boy! Let nobody hear the whisper—but, indeed, I
do love you so much that without you—see how foolish
I am!—I should have died of grief.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Dearest!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> So you see how grateful I ought to be to your
mother, since it is not to you but to her that I owe my
happiness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> You cruel girl! Don't you know what I should
have done in spite of every obstacle? You feel it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Yes. You would have obeyed and given me up.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Never,—for nothing, for nobody.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Will you swear it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> I swear it by all that is holy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> There, I am content.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Inés, Edward, Juana, Don Lorenzo, and Dr. Tomás.
Juana appears in door C. supported by Don Lorenzo and
Dr. Tomás, stands for breath and then slowly advances;
is poorly and darkly clad.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Turning round.</i>] What a sombre group! Why
does this black cloud come to dim the azure of our
heaven?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> It is Juana, my father's nurse. Oh, it is quite a
story. I will tell it to you afterwards.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Easy, Juana, easy——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Who is that young lady?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Inés, my daughter. Come hither, Inés.
[<i>Inés approaches, followed by Edward.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> How very lovely! She looks like an angel. To
find such a creature at one's side in the hour of eternal
darkness would seem a presage of heaven.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Another step.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> One more effort—the last. [<i>They help her to
the sofa, where she sits down. The rest stand round her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> I should like to kiss her. [<i>Points to Inés, who
comes nearer. Juana takes her hand and draws her to her.</i>]
No, your hand is warm and my breath is ice. I may
not kiss you! It would be to give you the kiss of death.
[<i>Pushes her gently away and lets her hand fall.</i>] Not
with the lips, but in thought do I kiss you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>To Edward and Inés.</i>] Come away. The
poor woman wants to be alone with him. [<i>To Juana.</i>]
Till later, and courage. Your pains are over.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Yes, those of this world.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Poor woman! [<i>Stands and looks at her.</i>]</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> [<i>After a pause.</i>] Have they already gone?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes, dear Juana. We are alone.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> At last. At last has come the hour so long
desired. All things come—and all things pass! Listen
to me, Lorenzo. Life is slipping from me so quickly, so
quickly, and I have still so many things to say to you.
The first is—I am innocent. I did not think—I did not
want—I did——[<i>Tears interrupt her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I know it, Juana—I know it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> You do not know. Everything is against me—everything.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I beg you not to worry yourself in this
way. Forget all, and rest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Forget, yes. I shall soon enough forget. Rest!
I have so much time before me for resting that to-day I
desire to live—although I suffer, although I weep. I
would carry with me into the grave even the tears and
sobs along with the kisses—that its silence and solitude
might be filled with some remembrance of life. [<i>Pause.</i>]
That is why I want to tell you something. But how
can I without preparing you? Now, so that doubt may
not come first before revelation, and before doubt
suspicion, and before suspicion presentiment, and before
presentiment that nameless something, the shadow cast
upon the soul by that which comes from afar? You do
not understand me, and I do not know how to explain
myself, though it is now twenty years since I first harboured
the one idea. Judge if I ought to be able to
explain it well.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Tell me anything you like, only do not
get excited over it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Yes, I will tell you all. How could I die without
doing so? In the first place, if only to prove to you
that I am not a miserable—thief. [<i>Hides her face.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Hush, hush! Do not pronounce the
word.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> And then—the sole consolation left me is to open
my heart to you. Forgive me, Lorenzo. The dying
are so selfish. For you it will be a horrible shock—while
for me it will be a supreme benediction.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> If it were so for you, my dear Juana, how
could it be a horrible shock for me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> How! But so it will be—so it will be, my son.
My son! Give me leave to name you such. You are
not angry with me?—truly?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I beseech you, Juana!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Well, then, my son will I call you, and you too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>must call me mother. Call me mother, once. Let it
please heaven or hell, mother you must name me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Mother!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Not so—not in that way. Cruel boy! [<i>Leans to

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> It is twenty years since I have seen you, and now

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Juana!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Listen—one word, and then you are free, if you
still wish to leave me. It was I, I myself, who stole the
locket.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What for?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> So that you might not see it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Why?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Because there was a paper in it containing something
your mother had written that I did not want you
to see.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What was it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> I know the words by heart. They were:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>'Lorenzo, my son, in the casket which lies at the head
of my bed there is hidden a paper under a sealed
envelope. When I am dead, open it, and read what I
wrote during a night of sharp remorse. Forgive me,
and may God inspire you.'</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>In surprise.</i>] 'Forgive me, and may God
inspire you.' She wrote that?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You also made strange mention of
remorse. [<i>With increasing curiosity.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Remorse was the word. Now go away if you like.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Thinking.</i>] No. [<i>Pause.</i>] And that
paper?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> It was no secret for me that your mother had
written it. Where it was hidden was what I did not
know. That there was something hidden in the locket
a vigilance so alert as mine had easily discovered,
and what the paper contained misgiving helped me to
divine. That was why I took the locket. It was mine
by right. It had cost me twenty years of tears and
anguish, than which none more bitter or intolerable
have ever been shed.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Forgiveness, remorse, a secret—and my
mother! I cannot imagine what you would say. Confused
shades gather and drift before my mind, and pain
strikes my heart in lightning flashes. You are raving,
and you make me rave too.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> No, no.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> But that secret paper in the casket——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> It was mine, and you did not see it because it was
not right you should see it. Since your mother was
dead, what could it matter to her? Have I not said it,—there
is nothing more selfish than death?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> That paper——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> I have it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Here?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Here. [<i>Lifts her hand to her bosom.</i>] Look, it is

my heart.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> [<i>With exquisite courtesy.</i>] Señor de Avendaña.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Avendaña, Avendaña! I don't know
where he is, madam. [<i>In sombre absent tone.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] What is he saying?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Goodness, what does this mean?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> I understand, Señor de Avendaña, how unwelcome
must be my visit, since I come to claim of you the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>most precious of your possessions [<i>points to Inés</i>], and
certainly it is not surprising that you should receive me
as an enemy. [<i>Sweetly.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Fate is my enemy, nobody else, madam.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Oh, what can have happened?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> You are right. It is the ruthless enemy of the
parents.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Still more so of the children.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> I do not deny it. But in spite of it, 'tis divine
law that governs our human sorrows, and we are forced
to respect it. [<i>Makes an effort to turn the conversation,
but does not conceal her wonderment.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Ah, madam, those laws might often prove
less cruel if it were only human cruelty that dictated
them. [<i>The duchess evinces marked impatience. Edward
approaches her. Inés goes to her father, while Doña
Ángela and Dr. Tomás look on gloomily.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>Aside to Don Lorenzo.</i>] Father, I entreat you——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Aside to Duchess.</i>] For my sake, mother.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> [<i>Haughtily and dryly.</i>] I am a mother, and I
adore my son. I know that happiness is not possible
for him without this young lady, and rather than lose
one child I prefer to gain two.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>To Don Lorenzo.</i>] See how kind she is, father.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> To lose a son were a terrible misfortune.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> [<i>Gently and approaching Don Lorenzo.</i>] Will
you not consent to bestow also the name of son upon
my boy?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>In low voice of entreaty.</i>] Answer, father.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Looks sadly at his daughter, takes her</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span><i>head between his hands, and contemplates her yearningly.</i>]
How sweet you are! It seems incredible that you
should not prove stronger than the law of honour.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> [<i>Unable to control herself.</i>] To make an end
of the matter, Señor de Avendaña, do you wish my
son, the Duke of Almonte, to give his name to your
daughter Inés?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>In magnificent fury.</i>] If I were a scoundrel,
madam, this were an excellent occasion for procuring
an honest name for my nameless child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Father!</p>
<p><span class="multiline"><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span><br /><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span></span><span class='multiline'><span class='xxlarge'>}</span></span><span class="multiline">Lorenzo!</span></p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> I must frankly confess that I can make nothing
of your answers nor of your attitude, which is
quite other than what I had expected. I will content
myself with asking for the last time—do you consent?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I am an honourable man. Misfortune
may conquer me, but it will never disgrace me. Your
Grace, this marriage is impossible.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> [<i>Offended, retreats a step.</i>] Ah!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> What do you say, father? Impossible!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes, impossible. For I am not Avendaña.
My parents were not my parents. This house is
not my house. To you, my dearest girl, I can only give
a soiled and an unworthy name,—because I am the
wretchedest of men and I do not wish to be the basest.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Father, father—oh, why are you killing me? [<i>Falls
into a chair.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> What have you done, you madman?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Inés, my child! Thou hast conquered,
O God; but have pity on me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><i>Edward listens at door R., then comes up C.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> I hear nothing. Has she recovered consciousness?
To think how close a thing to life is death!
[<i>Pause.</i>] They believe that I must give up my beloved
girl! They suppose me capable of crediting Don
Lorenzo's absurd tale. Poor scholar! Why, he doesn't
know what he is saying. [<i>Pause.</i>] And even if his
assertion were true, would that make Inés other than
the loveliest, the most adorable of women? Mine she
will be, though I should have to cast myself at my
mother's feet and bathe them with my tears. Don
Lorenzo must consent, even if we have to gag him and
put him into a strait-jacket. And that wretched
beggar from whom the ill-advised philosopher has
caught his delirium must be sent away, far away from
everybody. How will my poor Inés bear up against
the blow her father has inflicted upon her? [<i>Again
approaches the door and listens.</i>] Nothing, nothing.
Silence, always the same silence. [<i>Comes down.</i>] Her
father! her own father! Heaven help me, but I
almost hate the man. [<i>With increasing passion.</i>] The
madman! How he delighted to torture her! Her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>father!—that brainless scholar! an atheist clothed in
sanctity! a new Don Quixote <em>minus</em> wit and <em>plus</em>
pedantry! a mock Bayard of honour! What sort of
father is he who pretends to a reputation for virtue
through his daughter's broken heart? A fig for such
virtue! Vice itself is more lovable. No one comes, and
the hours go by—ah, I hear somebody coming at last.</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE II</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c024'>
    <div><i>Edward and the Duchess, who enters R.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> How is Inés, mother? Has she regained consciousness?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> She has now, thank God. Poor child! I
could not go until I was assured it was all right, and
that she was better. And you, my son?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> I must see her.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Edward!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Then we have to talk to Don Lorenzo, and
afterwards——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Afterwards you will get to the end of my
patience. I have done all for you that honour, dignity,
and social convention permit—even more. But the
moment has come for you to show yourself a man, to
remember who you are and listen to the voice of duty.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Rightly said, mother, that is what I am prepared
to do, but it remains to be seen if we entertain the
same idea of duty.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> You must give Inés up.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Why? Because of her poverty?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> By no means.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Then why, mother? Because Don Lorenzo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>wishes to perform a sublime action which, if he carries
out the prospect, will immortalise him in tale and history,
and, who knows, may even lift him aloft into the
Calendar?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> I see you appreciate the humour of the situation,
and that is no bad sign.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> I want to show you how perfectly cool I am.
As for Don Lorenzo, we must regard the affair as a
joke, or put him into an asylum.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Don't say such things, Edward. It offends me
to hear you speak so. There may be some slight
exaggeration, perhaps no inconsiderable precipitation,
and a certain air of melodramatic display in Don
Lorenzo's project, but we cannot deny that he is acting
like a gentleman.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Why does he revel in his daughter's misfortune?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Because he is accomplishing his duty without
respect of human passions.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Then if Don Lorenzo is so honourable, and
the lustre of noble actions is a heritage, Inés will be
something more than the angel of my life—she will
bring me a wealth of hereditary virtue.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> She will also bring more than her share of
hereditary dishonour. [<i>In low voice approaching him.</i>]
The girl has no name good or bad, since nobody knows
what her father's is, and that of her grandmother has
been inscribed as a thief's upon the infamous register
of a prison.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Hush!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> If we are to believe Don Lorenzo, that unhappy
girl's fate is to be a humble nurse's grandchild, and her
father's accomplice in living under a false name. It
would perhaps be an excess of aristocratic pride to
reject such an honourable alliance, but to such a decision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>am I led by what you, with your modern education, will
doubtless qualify as old-fashioned prejudices.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Well, mother, I love Inés.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> You are mad, boy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> That were not strange, since love is said to be
a madness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> You almost make me lose my judgment.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Would you prefer to lose me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Enough, Edward. We must leave this house
which, in an evil moment, I entered to-day for the first
time.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> But say—is not Inés sweet?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Assuredly—as an angel of God's heaven, when
I first beheld her, and now she looks like the angel of
sorrow.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Does not the whole world regard Don Lorenzo
as an accomplished scholar, and have you yourself not
said that he is a saint?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> It would be injustice to deny the value of a
reputation so illustrious as his, or the keenness of his
sense of honour.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Then there is no objection to him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Certainly not.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Approaches the duchess and speaks in a low voice.</i>]
Can't we find some means of averting scandal? Who
knows anything of this wretched story, true or false,
though to me it seems more likely false? Only ourselves,
and we will hold our tongue. Dr. Tomás is
almost one of the family. Death will shortly seal the
lips of that unhappy woman. And, after all, Don
Lorenzo is a father; he will do for Inés' sake that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>which you refuse to do for mine. Why, mother dear,
need we go in search of misery and death when felicity
is within our reach?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Ah, see how contact with crime perverts the
noblest minds! Unfortunate boy, do you not understand
that you are proposing a monstrous thing to me?
that you wish me to be an accomplice to a felony?
Good heavens, what has come over you that you should
think and speak such things?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Who on earth speaks of anything monstrous or
proposes felony? Have we all gone mad with Don
Lorenzo, or are you martyrising me for your own entertainment?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> You suggested our averting scandal by silence.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Then——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Listen, mother. This is what I meant to say.
If Don Lorenzo's tale be true, which is what I doubt,
the legitimate heirs of this confounded wealth may be
discovered cautiously, in secret, and a way can be found
to restore it to them.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> But on what pretext?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> If you had to beg for a fortune, it might be
difficult to find one, but when it comes to giving, don't
be afraid. It is easy enough, and any pretext is equally
welcome to those who receive it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Inés will still bear a name she has no title to.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> She will bear mine, which is worth all others.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> That is true. But Don Lorenzo——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Leave him alone. He has enough to do with
his philosophy. We have ourselves to think of, and I
believe that it can be all managed if you will consent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>With a word you can give Inés back life, and give a
new life to me in exchange for that which your unkindness
blighted, and which I first owed to your affection.
Restore happiness to this unhappy family, and bestow
their usurped fortune upon the rightful heirs without
noise or vain display. This is no felony, and it is not a
monstrous thing to do.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> You magnetise me, Edward. I scarce know
what to say. But an inward voice warns me that what
you suggest is neither right nor just,—that deception can
never be preferable to truth, and despite Don Lorenzo's
ravings, I feel that duty triumphs in him, while in you
it is passion that triumphs, for all your arguments.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> How so? Tell me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> I cannot discuss it with you, Edward.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> What you cannot do is love me as you ought.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Not love you; cruel boy! You have wounded
me to the heart, though I know that you do not believe
what you say.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Then yield to me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Don't press me, Edward.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> You are yielding—I see it. Your face is pale,
there are tears in your eyes, and your lips tremble.
[<i>Caressingly.</i>] Confession of consent hangs upon them—yes,
why not? What is there absolutely opposed to
that high ideal of honour you and Don Lorenzo worship?
What wrong is there in my plan?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> There is wrong, Edward.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> So little, an atom, a shadow, a mere scruple.
And don't I deserve you should commit so trivial an
error for me? Go among the people whom you treat
with such contempt, and from whom the aristocrat's
pride separates you by an abyss; seek out a mother,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and ask her if, for her son's sake, she would not stifle
upon a cry of love all these refinements of conscience.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> [<i>Passionately.</i>] I am capable of making any
sacrifice a mother can make.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Embracing her.</i>] Thanks, mother, thanks.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> But——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> You have promised, you have promised. [<i>Without
heeding her.</i>] And, after all, it may not even be
necessary. What assurance have we that Don Lorenzo's
tale is true? What tangible proofs are there? None
that we know of. The word of a dying woman in
delirium? Is that enough?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Truly not.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Yet we have not even that much; for Dr.
Tomás has not been able to interrogate Juana. How
do we know that she told it to Don Lorenzo, or if he
only dreamed it? Let me assure you, Don Lorenzo's
head is no sound one.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> It is not, indeed.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> What an odd and extravagant fellow he is!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> For my part, I really thought he had gone mad.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Depend upon it, he is not far off. All these
men of learning end that way. Both Dr. Tomás and
Ángela admit that he doesn't reason like other men.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> She will not remain in bed, though we

that she fills us with terror. If strength had not failed
her, she would have come to look for you. In kindness,
duchess, do go to my stricken girl, and console her, you
who are so affectionate a mother. 'Tis a most afflicted
mother that implores you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> And you will tell her that there is still hope,
that all depends upon Don Lorenzo—won't you?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> What? Is it true? Oh, madam——
[<i>To duchess, and takes her hand effusively.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Yes [<i>to Doña Ángela</i>], I will explain it. You
must persuade your husband.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> But——[<i>Edward does not heed her, and talks
aside to Doña Ángela.</i>] That boy of mine does just what
he likes with me. What am I to say to this good woman
now that he has promised my consent? Oh, what a
hare-brained fellow! The girl herself is lovely, like a
dream, and altogether very charming. Poor Inés!—and
Don Lorenzo possesses, or rather did possess, a
colossal fortune. Ah! what things are human might
and human vanity!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>To Edward.</i>] I understand, I understand.
[<i>Then comes over to the duchess.</i>] I am very
grateful to you for your great kindness. Do, pray, carry
the good news yourself to my daughter, and I, in a little
while, will induce Lorenzo to consent. Never fear, he
will give in. It is certain, else will he prove himself
quite heartless.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> To see my daughter.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Impossible. She has recovered consciousness
now, and your presence might again upset her,
since you it was who caused her illness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> But I wish to see her.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> You cannot. With you duty is always
imperative, so you will respect that unhappy girl's grieving
solitude [<i>ironically</i>], not upon the command of my will,
which must always be second to yours, but upon that of
your own reflective judgment.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You are right. [<i>Pause. Both are in

does she say of me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Nothing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> She does not blame me?</p>

her hopes! Can it be that I have broken her heart?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> You know full well what you have done,
Lorenzo. So much the better, if remorse will now help
you to repair your cruel work.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I am indeed miserable.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> You miserable! Inés it is who is miserable,
not you, who doubtless find assured ineffable joy and
divine consolation in contemplating your own moral perfection.
[<i>Ironically.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> How ill you judge me, and how little you
understand me!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> I judge you ill, and yet humbly admire
the fruit of your sainthood! That I do not understand
you, I admit, for superior beings such as you are not
within reach of so mediocre an intelligence as mine.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Ángela, your words pierce my heart like

you like now. Only save your child. Place no fresh
obstacle to this marriage. Don't continue to irritate the
duchess's pride by brutal and futile revelations. Don't
make it impossible for us to remedy the evil you have
done by any new explosion.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Frankly, then, you would have me hold
my tongue.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> That is it. Hold your tongue.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> But that would be infamous.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> I know nothing about it. I feel, I can't
argue.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> My whole soul rises up in revolt against
the idea. To become an accomplice in the most repugnant,
because most cowardly, of crimes! To enjoy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>usurped wealth and a name I have no right to, and all
that is not ours! God has not willed it so, and what he
has not willed should not be. Inés, you and I, all sunk
in the mire! Is this what you would counsel? [<i>With
increasing excitement.</i>] Then virtue is but a lie, and you
all, whom I have most loved in this world, perceiving
what I regarded as divinity in you, are only miserable
egoists, incapable of sacrifice, a prey to greed and the
mere playthings of passion. Then you are all but clay,
and nothing more. And if you are but clay, resolve
yourselves to dust, and let the wind of the tempest carry
all off. [<i>Violently.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Beings shaped without conscience or free
will are simply atoms that meet to-day and separate
to-morrow. Such is matter—then let it go.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> You are wandering, Lorenzo. I don't
understand you. I don't know what it is you want.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> To respect truth and justice.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Truth!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> And cry it to the world from the housetops.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I will announce it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> And leave us in poverty.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I will earn your bread and my own by
my work.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> You earn your bread! Scholar's vanity!
Well, be it so, but listen to me first. If it should be
that we really have no right to our wealth, give it up,—well
and good. [<i>Don Lorenzo bursts into a cry of delight
and advances to her with outstretched arms.</i>] Privations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>do not fright me, nor am I the miserable woman and
egoist you painted erewhile.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Ángela, my dear wife, forgive me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Do you want my forgiveness? Do you
want me to continue blessing the hour I became your
wife, as I have always blessed it till to-day?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Then do your duty as a man of honour,
but in silence, prudently, without ostentation, or noise,
or scandal.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Why? The duchess would never consent
to her son's marriage with Inés even at that price.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Edward answers for his mother's consent.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> She will never give in.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> She will. She is a woman and a mother.
We have not all attained such perfection as yours.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I do not believe it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Is it that you do not believe it, or that
you fear it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> But supposing she should consent,—how
can I retain a name that is not mine?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> What shabby subtleties to sacrifice my
Inés to!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> A name, Ángela, in social life is——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> A name is but a sound, a passing breath
of air, something vain and evanescent. But a child,
Lorenzo, is a creature made of our own flesh and of the
blood in our veins: a creature that, while still nothing,
we shelter warm in our bosom, and receive into our arms
upon its first cry; that gives us its first smile and its
first kiss; that lives by our life, and is at once our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>sweetest joy and our sharpest sorrow: a creature we love
more than ourselves, but without a taste of that selfish
leaven which degrades all our other loves; the sole
divine affection that exists upon this earth, and if heaven
be heaven, beyond the blue it will also be found in God
himself. Choose now between what you call a name,
and what I call a child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Your words madden me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> If you first lost your senses for Inés'
misfortune, it matters little that I should drive you
mad for her good.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You are partly right, Ángela. I am a
poor fool. My scruples are, perhaps, exaggerated. My
daughter, my dear Inés—she, so good, so lovely—she
would die,—would surely die.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> At last, Lorenzo, my dear husband.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> But stay—no—my ideas are confused.
My brain turns to the flail of a fiery whirlwind. Yet I
still feel convinced that it would not be enough to
renounce my fortune. I am bound to say why I
renounce it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Not listening to her, but talking to himself.</i>]
It is true that without it I could always materially
make restitution of material possessions,—and still
without recognising the legitimate rights of those I have
despoiled. 'Twould be to make a traitorous and
cowardly restitution, under shadow of vain and artificial
rights, which I must fabricate for my convenience, and
for the benefit of my family, instead of openly and
honourably relinquishing what is not mine.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> What nonsense you talk, Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Not heeding her.</i>] If I retain a name
that is not mine, I prove myself a shabby thief—I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>compelled to pronounce a word that burns on my lips.
I rob a name and all its rights, and I deprive my victims
of their best means of defence against a cupidity that
may any day develop in my descendants, and perhaps
give rise to a worse iniquity in the future. Don't you
see it? Surely you must see it if you are not totally
blind! I must tell the truth, the whole truth, in a loud
voice, happen what will.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Would a judge and a tribunal sentence
me to despoilment of my goods alone, or to despoilment
of both my goods and my name? Of everything,
everything—is it not so? Then what a judge would
decide I have to do myself—my own judge—or I am a
wretched fellow. Such, my poor wife, is what my conscience
ordains me to do. I want no half-hearted view
of honesty, for there is no middle term between clean
honour and complete abasement. All this is quite clear
to me. Nothing so clear as duty.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Very well, if the affair is made public
the duchess will not give her consent.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> She will not consent. 'Tis what I have
already said.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Ah, Lorenzo, Lorenzo, you are everything,—philosopher,
moralist, jurisconsult, and, needless
to say, gentleman. All, all, wretched reflecting machine,
except a father.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> If you want to drive me out of my senses
you are succeeding.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> That would indeed be difficult.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Because I am out of them already?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Yes, but you haven't yet got to the
bottom of the abyss. Hear me, Lorenzo, for I, too,
understand something of logic—after all, am I not your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>wife? It is your intention to tell the truth, the entire
truth?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> It is so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Before the tribunal of human justice?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> We need not trouble ourselves about
divine justice, which at this moment is weighing you
and me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Understand me well, Lorenzo. I want
to know if you will repeat to the judge, to the lawyers
and all, no matter whom, whose business it will be to
take possession of your abandoned fortune in the
interests of the rightful owners, the story you told us
a little while ago?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> You will tell them everything?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I am bound to do so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Hear me further. You will have to
acknowledge Juana the nurse as your mother.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> That is the only way left me to wipe
away the stain of an iniquitous sentence. Here alone
were reason sufficient to prove the crime of the silence
you counsel.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> And here, I say, is reason sufficient to
command silence as an imperative duty. Can't you see
that if Juana be innocent of the wrong imputed, she is
guilty of a much greater,—which is called illegal retention
of personal rights? You know it well. Falsification
of a family is quite as bad as degrading or
destroying it. To deprive legitimate owners of their
fortune is far worse than to lift a locket from the ground.
To conceal an illegitimate birth under an honest name
is the same as covering the plague-spot of vice with an
ermine mantle. If Juana be your mother, all this has she
done, and has persisted in the deception for forty years.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Moves away and grasps his head in both
hands.</i>] Silence, for God Almighty's sake, silence!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> That is just what I am begging of you—silence!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> She is my mother.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> What of that? He who can injure an
innocent daughter need not trouble himself to respect
a culpable mother. Is not divine law above human law?
Is not justice first?—Justice, duty, and truth? Must
not the command of the spirit ever triumph over the
weaknesses of the flesh?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You speak well—but in spite of it you
are raving. [<i>Moves away from her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> And why? You seem already to be
growing as ordinary and weak as any poor mother.
Does duty not order you to let your daughter die?
Then let her die. Does it not also command you to cast
the dying Juana into a prison-cell? Then hasten to
procure her condemnation. You see, Lorenzo, I have
some logic too, in my own way.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Infernal logic.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> And yours? From what sublime sphere
does it descend?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Moves still further off.</i>] Let me be, let
me be. I can stand no more. My own Inés—and my
mother! What have I done to you, Ángela, that you
should torture me so? [<i>Falls nervously into arm-chair
at table.</i>] My head burns; it is on fire.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Gently.</i>] Lorenzo, Lorenzo.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes, you are right, and I am a poor fool.
How can I know what I ought to do? Darkness
envelops me. What is truth? What is falsehood?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] It was very cruel of me, but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>have saved my child. He will not speak. [<i>Don
Lorenzo seated, sinks down in chair, with his arms upon
table, and hides his face in both hands. Doña Ángela
approaches him caressingly and speaks tenderly.</i>] Forgive
me, Lorenzo.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Go away—in mercy leave me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> I wanted to show you the abyss you
were falling into. I wanted to save Inés, and to save
you yourself from your own outbreak.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes, yes, Ángela. I understand, but
leave me now.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Do you forgive me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I forgive you—and love you. Poor
Ángela, you too are suffering. But I desire to be
alone.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Very well. I am going. But do not
fret. We shall find some way out of the difficulty. I
will tell Inés that you want to see her—you would like
to speak to her and comfort her?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Submissively.</i>] If she wishes it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Then wait here, and I will come for you
presently, and then, beside our child, together, at one in
our desire and with a common will, you'll see that we
shall get the better of fatality which now seems to
crush us.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> We'll conquer it, yes, we'll conquer it.
[<i>Speaks unconsciously.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Good-bye, and don't bear me rancour.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Bear you rancour! I?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Then good-bye.</p>

  <h4 class='c020'>SCENE V</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Seated at table in profound dejection.
Fire burns redly, room enveloped in deep shadow. Pause.</i>]
Now I am alone. How the shadows play around me!
The fire burns dull and red. So much the better.
Darkness gathers. Come to my aid, obscurity! 'Tis
now the hour when the conscience spreads its most
luminous rays. I would do what is right, but then, I
know not what is right. My will is strong enough, but
reason is dimmed. Three names dance before my eyes
in the black night that enshrouds me. Ángela, Juana,
and Inés! Destiny leads me to my Calvary, and I
ascend my cross of suffering without complaint. But
you, my dear ones, you, Inés, why must you precede me,
marking with your tears the way that is to tear my feet?
I alone—but not you! My God, my God! how low the
flame of conscience flickers, and how faint is my will!
Despair, alas! holds me in its grip. I desire good, and
seek it in Thee, O Lord. Come to my aid, answer to
my call. Shadows that encircle me, space in which I
most dolorously wander, time that is mine own eternity
of pain, and thou, august silence, that dost hear me in
thy consoling mood, call all of you upon your God whom
my voice may not reach. Tell him that I would my
daughter were spared, and that I implore the chalice of
bitterness may pass her by, that I myself may drain it
with my lips to the very dregs. Let all fall upon me, and
let her live in all her loveliness and goodness and purity.—Not
on her, my God, not on her! [<i>Drops his head on
table in bitter weeping.</i>]</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c024'>
    <div><i>Don Lorenzo and Juana, who stands in door R.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> A flickering shadow has passed before
my eyes. Has it all been a dream? No, Juana is
yonder, and the proof, the proof. [<i>Opens desk and takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>out paper.</i>] Here is the proof. Unhappily it is no dream.
It is terrible and implacable reality. I have read it a
hundred times, and can never weary of reading it:
'I have loved you like a son, although you are no child
of ours.' 'Although you are no child of ours!'</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> [<i>Aside, watching him.</i>] He is reading—reading
that letter written by one he believed to be his mother.
I it is who am his mother—not another. [<i>Advances
slowly.</i>] How sad he looks! and there are tears in his
eyes. In his eyes, do I say? Perhaps it is my own
eyes, looking at him, that are wet. His eyes or mine!
What matter? There are tears somewhere. [<i>Comes
nearer.</i>] He is crying. Why? Because I am his mother?
But what of that, if nobody else knows my secret?
I am so near death! Yes, death! I shall soon die. Cold
and eternal night has already penetrated to the depths
of my being. It is all dark within. [<i>Staggers and
leans against the table. Don Lorenzo turns to her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Juana!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Still that name.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Mother!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> It offends you that I am such—I see it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Do you think so ill of me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Well, if it does not offend you, you are ashamed
of me as your mother?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I ashamed of you! To-morrow the world
will know that I am your son.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> To-morrow! What do you mean? [<i>With terror.</i>]
My hearing is dull, and I cannot rightly have understood
what you said.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I made a mistake. Not to-morrow. You
must leave Spain first, and then, when you are in some
safe place, since man's justice can often be very cruel, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>will proclaim the truth aloud. I will give up a name
that is not mine, as well as an appropriated fortune.
That is what I have decided to do.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Christ above!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> And then along with Ángela and my poor
child I will join you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> You, poor and dishonoured, with only a stained
and contemptible name! And why? Wherefore?
What compels you? Speak, my son. My wits forsake
me. What forces you to it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Conscience, mother, and your misdoing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> You intend to tell the truth?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Angrily.</i>] Why did you ever tell it to
me? If I had known nothing about it I should not
now be obliged to break my daughter's heart.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Why? And you can ask me that? You don't
understand? Oh, ungrateful son! [<i>Hides her face in
her hands and sobs bitterly.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Mother!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Because I was dying, because I am dying—and I
wanted you to know all that I had sacrificed for your
sake before I went. And because I wished to hear you
call me mother at least once. For that, and for no
other reason. Because the heart within me rose to my
throat and nearly choked me, till at last I could no
longer command myself, and had to call you son.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I understand, mother, and do not blame you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> But you will not do as you have just threatened?
Say you will not. It would be infamous to your family
and most cruel to me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Cruel, yes, but not infamous. With this
cruelty shall I wipe out all infamy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Forgive me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> [<i>Tragically.</i>] You accuse me of having committed
an infamy?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I have not said it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> [<i>In stifled voice.</i>] But it was for your sake—for
your sake, my son. [<i>Don Lorenzo remains silent and
gloomy, not looking toward his mother.</i>] My God, I did
it for his sake, and this is how he repays me! Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Wrong may not prevail. The work of
iniquity must fall into ruins beneath its own weight. My
sacrifice will serve to wipe out your sin.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Lorenzo! [<i>Don Lorenzo draws her to the light and
places the letter in her hand, obliging her to read it.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What does it say there?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> [<i>Sits down and reads with difficulty.</i>] 'Forgive
me, and may God inspire you.'</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Well, mother, I have forgiven her, and

me, mother. I will return instantly.</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE VIII</h4>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> [<i>Holding the paper in her hand.</i>] Not even for her
sake! [<i>Sobs.</i>] Sacrifice yourself, Juana, for your son.
Renounce his caresses, tear your breast with your nails
on seeing him kiss another woman and call her mother;
drink deeply of the tears of bitterness, and gather them
in your heart until it overflows or bursts. Bear the
brand of shame upon your brow, wear yourself out in
poverty and sorrow in a garret for twenty years, with no
other happiness or consolation than seeing him pass in
his carriage from the distance. Oh, heavens, I am dying!
[<i>Pause. She gets better.</i>] Still,—still worse,—poor Juana!
suffer all I have mentioned, and in exchange procure
him wealth, reputation, celebrity—and at the last
moment of your life come to him and only ask a kiss,
only ask him to say once: 'How good you have been to
me! How fondly you have loved me!' What will he
say? Nothing of this. He will glance at you in austere
sadness, and tell you that you have committed an infamy,
and that he must wipe out your crime,—that your work
is—a work of iniquity. A work of iniquity! Oh,
Lorenzo, my son! Why are you so cruel? Why do
you cast from you in contempt all that I gave you at
the price of my own happiness? See what tears you
cost me! [<i>Changes her voice and crosses R. with a
desperate gesture.</i>] And my sacrifice has been in vain.
I have forfeited my own happiness and lost his too.
Mad woman, egoist! Why did I tell him the truth?
[<i>Pause.</i>] But it must not be, it must not be. No, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>work of iniquity will not fall into ruins yet a while.
Poor visionary! I will deny everything. [<i>In a dead voice.</i>]
You will be happy and rich and powerful whether you
like it or no. He put the sole proof into my hand. [<i>Takes
up the paper.</i>] Very well, then. Between his mother
and his daughter he will be saved. Strange coincidence!
She, calling for him, obliges him to go away, and I stay
behind. Ah, let us exhaust what little strength remains.
So, a little nearer still, through the darkness—just so
dark a night was it when my mistress came to my bedside
and murmuring asked: 'Would you have your child
rich and happy?' And first I doubted, and then I consented—and
now—and now I still say 'yes.' [<i>Reaches
table. Pause.</i>] Is Lorenzo coming back? [<i>Listens.</i>] Yes,
I think he is coming. He will ask me for the letter as
he did before. Here, to the fire with it. [<i>Tries to walk,
but cannot.</i>] I hear his voice. Strength fails me. I
have no time. He will come. No, I will not give it up.
Once more it is in my hands. Ah, now I know, now I
know. I will slip a clean sheet into the envelope so
that he may notice nothing. [<i>Does this.</i>] Lorenzo calls
it a work of iniquity. My poor boy, he is in some things
as innocent as a child. Thus—thus, I leave it where it
was—and this other goes to the flames. [<i>Throws paper
into the fire and stoops to watch it burn.</i>] Now it is in
flames. See how luminously they quiver upon my
mistress's portrait. [<i>Looks at portrait upon the wall.</i>]
And now, see, it is in ashes—that which was the only
proof. The only one? No: another still remains—it is
I—and soon that also will be ashes. [<i>Pause.</i>] Now I will
go to my room. [<i>Moves.</i>] My God, how weak I have
grown! [<i>Moves again with an effort.</i>] But I have saved
him. Felicity, fortune are his—I cannot see,—I cannot
see. The light is dim. Is it the light or my eyes that
are dim? [<i>Approaches table, takes up candle and walks
again.</i>] Light, light! where is my room? Shadows!
All is darkness. Alas, alas, I cannot, I cannot [<i>Lets
candle fall. Room is only lit by the red reflection of the
fire. She falls between fireplace and table.</i>]</p>

  <h4 class='c020'>SCENE IX</h4>
</div>

<p class='c011'><i>Juana, Duchess, Don Lorenzo, Doña Ángela, and Inés.
The latter enters R. Don Lorenzo tries to get away from
his daughter, who stands at door in white; behind her, half
hidden by curtains, the Duchess and Doña Ángela.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Coming down the stage.</i>] No more, no
more. It is the last test,—the last, yes. But, oh, how
my will fainted.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>To Inés.</i>] Follow him. Do not leave him
alone. He will give in.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Why do you fly from me, father? [<i>Advances a little,
behind her the duchess and Doña Ángela. This scene
must be strongly marked and fantastic. Don Lorenzo, in the
middle of the stage, evinces in his attitude, manner, and
expression that he is undergoing a desperate inward
struggle. Inés, delicate-looking and charming, approaches
him slowly, and Doña Ángela and duchess, in black,
follow, encouraging her. Juana dying; the study is quite
dark save for the glimmer of the firelight which shows out
Inés sharply.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Here lies my real temptation. Oh, how
lovely she is! What an aureola of divine beauty
encircles her head—the sole ray of light in this heavy
darkness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Aside to Inés.</i>] Do you see? He cannot
resist you. Implore him, implore him, my child.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>Advancing.</i>] Kiss me, father.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Retreating.</i>] Alas for me if those dear
arms should clasp themselves like a halter round my
neck!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] A halter round the neck! He is right.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> For the love of God, father, for the love of me, for
all the tears shed by those eyes you used to kiss so
fondly when I was a child. [<i>Lifts her hands to her eyes,
and then offers them to Don Lorenzo to kiss.</i>] See how the
drops still flow from my eyelids. My fingers are wet
with them. Kiss them, and let your lips taste of their
bitterness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes—I will kiss them—I will kiss them—but,
alas! if one of mine should fall upon them.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Fall, fall, so he said. I also am falling
into the bottomless abyss. But first, first I must embrace
my son.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> 'Twas Lorenzo they called. There—there—I see
something.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> No, no—a thousand times, no. Would
you degrade me?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> And you, father—who would believe it?—would
kill me. If not, why do you seek to place an obstacle
between me and the love of my life?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> No, my Inés, no—the duchess—it is the
duchess.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> It is not true. The duchess consents.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> At the cost of my honour.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Not so, Inés. In exchange for silence.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Don't you hear her, father?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Moving away and repulsing her.</i>] I only
hear voices begging my conscience of me. I only see
shadows pursuing me through the shadows—phantasms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of space, engendered by temptation. Leave me, leave
me—in God's name. If you are strong enough to wring
my heart, at least you are not strong enough to bend
my will.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> His voice! Lorenzo, Lorenzo! [<i>Comes over to
embrace him.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Mother! [<i>Embraces her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>Taking refuge behind Doña Ángela.</i>] Whose voice
is that? Who is that woman? What shade is that
which has come out of the darkness and encircles my
father with its arms? I'm afraid.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Juana! my mother!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> His mother! Why does he call her mother?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Because she's my mother, and because I
should call her so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> I? his mother? Good gracious, what an idea!
How I wish it were so!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Do you hear—do you hear what she says?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> She denies it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Violently.</i>] You are my mother.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Ah, my poor Lorenzo. [<i>Laughs with an effort,
embraces him, and whispers.</i>] Child of my heart!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> On your life, repeat aloud what you have
just whispered to me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> I whispered! Well, what did I say? To be his
mother! Could I wish for a greater blessing?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Furiously.</i>] Ah, you deny it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>With increasing fury.</i>] Do you deny
that you are my mother?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> Why not?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Despairingly.</i>] You denied me at the
hour of my birth, and again you deny me at the hour of
your death.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> [<i>Clasping him closely, so that in the darkness it is
not possible to discern if they are embracing, or if Don
Lorenzo has caught her in his rage.</i>] Child of my love!
[<i>Whispers in a dying voice.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Deliriously.</i>] That's so, that's so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> I am dying.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> No, mother.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Heavens! Is the man going to kill her?
Help! [<i>Runs to door R.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Edward—doctor!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Mother, mother!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Juana.</span> No,—God help me!—no, not that.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> My mother—forgive me, forgive me.

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> No, it cannot be. [<i>Embraces her.</i>] I

<div class='nf-center c024'>
    <div><i>Dr. Tomás. Afterwards servant.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Everything is quiet. The girl's sobbing can
no longer be heard, and Don Lorenzo's fury is calmed.
'Tis but the gentle precursor of a fresh tempest. [<i>Pause.</i>]
There are moments when I doubt and vacillate. He,—he,—my
good friend, poor Lorenzo—the very idea gives
me no rest. Well, well, we shall soon know the truth
now,—meanwhile, courage. I have sacred obligations to
fulfil towards this afflicted family. Nobody could more
earnestly desire to help them than I.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> A gentleman, accompanied by two—really sir,
I don't know what to call them—but their dress,—well,
the gentleman has given me his card for you, and they
are all waiting outside.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Looking at card.</i>] Ah, Doctor Bermúdez.
Show him in.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> And the other two?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Let them wait. [<i>Exit servant.</i>] As the hour
approaches my doubts and my anxiety increase. Poor
Doña Ángela! what a blow for her! And in what a
state of nervous agitation is her unhappy daughter!
How lucid her glance, and how quick her intelligence!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Nobody has explained the matter to her, and yet I
believe she knows everything. She guesses what she
does not precisely know, and suspects what she does
not guess. Oh, no; the situation cannot be prolonged.
However sad reality may be, we have to face it.</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE II</h4>

<p class='c011'><i>Dr. Tomás, Dr. Bermúdez. Afterwards two keepers, attired
like gentlemen, but evincing that they are not such.
Dr. Tomás advances with outstretched hand.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Doctor.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> Dr. Tomás.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Punctual as ever.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> No, I am a little early. I want to hide these
fellows somewhere.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Yes, yes, I understand.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> I have made them dress so as to avert
suspicion in Don Lorenzo. This is a case for such
general precautions.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Quite so, quite so. We must proceed with
great caution. It was an access of fury, a veritable
access of fury, as I told you. He has only had one, the
other night. Perhaps I am mistaken.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> I sincerely hope so—and you, too, I am
sure.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Ah, my friend, I scarce know what I am
doing. But we trust in your science, your experience,
and profound penetration to relieve us of our present
doubt.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> You flatter me. You also are a doctor——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Don't count on me, Bermúdez. I am good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>for nothing. I declare myself incompetent. It is a
question of my best friend, of a brother almost. Besides,
he has always struck me—you know my school.
There is not a divisional line between reason and madness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> Quite true. All men of learning are more
or less insane.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Precisely. Excitement of the brain beyond
certain limits——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> That's it. What we have to do is to see
what can be done with Don Lorenzo. Now these two
fellows——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Oh, it will be easy enough to invent a tale.
We'll call them witnesses—say they've come with the
notary—anything, in fact. Poor Lorenzo is not in a
condition to take note of details.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> Where will they wait?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Pointing to door R.</i>] Inside that door.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> [<i>Going up the stage.</i>] Here, Braulio!
{<i>Enter two keepers, rather heavy and rough in appearance.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Go into that closet. You will be called if
necessary,—meanwhile, remain quiet. [<i>Keepers salute
and enter closet R.</i>] Since Juana's death Don Lorenzo
has not used this room. [<i>To Bermúdez.</i>] With the door
shut—— [<i>Shuts it.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> [<i>Looking at his watch.</i>] I will be with you
in a moment. I'll be back again before the notary
arrives. I'm only off somewhere in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> A visit?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> Yes; a very strange case of insanity. [<i>Enter
Doña Ángela C., who stands looking at Bermúdez.</i>]
She's——? [<i>To Dr. Tomás, glancing at Doña Ángela.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Yes—his wife. Don't say anything to her.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> [<i>Aside to Dr. Tomás.</i>] I'll be back shortly.
Your servant, madam. [<i>Salutes Doña Ángela, and
exit C.</i>]</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE III</h4>

<p class='c011'><i>Doña Ángela and Dr. Tomás. Doña Ángela follows Bermúdez
with her eyes, then glances towards the closet
where keepers are concealed.</i></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Who was that going away? And who
were the two men that accompanied <a id='corr165.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='him.'>him?</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_165.10'><ins class='correction' title='him.'>him?</ins></a></span></p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Don't be alarmed, dear madam. It will be
all right. These are only ordinary precautions, for, who
knows? Don Lorenzo might have another access of fury
like that of the night before last, and for your sakes—for
his own——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Oh, doctor, don't hint such a thing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Don't you remember with what frenzy he
grasped poor Juana's dying body? Now that nobody
is listening, in all confidence let me say that I firmly
believe he was the determining cause——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Tomás, Tomás!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Well, at any rate he hastened her death. You
heard how bitterly he accused himself in his delirium.
Don't let us forge illusions. It was a real access of——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Sobbing.</i>] Lorenzo, my husband!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> The crisis may return, for to-day——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Yes, I know what his intention is. Ah,
doctor, how unfortunate we are! How unfortunate my
poor Lorenzo is!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> What is he doing now?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> He is quite calm. He writes, and walks
about. He wants to be continually with Inés and me,
because solitude terrifies him. A moment ago he stared
at me mournfully, but with such tenderness, and kissed
me, murmuring, 'poor Ángela.'</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> You must not contradict him.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> No, doctor. We agree with him in
everything.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> And he still persists in the same idea?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Yes. From time to time he asks what
o'clock it is, gets impatient with the notary's delay,
and then mutters in an undertone: 'Though all the
world should oppose me, I must do it.'</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> What a fellow! What character!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Oh, doctor, for the love of God, don't
deceive me. Tell me, do you really believe Lorenzo to be—to
be,—no, I can't—I can't bring myself to pronounce
the horrible word.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> I don't yet know what to believe. We shall
soon see, my dear friend, we shall see. It was precisely
to be relieved once and for all of intolerable anxiety
that I asked Dr. Bermúdez to call. He is the first
authority upon all such cases.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> But it is impossible, it is surely impossible.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> It would rejoice me to learn so, and we need
not lose hope. But impossible, madam! Ah, human
reason is so slight a thing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Oh, my dear husband! No, I cannot
bear—it cannot be.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Come, come, Doña Ángela. Have sense and
courage, if only for your daughter's sake, for poor Inés.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>And who knows yet? We have to see if Don Lorenzo
has any explanation to offer—any proof——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> What proof can he have? Even the
dying Juana cried out to him, 'No, no, you are not my
son,' while he, frenzied and delirious, grasped her in his
arms and strove to force an impossible confession from
the half dead body, calling her 'mother' in the strident
voice of dementia. No, you can't console me, friend.
It is useless. I foresee that our misfortune is inevitable.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> I almost fear so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> And then his way of receiving the
duchess, he who is always the pink of courtesy, a finished
gentleman——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> You are right. On that occasion I understood
how it was with him. But who can be resigned
when fate strikes so suddenly?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Adoring a child as he adores Inés, is
there anybody who could act as he proposes to act
to-day?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Nobody, madam, nobody in his right mind.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Have you told Dr. Bermúdez?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Not everything. That would be dangerous.
But quite enough to enable him to pronounce an
opinion.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> And what is it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Am I to speak fully?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Yes, yes, doctor. Conceal nothing. I
know there is no remedy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> With skillful treatment, separated from everybody,
especially from those whose presence could only
serve to exasperate his nervous sensibility by very reason
of his affection for them——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Tomás!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> In some good asylum here in Spain or
abroad——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> What! What is it you say? Separate
him from us! Take him away! He—he—never. I
am his wife. I will never consent to it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> The sight of Inés will aggravate his delirium.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Her absence would be his death.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> He smothered that poor woman to death.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> There you are wrong, Tomás. With her
father Inés runs no risk. She is his daughter.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> He believed Juana to be his mother.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> It must not be, Tomás, it must not be.
Why can't you find a way of relieving my anguish
instead of torturing me so?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Doña Ángela!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> It is true, my friend, 'twould indeed be
no easy matter to find consolation for such a sorrow as
mine.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> There is no human sorrow inconsolable,
however great it may be.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Oh, but mine is.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Yours still less than many others. Come, let
us discuss it dispassionately.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> How can I, with fever running fire in my
veins?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Hear me out. If what Don Lorenzo asserts
be true, if there were irrefragable proofs——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Then my poor husband would not be out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of his mind. We it would be who are blind and foolish.
Oh, what a blessing that would be!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Not so great, for in that case you would have
to face poverty, dishonour—death even.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Hush, Tomás.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> I say death advisedly, for Inés would most
certainly die of it. On the other hand, if Lorenzo's
calamity be proved——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Don't continue. I can't bear to think
of it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> But think of Inés, and in thinking of her
you will see that, terrible as the wound is—we must
acknowledge the fact, sad as it is—it is by no means a
mortal wound. For youth, what alone is mortal is to
destroy the future—not simply precipitate the past into
nothingness.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> For mercy's sake, Tomás!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> The happiness of Inés' lifetime depends upon
her father's calamity—don't forget it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Let God's will be done, but do not seek to
awaken ideas rather fitted to frighten than to comfort me.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] But where have I left the key?
Oh, my head! and the notary will be here presently. I
left the letter in the desk. I remember quite well.
Two days ago, when my mother——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Without seeing Don Lorenzo.</i>] Poor Doña
Ángela! The proof [ordeal] will be a terrible one.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What? What are they saying? The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>proof! yes; they are speaking of the proof. [<i>Looks
eagerly about the table for key of desk.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Yes, it will be a terrible one—very
terrible to walk between two precipices. Lorenzo on
the one side, Inés on the other. You are right indeed.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aloud, angrily.</i>] I have lost it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Aside, turning round.</i>] I should think you
have, unfortunate man.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Ah, they're there. [<i>Recognises them with
a suspicious glance.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Gently.</i>] What are you looking for?
We will help you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You! no. Wherefore? It is my work.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> But at least tell us what you have lost.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Everything—even the love of mine own.
Say if there can be more for me to lose.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> No, Lorenzo, do not believe it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> At last! The key. Heaven be praised!
[<i>Aside, distrustfully.</i>] It was there—it was in the lock.
[<i>Opens desk and takes out the paper Juana placed there.</i>]
Ah, here it is. I breathe again freely. [<i>Reads.</i>] 'For
Lorenzo.' This is the paper.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Approaching.</i>] Have you found what
you were looking for?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes. [<i>Dr. Tomás also approaches.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> What paper is it?</p>
<p class='c011'><i>Don Lorenzo makes a movement to take paper out of
envelope, but seeing Dr. Tomás and Doña Ángela come
nearer, he puts it back in desk, locks it, and pockets the
key.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> A very important one. [<i>Looks from one
to the other angrily and suspiciously.</i>] But why do you
want to know?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Don't be offended, Lorenzo. Forgive me
if I have committed an indiscretion.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I forgive! It is I who want your forgiveness.
Through me, through my fault, are you about to
be plunged into misery.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Do not say so. We could never be
miserable, you being happy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> And I, could I be happy, fortune having
deserted you and my beloved child?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> She, too, will be happy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Impossible, for you know what I am
thinking of.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> You have told me. Don't you remember?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>To Dr. Tomás.</i>] And you?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> I also know.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You approve?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Sweetly.</i>] Whatever you do will be well
done.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>To Dr. Tomás</i>] What have you to say?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> The same.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Thoughtfully.</i>] 'The same.' What
conformity of opinion! Do you know that I have sent
for a notary?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> We know it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Looking at both.</i>] You know it. And
do you likewise know that I am about to have a legal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>act drawn up containing my formal declaration and
renunciation?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Yes, Lorenzo.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> So that the judge may then ordain as the
law directs? Is it not so?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> It is natural.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>To Doña Ángela.</i>] What do you say
to it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>In weeping voice.</i>] If this wealth we now
enjoy is not legally yours—you do well.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> If the name you bear is not yours, you must
certainly give it up.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> In any case your will is law.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes, but a tyrannical law, an impious law—eh?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Still, a law that I respect above all others.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Nervous, unquiet, almost irritable.</i>] And
you don't resist it? You don't struggle against it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Your conduct is that of a man of honour.
Strictly speaking, there is nothing else for you to do.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What unheard-of submission! What
extraordinary docility! What a sudden change! You
are deceiving me. I tell you, you are lying to me.
[<i>Violently.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> For pity's sake, Lorenzo.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Ah, there is no hope. Like a black
wave dementia has spread over his mind.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>More calmly.</i>] Well, well, better so.
[<i>Pause. Approaches Doña Ángela affectionately.</i>] Where
is Inés?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> My poor child!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You don't defend her against me? [<i>Then
gently.</i>] Nevertheless, it is your duty.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Alas, Lorenzo, what strength has your
wretched wife to use against you? Your will grows iron
in strife and calamity; mine bends to the very dust.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You are right. My will is irresistible
when duty orders me. [<i>To Dr. Tomás.</i>] What do you
think of all this?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> That it should be so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> So it is. [<i>Pause.</i>] Poor Ángela! And
do you know what we are going to do once the act is
signed and the proof given up?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> You have a proof?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You didn't know. [<i>Aside, wondering.</i>]
(And they were talking about it when I entered!) Yes,
I have it, irrefutable, past doubt, clear as daylight,
although it is black as night and treason.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Keep calm, Lorenzo.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Then what is it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> A letter of my mother's—of the woman
who called herself my mother.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Good Heavens! Can it be
true?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Her signature, her handwriting—it is here—in
my power.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Ah, if it were so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Then when the proof is delivered up, you,
my poor Inés, and I will at once leave this house—this
house which already has ceased to be ours, and which
this very day the law will take into possession until it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>handed over to the heirs of Avendaña. [<i>With increasing
animation.</i>] And in a little while we shall wander forth
without resources, without a name, bearing a dying child
in our arms—for have you not assured us that Inés will
die? [<i>to Dr. Tomás</i>]—fronting a despairing solitude——no,
'twas not well said—I blasphemed. We will bear
away with us an unstained honour and a tranquil conscience,
and our heads will be held high, while God is with
us. What matter if the world forsake us, thus accompanied?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> [<i>Embracing him.</i>] Before, I said with
my lips only: 'Your will is law, Lorenzo.' Now I say
it with my heart.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] If the proof exists, this man is a
saint. But, alas! if it does not exist, the unfortunate
fellow is nothing but a lunatic.      [<i>Enter servant.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Servant.</span> The Duchess of Almonte, and his Grace the
Duke.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Show them in. [<i>To Dr. Tomás.</i>] Have you
informed them?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>To Doña Ángela.</i>] I told them last night.
The duchess promised to come. You see, she has kept
her word.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I cannot see them. I must be alone,
unless you are with me—only you. Good-bye, Ángela.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Good-bye, Lorenzo.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Looking at his watch.</i>] How slowly time
passes! [<i>Goes to door R. Dr. Tomás follows him.</i>] Have
you given notice to the witnesses? [<i>At door.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> I have two inside waiting, and another will
be here presently.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Who are they?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> You don't know them. They are friends of
mine.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> And why not mine too?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> I always considered my friends as yours.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Looks at him for a moment.</i>] So they
are. [<i>Aside.</i>] Ah, this complaisance! I would have
preferred to see them resist—struggle against me!</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE V</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><i>Doña Ángela, the Duchess, Edward, and Dr. Tomás.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Duchess!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Madam! [<i>Salutes affectionately.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> You are always so good to us.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> It is my duty to offer the consolations of sincere
friendship in your cruel trouble. God has willed that
the same misfortune should strike us all though in
different ways. [<i>Lowers her voice and points to Edward
on uttering the last word.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> But what then do you call the misfortune
that has struck me? I know not.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Well, madam, the moment for naming it has
arrived. It is called poverty, and shame, and the death
of Inés, or——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela</span> <em>and</em> <span class='sc'>Duchess</span>, [<i>At same time.</i>] Edward!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Forgive me, mother. We should each and all
speak out the truth to-day. You have already said: 'I
will compromise with Don Lorenzo's calamity for the
sake of the love I bear you and that which you bear me;
but I will never compromise with his public dishonour,—never,
not even for the price of your life.' My life,
mother, was it not so 'twas said?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> [<i>With energy, but sadly.</i>] Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Going toward Doña Ángela.</i>] Then, madam,
let us probe the misfortune that has struck you. Whether
is it called dishonour or madness? This is the problem
we have to solve. Should Don Lorenzo be correct,
should he be in his sound senses, should there be proof
forthcoming of his assertion, it is for us to respect his
cruel virtue. But if, as I (by a thousand signs that
almost constitute evidence) believe, an eternal cloud has
dimmed his intellect, and the light of his reason is for ever
quenched,—then defend yourself, Doña Ángela. It is
your most sacred duty. Defend the name you bear,
your social position, even Don Lorenzo's honour, against
his own raving; defend,—why should I keep it back?—Inés'
life and her life's felicity. Do not, madam, leave
such almighty interests and so dear an object at the
mercy of a madman.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Edward!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> The word is a harsh one, but the time has come
to pronounce it. Once for all, let us learn the fact
whether this battle for reputation and existence into
which Don Lorenzo has cast us is what it seems or what
I fear:—whether, finally, the heroic sacrifice of this implacable
scholar is insanity or sanctity.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Enough, Edward. [<i>Doña Ángela sits down on
sofa, weeping bitterly. Duchess goes over to her.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> [<i>To Edward.</i>] The happiness of this family
affects me as closely as my own. What you propose to
do has already been considered, and both the law and
science will be called in to decide.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> I hope to Heaven the darkness will be illuminated
for you. [<i>To Doña Ángela.</i>] Come, come, madam:
courage, resignation! Where is Inés?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Do you wish to see her?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Come, then. [<i>To Dr. Tomás.</i>] And you
too. I would like you to see her. For the past three
days fever alone has lent her strength. My daughter,
my dear child is very ill.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Poor girl!</p>
<div class='c021'>[<i>Exeunt Doña Ángela, Duchess, and Dr. Tomás.</i>]</div>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE VI</h4>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> They persist in doubting. What blindness!
They can't understand that the unfortunate gentleman,
from force of seeking, not the righting of wrongs, like
the Errant Knight, but the reason of all the varied
rights invented by the accumulated wisdom of centuries,
has ended by losing the only one that Providence saw
fit to bestow upon him—namely, natural reason. Oh,
but this must not be. I cannot allow them to sacrifice
my dear one's life to the extravagances of a poor madman.</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE VII</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c024'>
    <div><i>Edward, Inés, comes out by closet R., where the keepers are</i></div>
    <div><i>concealed, agitated, and as if fleeing.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> What are those men? Who are they?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Rushing towards her.</i>] Inés, my beloved!
How pale you are! Your divine glance is hemmed
round by deep purple shadow.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> But answer me. Who are they? What are they
waiting for? Send them away. [<i>Approaches the door
cautiously and peeps in; Edward endeavours to lead her
down the stage.</i>] There is something sinister about
them. My father—where is my father? I was looking
for him between the drawing-room and yonder closet,
and I saw them—I can't bear the sight of them, and yet
I cannot take my eyes from off them.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> But what is the matter with you, dearest?
Why do your eyes seem to shun me? Is it from me
that you are running away? Inés, have you wearied of
my love?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>Coming down the stage.</i>] Wearied of your love?
You must know that it is my life. But oh, Edward, to
what a frightful ordeal fate has subjected us! You do
not understand it. For me supreme bliss lies in your
love, and the hope I place in your love is a still greater
bliss—a far, far greater. The one is our present, the
other contains all our future. And yet, Edward,
dearest, that same hope has now become a crime for your
Inés, yes, a crime. Can a cruelty more exquisite be
conceived? That which destiny denies no other living
being it denies me. Yesterday I was but a child. My
thoughts floated upon laughter in a sphere of white
transparency, like a vapoury mist in moonlight. To-day
they are as heavy as lead, as burning as lava.
Could you but hear their horrible whispers in the silence
of night. And these thoughts are not mine. It is not
my will that gives them birth. They come I know not
whence. I cast them from me, and still they return.
They vex me with chiding complaints: 'your poor
father,' one moment, and then assail me with tempting
voices, murmuring: 'Inés, Inés, who knows?—you may
yet be happy—love may yet smile upon you—hope,
hope, poor little thing.' Can you think of anything
more horrible—surely it must be my bad angel—than
to hear within oneself the voice of Satan whispering of
hope to one bidden to say farewell to it?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> You are not yourself, my dear Inés.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>Approaching Edward.</i>] I am filled with remorse.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> For what?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> I don't know. I have done nothing wrong. My
father! My poor father!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> You angel of my life, my heart's desire, be
calm, be calm. I beg of you to spare yourself.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Whisper, Edward. I could almost wish I were
dead.</p>

<h4 class='c020'>SCENE VIII</h4>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c024'>
    <div><i>Don Lorenzo, Inés, and Edward. Don Lorenzo enters C.,</i></div>
    <div><i>and stands listening to Inés.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Dead, she said?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> You dead! No, Inés, don't say such a thing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Why not? If I do not die of sorrow—should
fortune ever again smile upon me, then must I die of
remorse.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Of remorse! She! Should
fortune ever again smile upon her! What worse fate
floats in the air and hangs threateningly above my head?
Remorse!—I have again caught another passing word.
I traverse rooms and galleries, and wander from one
place to another, pricked by insufferable anguish. I
hear talk that I do not understand, and meet glances
still further from my comprehension. I see tears here,
smiles there, and nobody opposes me,—all either fly
from me or watch me. [<i>Aloud.</i>] What is this? What
is this?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>Rushing to his arms.</i>] Oh, father!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Inés, how white you are? Whence this
dolorous constriction of your lips? Why do you essay
a smile only to end in sobbing? How lovely she is in
her sorrow! And it is all my fault.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> No, father.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I am cruel. Oh, if you do not say it, you
think it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Inés is too sweet-natured to harbour rebellious
thoughts. But we who see her suffer cannot help
thinking and saying it for her.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> It is but natural you should do so.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>Passionately.</i>] Then if I am right, you are
wrong.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I am not in the wrong for that. There
is something more pallid than the white brow of a lovesick
maid; there are tears sadder far than the crystal
drops of her beautiful eyes, something still crueller than
the curving smiles of her lips, and something yet more
tragic than the death of our beloved.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>With violence and contempt.</i>] What is this
worse pallor, these sadder tears, and still mournfuller
tragedies?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Seizing his arm.</i>] Madman! The
pallor of crime, the tears of remorse, the consciousness
of one's own infamy.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> And this infamy, this remorse, this crime would
lie in furthering your daughter's happiness?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Despairingly.</i>] It should not be—but so
it is nevertheless. [<i>Pause.</i>] And this makes my torment.
This is the idea that will drive me mad.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> No, no, father. You must not say that. Do what
you think best without thought of me. What does it
matter whether I live or die?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Inés!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Only, do not be uncertain in it—above all, do not
let others see your uncertainty. Let your speech be
clear and persuasive, as it is now, and do not let worry
blind you. Be calm, father. I implore you by all that
is sacred.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What do you mean? I do not understand.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Do I myself know rightly what I mean? Adieu,
adieu. I cannot bear to grieve you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> [<i>To Don Lorenzo.</i>] Alas, if 'twere possible for
you to take counsel with your heart, and silence the
prompting of thought.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>To Edward.</i>] Do not vex him. Come with me—if
you thwart him maybe 'twill force his hate.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Poor child!—she also is struggling—but
she will conquer. She is not my daughter for nothing.</p>

<p class='c028'>[<i>Utters this proudly. Inés and Edward go up the stage;
passing the door of the closet, Inés sees the keepers,
and makes a movement of horror.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> What sinister vision is it that frights my gaze?
Those men? Oh, father, do not enter there.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Come, Inés, come.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> [<i>To her father.</i>] No, no. I beseech you, father.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Going towards her.</i>] Inés!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Those men—there—look! [<i>Points to closet. Don
Lorenzo stands and follows her eyes. At that moment
the keepers, hearing her cry, lift the curtain and show
themselves.</i>]</p>

    <div><i>Don Lorenzo, Braulio and Benito.</i> [<i>Pause.</i>]</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Who can they be? Enter, pray. [<i>The
keepers advance timidly, and speak abruptly.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> Dr. Tomás——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Ah, I understand.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> Told us to wait there——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Excuse me, I did not know——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> Not at all, sir.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] How odd they look, in sooth.
Pray, be seated.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> Thanks, sir.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> We are well enough standing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I cannot permit it——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> Don't trouble yourself, sir.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> If the gentleman orders it, it is better to take a
seat. [<i>Both sit down on sofa. Don Lorenzo remains
standing.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Their looks seem to bode no
good, or is it, perhaps, that my eyes only reflect the
flashes that dart across my mind? [<i>Inspects them again
attentively. Aloud.</i>] It was Miss Avendaña who saw
you when she passed, and mentioned it to me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> Yes, that beautiful young lady.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> Who looked so sorrowful.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> Like the picture of the Dolorosa. [<i>The keepers
speak shortly, and after these remarks fall into sudden
silence, remaining stiff and immovable, looking vaguely
before them.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You frightened her, and she almost ran
away at the sight of you. But you must not be
astonished. The poor girl is very ill—indeed, she is
scarce other than a child yet.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> [<i>Smiling sillily.</i>] It always happens to us in
every house.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aside, wondering.</i>] In every house!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> [<i>Looking for the first time at Don Lorenzo, and
again looking steadily in front of him.</i>] Can she be that
poor gentleman's daughter,—eh?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What poor gentleman?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> [<i>Without looking at him.</i>] The gentleman who
is—— [<i>Touches his forehead, still not looking at Don
Lorenzo, who, unobserved by the keepers, makes a gesture
of surprise.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Ah—no—what an idea! [<i>Aloud,
with an effort of self-control.</i>] Just so. She is the
daughter of—— [<i>Observes them with increasing anxiety.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> Well, she is very beautiful, though so sad.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> 'Tis reason enough she has to be sad.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You know——?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> Everything. [<i>Looks a moment at Don Lorenzo
and then away.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Dr. Tomás told you?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> Not to us.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> He told the doctor.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> Why should he talk to us? We, in doing our
duty——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] All my body is bathed in a cold
sweat, like the sweat of death. I am raving—This can't
possibly be true. [<i>Repeats mechanically.</i>] In doing your
duty——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> We are here on the look-out in case he should
become obstreperous.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> In case he should become obstreperous?—who?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> Why, the gentleman.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Falls back staring at him in terror;
passes his hand over his forehead as if to brush away an
idea; retreats still further, staggers, and leans against the
table. Then speaks low and abruptly in a dead voice.</i>]
So you know everything.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> Nearly everything.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> As we have been waiting here for some time, we
have heard the servants talk.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> They said——?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> They didn't leave us in the dark, you may be
sure. It appears Don Lorenzo had an attack the night
before last. You know all about it better than we do.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>In a heavy sombre tone.</i>] Yes.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> They say he strangled a poor old woman. [<i>Don
Lorenzo recoils in horror, and covers his face with his
hands.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> There's a fellow for you! A good beginning—that's
clear enough. It's always the same thing. The
family——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> The family! [<i>Removes his hands from
his face, walks a few steps as if shaken by an electric shock,
and stares at them with keen anxiety, speaking in the
same dead voice.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> Yes, the family—'tis natural enough.—Don't
they say he wanted to give all his fortune away? ever
so many millions. The devil of a lunatic altogether.
Nothing else for it but what has been decided—to pack
him off. We take him away and the poor ladies are
left in peace.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I!—they?—Ángela?—Inés—no, no—not
possible. [<i>Recoils again R.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> [<i>Staring after him. Aside.</i>] What's the matter
with the gentleman? [<i>To Benito.</i>] Look at him, look.
[<i>Both keepers draw together and bend forward in direction
R. looking curiously at Don Lorenzo. This group should be
made important.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Air, light! No, not light—darkness! I
do not want to see. I do not want to think. [<i>Falls into
arm-chair and lets his head drop into his palms.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> I say, I believe that's——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> This is a fine fix.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> Who would think it!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> Let us go back to our hiding-place.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> Sh! Say nothing about it. [<i>They rise and walk
cautiously to the closet, closely watching Don Lorenzo.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Braulio.</span> That's settled. Not a word. We were told to
stay in here. Then let us stay, and we'd have done
better not to budge.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Benito.</span> Somebody is crying and sobbing. [<i>They reach
the door, stand and look at Don Lorenzo, who has not
changed his attitude. Servant enters C., crosses and goes
out R.</i>] Leave him alone, leave him alone. Now that
he is calm. [<i>They enter closet and shut door.</i>]</p>

[<i>Sobs despairingly.</i>] Thou who madest me believe in
them. Thou who madest me love them!—and now
they—oh, traitors! No, no. Lord who hast given me
life, relieve me of its burden soon. See, Lord, how close
upon me is the temptation to thrust from me with my

yearn for death! Dost thou not see it? See me kneel

    <div><i>Don Lorenzo. Afterwards Dr. Tomás and Dr. Bermúdez.</i></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Now am I calmer. The hurt is mortal.
I feel it—here at the heart's core. Thanks, Almighty
consoler. [<i>Dr. Tomás and Dr. Bermúdez enter C. and

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> You see him there—beside the arm-chair.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> Unfortunate man!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Rising. Aside.</i>] Ah, miserable being—still,
still—cherishing impossible hopes. Impossible!
And suppose they honestly believe that I——? Oh, but
if they loved me, surely they would not believe it.
[<i>Despairingly. Pause.</i>] Did I not hear Inés—the child
I so greatly love—speak of remorse? Why should she
speak of remorse? [<i>Aloud with increasing agitation.</i>] All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>of them—wretches!—They would almost rejoice at my
death. No, then I will not die, no, not until I have
fulfilled my duty as an honourable man, not before I have

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Turning, recognises him, and retreats

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Let me introduce one of my best friends,
Dr. Bermúdez. [<i>Pause. Don Lorenzo looks at both
strangely.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> [<i>In low voice to Dr. Tomás.</i>] You can see the
effort he is making to control himself. There can be no
doubt that he is vaguely conscious of his condition.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> One of your best friends—one of your
best friends——</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> [<i>Aside to Dr. Tomás.</i>] An idea is escaping
him, and he is struggling to retain it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Ironically.</i>] Then if he is one of your
best friends, your loyalty will be a guarantee of his.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> [<i>Aside to Dr. Tomás.</i>] At last he has found
the word, but note the unnatural tones of his voice.
[<i>Aloud.</i>] I come, Dr. Tomás assures me, to witness a
most noble deed.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> And an act of unworthy treason as well.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> [<i>Aside to Dr. Tomás.</i>] Let him say what he

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> And of an exemplary chastisement.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> [<i>Aside to Dr. Tomás.</i>] It is very serious, my

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>To Dr. Tomás.</i>] Call everybody, everybody,

me with pity, the traitors! Oh, I am well sustained by
the certainty of triumph. Be still, my heart. There they

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Aside.</i>] Now they will see how my
madness is going to end. Before I leave this house with
what a hearty pleasure will I kick that doctor out.
Fresh vigour already animates me. What! Since when
has it become reason sufficient to declare a man mad
because he is resolved to perform his duty? Ah, that's
not very likely. Humanity is neither so blind nor so
base, though it is bad enough. Softly now. Treason
has begun its work; then let the punishment begin too.
[<i>Aloud.</i>] The hour has come for me to accomplish a
sacred obligation, however sharp a sorrow it may be.
It were a useless trouble to insist upon your presence at
the necessary legal formalities. It would only bore you.
The representative of law awaits me in yonder room. I,
in obeying a higher law, am about to renounce a fortune
that is not mine, as well as a name that neither I nor
my family can any longer bear with a clear conscience.
Afterwards I will return here, and with my wife and—and—my
daughter, will leave this house, which in the
past has only sheltered love and felicity, and to-day
offers me nothing but treason and wickedness. Let no
one seek to prevent me, for none of you can resist my

You yourself, madam, what is it you desire but Edward's

proof, Ángela, here, my child, is the proof. Listen.
[<i>Pause. Don Lorenzo opens envelope. All gather round
him.</i>] This is—what is this? [<i>Holds paper away from his
eyes, over which he rubs his hand.</i>] What shade is this
that dims my eyes? Can it be that there are tears in
them which impede clear vision? No,—I cried before—but
now I am not weeping. [<i>Looks at paper again with
horrible anxiety, opens it altogether, and seeks for writing
on all sides.</i>] Where are the words that woman wrote?
I have read them a thousand times—and now I can't——[<i>To
Dr. Tomás, holding out paper to him.</i>] What does it
say?—read, read—quickly—only tell me what it says.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Nothing, my poor friend.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Nothing! [<i>Again looks at paper.</i>] You
are deceiving me. Dr. Bermúdez, that fellow is deceiving
me. He is one of the scoundrels who have plotted
this wretched treason. Read it you—read it.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> There is nothing written on the paper.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Nothing written on it! You say there is
nothing written upon it! It is not true—no, it is not
true. Inés, my daughter, my best beloved, come and
save your father.—What does it say?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Oh, father, I see nothing.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Nothing!—she also!—But is this not the
proof?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Yes, my unhappy friend—the proof—but a
far too cruel one.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> [<i>Striking his forehead.</i>] Ah, I understand.
[<i>Looks at Dr. Tomás and Doña Ángela.</i>] I heard
them once before talking of a proof. You! [<i>to Dr.
Tomás</i>] and you! [<i>To Doña Ángela.</i>] You have taken
it away. God in Heaven! [<i>Recoils from them in horror.
The rest move away from him, and he stands alone in the
middle of the stage. Pause.</i>] Be it so,—be it so!—I am
defeated—most miserably defeated! How they rejoice
in their triumph! See how they gaze at me in their
hypocritical distress! And they feign to weep, too. They
are all feigning. [<i>Pause.</i>] Alas! my heart—alas! for my
life's illusion—alas! for love, and oh, alas! alas! my
child—phantoms that whirl about and fly from me—for
ever fly away!—I who believed in all things good—in
the blue above, in the purity of my daughter's brow—what
is there now left me to believe in? You see for
yourselves. I make no resistance. I yield myself up.
Yours the victory. Why have you brought those men
here when I do not seek to oppose your will? I will go
wherever you bid me. Adieu. Don't touch me. [<i>To Dr.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span><i>Tomás, who approaches and takes his hand.</i>] When
human flesh comes in contact with mine, it seems to me
that vipers crawl along my skin. Alone—alone will I
ascend my Calvary bearing my cross of sorrows without
an infamous Cyrenean to assist me. Farewell, loyal
friend [<i>still addresses Dr. Tomás</i>], who have saved the
fortune of this disconsolate family from the hands of a
madman. Farewell, Ángela, my tender-hearted wife.
Twenty years ago, mad with love of you, I gave you my
first kiss. To-day, no less a madman, I send you the
last. [<i>Kisses his hand to her with cry and expression of
desperate grief.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Don't come near me. I might strangle
you in my arms. [<i>Ángela recoils.</i>] Farewell, Inés, my
only child. Be happy—if you can. To you I say
nothing. I could not speak to you unkindly. [<i>Walks
a few steps feebly, then stops. Repulses roughly those who
rush to his assistance.</i>] Let me be. I require no one.
My brow is damp with sweat, and thirst is upon my dry
lips, and a fiery heat seems to swell my eyelids. [<i>Stops
again.</i>] Listen to me, Inés, my child.—If you still retain
any love for me,—if by chance your heart is touched
with pity for your father,—if you feel regret for what
you have done against me along with the rest of them—come
once to my arms. Let me carry away into the
hell of suffering that awaits me one tear of your eyes
upon my cheek, one kiss of your dear lips upon mine.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Father! [<i>All endeavour to restrain her, but she breaks
from them and runs to Don Lorenzo, who catches her in his
arms and holds her closely clasped to his breast.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> My child! [<i>The rest advance to them, but
make no effort to separate them.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> No—they must not take you away—I love you
dearly,—every one lies but you.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> You would not have those men carry me
off?</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> No, no; I will defend you—and you defend me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> Yes! I will defend you—Let them drag
you from my arms if they can. [<i>Makes a movement to
carry her away.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> My child, my child! Help! [<i>Edward,
Dr. Tomás and Bermúdez struggle to separate father and
daughter.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I will not let her go—for ever in my arms!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Yes, yes, father. Defend me.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Bermúdez.</span> It is imperative.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> Don Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Dr. Tomás.</span> Lorenzo!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Duchess.</span> Merciful god, he will kill her as he killed Juana!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Doña Ángela.</span> Inés! [<i>These exclamations are simultaneous:
the struggle is swift. Keepers enter. The men
hold Don Lorenzo, and the women restrain Inés, keeping
her by force from her father.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Edward.</span> At last!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Father! [<i>Holds her arms out to Don Lorenzo.</i>]</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> I was not able, child.—I could do no more.—Here
upon my cheek I feel your kisses and your tears.—She
at least loved me—she was innocent—I see it now.
God above, thou hast accepted my martyrdom in that
night of agony and temptation in exchange for her
happiness. I do not regret it. Make her happy—very
happy! and let the cup of bitterness be mine alone—only
mine!</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Inés.</span> Adieu, father—I will save you yet.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span><span class='sc'>Don Lorenzo.</span> What can you do, child—when God himself
has not seen fit to save me? [<i>Remains near closet
between keepers, guarded by Edward, Dr. Tomás and
Bermúdez. Inés, held back by the other women, stands
with arms strained towards him.</i>]</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
