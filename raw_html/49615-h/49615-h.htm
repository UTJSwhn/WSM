<h3>PROPHET, PRIEST AND KING</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> little theatrical company I write my plays
for had come to a west of Ireland town, and
was to give a performance in an old ball-room,
for there was no other room big enough. I
went there from a neighbouring country-house,
and, arriving a little before the players, tried to
open a window. My hands were black with
dirt in a moment, and presently a pane of glass
and a part of the window-frame came out in
my hands. Everything in this room was half
in ruins, the rotten boards cracked under my
feet, and our new proscenium and the new
boards of the platform looked out of place, and
yet the room was not really old, in spite of the
musicians’ gallery over the stage. It had been
built by some romantic or philanthropic landlord
some three or four generations ago, and
was a memory of we knew not what unfinished
scheme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>From there I went to look for the players,
and called for information on a young priest,
who had invited them and taken upon himself
the finding of an audience. He lived in a
high house with other priests, and as I went
in I noticed with a whimsical pleasure a broken
pane of glass in the fanlight over the door, for
he had once told me the story of an old woman
who a good many years ago quarrelled with the
bishop, got drunk and hurled a stone through
the painted glass. He was a clever man who
read Meredith and Ibsen, but some of his books
had been packed in the fire-grate by his housekeeper,
instead of the customary view of an
Italian lake or the coloured tissue-paper. The
players, who had been giving a performance in a
neighbouring town, had not yet come, or were
unpacking their costumes and properties at the
hotel he had recommended them. We should
have time, he said, to go through the half-ruined
town and to visit the convent schools
and the cathedral, where, owing to his influence,
two of our young Irish sculptors had been set
to carve an altar and the heads of pillars. I
had only heard of this work, and I found its
strangeness and simplicity—one of them had
been Rodin’s pupil—could not make me forget
the meretriciousness of the architecture and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the commercial commonplace of the inlaid
pavements. The new movement had seized
on the cathedral midway in its growth, and
the worst of the old and the best of the new
were side by side without any sign of transition.
The convent school was, as other like
places have been to me—a long room in a
workhouse hospital at Portumna, in particular—a
delight to the imagination and the eyes. A
new floor had been put into some ecclesiastical
building and the light from a great mullioned
window, cut off at the middle, fell aslant upon
rows of clean and seemingly happy children.
The nuns, who show in their own convents,
where they can put what they like, a love of
what is mean and pretty, make beautiful rooms
where the regulations compel them to do all
with a few colours and a few flowers. I think
it was that day, but am not sure, that I had
lunch at a convent and told fairy stories to a
couple of nuns, and I hope it was not mere
politeness that made them seem to have a child’s
interest in such things.</p>

<p>A good many of our audience, when the
curtain went up in the old ball-room, were
drunk, but all were attentive, for they had a
great deal of respect for my friend, and there
were other priests there. Presently the man at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the door opposite to the stage strayed off somewhere
and I took his place, and when boys
came up offering two or three pence and asking
to be let into the sixpenny seats, I let them
join the melancholy crowd. The play professed
to tell of the heroic life of ancient Ireland, but
was really full of sedentary refinement and the
spirituality of cities. Every emotion was made
as dainty-footed and dainty-fingered as might
be, and a love and pathos where passion had
faded into sentiment, emotions of pensive and
harmless people, drove shadowy young men
through the shadows of death and battle. I
watched it with growing rage. It was not my
own work, but I have sometimes watched my
own work with a rage made all the more salt
in the mouth from being half despair. Why
should we make so much noise about ourselves
and yet have nothing to say that was not better
said in that workhouse dormitory, where a few
flowers and a few coloured counterpanes and
the coloured walls had made a severe and
gracious beauty? Presently the play was changed
and our comedian began to act a little farce,
and when I saw him struggle to wake into
laughter an audience, out of whom the life
had run as if it were water, I rejoiced, as I had
over that broken window-pane. Here was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
something secular, abounding, even a little
vulgar, for he was gagging horribly, condescending
to his audience, though not without
contempt.</p>

<p>We had supper in the priest’s house, and a
government official, who had come down from
Dublin, partly out of interest in this attempt
‘to educate the people,’ and partly because it
was his holiday and it was necessary to go somewhere,
entertained us with little jokes. Somebody,
not, I think, a priest, talked of the spiritual
destiny of our race and praised the night’s work,
for the play was refined and the people really
very attentive, and he could not understand my
discontent; but presently he was silenced by the
patter of jokes.</p>

<p>I had my breakfast by myself the next morning,
for the players had got up in the middle
of the night and driven some ten miles to catch
an early train to Dublin, and were already on
their way to their shops and offices. I had
brought the visitors’ book of the hotel, to turn
over its pages while waiting for my bacon and
eggs, and found several pages full of obscenities,
scrawled there some two or three weeks before,
by Dublin visitors, it seemed, for a notorious
Dublin street was mentioned. Nobody had
thought it worth his while to tear out the page<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
or block out the lines, and as I put the book
away impressions that had been drifting through
my mind for months rushed up into a single
thought. ‘If we poets are to move the people,
we must reintegrate the human spirit in our
imagination. The English have driven away
the kings, and turned the prophets into demagogues,
and you cannot have health among a
people if you have not prophet, priest and
king.’</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>PERSONALITY AND THE
INTELLECTUAL ESSENCES</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">My</span> work in Ireland has continually set this
thought before me: ‘How can I make my
work mean something to vigorous and simple
men whose attention is not given to art but to
a shop, or teaching in a National School, or
dispensing medicine?’ I had not wanted to
‘elevate them’ or ‘educate them,’ as these
words are understood, but to make them understand
my vision, and I had not wanted a large
audience, certainly not what is called a national
audience, but enough people for what is accidental
and temporary to lose itself in the lump.
In England, where there have been so many
changing activities and so much systematic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
education, one only escapes from crudities and
temporary interests among students, but here
there is the right audience could one but get
its ears. I have always come to this certainty:
what moves natural men in the arts is what
moves them in life, and that is, intensity of
personal life, intonations that show them in a
book or a play, the strength, the essential
moment of a man who would be exciting in
the market or at the dispensary door. They
must go out of the theatre with the strength
they live by strengthened with looking upon
some passion that could, whatever its chosen
way of life, strike down an enemy, fill a long
stocking with money or move a girl’s heart.
They have not much to do with the speculations
of science, though they have a little, or
with the speculations of metaphysics, though
they have a little. Their legs will tire on the
road if there is nothing in their hearts but
vague sentiment, and though it is charming to
have an affectionate feeling about flowers, that
will not pull the cart out of the ditch. An
exciting person, whether the hero of a play or
the maker of poems, will display the greatest
volume of personal energy, and this energy
must seem to come out of the body as out of
the mind. We must say to ourselves continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
when we imagine a character: ‘Have
I given him the roots, as it were, of all faculties
necessary for life?’ And only when one
is certain of that may one give him the one
faculty that fills the imagination with joy. I
even doubt if any play had ever a great popularity
that did not use, or seem to use, the
bodily energies of its principal actor to the full.
Villon the robber could have delighted these
Irishmen with plays and songs, if he and they
had been born to the same traditions of word
and symbol, but Shelley could not; and as men
came to live in towns and to read printed books
and to have many specialised activities, it has
become more possible to produce Shelleys and
less and less possible to produce Villons. The
last Villon dwindled into Robert Burns because
the highest faculties had faded, taking the sense
of beauty with them, into some sort of vague
heaven and left the lower to lumber where
they best could. In literature, partly from the
lack of that spoken word which knits us to
normal man, we have lost in personality, in our
delight in the whole man—blood, imagination,
intellect, running together—but have found a
new delight, in essences, in states of mind, in
pure imagination, in all that comes to us most
easily in elaborate music. There are two ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
before literature—upward into ever-growing
subtlety, with Verhaeren, with Mallarmé, with
Maeterlinck, until at last, it may be, a new
agreement among refined and studious men
gives birth to a new passion, and what seems
literature becomes religion; or downward,
taking the soul with us until all is simplified
and solidified again. That is the choice of
choices—the way of the bird until common
eyes have lost us, or to the market carts; but
we must see to it that the soul goes with us,
for the bird’s song is beautiful, and the traditions
of modern imagination, growing always
more musical, more lyrical, more melancholy,
casting up now a Shelley, now a Swinburne,
now a Wagner, are, it may be, the frenzy of
those that are about to see what the magic
hymn printed by the Abbé de Villars has called
the Crown of Living and Melodious Diamonds.
If the carts have hit our fancy we must have
the soul tight within our bodies, for it has
grown so fond of a beauty accumulated by
subtle generations that it will for a long time
be impatient with our thirst for mere force,
mere personality, for the tumult of the blood.
If it begin to slip away we must go after it,
for Shelley’s Chapel of the Morning Star is
better than Burns’s beer-house—surely it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
beer, not barleycorn—except at the day’s weary
end; and it is always better than that uncomfortable
place where there is no beer, the
machine shop of the realists.</p>

<h3>THE MUSICIAN AND THE ORATOR</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Walter Pater</span> says music is the type of all
the Arts, but somebody else, I forget now who,
that oratory is their type. You will side with
the one or the other according to the nature
of your energy, and I in my present mood am
all for the man who, with an average audience
before him, uses all means of persuasion—stories,
laughter, tears, and but so much music
as he can discover on the wings of words. I
would even avoid the conversation of the lovers
of music, who would draw us into the impersonal
land of sound and colour, and would
have no one write with a sonata in his memory.
We may even speak a little evil of musicians,
having admitted that they will see before we
do that melodious crown. We may remind
them that the housemaid does not respect the
piano-tuner as she does the plumber, and of
the enmity that they have aroused among all
poets. Music is the most impersonal of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and words the most personal, and that is why
musicians do not like words. They masticate
them for a long time, being afraid they would
not be able to digest them, and when the words
are so broken and softened and mixed with
spittle that they are not words any longer,
they swallow them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>A GUITAR PLAYER</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A girl</span> has been playing on the guitar. She is
pretty, and if I didn’t listen to her I could have
watched her, and if I didn’t watch her I could
have listened. Her voice, the movements of
her body, the expression of her face, all said
the same thing. A player of a different temper
and body would have made all different, and
might have been delightful in some other way.
A movement not of music only but of life came
to its perfection. I was delighted and I did
not know why until I thought, ‘That is the
way my people, the people I see in the mind’s
eye, play music, and I like it because it is all
personal, as personal as Villon’s poetry.’ The
little instrument is quite light, and the player
can move freely and express a joy that is not
of the fingers and the mind only but of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
whole being; and all the while her movements
call up into the mind, so erect and natural she
is, whatever is most beautiful in her daily life.
Nearly all the old instruments were like that,
even the organ was once a little instrument,
and when it grew big our wise forefathers gave
it to God in the cathedrals, where it befits him
to be everything. But if you sit at the piano,
it is the piano, the mechanism, that is the important
thing, and nothing of you means anything
but your fingers and your intellect.</p>

<h3>THE LOOKING-GLASS</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> just been talking to a girl with a shrill
monotonous voice and an abrupt way of moving.
She is fresh from school, where they have taught
her history and geography ‘whereby a soul can
be discerned,’ but what is the value of an education,
or even in the long run of a science, that
does not begin with the personality, the
habitual self, and illustrate all by that? Somebody
should have taught her to speak for the
most part on whatever note of her voice is
most musical, and soften those harsh notes by
speaking, not singing, to some stringed instrument,
taking note after note and, as it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
caressing her words a little as if she loved the
sound of them, and have taught her after this
some beautiful pantomimic dance, till it had
grown a habit to live for eye and ear. A wise
theatre might make a training in strong and
beautiful life the fashion, teaching before all
else the heroic discipline of the looking-glass,
for is not beauty, even as lasting love, one of
the most difficult of the arts?</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>THE TREE OF LIFE</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> artists have taken over-much to heart that
old commandment about seeking after the Kingdom
of Heaven. Verlaine told me that he had
tried to translate ‘In Memoriam,’ but could
not because Tennyson was ‘too noble, too
Anglais, and, when he should have been broken-hearted,
had many reminiscences.’ About that
time I found in some English review an essay
of his on Shakespeare. ‘I had once a fine
Shakespeare,’ he wrote, or some such words,
‘but I have it no longer. I write from memory.’
One wondered in what vicissitude he had sold
it, and for what money; and an image of the
man rose in the imagination. To be his ordinary
self as much as possible, not a scholar or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
even a reader, that was certainly his pose; and
in the lecture he gave at Oxford he insisted
‘that the poet should hide nothing of himself,’
though he must speak it all with ‘a care of
that dignity which should manifest itself, if
not in the perfection of form, at all events with
an invisible, insensible, but effectual endeavour
after this lofty and severe quality, I was about
to say this virtue.’ It was this feeling for his own
personality, his delight in singing his own life,
even more than that life itself, which made the
generation I belong to compare him to Villon.
It was not till after his death that I understood
the meaning his words should have had
for me, for while he lived I was interested in
nothing but states of mind, lyrical moments,
intellectual essences. I would not then have
been as delighted as I am now by that guitar
player, or as shocked as I am now by that girl
whose movements have grown abrupt, and
whose voice has grown harsh by the neglect
of all but external activities. I had not learned
what sweetness, what rhythmic movement,
there is in those who have become the joy that
is themselves. Without knowing it, I had come
to care for nothing but impersonal beauty. I
had set out on life with the thought of putting
my very self into poetry, and had understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
this as a representation of my own visions and
an attempt to cut away the non-essential, but
as I imagined the visions outside myself my
imagination became full of decorative landscape
and of still life. I thought of myself as something
unmoving and silent living in the middle
of my own mind and body, a grain of sand in
Bloomsbury or in Connacht that Satan’s watch
fiends cannot find. Then one day I understood
quite suddenly, as the way is, that I was seeking
something unchanging and unmixed and always
outside myself, a Stone or an Elixir that was
always out of reach, and that I myself was the
fleeting thing that held out its hand. The
more I tried to make my art deliberately beautiful,
the more did I follow the opposite of
myself, for deliberate beauty is like a woman
always desiring man’s desire. Presently I found
that I entered into myself and pictured myself
and not some essence when I was not seeking
beauty at all, but merely to lighten the mind
of some burden of love or bitterness thrown
upon it by the events of life. We are only
permitted to desire life, and all the rest should
be our complaints or our praise of that exacting
mistress who can awake our lips into song
with her kisses. But we must not give her all,
we must deceive her a little at times, for, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Le Sage says in <i>The Devil on Two Sticks</i>, the
false lovers who do not become melancholy or
jealous with honest passion have the happiest
mistress and are rewarded the soonest and by
the most beautiful. Our deceit will give us
style, mastery, that dignity, that lofty and
severe quality Verlaine spoke of. To put it
otherwise, we should ascend out of common
interests, the thoughts of the newspapers, of
the market-place, of men of science, but only
so far as we can carry the normal, passionate,
reasoning self, the personality as a whole. We
must find some place upon the Tree of Life
high enough for the forked branches to keep
it safe, and low enough to be out of the little
wind-tossed boughs and twigs, for the Phœnix
nest, for the passion that is exaltation and not
negation of the will, for the wings that are
always upon fire.</p>

<h3>THE PRAISE OF OLD WIVES’ TALES</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">An</span> art may become impersonal because it has
too much circumstance or too little, because
the world is too little or too much with it,
because it is too near the ground or too far up
among the branches. I met an old man out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
fishing a year ago, who said to me, ‘Don
Quixote and Odysseus are always near to me’;
that is true for me also, for even Hamlet and
Lear and Œdipus are more cloudy. No playwright
ever has made or ever will make a
character that will follow us out of the theatre
as Don Quixote follows us out of the book, for
no playwright can be wholly episodical, and
when one constructs, bringing one’s characters
into complicated relations with one another,
something impersonal comes into the story.
Society, fate, ‘tendency,’ something not quite
human, begins to arrange the characters and
to excite into action only so much of their
humanity as they find it necessary to show to
one another. The common heart will always
love better the tales that have something of an
old wives’ tale and that look upon their hero
from every side as if he alone were wonderful,
as a child does with a new penny. In plays of
a comedy too extravagant to photograph life,
or written in verse, the construction is of a
necessity woven out of naked motives and passions,
but when an atmosphere of modern
reality has to be built up as well, and the tendency,
or fate, or society has to be shown as it
is about ourselves, the characters grow fainter,
and we have to read the book many times or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
see the play many times before we can remember
them. Even then they are only possible
in a certain drawing-room and among such and
such people, and we must carry all that lumber
in our heads. I thought Tolstoi’s ‘War and
Peace’ the greatest story I had ever read, and
yet it has gone from me; even Lancelot, ever
a shadow, is more visible in my memory than
all its substance.</p>

<h3>THE PLAY OF MODERN MANNERS</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all artistic forms that have had a large
share of the world’s attention, the worst is the
play about modern educated people. Except
where it is superficial or deliberately argumentative
it fills one’s soul with a sense of commonness
as with dust. It has one mortal ailment.
It cannot become impassioned, that is to say
vital, without making somebody gushing and
sentimental. Educated and well-bred people
do not wear their hearts upon their sleeves and
they have no artistic and charming language
except light persiflage and no powerful language
at all, and when they are deeply moved they
look silently into the fireplace. Again and
again I have watched some play of this sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
with growing curiosity through the opening
scene. The minor people argue, chaff one
another, hint sometimes at some deeper stream
of life just as we do in our houses, and I am
content. But all the time I have been wondering
why the chief character, the man who is
to bear the burden of fate, is gushing, sentimental
and quite without ideas. Then the
great scene comes and I understand that he
cannot be well-bred or self-possessed or intellectual,
for if he were he would draw a chair
to the fire and there would be no duologue
at the end of the third act. Ibsen understood
the difficulty and made all his characters a little
provincial that they might not put each other
out of countenance, and made a leading article
sort of poetry, phrases about vine leaves and
harps in the air it was possible to believe them
using in their moments of excitement, and if
the play needed more than that, they could
always do something stupid. They could go
out and hoist a flag as they do at the end of
<i>Little Eyolf</i>. One only understands that this
manner, deliberately adopted one doubts not,
had gone into his soul and filled it with dust,
when one has noticed that he could no longer
create a man of genius. The happiest writers
are those that, knowing this form of play is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
slight and passing, keep to the surface, never
showing anything but the arguments and the
persiflage of daily observation, or now and then,
instead of the expression of passion, a stage
picture, a man holding a woman’s hand or
sitting with his head in his hands in dim light
by the red glow of a fire. It was certainly an
understanding of the slightness of the form, of
its incapacity for the expression of the deeper
sorts of passion, that made the French invent
the play with a thesis, for where there is a
thesis people can grow hot in argument, almost
the only kind of passion that displays itself in
our daily life. The novel of contemporary
educated life is upon the other hand a permanent
form because having the power of
psychological description it can follow the
thought of a man who is looking into the grate.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>HAS THE DRAMA OF CONTEMPORARY
LIFE A ROOT OF ITS OWN?</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> watching a play about modern educated
people, with its meagre language and its action
crushed into the narrow limits of possibility, I
have found myself constantly saying: ‘Maybe
it has its power to move, slight as that is, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
being able to suggest fundamental contrasts and
passions which romantic and poetical literature
have shown to be beautiful.’ A man facing his
enemies alone in a quarrel over the purity of
the water in a Norwegian Spa and using no
language but that of the newspapers can call
up into our minds, let us say, the passion of
Coriolanus. The lovers and fighters of old
imaginative literature are more vivid experiences
in the soul than anything but one’s own
ruling passion that is itself riddled by their
thought as by lightning, and even two dumb
figures on the roads can call up all that glory.
Put the man who has no knowledge of literature
before a play of this kind and he will
say, as he has said in some form or other in
every age at the first shock of naturalism,
‘What has brought me out to hear nothing
but the words we use at home when we are
talking of the rates?’ And he will prefer to
it any play where there is visible beauty or
mirth, where life is exciting, at high tide as it
were. It is not his fault that he will prefer in
all likelihood a worse play although its kind
may be greater, for we have been following
the lure of science for generations and forgotten
him and his. I come always back to this
thought. There is something of an old wives’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
tale in fine literature. The makers of it are
like an old peasant telling stories of the great
famine or the hangings of ’98 or his own
memories. He has felt something in the depth
of his mind and he wants to make it as visible
and powerful to our senses as possible. He will
use the most extravagant words or illustrations
if they suit his purpose. Or he will invent a
wild parable, and the more his mind is on fire
or the more creative it is, the less will he look
at the outer world or value it for its own sake.
It gives him metaphors and examples and that
is all. He is even a little scornful of it, for it
seems to him while the fit is on that the fire
has gone out of it and left it but white ashes.
I cannot explain it, but I am certain that every
high thing was invented in this way, between
sleeping and waking, as it were, and that peering
and peeping persons are but hawkers of
stolen goods. How else could their noses have
grown so ravenous or their eyes so sharp?</p>

<h3>WHY THE BLIND MAN IN ANCIENT
TIMES WAS MADE A POET</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A description</span> in the Iliad or the Odyssey,
unlike one in the Æneid or in most modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
writers, is the swift and natural observation of
a man as he is shaped by life. It is a refinement
of the primary hungers and has the least
possible of what is merely scholarly or exceptional.
It is, above all, never too observant,
too professional, and when the book is closed
we have had our energies enriched, for we have
been in the mid-current. We have never seen
anything Odysseus could not have seen while
his thought was of the Cyclops, or Achilles
when Briseis moved him to desire. In the
heart of the greatest periods there is something
careless and sudden in all habitual moods though
not in their expression, because these moods
are a conflagration of all the energies of active
life. In primitive times the blind man became
a poet as he becomes a fiddler in our villages,
because he had to be driven out of activities
all his nature cried for before he could be contented
with the praise of life. And often it is
Villon or Verlaine with impediments plain to
all, who sings of life with the ancient simplicity.
Poets of coming days, when once more it will
be possible to write as in the great epochs, will
recognise that their sacrifice shall be to refuse
what blindness and evil name, or imprisonment
at the outsetting, denied to men who missed
thereby the sting of a deliberate refusal. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
poets of the ages of silver need no refusal of
life, the dome of many-coloured glass is already
shattered while they live. They look at life
deliberately and as if from beyond life, and the
greatest of them need suffer nothing but the
sadness that the saints have known. This is
their aim, and their temptation is not a passionate
activity, but the approval of their fellows,
which comes to them in full abundance only
when they delight in the general thoughts
that hold together a cultivated middle-class,
where irresponsibilities of position and poverty
are lacking; the things that are more excellent
among educated men who have political pre-occupations,
Augustus Cæsar’s affability, all
that impersonal fecundity which muddies the
intellectual passions. Ben Jonson says in the
‘Poetaster,’ that even the best of men without
Promethean fire is but a hollow statue, and a
studious man will commonly forget after some
forty winters that of a certainty Promethean
fire will burn somebody’s fingers. It may
happen that poets will be made more often by
their sins than by their virtues, for general
praise is unlucky, as the villages know, and not
merely as I imagine—for I am superstitious
about these things—because the praise of all
but an equal enslaves and adds a pound to the
ball at the ankle with every compliment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>All energy that comes from the whole man
is as irregular as the lightning, for the communicable
and forecastable and discoverable is
a part only, a hungry chicken under the breast
of the pelican, and the test of poetry is not in
reason but in a delight not different from the
delight that comes to a man at the first coming
of love into the heart. I knew an old man
who had spent his whole life cutting hazel and
privet from the paths, and in some seventy years
he had observed little but had many imaginations.
He had never seen like a naturalist,
never seen things as they are, for his habitual
mood had been that of a man stirred in his
affairs; and Shakespeare, Tintoretto, though
the times were running out when Tintoretto
painted, nearly all the great men of the Renaissance,
looked at the world with eyes like his.
Their minds were never quiescent, never as it
were in a mood for scientific observations,
always an exaltation, never—to use known
words—founded upon an elimination of the
personal factor; and their attention and the
attention of those they worked for dwelt constantly
with what is present to the mind in
exaltation. I am too modern fully to enjoy
Tintoretto’s Creation of the Milky Way, I
cannot fix my thoughts upon that glowing and
palpitating flesh intently enough to forget, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
can the make-believe of a fairy tale, that heavy
drapery hanging from a cloud, though I find my
pleasure in <i>King Lear</i> heightened by the make-believe
that comes upon it all when the fool
says: ‘This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I
live before his time’;—and I always find it quite
natural, so little does logic in the mere circumstance
matter in the finest art, that Richard’s
and Richmond’s tents should be side by side.
I saw with delight <i>The Knight of the Burning
Pestle</i> when Mr. Carr revived it, and found
it none the worse because the apprentice acted
a whole play upon the spur of the moment and
without committing a line to heart. When
Ben Jonson’s <i>Epicœne</i> rammed a century of
laughter into the two hours’ traffic, I found
with amazement that almost every journalist
had put logic on the seat, where our lady
imagination should pronounce that unjust and
favouring sentence her woman’s heart is ever
plotting, and had felt bound to cherish none
but reasonable sympathies and to resent the
baiting of that grotesque old man. I have
been looking over a book of engravings made
in the eighteenth century from those wall-pictures
of Herculaneum and Pompeii that
were, it seems, the work of journeymen copying
from finer paintings, for the composition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
is always too good for the execution. I find in
great numbers an indifference to obvious logic,
to all that the eye sees at common moments.
Perseus shows Andromeda the death she lived
by in a pool, and though the lovers are carefully
drawn the reflection is upside down that
we may see it the better. There is hardly an
old master who has not made known to us in
some like way how little he cares for what
every fool can see and every knave can praise.
The men who imagined the arts were not less
superstitious in religion, understanding the
spiritual relations, but not the mechanical, and
finding nothing that need strain the throat in
those gnats the floods of Noah and Deucalion,
and in Joshua’s moon at Ascalon.</p>

<h3>CONCERNING SAINTS AND ARTISTS</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I took</span> the Indian hemp with certain followers
of St. Martin on the ground floor of a house
in the Latin Quarter. I had never taken it
before, and was instructed by a boisterous young
poet, whose English was no better than my
French. He gave me a little pellet, if I am
not forgetting, an hour before dinner, and
another after we had dined together at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
restaurant. As we were going through the
streets to the meeting-place of the Martinists,
I felt suddenly that a cloud I was looking at
floated in an immense space, and for an instant
my being rushed out, as it seemed, into that
space with ecstasy. I was myself again immediately,
but the poet was wholly above himself,
and presently he pointed to one of the
street lamps now brightening in the fading
twilight, and cried at the top of his voice,
‘Why do you look at me with your great
eye?’ There were perhaps a dozen people
already much excited when we arrived; and
after I had drunk some cups of coffee and eaten
a pellet or two more, I grew very anxious to
dance, but did not, as I could not remember
any steps. I sat down and closed my eyes; but
no, I had no visions, nothing but a sensation
of some dark shadow which seemed to be telling
me that some day I would go into a trance
and so out of my body for awhile, but not yet.
I opened my eyes and looked at some red ornament
on the mantelpiece, and at once the room
was full of harmonies of red, but when a blue
china figure caught my eye the harmonies became
blue upon the instant. I was puzzled, for
the reds were all there, nothing had changed,
but they were no longer important or harmonious;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and why had the blues so unimportant
but a moment ago become exciting and delightful?
Thereupon it struck me that I was seeing
like a painter, and that in the course of the
evening everyone there would change through
every kind of artistic perception.</p>

<p>After a while a Martinist ran towards me
with a piece of paper on which he had drawn
a circle with a dot in it, and pointing at it
with his finger he cried out, ‘God, God!’
Some immeasurable mystery had been revealed,
and his eyes shone; and at some time or other
a lean and shabby man, with rather a distinguished
face, showed me his horoscope and
pointed with an ecstasy of melancholy at its
evil aspects. The boisterous poet, who was an
old eater of the Indian hemp, had told me that
it took one three months growing used to it,
three months more enjoying it, and three
months being cured of it. These men were in
their second period; but I never forgot myself,
never really rose above myself for more than a
moment, and was even able to feel the absurdity
of that gaiety, an Herr Nordau among the men
of genius, but one that was abashed at his own
sobriety. The sky outside was beginning to
grey when there came a knocking at the window
shutters. Somebody opened the window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and a woman in evening dress, who was not a
little bewildered to find so many people, was
helped down into the room. She had been at
a students’ ball unknown to her husband, who
was asleep overhead, and had thought to have
crept home unobserved, but for a confederate
at the window. All those talking or dancing
men laughed in a dreamy way; and she, understanding
that there was no judgment in the
laughter of men that had no thought but of
the spectacle of the world, blushed, laughed
and darted through the room and so upstairs.
Alas that the hangman’s rope should be own
brother to that Indian happiness that keeps
alone, were it not for some stray cactus, mother
of as many dreams, an immemorial impartiality
and simpleness.</p>

<h3>THE SUBJECT MATTER OF DRAMA</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I read</span> this sentence a few days ago, or one
like it, in an obituary of Ibsen: ‘Let nobody
again go back to the old ballad material of
Shakespeare, to murders, and ghosts, for what
interests us on the stage is modern experience
and the discussion of our interests’; and in
another part of the article Ibsen was blamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
because he had written of suicides and in other
ways made use of ‘the morbid terror of death.’
Dramatic literature has for a long time been
left to the criticism of journalists, and all these,
the old stupid ones and the new clever ones,
have tried to impress upon it their absorption
in the life of the moment, their delight in
obvious originality and in obvious logic, their
shrinking from the ancient and insoluble. The
writer I have quoted is much more than a
journalist, but he has lived their hurried life,
and instinctively turns to them for judgment.
He is not thinking of the great poets and
painters, of the cloud of witnesses, who are
there that we may become, through our understanding
of their minds, spectators of the
ages, but of this age. Drama is a means of
expression, not a special subject matter, and
the dramatist is as free to choose where he
has a mind to as the poet of ‘Endymion’ or as
the painter of Mary Magdalene at the door of
Simon the Pharisee. So far from the discussion
of our interests and the immediate circumstance
of our life being the most moving to the imagination,
it is what is old and far off that stirs
us the most deeply. There is a sentence in
<i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> that is meaningless
until we understand Blake’s system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
correspondences. ‘The best wine is the oldest,
the best water the newest.’</p>

<p>Water is experience, immediate sensation,
and wine is emotion, and it is with the intellect,
as distinguished from imagination, that
we enlarge the bounds of experience and separate
it from all but itself, from illusion, from
memory, and create among other things science
and good journalism. Emotion, on the other
hand, grows intoxicating and delightful after it
has been enriched with the memory of old
emotions, with all the uncounted flavours of
old experience, and it is necessarily an antiquity
of thought, emotions that have been deepened
by the experiences of many men of genius,
that distinguishes the cultivated man. The
subject-matter of his meditation and invention
is old, and he will disdain a too conscious
originality in the arts as in those matters of
daily life where, is it not Balzac who says, ‘we
are all conservatives’? He is above all things
well-bred, and whether he write or paint will
not desire a technique that denies or obtrudes
his long and noble descent. Corneille and
Racine did not deny their masters, and when
Dante spoke of his master Virgil there was no
crowing of the cock. In their day imitation
was conscious or all but conscious, and while
originality was but so much the more a part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the man himself, so much the deeper because
unconscious, no quick analysis could find out
their miracle, that needed, it may be, generations
to reveal; but it is our imitation that is
unconscious and that waits the certainties of
time. The more religious the subject-matter of
an art, the more will it be as it were stationary,
and the more ancient will be the emotion that
it arouses and the circumstances that it calls
up before our eyes. When in the Middle Ages
the pilgrim to St. Patrick’s Purgatory found
himself on the lake side, he found a boat made
out of a hollow tree to ferry him to the cave
of vision. In religious painting and poetry,
crowns and swords of an ancient pattern take
upon themselves new meanings, and it is impossible
to separate our idea of what is noble
from a mystic stair, where not men and women,
but robes, jewels, incidents, ancient utilities
float upward slowly over the all but sleeping
mind, putting on emotional and spiritual life
as they ascend until they are swallowed up by
some far glory that they even were too
modern and momentary to endure. All art is
dream, and what the day is done with is dreaming
ripe, and what art moulds religion accepts,
and in the end all is in the wine cup, all is in
the drunken phantasy, and the grapes begin to
stammer.</p>

<h3>THE TWO KINDS OF ASCETICISM</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is not possible to separate an emotion or a
spiritual state from the image that calls it up
and gives it expression. Michael Angelo’s
Moses, Velasquez’ Philip the Second, the colour
purple, a crucifix, call into life an emotion or
state that vanishes with them because they are
its only possible expression, and that is why
no mind is more valuable than the images it
contains. The imaginative writer differs from
the saint in that he identifies himself—to the
neglect of his own soul, alas!—with the soul
of the world, and frees himself from all that
is impermanent in that soul, an ascetic not of
women and wine, but of the newspapers. That
which is permanent in the soul of the world
upon the other hand, the great passions that
trouble all and have but a brief recurring life
of flower and seed in any man, is the renunciation
of the saint who seeks not an eternal art,
but his own eternity. The artist stands between
the saint and the world of impermanent things,
and just in so far as his mind dwells on what
is impermanent in his sense, on all that ‘modern
experience and the discussion of our interests,’
that is to say on what never recurs, as desire
and hope, terror and weariness, spring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
autumn, recur in varying rhythms, will his
mind become critical, as distinguished from
creative, and his emotions wither. He will
think less of what he sees and more of his own
attitude towards it, and will express this attitude
by an essentially critical selection and
emphasis. I am not quite sure of my memory,
but I think that Mr. Ricketts has said in his
book on the Prado that he feels the critic in
Velasquez for the first time in painting, and
we all feel the critic in Whistler and Degas,
in Browning, even in Mr. Swinburne, in the
finest art of all ages but the greatest. The end
for art is the ecstasy awakened by the presence
before an ever-changing mind of what is permanent
in the world, or by the arousing of that
mind itself into the very delicate and fastidious
mood habitual with it when it is seeking those
permanent and recurring things. There is a
little of both ecstasies at all times, but at this
time we have a small measure of the creative
impulse itself, of the divine vision, a great one
of ‘the lost traveller’s dream under the hill,’
perhaps because all the old simple things have
been painted or written, and they will only
have meaning for us again when a new race or
a new civilisation has made us look upon all
with new eyesight.</p>

<h3>IN THE SERPENT’S MOUTH</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> is an old saying that God is a circle
whose centre is everywhere. If that is true,
the saint goes to the centre, the poet and artist
to the ring where everything comes round
again. The poet must not seek for what is
still and fixed, for that has no life for him; and
if he did, his style would become cold and
monotonous, and his sense of beauty faint and
sickly, as are both style and beauty to my imagination
in the prose and poetry of Newman,
but be content to find his pleasure in all that
is for ever passing away that it may come again,
in the beauty of woman, in the fragile flowers
of spring, in momentary heroic passion, in
whatever is most fleeting, most impassioned,
as it were, for its own perfection, most eager
to return in its glory. Yet perhaps he must
endure the impermanent a little, for these things
return, but not wholly, for no two faces are
alike, and, it may be, had we more learned
eyes, no two flowers. Is it that all things are
made by the struggle of the individual and the
world, of the unchanging and the returning,
and that the saint and the poet are over all,
and that the poet has made his home in the
Serpent’s mouth?</p>

<h3>THE BLACK AND THE WHITE
ARROWS</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Instinct</span> creates the recurring and the beautiful,
all the winding of the serpent; but reason,
the most ugly man, as Blake called it, is a
drawer of the straight line, the maker of the
arbitrary and the impermanent, for no recurring
spring will ever bring again yesterday’s clock.
Sanctity has its straight line also, darting from
the centre, and with these arrows the many-coloured
serpent, theme of all our poetry, is
maimed and hunted. He that finds the white
arrow shall have wisdom older than the Serpent,
but what of the black arrow? How much
knowledge, how heavy a quiver of the crow-feathered
ebony rods can the soul endure?</p>

<h3>HIS MISTRESS’S EYEBROWS</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> preoccupation of our Art and Literature
with knowledge, with the surface of life, with
the arbitrary, with mechanism, has arisen out
of the root. A careful, but not necessarily very
subtle man, could foretell the history of any
religion if he knew its first principle, and that
it would live long enough to fulfil itself. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
mind can never do the same thing twice over,
and having exhausted simple beauty and meaning,
it passes to the strange and hidden, and
at last must find its delight, having outrun its
harmonies in the emphatic and discordant.
When I was a boy at the art school I watched
an older student late returned from Paris, with
a wonder that had no understanding in it. He
was very amorous, and every new love was the
occasion of a new picture, and every new picture
was uglier than its forerunner. He was
excited about his mistress’s eyebrows, as was
fitting, but the interest of beauty had been
exhausted by the logical energies of Art, which
destroys where it has rummaged, and can but
discover, whether it will or no. We cannot
discover our subject-matter by deliberate intellect,
for when a subject-matter ceases to
move us we must go elsewhere, and when it
moves us, even though it be ‘that old ballad
material of Shakespeare’ or even ‘the morbid
terror of death,’ we can laugh at reason. We
must not ask is the world interested in this or
that, for nothing is in question but our own
interest, and we can understand no other. Our
place in the Hierarchy is settled for us by our
choice of a subject-matter, and all good criticism
is hieratic, delighting in setting things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
above one another, Epic and Drama above
Lyric and so on, and not merely side by side.
But it is our instinct and not our intellect that
chooses. We can deliberately refashion our
characters, but not our painting or our poetry.
If our characters also were not unconsciously
refashioned so completely by the unfolding of
the logical energies of Art, that even simple
things have in the end a new aspect in our eyes,
the Arts would not be among those things that
return for ever. The ballads that Bishop Percy
gathered returned in the <i>Ancient Mariner</i> and
the delight in the world of old Greek sculptors
sprang into a more delicate loveliness in that
archaistic head of the young athlete down the
long corridor to your left hand as you go into
the British Museum. Civilisation too, will not
that also destroy where it has loved, until it
shall bring the simple and natural things again
and a new Argo with all the gilding on her
bows sail out to find another fleece?</p>

from us, but she lets us play with the tresses

<h3>A TOWER ON THE APENNINE</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> other day I was walking towards Urbino,
where I was to spend the night, having crossed
the Apennines from San Sepolcro, and had come
to a level place on the mountain-top near the
journey’s end. My friends were in a carriage
somewhere behind, on a road which was still
ascending in great loops, and I was alone amid
a visionary fantastic impossible scenery. It
was sunset and the stormy clouds hung upon
mountain after mountain, and far off on one
great summit a cloud darker than the rest
glimmered with lightning. Away south upon
another mountain a mediæval tower, with no
building near nor any sign of life, rose into
the clouds. I saw suddenly in the mind’s eye
an old man, erect and a little gaunt, standing
in the door of the tower, while about him
broke a windy light. He was the poet who
had at last, because he had done so much for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the world’s sake, come to share in the dignity
of the saint. He had hidden nothing of himself,
but he had taken care of ‘that dignity ...
the perfection of form ... this lofty and severe
quality ... this virtue.’ And though he had
but sought it for the world’s sake, or for a
woman’s praise, it had come at last into his
body and his mind. Certainly as he stood
there he knew how from behind that laborious
mood, that pose, that genius, no flower of himself
but all himself, looked out as from behind
a mask that other Who alone of all men, the
country people say, is not a hair’s breadth more
nor less than six feet high. He has in his ears
well instructed voices and seeming solid sights
are before his eyes, and not as we say of many
a one, speaking in metaphor, but as this were
Delphi or Eleusis, and the substance and the
voice come to him among his memories which
are of women’s faces; for was it Columbanus
or another that wrote ‘There is one among the
birds that is perfect, and one perfect among
the fish’?</p>

<h3>THE THINKING OF THE BODY</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Those</span> learned men who are a terror to children
and an ignominious sight in lovers’ eyes, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
those butts of a traditional humour where there
is something of the wisdom of peasants, are
mathematicians, theologians, lawyers, men of
science of various kinds. They have followed
some abstract reverie, which stirs the brain
only and needs that only, and have therefore
stood before the looking-glass without pleasure
and never known those thoughts that shape
the lines of the body for beauty or animation,
and wake a desire for praise or for display.</p>

<p>There are two pictures of Venice side by
side in the house where I am writing this, a
Canaletto that has little but careful drawing,
and a not very emotional pleasure in clean
bright air, and a Franz Francken, where the
blue water, that in the other stirs one so little,
can make one long to plunge into the green
depth where a cloud shadow falls. Neither
painting could move us at all, if our thought
did not rush out to the edges of our flesh, and
it is so with all good art, whether the Victory
of Samothrace which reminds the soles of our
feet of swiftness, or the Odyssey that would
send us out under the salt wind, or the young
horsemen on the Parthenon, that seem happier
than our boyhood ever was, and in our boyhood’s
way. Art bids us touch and taste and
hear and see the world, and shrinks from what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Blake calls mathematic form, from every
abstract thing, from all that is of the brain
only, from all that is not a fountain jetting
from the entire hopes, memories, and sensations
of the body. Its morality is personal,
knows little of any general law, has no blame
for Little Musgrave, no care for Lord Barnard’s
house, seems lighter than a breath and yet is
hard and heavy, for if a man is not ready to
face toil and risk, and in all gaiety of heart, his
body will grow unshapely and his heart lack
the wild will that stirs desire. It approved
before all men those that talked or wrestled or
tilted under the walls of Urbino, or sat in the
wide window-seats discussing all things, with
love ever in their thought, when the wise
Duchess ordered all, and the Lady Emilia gave
the theme.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>RELIGIOUS BELIEF NECESSARY
TO SYMBOLIC ART</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> art is sensuous, but when a man puts only
his contemplative nature, and his more vague
desires into his art, the sensuous images through
which it speaks become broken, fleeting, uncertain,
or are chosen for their distance from
general experience, and all grows unsubstantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and fantastic. When imagination moves in a
dim world like the country of sleep in ‘Love’s
Nocturne’ and ‘Siren there winds her dizzy
hair and sings’ we go to it for delight indeed
but in our weariness. If we are to sojourn there
that world must grow consistent with itself,
emotion must be related to emotion by a system
of ordered images, as in the <i>Divine Comedy</i>.
It must grow to be symbolic, that is, for the
soul can only achieve a distinct separated life
where many related objects at once distinguish
and arouse its energies in their fulness. All
visionaries have entered into such a world in
trances, and all ideal art has trance for warranty.
Shelley seemed to Matthew Arnold to beat his
ineffectual wings in the void, and I only made
my pleasure in him contented pleasure by massing
in my imagination his recurring images of
towers and rivers, and caves with fountains in
them, and that one star of his, till his world
had grown solid underfoot and consistent
enough for the soul’s habitation.</p>

<p>But even then I lacked something to compensate
my imagination for geographical and
historical reality, for the testimony of our
ordinary senses, and found myself wishing for
and trying to imagine, as I had also when reading
Keats’ <i>Endymion</i>, a crowd of believers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
who could put into all those strange sights the
strength of their belief and the rare testimony
of their visions. A little crowd had been sufficient,
and I would have had Shelley a sectary
that his revelation might have found the only
sufficient evidence of religion, miracle. All
symbolic art should arise out of a real belief,
and that it cannot do so in this age proves that
this age is a road and not a resting-place for
the imaginative arts. I can only understand
others by myself, and I am certain that there
are many who are not moved as they desire to
be by that solitary light burning in the tower
of Prince Athanais, because it has not entered
into men’s prayers nor lighted any through
the sacred dark of religious contemplation.</p>

<p>Lyrical poems even when they but speak of
emotions common to all need, if not a religious
belief like the spiritual arts, a life that has
leisure for itself, and a society that is quickly
stirred that our emotion may be strengthened
by the emotion of others. All circumstance
that makes emotion at once dignified and
visible, increases the poet’s power, and I think
that is why I have always longed for some
stringed instrument and a listening audience
not drawn out of the hurried streets but from
a life where it would be natural to murmur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
over again the singer’s thought. When I heard
Yvette Guilbert the other day, who has the
lyre or as good, I was not content, for she sang
among people whose life had nothing it could
share with an exquisite art that should rise out
of life as the blade out of the spearshaft, a song
out of the mood, the fountain from its pool,
all art out of the body, laughter from a happy
company. I longed to make all things over
again, that she might sing in some great hall,
where there was no one that did not love life
and speak of it continually.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h3>THE HOLY PLACES</h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> all art was struck out of personality,
whether as in our daily business or in the adventure
of religion, there was little separation
between holy and common things, and just as
the arts themselves passed quickly from passion
to divine contemplation, from the conversation
of peasants to that of princes, the one song
remembering the drunken miller and but half
forgetting Cambynskan bold; so did a man feel
himself near sacred presences when he turned
his plough from the slope of Cruachmaa or of
Olympus. The occupations and the places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
known to Homer or to Hesiod, those pure first
artists, might, as it were, if but the fashioners’
hands had loosened, have changed before the
poem’s end to symbols and vanished, winged
and unweary, into the unchanging worlds
where religion only can discover life as well as
peace. A man of that unbroken day could
have all the subtlety of Shelley, and yet use no
image unknown among the common people,
and speak no thought that was not a deduction
from the common thought. Unless the discovery
of legendary knowledge and the returning
belief in miracle, or what we must needs
call so, can bring once more a new belief in
the sanctity of common ploughland, and new
wonders that reward no difficult ecclesiastical
routine but the common, wayward, spirited
man, we may never see again a Shelley and a
Dickens in the one body, but be broken to the
end. We have grown jealous of the body, and
we dress it in dull unshapely clothes, that we
may cherish aspiration alone. Molière being
but the master of common sense lived ever in
the common daylight, but Shakespeare could
not, and Shakespeare seems to bring us to the
very market-place, when we remember Shelley’s
dizzy and Landor’s calm disdain of usual daily
things. And at last we have Villiers de L’Isle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Adam crying in the ecstasy of a supreme culture,
of a supreme refusal, ‘as for living, our
servants will do that for us.’ One of the means
of loftiness, of marmorean stillness has been the
choice of strange and far away places, for the
scenery of art, but this choice has grown bitter
to me, and there are moments when I cannot
believe in the reality of imaginations that are
not inset with the minute life of long familiar
things and symbols and places. I have come
to think of even Shakespeare’s journeys to
Rome or to Verona as the outflowing of an
unrest, a dissatisfaction with natural interests,
an unstable equilibrium of the whole European
mind that would not have come had Constantinople
wall been built of better stone. I am
orthodox and pray for a resurrection of the
body, and am certain that a man should find
his Holy Land where he first crept upon the
floor, and that familiar woods and rivers should
fade into symbol with so gradual a change that
he never discover, no, not even in ecstasy itself,
that he is beyond space, and that time alone
keeps him from Primum Mobile, the Supernal
Eden, and the White Rose over all.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> know little of Spenser’s childhood and
nothing of his parents, except that his father
was probably an Edmund Spenser of north-east
Lancashire, a man of good blood and ‘belonging
to a house of ancient fame.’ He was born in
London in 1552, nineteen years after the death
of Ariosto, and when Tasso was about eight
years old. Full of the spirit of the Renaissance,
at once passionate and artificial, looking out
upon the world now as craftsman, now as connoisseur,
he was to found his art upon theirs
rather than upon the more humane, the more
noble, the less intellectual art of Malory and
the Minstrels. Deafened and blinded by their
influence, as so many of us were in boyhood
by that art of Hugo, that made the old simple
writers seem but as brown bread and water,
he was always to love the journey more than
its end, the landscape more than the man, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
reason more than life, and the tale less than its
telling. He entered Pembroke College, Cambridge,
in 1569, and translated allegorical
poems out of Petrarch and Du Bellay. To-day
a young man translates out of Verlaine
and Verhaeren; but at that day Ronsard and
Du Bellay were the living poets, who promised
revolutionary and unheard-of things to a poetry
moving towards elaboration and intellect, as
ours—the serpent’s tooth in his own tail again—moves
towards simplicity and instinct. At
Cambridge he met with Hobbinol of <i>The
Shepheards Calender</i>, a certain Gabriel Harvey,
son of a rope-maker at Saffron Walden, but
now a Fellow of Pembroke College, a notable
man, some five or six years his elder. It is
usual to think ill of Harvey, because of his
dislike of rhyme and his advocacy of classical
metres, and because he complained that Spenser
preferred his <i>Faerie Queene</i> to the <i>Nine Muses</i>,
and encouraged Hobgoblin ‘to run off with
the Garland of Apollo.’ But at that crossroad,
where so many crowds mingled talking of so
many lands, no one could foretell in what bed
he would sleep after nightfall. Milton was in
the end to dislike rhyme as much, and it is
certain that rhyme is one of the secondary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
causes of that disintegration of the personal
instincts which has given to modern poetry
its deep colour for colour’s sake, its overflowing
pattern, its background of decorative landscape,
and its insubordination of detail. At the opening
of a movement we are busy with first
principles, and can find out everything but the
road we are to go, everything but the weight
and measure of the impulse, that has come to
us out of life itself, for that is always in defiance
of reason, always without a justification but
by faith and works. Harvey set Spenser to the
making of verses in classical metre, and certain
lines have come down to us written in what
Spenser called ‘Iambicum trimetrum.’ His
biographers agree that they are very bad, but,
though I cannot scan them, I find in them the
charm of what seems a sincere personal emotion.
The man himself, liberated from the minute
felicities of phrase and sound, that are the
temptation and the delight of rhyme, speaks
of his Mistress some thought that came to
him not for the sake of poetry, but for love’s
sake, and the emotion instead of dissolving into
detached colours, into ‘the spangly gloom’ that
Keats saw ‘froth and boil’ when he put his
eyes into ‘the pillowy cleft,’ speaks to her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
poignant words as if out of a tear-stained love-letter:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Whether lying restlesse in heavy bedde, or else</div>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>He left College in his twenty-fourth year,
and stayed for a while in Lancashire, where he
had relations, and there fell in love with one
he has written of in <i>The Shepheards Calender</i> as
‘Rosalind, the widdowes daughter of the Glenn,’
though she was, for all her shepherding, as one
learns from a College friend, ‘a gentlewoman
of no mean house.’ She married Menalchus of
the <i>Calender</i> and Spenser lamented her for years,
in verses so full of disguise that one cannot
say if his lamentations come out of a broken
heart or are but a useful movement in the
elaborate ritual of his poetry, a well-ordered
incident in the mythology of his imagination.
To no English poet, perhaps to no European
poet before his day, had the natural expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of personal feeling been so impossible, the clear
vision of the lineaments of human character so
difficult; no other’s head and eyes had sunk so
far into the pillowy cleft. After a year of this
life he went to London, and by Harvey’s advice
and introduction entered the service of the
Earl of Leicester, staying for a while in his
house on the banks of the Thames; and it was
there in all likelihood that he met with the
Earl’s nephew, Sir Philip Sidney, still little
more than a boy, but with his head full of affairs
of state. One can imagine that it was the great
Earl or Sir Philip Sidney that gave his imagination
its moral and practical turn, and one
imagines him seeking from philosophical men,
who distrust instinct because it disturbs contemplation,
and from practical men who
distrust everything they cannot use in the
routine of immediate events, that impulse and
method of creation that can only be learned
with surety from the technical criticism of poets,
and from the excitement of some movement in
the artistic life. Marlowe and Shakespeare were
still at school, and Ben Jonson was but five years
old. Sidney was doubtless the greatest personal
influence that came into Spenser’s life, and it
was one that exalted moral zeal above every
other faculty. The great Earl impressed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
imagination very deeply also, for the lamentation
over the Earl of Leicester’s death is more
than a conventional Ode to a dead patron.
Spenser’s verses about men, nearly always indeed,
seem to express more of personal joy and
sorrow than those about women, perhaps because
he was less deliberately a poet when he
spoke of men. At the end of a long beautiful
passage he laments that unworthy men should
be in the dead Earl’s place, and compares them
to the fox—an unclean feeder—hiding in the
lair ‘the badger swept.’ The imaginer of the
festivals of Kenilworth was indeed the fit patron
for him, and alike, because of the strength and
weakness of Spenser’s art, one regrets that he
could not have lived always in that elaborate
life a master of ceremony to the world, instead
of being plunged into a life that but stirred him
to bitterness, as the way is with theoretical
minds in the tumults of events they cannot
understand. In the winter of 1579-80 he published
<i>The Shepheards Calender</i>, a book of twelve
eclogues, one for every month of the year, and
dedicated it to Sir Philip Sidney. It was full
of pastoral beauty and allegorical images of
current events, revealing too that conflict between
the æsthetic and moral interests that was
to run through well-nigh all his works, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
became immediately famous. He was rewarded
with a place as private secretary to the Lord
Lieutenant, Lord Grey de Wilton, and sent to
Ireland, where he spent nearly all the rest of
his life. After a few years there he bought
Kilcolman Castle, which had belonged to the
rebel Earl of Desmond, and the rivers and hills
about this castle came much into his poetry.
Our Irish Aubeg is ‘Mulla mine, whose waves
I taught to weep,’ and the Ballyvaughan Hills,
it has its rise among, ‘old Father Mole.’ He
never pictured the true countenance of Irish
scenery, for his mind turned constantly to the
courts of Elizabeth and to the umbrageous level
lands, where his own race was already seeding
like a great poppy:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Both heaven and heavenly graces do much more</div>
<div class="verse">(Quoth he), abound in that same land then this:</div>
<div class="verse">For there all happie peace and plenteous store</div>
<div class="verse">Conspire in one to make contented blisse.</div>
<div class="verse">No wayling there nor wretchednesse is heard,</div>
<div class="verse">No bloodie issues nor no leprosies,</div>
<div class="verse">No griesly famine, nor no raging sweard,</div>
<div class="verse">No nightly bordrags, nor no hue and cries;</div>
<div class="verse">The shepheards there abroad may safely lie</div>

<div class="verse">The learned arts do florish in great honor,</div>
<div class="verse">And Poets wits are had in peerlesse price.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Nor did he ever understand the people he
lived among or the historical events that were
changing all things about him. Lord Grey de
Wilton had been recalled almost immediately,
but it was his policy, brought over ready-made
in his ship, that Spenser advocated throughout
all his life, equally in his long prose book <i>The
State of Ireland</i> as in the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, where
Lord Grey was Artigall and the Iron man the
soldiers and executioners by whose hands he
worked. Like an hysterical patient he drew a
complicated web of inhuman logic out of the
bowels of an insufficient premise—there was
no right, no law, but that of Elizabeth, and
all that opposed her opposed themselves to
God, to civilisation, and to all inherited wisdom
and courtesy, and should be put to death. He
made two visits to England, celebrating one of
them in <i>Colin Clouts come Home againe</i>, to publish
the first three books and the second three books
of the <i>Faerie Queene</i> respectively, and to try for
some English office or pension. By the help
of Raleigh, now his neighbour at Kilcolman,
he had been promised a pension, but was kept
out of it by Lord Burleigh, who said, ‘All that
for a song!’ From that day Lord Burleigh
became that ‘rugged forehead’ of the poems,
whose censure of this or that is complained of.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
During the last three or four years of his life
in Ireland he married a fair woman of his
neighbourhood, and about her wrote many
intolerable artificial sonnets and that most beautiful
passage in the sixth book of the <i>Faerie
Queene</i>, which tells of Colin Clout piping to
the Graces and to her; and he celebrated his
marriage in the most beautiful of all his poems,
the <i>Epithalamium</i>. His genius was pictorial,
and these pictures of happiness were more
natural to it than any personal pride, or joy,
or sorrow. His new happiness was very brief,
and just as he was rising to something of
Milton’s grandeur in the fragment that has
been called <i>Mutabilitie</i>, ‘the wandering companies
that keep the woods,’ as he called the
Irish armies, drove him to his death. Ireland,
where he saw nothing but work for the Iron
man, was in the midst of the last struggle of
the old Celtic order with England, itself about
to turn bottom upward, of the passion of the
Middle Ages with the craft of the Renaissance.
Seven years after Spenser’s arrival in Ireland a
large merchant ship had carried off from Loch
Swilly, by a very crafty device common in
those days, certain persons of importance. Red
Hugh, a boy of fifteen, and the coming head
of Tirconnell, and various heads of clans had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
been enticed on board the merchant ship to
drink of a fine vintage, and there made prisoners.
All but Red Hugh were released, on finding
substitutes among the boys of their kindred,
and the captives were hurried to Dublin and
imprisoned in the Burningham Tower. After
four years of captivity and one attempt that
failed, Red Hugh and his companions escaped
into the Dublin mountains, one dying there of
cold and privation, and from that to their own
country-side. Red Hugh allied himself to
Hugh O’Neil, the most powerful of the Irish
leaders—‘Oh, deep, dissembling heart, born to
great weal or woe of thy country!’ an English
historian had cried to him—an Oxford man
too, a man of the Renaissance, and for a few
years defeated English armies and shook the
power of England. The Irish, stirred by these
events, and with it maybe some rumours of
<i>The State of Ireland</i> sticking in their stomachs,
drove Spenser out of doors and burnt his house,
one of his children, as tradition has it, dying
in the fire. He fled to England, and died some
three months later in January, 1599, as Ben
Jonson says, ‘of lack of bread.’</p>

<p>During the last four or five years of his life
he had seen, without knowing that he saw it,
the beginning of the great Elizabethan poetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
movement. In 1598 he had pictured the Nine
Muses lamenting each one over the evil state
in England, of the things that she had in charge,
but, like William Blake’s more beautiful <i>Whether
on Ida’s shady brow</i>, their lamentations should
have been a cradle-song. When he died <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>, <i>Richard III.</i>, and <i>Richard II.</i>, and
the plays of Marlowe had all been acted, and
in stately houses were sung madrigals and love
songs whose like has not been in the world
since. Italian influence had strengthened the
old French joy that had never died out among
the upper classes, and an art was being created
for the last time in England which had half its
beauty from continually suggesting a life hardly
less beautiful than itself.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>When Spenser was buried at Westminster
Abbey many poets read verses in his praise,
and threw then their verses and the pens that
had written them into his tomb. Like him
they belonged, for all the moral zeal that was
gathering like a London fog, to that indolent,
demonstrative Merry England that was about
to pass away. Men still wept when they were
moved, still dressed themselves in joyous colours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and spoke with many gestures. Thoughts and
qualities sometimes come to their perfect expression
when they are about to pass away, and
Merry England was dying in plays, and in
poems, and in strange adventurous men. If
one of those poets who threw his copy of
verses into the earth that was about to close
over his master were to come alive again, he
would find some shadow of the life he knew,
though not the art he knew, among young
men in Paris, and would think that his true
country. If he came to England he would find
nothing there but the triumph of the Puritan
and the merchant—those enemies he had feared
and hated—and he would weep perhaps, in
that womanish way of his, to think that so
much greatness had been, not as he had hoped,
the dawn, but the sunset of a people. He had
lived in the last days of what we may call the
Anglo-French nation, the old feudal nation
that had been established when the Norman
and the Angevin made French the language
of court and market. In the time of Chaucer
English poets still wrote much in French, and
even English labourers lilted French songs over
their work; and I cannot read any Elizabethan
poem or romance without feeling the pressure
of habits of emotion, and of an order of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
which were conscious, for all their Latin gaiety,
of a quarrel to the death with that new Anglo-Saxon
nation that was arising amid Puritan
sermons and Mar-Prelate pamphlets. This
nation had driven out the language of its
conquerors, and now it was to overthrow
their beautiful, haughty imagination and their
manners, full of abandon and wilfulness, and
to set in their stead earnestness and logic and
the timidity and reserve of a counting-house.
It had been coming for a long while, for it
had made the Lollards; and when Anglo-French
Chaucer was at Westminster its poet,
Langland, sang the office at St. Paul’s. Shakespeare,
with his delight in great persons, with
his indifference to the State, with his scorn of
the crowd, with his feudal passion, was of
the old nation, and Spenser, though a joyless
earnestness had cast shadows upon him, and
darkened his intellect wholly at times, was of
the old nation too. His <i>Faerie Queene</i> was
written in Merry England, but when Bunyan
wrote in prison the other great English allegory
Modern England had been born. Bunyan’s men
would do right that they might come some
day to the Delectable Mountain, and not at all
that they might live happily in a world whose
beauty was but an entanglement about their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
feet. Religion had denied the sacredness of an
earth that commerce was about to corrupt and
ravish, but when Spenser lived the earth had
still its sheltering sacredness. His religion,
where the paganism that is natural to proud
and happy people had been strengthened by
the platonism of the Renaissance, cherished the
beauty of the soul and the beauty of the body
with, as it seemed, an equal affection. He
would have had men live well, not merely that
they might win eternal happiness but that they
might live splendidly among men and be celebrated
in many songs. How could one live
well if one had not the joy of the Creator and
of the Giver of gifts? He says in his <i>Hymn to
Beauty</i> that a beautiful soul, unless for some
stubbornness in the ground, makes for itself a
beautiful body, and he even denies that beautiful
persons ever lived who had not souls as
beautiful. They may have been tempted until
they seemed evil, but that was the fault of
others. And in his <i>Hymn to Heavenly Beauty</i>
he sets a woman little known to theology, one
that he names Wisdom or Beauty, above Seraphim
and Cherubim and in the very bosom of
God, and in the <i>Faerie Queene</i> it is pagan Venus
and her lover Adonis who create the forms of
all living things and send them out into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
world, calling them back again to the gardens
of Adonis at their lives’ end to rest there, as it
seems, two thousand years between life and
life. He began in English poetry, despite a
temperament that delighted in sensuous beauty
alone with perfect delight, that worship of
Intellectual Beauty which Shelley carried to a
much greater subtlety and applied to the whole
of life.</p>

<p>The qualities, to each of whom he had
planned to give a Knight, he had borrowed
from Aristotle and partly Christianised, but
not to the forgetting of their heathen birth.
The chief of the Knights, who would have
combined in himself the qualities of all the
others, had Spenser lived to finish the <i>Faerie
Queene</i>, was King Arthur, the representative of
an ancient quality, Magnificence. Born at the
moment of change, Spenser had indeed many
Puritan thoughts. It has been recorded that
he cut his hair short and half regretted his
hymns to Love and Beauty. But he has himself
told us that the many-headed beast overthrown
and bound by Calidor, Knight of
Courtesy, was Puritanism itself. Puritanism,
its zeal and its narrowness, and the angry suspicion
that it had in common with all movements
of the ill-educated, seemed no other to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
him than a slanderer of all fine things. One
doubts, indeed, if he could have persuaded
himself that there could be any virtue at all
without courtesy, perhaps without something
of pageant and eloquence. He was, I think,
by nature altogether a man of that old Catholic
feudal nation, but, like Sidney, he wanted to
justify himself to his new masters. He wrote
of knights and ladies, wild creatures imagined
by the aristocratic poets of the twelfth century,
and perhaps chiefly by English poets who had
still the French tongue; but he fastened them
with allegorical nails to a big barn door of
common-sense, of merely practical virtue.
Allegory itself had risen into general importance
with the rise of the merchant class in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries; and it was
natural when that class was about for the first
time to shape an age in its image, that the last
epic poet of the old order should mix its art
with his own long-descended, irresponsible,
happy art.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Allegory and, to a much greater degree,
symbolism are a natural language by which
the soul when entranced, or even in ordinary
sleep, communes with God and with angels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
They can speak of things which cannot be
spoken of in any other language, but one will
always, I think, feel some sense of unreality
when they are used to describe things which can
be described as well in ordinary words. Dante
used allegory to describe visionary things, and
the first maker of <i>The Romance of the Rose</i>, for
all his lighter spirits, pretends that his adventures
came to him in a vision one May
morning; while Bunyan, by his preoccupation
with heaven and the soul, gives his simple
story a visionary strangeness and intensity:
he believes so little in the world, that he takes
us away from all ordinary standards of probability
and makes us believe even in allegory
for a while. Spenser, on the other hand, to
whom allegory was not, as I think, natural at
all, makes us feel again and again that it disappoints
and interrupts our preoccupation with
the beautiful and sensuous life he has called up
before our eyes. It interrupts us most when
he copies Langland, and writes in what he
believes to be a mood of edification, and the
least when he is not quite serious, when he
sets before us some procession like a court
pageant made to celebrate a wedding or a
crowning. One cannot think that he should
have occupied himself with moral and religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
questions at all. He should have been content
to be, as Emerson thought Shakespeare was, a
Master of the Revels to mankind. I am certain
that he never gets that visionary air which can
alone make allegory real, except when he
writes out of a feeling for glory and passion.
He had no deep moral or religious life. He
has never a line like Dante’s ‘Thy Will is our
Peace,’ or like Thomas à Kempis’s ‘The Holy
Spirit has liberated me from a multitude of
opinions,’ or even like Hamlet’s objection to
the bare bodkin. He had been made a poet
by what he had almost learnt to call his sins.
If he had not felt it necessary to justify his
art to some serious friend, or perhaps even to
‘that rugged forehead,’ he would have written
all his life long, one thinks, of the loves of
shepherdesses and shepherds, among whom
there would have been perhaps the morals
of the dovecot. One is persuaded that his
morality is official and impersonal—a system
of life which it was his duty to support—and
it is perhaps a half understanding of this that
has made so many generations believe that he
was the first poet laureate, the first salaried
moralist among the poets. His processions of
deadly sins, and his houses, where the very
cornices are arbitrary images of virtue, are an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
unconscious hypocrisy, an undelighted obedience
to the ‘rugged forehead,’ for all the while
he is thinking of nothing but lovers whose
bodies are quivering with the memory or the
hope of long embraces. When they are not
together, he will indeed embroider emblems
and images much as those great ladies of the
courts of love embroidered them in their castles;
and when these are imagined out of a thirst for
magnificence and not thought out in a mood
of edification, they are beautiful enough; but
they are always tapestries for corridors that
lead to lovers’ meetings or for the walls of
marriage chambers. He was not passionate,
for the passionate feed their flame in wanderings
and absences, when the whole being of
the beloved, every little charm of body and of
soul, is always present to the mind, filling it
with heroical subtleties of desire. He is a poet
of the delighted senses, and his song becomes
most beautiful when he writes of those islands
of Phædria and Acrasia, which angered ‘that
rugged forehead,’ as it seems, but gave to
Keats his <i>Belle Dame sans Merci</i> and his ‘perilous
seas in faery lands forlorn,’ and to William
Morris his <i>Water of the Wondrous Isles</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>The dramatists lived in a disorderly world,
reproached by many, persecuted even, but following
their imagination wherever it led them.
Their imagination, driven hither and thither
by beauty and sympathy, put on something of
the nature of eternity. Their subject was
always the soul, the whimsical, self-awakening,
self-exciting, self-appeasing soul. They celebrated
its heroical, passionate will going by its
own path to immortal and invisible things.
Spenser, on the other hand, except among those
smooth pastoral scenes and lovely effeminate
islands that have made him a great poet, tried
to be of his time, or rather of the time that
was all but at hand. Like Sidney, whose charm
it may be led many into slavery, he persuaded
himself that we enjoy Virgil because of the
virtues of Æneas, and so planned out his immense
poem that it would set before the
imagination of citizens, in whom there would
soon be no great energy, innumerable blameless
Æneases. He had learned to put the State,
which desires all the abundance for itself, in
the place of the Church, and he found it possible
to be moved by expedient emotions, merely
because they were expedient, and to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
serviceable thoughts with no self-contempt.
He loved his Queen a little because she was
the protectress of poets and an image of that
old Anglo-French nation that lay a-dying, but
a great deal because she was the image of the
State which had taken possession of his conscience.
She was over sixty years old, and ugly
and, it is thought, selfish, but in his poetry she
is ‘fair Cynthia,’ ‘a crown of lilies,’ ‘the image
of the heavens,’ ‘without mortal blemish,’ and
has ‘an angelic face,’ where ‘the red rose’ has
‘meddled with the white’; ‘Phœbus thrusts
out his golden head’ but to look upon her, and
blushes to find himself outshone. She is ‘a
fourth Grace,’ ‘a queen of love,’ ‘a sacred saint,’
and ‘above all her sex that ever yet has been.’
In the midst of his praise of his own sweetheart
he stops to remember that Elizabeth is
more beautiful, and an old man in <i>Daphnaida</i>,
although he has been brought to death’s door
by the death of a beautiful daughter, remembers
that though his daughter ‘seemed of angelic
race,’ she was yet but the primrose to the rose
beside Elizabeth. Spenser had learned to look
to the State not only as the rewarder of virtue
but as the maker of right and wrong, and had
begun to love and hate as it bid him. The
thoughts that we find for ourselves are timid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and a little secret, but those modern thoughts
that we share with large numbers are confident
and very insolent. We have little else to-day,
and when we read our newspaper and take up
its cry, above all its cry of hatred, we will not
think very carefully, for we hear the marching
feet. When Spenser wrote of Ireland he wrote
as an official, and out of thoughts and emotions
that had been organised by the State. He was
the first of many Englishmen to see nothing
but what he was desired to see. Could he have
gone there as a poet merely, he might have
found among its poets more wonderful imaginations
than even those islands of Phædria and
Acrasia. He would have found among wandering
storytellers, not indeed his own power of
rich, sustained description, for that belongs to
lettered ease, but certainly all the kingdom of
Faerie, still unfaded, of which his own poetry
was often but a troubled image. He would
have found men doing by swift strokes of the
imagination much that he was doing with painful
intellect, with that imaginative reason that
soon was to drive out imagination altogether
and for a long time. He would have met with,
at his own door, storytellers among whom the
perfection of Greek art was indeed as unknown
as his own power of detailed description, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
who, none the less, imagined or remembered
beautiful incidents and strange, pathetic out-crying
that made them of Homer’s lineage.
Flaubert says somewhere, ‘There are things in
Hugo, as in Rabelais, that I could have mended,
things badly built, but then what thrusts of
power beyond the reach of conscious art!’ Is
not all history but the coming of that conscious
art which first makes articulate and then destroys
the old wild energy? Spenser, the first
poet struck with remorse, the first poet who
gave his heart to the State, saw nothing but
disorder, where the mouths that have spoken
all the fables of the poets had not yet become
silent. All about him were shepherds and
shepherdesses still living the life that made
Theocritus and Virgil think of shepherd and
poet as the one thing; but though he dreamed
of Virgil’s shepherds he wrote a book to advise,
among many like things, the harrying of all
that followed flocks upon the hills, and of all
‘the wandering companies that keep the woods.’
His <i>View of the State of Ireland</i> commends indeed
the beauty of the hills and woods where
they did their shepherding, in that powerful and
subtle language of his which I sometimes think
more full of youthful energy than even the
language of the great playwrights. He is ‘sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
it is yet a most beautiful and sweet country as
any under heaven,’ and that all would prosper
but for those agitators, ’those wandering companies
that keep the wood,’ and he would rid
it of them by a certain expeditious way. There
should be four great garrisons. ‘And those
fowre garrisons issuing foorthe, at such convenient
times as they shall have intelligence or
espiall upon the enemye, will so drive him from
one side to another and tennis him amongst
them, that he shall finde nowhere safe to keepe
his creete, or hide himselfe, but flying from the
fire shall fall into the water, and out of one
daunger into another, that in short space his
creete, which is his moste sustenence, shall be
wasted in preying, or killed in driving, or starved
for wante of pasture in the woodes, and he himselfe
brought soe lowe, that he shall have no
harte nor abilitye to indure his wretchednesse,
the which will surely come to passe in very
short space; for one winters well following of
him will so plucke him on his knees that he
will never be able to stand up agayne.’</p>

<p>He could commend this expeditious way
from personal knowledge, and could assure the
Queen that the people of the country would
soon ’consume themselves and devoure one
another. The proofs whereof I saw sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
ensampled in these late warres of Mounster;
for notwithstanding that the same was a most
rich and plentifull countrey, full of corne and
cattell, that you would have thought they
would have bene able to stand long, yet ere
one yeare and a halfe they were brought to
such wretchednesse, as that any stonye heart
would have rued the same. Out of every
corner of the woodes and glynnes they came
creeping forth upon theyr hands, for theyr
legges could not beare them; they looked like
anatomyes of death, they spake like ghosts
crying out of their graves; they did eate of
the dead carrions, happy were they if they
could finde them, yea, and one another soone
after, insomuch as the very carcasses they spared
not to scrape out of theyr graves; and if they
found a plot of water-cresses or shamrokes,
there they flocked as to a feast for the time,
yet not able long to continue therewithall;
that in short space there were none allmost left,
and a most populous and plentifull countrey
suddaynely left voyde of man or beast; yet
sure in all that warre, there perished not many
by the sword, but all by the extremitye of
famine.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>In a few years the Four Masters were to
write the history of that time, and they were
to record the goodness or the badness of Irishman
and Englishman with entire impartiality.
They had seen friends and relatives persecuted,
but they would write of that man’s poisoning
and this man’s charities and of the fall of great
houses, and hardly with any other emotion
than a thought of the pitiableness of all life.
Friend and enemy would be for them a part
of the spectacle of the world. They remembered
indeed those Anglo-French invaders who
conquered for the sake of their own strong
hand, and when they had conquered became
a part of the life about them, singing its songs,
when they grew weary of their own Iseult and
Guinevere. But the Four Masters had not come
to understand, as I think, despite famines and
exterminations, that new invaders were among
them, who fought for an alien State, for an alien
religion. Such ideas were difficult to them, for
they belonged to the old individual, poetical
life, and spoke a language even in which it
was all but impossible to think an abstract
thought. They understood Spain, doubtless,
which persecuted in the interests of religion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
but I doubt if anybody in Ireland could have
understood as yet that the Anglo-Saxon nation
was beginning to persecute in the service of
ideas it believed to be the foundation of the
State. I doubt if anybody in Ireland saw that
with certainty, till the Great Demagogue had
come and turned the old house of the noble
into ’the house of the Poor, the lonely house,
the accursed house of Cromwell.’ He came,
another Cairbry Cat Head, with that great
rabble, who had overthrown the pageantry of
Church and Court, but who turned towards
him faces full of the sadness and docility of
their long servitude, and the old individual,
poetical life went down, as it seems, for ever.
He had studied Spenser’s book and approved
of it, as we know, finding, doubtless, his own
head there, for Spenser, a king of the old race,
carried a mirror which showed kings yet to
come though but kings of the mob. Those
Bohemian poets of the theatres were wiser,
for the States that touched them nearly were
the States where Helen and Dido had sorrowed,
and so their mirrors showed none but beautiful
heroical heads. They wandered in the places
that pale passion loves, and were happy, as one
thinks, and troubled little about those marching
and hoarse-throated thoughts that the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
has in its pay. They knew that those marchers,
with the dust of so many roads upon them,
are very robust and have great and well-paid
generals to write expedient despatches in sound
prose; and they could hear mother earth singing
among her cornfields:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">‘Weep not, my wanton! smile upon my knee;</div>
<div class="verse">When thou art old there’s grief enough for thee.’</div>
</div>
</div>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>There are moments when one can read
neither Milton nor Spenser, moments when
one recollects nothing but that their flesh had
partly been changed to stone, but there are
other moments when one recollects nothing
but those habits of emotion that made the lesser
poet especially a man of an older, more imaginative
time. One remembers that he delighted
in smooth pastoral places, because men could
be busy there or gather together there, after
their work, that he could love handiwork and
the hum of voices. One remembers that he
could still rejoice in the trees, not because they
were images of loneliness and meditation, but
because of their serviceableness. He could praise
‘the builder oake,’ ’the aspine, good for staves,’
‘the cypresse funerall,’ ’the eugh, obedient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the bender’s will,’ ’the birch for shaftes,’ ’the
sallow for the mill,’ ’the mirrhe sweete-bleeding
in the bitter wound,’ ’the fruitful olive,’ and
‘the carver holme.’ He was of a time before
undelighted labour had made the business of
men a desecration. He carries one’s memory
back to Virgil’s and Chaucer’s praise of trees,
and to the sweet-sounding song made by the
old Irish poet in their praise.</p>

<p>I got up from reading the <i>Faerie Queene</i> the
other day and wandered into another room. It
was in a friend’s house, and I came of a sudden
to the ancient poetry and to our poetry side by
side—an engraving of Claude’s ‘Mill’ hung
under an engraving of Turner’s ‘Temple of
Jupiter.’ Those dancing country people, those
cow-herds, resting after the day’s work, and
that quiet mill-race made one think of Merry
England with its glad Latin heart, of a time
when men in every land found poetry and imagination
in one another’s company and in the
day’s labour. Those stately goddesses, moving
in slow procession towards that marble architrave
among mysterious trees, belong to Shelley’s
thought, and to the religion of the wilderness—the
only religion possible to poetry to-day.
Certainly Colin Clout, the companionable shepherd,
and Calidor, the courtly man-at-arms, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
gone, and Alastor is wandering from lonely
river to river finding happiness in nothing but
in that star where Spenser too had imagined
the fountain of perfect things. This new beauty,
in losing so much, has indeed found a new loftiness,
a something of religious exaltation that the
old had not. It may be that those goddesses,
moving with a majesty like a procession of the
stars, mean something to the soul of man that
those kindly women of the old poets did not
mean, for all the fulness of their breasts and
the joyous gravity of their eyes. Has not the
wilderness been at all times a place of prophecy?</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Our poetry, though it has been a deliberate
bringing back of the Latin joy and the Latin
love of beauty, has had to put off the old marching
rhythms, that once delighted more than
expedient hearts, in separating itself from a life
where servile hands have become powerful. It
has ceased to have any burden for marching
shoulders, since it learned ecstasy from Smart
in his mad cell, and from Blake, who made
joyous little songs out of almost unintelligible
visions, and from Keats, who sang of a beauty
so wholly preoccupied with itself that its contemplation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
is a kind of lingering trance. The
poet, if he would not carry burdens that are
not his and obey the orders of servile lips, must
sit apart in contemplative indolence playing
with fragile things.</p>

<p>If one chooses at hazard a Spenserian stanza
out of Shelley and compares it with any stanza
by Spenser, one sees the change, though it
would be still more clear if one had chosen
a lyrical passage. I will take a stanza out of
<i>Laon and Cythna</i>, for that is story-telling and
runs nearer to Spenser than the meditative
<i>Adonais:</i></p>

<div class="verse">The beating of our veins one interval</div>
<div class="verse">Made still; and then I felt the blood that burned</div>
<div class="verse">Within her frame, mingle with mine, and fall</div>
<div class="verse">Around my heart like fire; and over all</div>

<div class="verse">Two disunited spirits when they leap</div>
<div class="verse">In union from this earth’s obscure and fading sleep.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The rhythm is varied and troubled, and the
lines, which are in Spenser like bars of gold
thrown ringing one upon another, are broken
capriciously. Nor is the meaning the less an
inspiration of indolent muses, for it wanders
hither and thither at the beckoning of fancy.
It is now busy with a meteor and now with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
throbbing blood that is fire, and with a mist
that is a swoon and a sleep that is life. It is
bound together by the vaguest suggestion, while
Spenser’s verse is always rushing on to some
preordained thought. ‘A popular poet’ can
still indeed write poetry of the will, just as
factory girls wear the fashion of hat or dress
the moneyed classes wore a year ago, but
‘popular poetry’ does not belong to the living
imagination of the world. Old writers gave
men four temperaments, and they gave the
sanguineous temperament to men of active life,
and it is precisely the sanguineous temperament
that is fading out of poetry and most obviously
out of what is most subtle and living in poetry—its
pulse and breath, its rhythm. Because
poetry belongs to that element in every race
which is most strong, and therefore most individual,
the poet is not stirred to imaginative
activity by a life which is surrendering its
freedom to ever new elaboration, organisation,
mechanism. He has no longer a poetical will,
and must be content to write out of those parts
of himself which are too delicate and fiery for
any deadening exercise. Every generation has
more and more loosened the rhythm, more and
more broken up and disorganised, for the sake
of subtlety or detail, those great rhythms which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
move, as it were, in masses of sound. Poetry
has become more spiritual, for the soul is of all
things the most delicately organised, but it has
lost in weight and measure and in its power of
telling long stories and of dealing with great
and complicated events. <i>Laon and Cythna</i>, though
I think it rises sometimes into loftier air than
the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, and <i>Endymion</i>, though its
shepherds and wandering divinities have a
stranger and more intense beauty than Spenser’s,
have need of too watchful and minute attention
for such lengthy poems. In William Morris,
indeed, one finds a music smooth and unexacting
like that of the old story-tellers, but not
their energetic pleasure, their rhythmical wills.
One too often misses in his <i>Earthly Paradise</i> the
minute ecstasy of modern song without finding
that old happy-go-lucky tune that had kept
the story marching.</p>

<p>Spenser’s contemporaries, writing lyrics or
plays full of lyrical moments, write a verse more
delicately organised than his and crowd more
meaning into a phrase than he, but they could
not have kept one’s attention through so long
a poem. A friend who has a fine ear told me
the other day that she had read all Spenser with
delight and yet could remember only four lines.
When she repeated them they were from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
poem by Matthew Roydon, which is bound up
with Spenser because it is a commendation of
Sir Philip Sidney:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘A sweet, attractive kind of grace,</div>
<div class="verse">A full assurance given by looks,</div>
<div class="verse">Continual comfort in a face,</div>
<div class="verse">The lineaments of Gospel books.’</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Yet if one were to put even these lines beside
a fine modern song one would notice that they
had a stronger and rougher energy, a feather-weight
more, if eye and ear were fine enough
to notice it, of the active will, of the happiness
that comes out of life itself.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>I have put into this book<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> only those passages
from Spenser that I want to remember and
carry about with me. I have not tried to select
what people call characteristic passages, for
that is, I think, the way to make a dull book.
One never really knows anybody’s taste but
one’s own, and if one likes anything sincerely
one may be certain that there are other people
made out of the same earth to like it too. I
have taken out of <i>The Shepheards Calender</i> only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
those parts which are about love or about old
age, and I have taken out of the <i>Faerie Queene</i>
passages about shepherds and lovers, and fauns
and satyrs, and a few allegorical processions. I
find that though I love symbolism, which is
often the only fitting speech for some mystery
of disembodied life, I am for the most part
bored by allegory, which is made, as Blake says,
‘by the daughters of memory,’ and coldly, with
no wizard frenzy. The processions I have
chosen are either those, like the House of
Mammon, that have enough ancient mythology,
always an implicit symbolism, or, like the Cave
of Despair, enough sheer passion to make one
forget or forgive their allegory, or else they
are, like that vision of Scudamour, so visionary,
so full of a sort of ghostly midnight animation,
that one is persuaded that they had some strange
purpose and did truly appear in just that way
to some mind worn out with war and trouble.
The vision of Scudamour is, I sometimes think,
the finest invention in Spenser. Until quite
lately I knew nothing of Spenser but the parts
I had read as a boy. I did not know that I had
read so far as that vision, but year after year
this thought would rise up before me coming
from I knew not where. I would be alone perhaps
in some old building, and I would think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
suddenly ’out of that door might come a procession
of strange people doing mysterious things
with tumult. They would walk over the stone
floor, then suddenly vanish, and everything
would become silent again.’ Once I saw what
is called, I think, a Board School continuation
class play <i>Hamlet</i>. There was no stage, but they
walked in procession into the midst of a large
room full of visitors and of their friends. While
they were walking in, that thought came to me
again from I knew not where. I was alone in a
great church watching ghostly kings and queens
setting out upon their unearthly business.</p>

<p>It was only last summer, when I read the
Fourth Book of the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, that I found
I had been imagining over and over the enchanted
persecution of Amoret.</p>

<p>I give too, in a section which I call ‘Gardens
of Delight,’ the good gardens of Adonis and
the bad gardens of Phædria and Acrasia, which
are mythological and symbolical, but not allegorical,
and show, more particularly those bad
islands, his power of describing bodily happiness
and bodily beauty at its greatest. He seemed
always to feel through the eyes, imagining
everything in pictures. Marlowe’s <i>Hero and
Leander</i> is more energetic in its sensuality,
more complicated in its intellectual energy than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
this languid story, which pictures always a
happiness that would perish if the desire to
which it offers so many roses lost its indolence
and its softness. There is no passion in the
pleasure he has set amid perilous seas, for he
would have us understand that there alone could
the war-worn and the sea-worn man find date-less
leisure and unrepining peace.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Mr. O’Leary died I could not bring
myself to go to his funeral, though I had been
once his close fellow-worker, for I shrank from
seeing about his grave so many whose Nationalism
was different from anything he had taught
or that I could share. He belonged, as did
his friend John F. Taylor, to the romantic conception
of Irish Nationality on which Lionel
Johnson and myself founded, so far as it was
founded on anything but literature, our Art
and our Irish criticism. Perhaps his spirit, if it
can care for or can see old friends now, will
accept this apology for an absence that has
troubled me. I learned much from him and
much from Taylor, who will always seem to me
the greatest orator I have heard; and that ideal
Ireland, perhaps from this out an imaginary
Ireland, in whose service I labour, will always
be in many essentials their Ireland. They were
the last to speak an understanding of life and
Nationality, built up by the generation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Grattan, which read Homer and Virgil, and
by the generation of Davis, which had been
pierced through by the idealism of Mazzini,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
and of the European revolutionists of the mid-century.</p>

<p>O’Leary had joined the Fenian movement
with no hope of success as we know, but
because he believed such a movement good for
the moral character of the people; and had
taken his long imprisonment without complaining.
Even to the very end, while often
speaking of his prison life, he would have
thought it took from his Roman courage to
describe its hardship. The worth of a man’s
acts in the moral memory, a continual height
of mind in the doing of them, seemed more to
him than their immediate result, if, indeed,
the sight of many failures had not taken away
the thought of success. A man was not to
lie, or even to give up his dignity, on any
patriotic plea, and I have heard him say, ‘I
have but one religion, the old Persian: to bend
the bow and tell the truth,’ and again, ‘There
are things a man must not do to save a nation,’
and again, ‘A man must not cry in public to
save a nation,’ and that we might not forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
justice in the passion of controversy. ‘There
was never cause so bad that it has not been
defended by good men for what seemed to
them good reasons.’ His friend had a burning
and brooding imagination that divided men
not according to their achievement but by
their degrees of sincerity, and by their mastery
over a straight and, to my thought, too obvious
logic that seemed to him essential to sincerity.
Neither man had an understanding of style or
of literature in the right sense of the word,
though both were great readers, but because
their imagination could come to rest no place
short of greatness, they hoped, John O’Leary
especially, for an Irish literature of the greatest
kind. When Lionel Johnson and Katharine
Tynan (as she was then), and I, myself, began
to reform Irish poetry, we thought to keep
unbroken the thread running up to Grattan
which John O’Leary had put into our hands,
though it might be our business to explore
new paths of the labyrinth. We sought to
make a more subtle rhythm, a more organic
form, than that of the older Irish poets who
wrote in English, but always to remember
certain ardent ideas and high attitudes of mind
which were the nation itself, to our belief,
so far as a nation can be summarised in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
intellect. If you had asked an ancient Spartan
what made Sparta Sparta, he would have
answered, The Laws of Lycurgus, and many
Englishmen look back to Bunyan and to Milton
as we did to Grattan and to Mitchell. Lionel
Johnson was able to take up into his Art one
portion of this tradition that I could not, for
he had a gift of speaking political thought in
fine verse that I have always lacked. I, on the
other hand, was more preoccupied with Ireland
(for he had other interests), and took
from Allingham and Walsh their passion for
country spiritism, and from Ferguson his
pleasure in heroic legend, and while seeing all
in the light of European literature found my
symbols of expression in Ireland. One thought
often possessed me very strongly. New from
the influence, mainly the personal influence, of
William Morris, I dreamed of enlarging Irish
hate, till we had come to hate with a passion
of patriotism what Morris and Ruskin hated.
Mitchell had already all but poured some of
that hate drawn from Carlyle, who had it of
an earlier and, as I think, cruder sort, into the
blood of Ireland, and were we not a poor nation
with ancient courage, unblackened fields, and
a barbarous gift of self-sacrifice? Ruskin and
Morris had spent themselves in vain because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
they had found no passion to harness to their
thought, but here was unwasted passion and
precedents in the popular memory for every
needed thought and action. Perhaps, too, it
would be possible to find in that new philosophy
of spiritism coming to a seeming climax in
the work of Ernest Myers, and in the investigations
of uncounted obscure persons, what
could change the country spiritism into a
reasoned belief that would put its might into
all the rest. A new belief seemed coming that
could be so simple and demonstratable and
above all so mixed into the common scenery
of the world, that it would set the whole man
on fire and liberate him from a thousand
obediences and complexities. We were to forge
in Ireland a new sword on our old traditional
anvil for that great battle that must in the end
re-establish the old, confident, joyous world.
All the while I worked with this idea, founding
societies that became quickly or slowly everything
I despise. One part of me looked on,
mischievous and mocking, and the other part
spoke words which were more and more unreal,
as the attitude of mind became more and more
strained and difficult. Madame Maud Gonne
could still draw great crowds out of the slums
by her beauty and sincerity, and speak to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of ‘Mother Ireland with the crown of stars
about her head.’ But gradually the political
movement she was associated with, finding it
hard to build up any fine lasting thing, became
content to attack little persons and little things.
All movements are held together more by
what they hate than what they love, for love
separates and individualises and quiets, but
the nobler movements, the only movements
on which literature can found itself, hate great
and lasting things. All who have any old
traditions, have something of aristocracy, but
we had opposing us from the first, though not
strongly from the first, a type of mind which
had been without influence in the generation
of Grattan, and almost without it in that of
Davis, and which has made a new nation out of
Ireland, that was once old and full of memories.</p>

<p>I remember, when I was twenty years old,
arguing, on my way home from a Young Ireland
Society, that Ireland, with its hieratic
Church, its readiness to accept leadership in
intellectual things—and John O’Leary spoke
much of this readiness<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>—its Latin hatred of
middle paths and uncompleted arguments,
could never create a democratic poet of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
type of Burns, although it had tried to do so
more than once, but that its genius would in
the long run be aristocratic and lonely. Whenever
I had known some old countryman, I had
heard stories and sayings that arose out of an
imagination that would have understood
Homer better than ‘The Cotter’s Saturday
Night’ or ‘Highland Mary,’ because it was an
ancient imagination, where the sediment had
found the time to settle, and I believed that
the makers of deliberate literature could still
take passion and theme, though but little
thought, from such as he. On some such old
and broken stem, I thought, have all the most
beautiful roses been grafted.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Him who trembles before the flame and the flood,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And the winds that blow through the starry ways;</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Let the starry winds and the flame and the flood</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Cover over and hide, for he has no part</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>With the proud, majestical, multitude.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Three</span> types of men have made all beautiful
things. Aristocracies have made beautiful
manners, because their place in the world puts
them above the fear of life, and the countrymen
have made beautiful stories and beliefs,
because they have nothing to lose and so do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
not fear, and the artists have made all the rest,
because Providence has filled them with recklessness.
All these look backward to a long
tradition, for, being without fear, they have
held to whatever pleased them. The others
being always anxious have come to possess
little that is good in itself, and are always
changing from thing to thing, for whatever
they do or have must be a means to something
else, and they have so little belief that anything
can be an end in itself, that they cannot
understand you if you say ‘All the most valuable
things are useless.’ They prefer the stalk
to the flower, and believe that painting and
poetry exist that there may be instruction, and
love that there may be children, and theatres
that busy men may rest, and holidays that busy
men may go on being busy. At all times they
fear and even hate the things that have worth
in themselves, for that worth may suddenly, as
it were a fire, consume their book of Life,
where the world is represented by cyphers and
symbols; and before all else, they fear irreverent
joy and unserviceable sorrow. It seems to them,
that those who have been freed by position, by
poverty, or by the traditions of Art, have something
terrible about them, a light that is unendurable
to eyesight. They complain much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of that commandment that we can do almost
what we will, if we do it gaily, and think that
freedom is but a trifling with the world.</p>

<p>If we would find a company of our own way
of thinking, we must go backward to turreted
walls, to courts, to high rocky places, to little
walled towns, to jesters like that jester of
Charles the Fifth who made mirth out of his
own death; to the Duke Guidobaldo in his
sickness, or Duke Frederick in his strength, to
all those who understood that life is not lived
at all, if not lived for contemplation or excitement.</p>

<p>Certainly we could not delight in that so
courtly thing, the poetry of light love, if it
were sad; for only when we are gay over a
thing, and can play with it, do we show ourselves
its master, and have minds clear enough
for strength. The raging fire and the destructive
sword are portions of eternity, too great for the
eye of man, wrote Blake, and it is only before
such things, before a love like that of Tristan
and Iseult, before noble or ennobled death,
that the free mind permits itself aught but
brief sorrow. That we may be free from all
the rest, sullen anger, solemn virtue, calculating
anxiety, gloomy suspicion, prevaricating hope,
we should be reborn in gaiety. Because there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
submission in a pure sorrow, we should sorrow
alone over what is greater than ourselves, nor
too soon admit that greatness, but all that is
less than we are should stir us to some joy, for
pure joy masters and impregnates; and so to
world end, strength shall laugh and wisdom
mourn.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> life, courtesy and self-possession, and in the
arts style, are the sensible impressions of the free
mind, for both arise out of a deliberate shaping
of all things, and from never being swept away,
whatever the emotion, into confusion or dulness.
The Japanese have numbered with heroic
things courtesy at all times whatsoever, and
though a writer, who has to withdraw so much
of his thought out of his life that he may learn
his craft, may find many his betters in daily
courtesy, he should never be without style,
which is but high breeding in words and in
argument. He is indeed the Creator of the
standards of manners in their subtlety, for he
alone can know the ancient records and be like
some mystic courtier who has stolen the keys
from the girdle of time, and can wander where
it please him amid the splendours of ancient
courts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, it may be, he is permitted the
license of cap and bell, or even the madman’s
bunch of straws, but he never forgets or leaves
at home the seal and the signature. He has
at all times the freedom of the well-bred, and
being bred to the tact of words can take what
theme he pleases, unlike the bourgeoisie, who
are rightly compelled to be very strict in their
conversation. Who should be free if he were
not? for none other has a continual deliberate
self-delighting happiness—style, ’the only
thing that is immortal in literature,’ as Sainte-Beuve
has said, a still unexpended energy, after
all that the argument or the story need, a still
unbroken pleasure after the immediate end has
been accomplished—and builds this up into a
most personal and wilful fire, transfiguring
words and sounds and events. It is the playing
of strength when the day’s work is done, a
secret between a craftsman and his craft, and
is so inseparate in his nature, that he has it
most of all amid overwhelming emotion, and
in the face of death. Shakespeare’s persons
when the last darkness has gathered about them,
speak out of an ecstasy that is one half the self-surrender
of sorrow, and one half the last playing
and mockery of the victorious sword, before
the defeated world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>It is in the arrangement of events as in the
words, and in that touch of extravagance, of
irony, of surprise, which is set there after the
desire of logic has been satisfied and all that is
merely necessary established, and that leaves
one, not in the circling necessity, but caught
up into the freedom of self-delight; as it were,
the foam upon the cup, the long pheasant’s
feather on the horse’s head, the spread peacock
over the pasty. If it be very conscious,
very deliberate, as it may be in comedy, for
comedy is more personal than tragedy, we call
it phantasy, perhaps even mischievous phantasy,
recognising how disturbing it is to all that
drag a ball at the ankle. This joy, because it
must be always making and mastering, remains
in the hands and in the tongue of the artist,
but with his eyes he enters upon a submissive,
sorrowful contemplation of the great irremediable
things, and he is known from other men
by making all he handles like himself, and yet
by the unlikeness to himself of all that comes
before him in a pure contemplation. It may
have been his enemy or his love or his cause
that set him dreaming, and certainly the phœnix
can but open her young wings in a flaming
nest; but all hate and hope vanishes in the
dream, and if his mistress brag of the song or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
his enemy fear it, it is not that either has its
praise or blame, but that the twigs of the holy
nest are not easily set afire. The verses may
make his mistress famous as Helen or give a
victory to his cause, not because he has been
either’s servant, but because men delight to
honour and to remember all that have served
contemplation. It had been easier to fight,
to die even, for Charles’s house with Marvel’s
poem in the memory, but there is no zeal of
service that had not been an impurity in the
pure soil where the marvel grew. Timon of
Athens contemplates his own end, and orders
his tomb by the beachy margent of the flood,
and Cleopatra sets the asp to her bosom, and
their words move us because their sorrow is
not their own at tomb or asp, but for all men’s
fate. That shaping joy has kept the sorrow
pure, as it had kept it were the emotion love
or hate, for the nobleness of the Arts is in the
mingling of contraries, the extremity of sorrow,
the extremity of joy, perfection of personality,
the perfection of its surrender, overflowing
turbulent energy, and marmorean stillness; and
its red rose opens at the meeting of the two
beams of the cross, and at the trysting-place of
mortal and immortal, time and eternity. No
new man has ever plucked that rose, or found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
that trysting-place, for he could but come to
the understanding of himself, to the mastery
of unlocking words after long frequenting of
the great Masters, hardly without ancestral
memory of the like. Even knowledge is not
enough, for the ’recklessness’ or negligence
which Castiglione thought necessary in good
manners is necessary in this likewise, and if a
man has it not he will be gloomy, and had
better to his marketing again.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> I saw John O’Leary first, every young
Catholic man who had intellectual ambition
fed his imagination with the poetry of Young
Ireland; and the verses of even the least known
of its poets were expounded with a devout
ardour at Young Ireland Societies and the like,
and their birthdays celebrated. The School
of writers I belonged to, tried to found itself
on much of the subject-matter of this poetry,
and, what was almost more in our thoughts, to
begin a more imaginative tradition in Irish
literature, by a criticism at once remorseless
and enthusiastic. It was our criticism, I think,
that set Clarence Mangan at the head of the
Young Ireland poets in the place of Davis, and
put Sir Samuel Ferguson, who had died with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
but little fame as a poet, next in the succession.
Our attacks, mine especially, on verse which
owed its position to its moral or political worth,
roused a resentment which even I find it hard
to imagine to-day, and our verse was attacked
in return, and not for anything peculiar to ourselves,
but for all that it had in common with
the accepted poetry of the world, and most of
all for its lack of rhetoric, its refusal to preach a
doctrine or to consider the seeming necessities of
a cause. Now, after so many years, I can see how
natural, how poetical even, an opposition was,
that shows what large numbers could not call
up certain high feelings without accustomed
verses, or believe we had not wronged the feeling
when we did but attack the verses. I have just
read in a newspaper that Sir Charles Gavan
Duffy recited before his death his favourite
poem, one of the worst of the patriotic poems
of Young Ireland, and it has brought all this
to mind, for the opposition to our School
claimed him as its leader. When I was at
Siena, I noticed that the Byzantine style persisted
in faces of Madonnas for several generations
after it had given way to a more natural
style, in the less loved faces of saints and
martyrs. Passion had grown accustomed to
those sloping and narrow eyes, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
almost Japanese, and to those gaunt cheeks,
and would have thought it sacrilege to change.
We would not, it is likely, have found listeners
if John O’Leary, the irreproachable patriot, had
not supported us. It was as clear to him that
a writer must not write badly, or ignore the
examples of the great masters in the fancied or
real service of a cause, as it was that he must
not lie for it or grow hysterical. I believed in
those days that a new intellectual life would
begin, like that of Young Ireland, but more
profound and personal, and that could we but
get a few plain principles accepted, new poets
and writers of prose would make an immortal
music. I think I was more blind than Johnson,
though I judge this from his poems rather
than anything I remember of his talk, for he
never talked ideas, but, as was common with
his generation in Oxford, facts and immediate
impressions from life. With others this renunciation
was but a pose, a superficial reaction
from the disordered abundance of the middle
century, but with him it was the radical life.
He was in all a traditionalist, gathering out of
the past phrases, moods, attitudes, and disliking
ideas less for their uncertainty than because
they made the mind itself changing and restless.
He measured the Irish tradition by another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
greater than itself, and was quick to feel any
falling asunder of the two, yet at many moments
they seemed but one in his imagination. Ireland,
all through his poem of that name, speaks to
him with the voice of the great poets, and in
‘Ireland Dead’ she is still mother of perfect
heroism, but there doubt comes too.</p>

<p>I do not think either of us saw that, as belief
in the possibility of armed insurrection withered,
the old romantic nationalism would wither too,
and that the young would become less ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to find pleasure in whatever they believed to be
literature. Poetical tragedy, and indeed all the
more intense forms of literature, had lost their
hold on the general mass of men in other
countries as life grew safe, and the sense of
comedy which is the social bond in times of
peace as tragic feeling is in times of war, had
become the inspiration of popular art. I always
knew this, but I believed that the memory of
danger, and the reality of it seemed near enough
sometimes, would last long enough to give
Ireland her imaginative opportunity. I could
not foresee that a new class, which had begun
to rise into power under the shadow of Parnell,
would change the nature of the Irish movement,
which, needing no longer great sacrifices,
nor bringing any great risk to individuals,
could do without exceptional men, and those
activities of the mind that are founded on the
exceptional moment.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> John O’Leary had spent
much of his thought in an unavailing war with
the agrarian party, believing it the root of
change, but the fox that crept into the badger’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hole did not come from there. Power passed
to small shop-keepers, to clerks, to that very
class who had seemed to John O’Leary so ready
to bend to the power of others, to men who
had risen above the traditions of the countryman,
without learning those of cultivated life
or even educating themselves, and who because
of their poverty, their ignorance, their superstitious
piety, are much subject to all kinds of
fear. Immediate victory, immediate utility,
became everything, and the conviction, which
is in all who have run great risks for a cause’s
sake, in the O’Learys and Mazzinis as in all
rich natures, that life is greater than the cause,
withered, and we artists, who are the servants
not of any cause but of mere naked life, and
above all of that life in its nobler forms, where
joy and sorrow are one, Artificers of the Great
Moment, became as elsewhere in Europe
protesting individual voices. Ireland’s great
moment had passed, and she had filled no
roomy vessels with strong sweet wine, where
we have filled our porcelain jars against the
coming winter.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Irish Celt is sociable, as may be known
from his proverb, ‘It is better to be quarreling
than to be lonely,’ and the Irish poets of the
nineteenth century have made songs abundantly
when friends and rebels have been at hand
to applaud. The Irish poets of the eighteenth
century found both at a Limerick hostelry,
above whose door was written a rhyming welcome
in Gaelic to all passing poets, whether
their pockets were full or empty. Its owner,
himself a famous poet, entertained his fellows
as long as his money lasted, and then took to
minding the hens and chickens of an old peasant
woman for a living, and ended his days in rags,
but not, one imagines, without content. Among
his friends and guests had been Red O’Sullivan,
Gaelic O’Sullivan, blind O’Heffernan, and
many another, and their songs had made the
people, crushed by the disasters of the Boyne and
Aughrim, remember their ancient greatness.</p>

<p>The bardic order, with its perfect artifice
and imperfect art, had gone down in the wars
of the seventeenth century, and poetry had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
found shelter amid the turf smoke of the cabins.
The powers that history commemorates are but
the coarse effects of influences delicate and vague
as the beginning of twilight, and these influences
were to be woven like a web about the hearts of
men by farm-labourers, pedlars, potato-diggers,
hedge-schoolmasters, and grinders at the quern,
poor wastrels who put the troubles of their
native land, or their own happy or unhappy
loves, into songs of an extreme beauty. But
in the midst of this beauty was a flitting incoherence,
a fitful dying out of the sense, as
though the passion had become too great for
words, as must needs be when life is the master
and not the slave of the singer.</p>

<p>English-speaking Ireland had meanwhile no
poetic voice, for Goldsmith had chosen to celebrate
English scenery and manners; and Swift
was but an Irishman by what Mr. Balfour has
called the visitation of God, and much against
his will; and Congreve by education and early
association; while Parnell, Denham, and Roscommon
were poets but to their own time.
Nor did the coming with the new century of
the fame of Moore set the balance even, for
his Irish melodies are too often artificial and
mechanical in their style when separated from
the music that gave them wings. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
he had of high poetry is in <i>The Light of Other
Days</i> and in <i>At the Mid Hour of Night</i>, which
express what Matthew Arnold has taught us
to call ’the Celtic melancholy,’ with so much
of delicate beauty in the meaning and in the
wavering or steady rhythm that one knows
not where to find their like in literature. His
more artificial and mechanical verse, because
of the ancient music that makes it seem natural
and vivid, and because it has remembered so
many beloved names and events and places,
has had the influence which might have belonged
to these exquisite verses had he written
none but these.</p>

<p>An honest style did not come into English-speaking
Ireland until Callanan wrote three or
four naive translations from the Gaelic. <i>Shule
Aroon</i> and <i>Kathleen O’More</i> had indeed been
written for a good while, but had no more
influence than Moore’s best verses. Now, however,
the lead of Callanan was followed by a
number of translators, and they in turn by
the poets of Young Ireland, who mingled a
little learned from the Gaelic ballad-writers
with a great deal learned from Scott, Macaulay,
and Campbell, and turned poetry once again
into a principal means for spreading ideas of
nationality and patriotism. They were full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
earnestness, but never understand that, though
a poet may govern his life by his enthusiasms,
he must, when he sits down at his desk, but use
them as the potter the clay. Their thoughts
were a little insincere, because they lived in the
half-illusions of their admirable ideals; and their
rhythms not seldom mechanical, because their
purpose was served when they had satisfied the
dull ears of the common man. They had no time
to listen to the voice of the insatiable artist, who
stands erect, or lies asleep waiting until a breath
arouses him, in the art of every craftsman.
Life was their master, as it had been the master
of the poets who gathered in the Limerick
hostelry, though it conquered them not by
unreasoned love for a woman, or for native
land, but by reasoned enthusiasm, and practical
energy. No man was more sincere, no man had
a less mechanical mind than Thomas Davis,
and yet he is often a little insincere and mechanical
in his verse. When he sat down to
write he had so great a desire to make the
peasantry courageous and powerful that he half
believed them already ’the finest peasantry upon
the earth,’ and wrote not a few such verses as—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Lead him to fight for native land,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">His is no courage cold and wary;</span></div>
<div class="verse">The troops live not that could withstand</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The headlong charge of Tipperary’—</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>and to-day we are paying the reckoning with
much bombast. His little book has many things
of this kind, and yet we honour it for its public
spirit, and recognize its powerful influence with
gratitude. He was in the main an orator influencing
men’s acts, and not a poet shaping
their emotions, and the bulk of his influence
has been good. He was, indeed, a poet of
much tenderness in the simple love-songs <i>The
Marriage</i>, <i>A Plea for Love</i>, and <i>Mary Bhan
Astór</i>, and, but for his ideal of a fisherman
defying a foreign soldiery, would have been as
good in <i>The Boatman of Kinsale;</i> and once or
twice when he touched upon some historic
sorrow he forgot his hopes for the future and
his lessons for the present, and made moving
verse.</p>

<p>His contemporary, Clarence Mangan, kept
out of public life and its half-illusions by a
passion for books, and for drink and opium,
made an imaginative and powerful style. He
translated from the German, and imitated
Oriental poetry, but little that he did on any
but Irish subjects has a lasting interest. He is
usually classed with the Young Ireland poets,
because he contributed to their periodicals and
shared their political views; but his style was
formed before their movement began, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
found it the more easy for this reason, perhaps,
to give sincere expression to the mood which
he had chosen, the only sincerity literature
knows of; and with happiness and cultivation
might have displaced Moore. But as it was,
whenever he had no fine ancient song to inspire
him, he fell into rhetoric which was only lifted
out of commonplace by an arid intensity. In
his <i>Irish National Hymn</i>, <i>Soul and Country</i>, and
the like, we look into a mind full of parched
sands where the sweet dews have never fallen.
A miserable man may think well and express
himself with great vehemence, but he cannot
make beautiful things, for Aphrodite never rises
from any but a tide of joy. Mangan knew nothing
of the happiness of the outer man, and it
was only when prolonging the tragic exultation
of some dead bard that he knew the unearthly
happiness which clouds the outer man with
sorrow, and is the fountain of impassioned art.
Like those who had gone before him, he was
the slave of life, for he had nothing of the self-knowledge,
the power of selection, the harmony
of mind, which enables the poet to be its
master, and to mould the world to a trumpet
for his lips. But O’Hussey’s Ode over his
outcast chief must live for generations because
of the passion that moves through its powerful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
images and its mournful, wayward, and fierce
rhythms.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘Though he were even a wolf ranging the round green woods,</div>
<div class="verse">Though he were even a pleasant salmon in the unchainable sea,</div>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">This sharp, sore sleet, these howling floods.’</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Edward Walsh, a village schoolmaster, who
hovered, like Mangan, on the edge of the Young
Ireland movement, did many beautiful translations
from the Gaelic; and Michael Doheny,
while out ’on his keeping’ in the mountains
after the collapse at Ballingarry, made one of
the most moving of ballads; but in the main the
poets who gathered about Thomas Davis, and
whose work has come down to us in <i>The Spirit
of the Nation</i>, were of practical and political, not
of literary, importance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Samuel Ferguson, William Allingham,
and Aubrey de Vere were working
apart from politics; Ferguson selecting his
subjects from the traditions of the bardic age,
and Allingham from those of his native Ballyshannon,
and Aubrey de Vere wavering between
English, Irish, and Catholic tradition. They
were wiser than Young Ireland in the choice
of their models, for, while drawing not less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
from purely Irish sources, they turned to the
great poets of the world, Aubrey de Vere owing
something of his gravity to Wordsworth, Ferguson
much of his simplicity to Homer, while
Allingham had trained an ear, too delicate to
catch the tune of but a single master, upon the
lyric poetry of many lands. Allingham was
the best artist, but Ferguson had the more
ample imagination, the more epic aim. He
had not the subtlety of feeling, the variety of
cadence of a great lyric poet, but he has touched,
here and there, an epic vastness and <i>naïveté</i>,
as in the description in <i>Congal</i> of the mire-stiffened
mantle of the giant spectre Mananan
mac Lir striking against his calves with as
loud a noise as the mainsail of a ship ’when
with the coil of all its ropes it beat the sounding
mast.’ He is frequently dull, for he often lacked
the ’minutely appropriate words’ necessary to
embody those fine changes of feeling which
enthral the attention; but his sense of weight
and size, of action and tumult, has set him
apart and solitary, an epic figure in a lyric age.</p>

<p>Allingham, whose pleasant destiny has made
him the poet of his native town, and put <i>The
Winding Banks of Erne</i> into the mouths of the
ballad-singers of Ballyshannon, is, on the other
hand, a master of ’minutely appropriate words,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and can wring from the luxurious sadness of
the lover, from the austere sadness of old age,
the last golden drop of beauty; but amid action
and tumult he can but fold his hands. He is
the poet of the melancholy peasantry of the
West, and, as years go on, and voluminous
histories and copious romances drop under the
horizon, will take his place among those minor
immortals who have put their souls into little
songs to humble the proud.</p>

<p>The poetry of Aubrey de Vere has less
architecture than the poetry of Ferguson and
Allingham, and more meditation. Indeed, his
few but ever memorable successes are enchanted
islands in gray seas of stately impersonal reverie
and description, which drift by and leave no
definite recollection. One needs, perhaps, to
perfectly enjoy him, a Dominican habit, a
cloister, and a breviary.</p>

<p>These three poets published much of their
best work before and during the Fenian movement,
which, like Young Ireland, had its poets,
though but a small number. Charles Kickham,
one of the ’triumvirate’ that controlled it in
Ireland; John Casey, a clerk in a flour-mill; and
Ellen O’Leary, the sister of Mr. John O’Leary,
were at times very excellent. Their verse lacks,
curiously enough, the oratorical vehemence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Young Ireland, and is plaintive and idyllic. The
agrarian movement that followed produced but
little poetry, and of that little all is forgotten
but a vehement poem by Fanny Parnell and a
couple of songs by T. D. Sullivan, who is a
good song-writer, though not, as the writer
has read on an election placard, ’one of the
greatest poets who ever moved the heart of
man.’ But while Nationalist verse has ceased
to be a portion of the propaganda of a party,
it has been written, and is being written, under
the influence of the Nationalist newspapers and
of Young Ireland societies and the like. With
an exacting conscience, and better models than
Thomas Moore and the Young Irelanders, such
beautiful enthusiasm could not fail to make
some beautiful verses. But, as things are, the
rhythms are mechanical, and the metaphors
conventional; and inspiration is too often worshipped
as a Familiar who labours while you
sleep, or forget, or do many worthy things
which are not spiritual things.</p>

<p>For the most part, the Irishman of our times
loves so deeply those arts which build up a
gallant personality, rapid writing, ready talking,
effective speaking to crowds, that he has no
thought for the arts which consume the personality
in solitude. He loves the mortal arts
which have given him a lure to take the hearts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of men, and shrinks from the immortal, which
could but divide him from his fellows. And
in this century, he who does not strive to be
a perfect craftsman achieves nothing. The
poor peasant of the eighteenth century could
make fine ballads by abandoning himself to the
joy or sorrow of the moment, as the reeds
abandon themselves to the wind which sighs
through them, because he had about him a
world where all was old enough to be steeped
in emotion. But we cannot take to ourselves,
by merely thrusting out our hands, all we need
of pomp and symbol, and if we have not the
desire of artistic perfection for an ark, the
deluge of incoherence, vulgarity, and triviality
will pass over our heads. If we had no other
symbols but the tumult of the sea, the rusted
gold of the thatch, the redness of the quicken-berry,
and had never known the rhetoric of the
platform and of the newspaper, we could do
without laborious selection and rejection; but,
even then, though we might do much that
would be delightful, that would inspire coming
times, it would not have the manner of the
greatest poetry.</p>

<p>Here and there, the Nationalist newspapers
and the Young Ireland societies have trained a
writer who, though busy with the old models,
has some imaginative energy; while the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
literary writers, the successors of Allingham
and Ferguson and De Vere, are generally more
anxious to influence and understand Irish
thought than any of their predecessors who
did not take the substance of their poetry from
politics. They are distinguished too by their
deliberate art, and by their preoccupation with
spiritual passions and memories.</p>

<p>The poetry of Lionel Johnson and Mrs.
Hinkson is Catholic and devout, but Lionel
Johnson’s is lofty and austere, and like De Vere’s
never long forgets the greatness of his Church
and the interior life whose expression it is,
while Mrs. Hinkson is happiest when she puts
emotions, that have the innocence of childhood,
into symbols and metaphors from the
green world about her. She has no reverie nor
speculation, but a devout tenderness like that
of St. Francis for weak instinctive things, old
gardeners, old fishermen, birds among the leaves,
birds tossed upon the waters. Miss Hopper
belongs to that school of writers which embodies
passions, that are not the less spiritual
because no Church has put them into prayers,
in stories and symbols from old Celtic poetry
and mythology. The poetry of ‘A.E.’, at its
best, finds its symbols and its stories in the
soul itself, and has a more disembodied ecstasy
than any poetry of our time. He is the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
poet of the school of Irish mystics, in which
there are many poets besides many who have
heard the words, ‘If ye know these things,
happy are ye if ye do them,’ and thought the
labours that bring the mystic vision more important
than the labours of any craft.</p>

<p>Mr. Herbert Trench and Mrs. Shorter and
‘Moira O’Neill’ are more interested in the
picturesqueness of the world than in religion.
Mr. Trench and Mrs. Shorter have put old
Irish stories into vigorous modern rhyme, and
have written, the one in her <i>Ceann Dubh Deelish</i>
and the other in <i>Come, let us make Love
deathless</i>, lyrics that should become a lasting
part of Irish lyric poetry. ‘Moira O’Neill’
has written pretty lyrics of Antrim life; but
one discovers that Mrs. Hinkson or Miss
Hopper, although their work is probably less
popular, comes nearer to the peasant passion,
when one compares their work and hers with
that Gaelic song translated so beautifully by
Dr. Sigerson, where a ragged man of the roads,
having lost all else, is yet thankful for ’the
great love gift of sorrow,’ or with many songs
translated by Dr. Hyde in his <i>Love Songs of
Connacht</i>, or by Lady Gregory in her <i>Poets and
Dreamers</i>.</p>

<p>Except some few Catholic and mystical
poets and Professor Dowden in one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
poems, no Irishman living in Ireland has sung
excellently of any but a theme from Irish
experience, Irish history, or Irish tradition.
Trinity College, which desires to be English,
has been the mother of many verse writers and
of few poets; and this can only be because she
has set herself against the national genius, and
taught her children to imitate alien styles and
choose out alien themes, for it is not possible
to believe that the educated Irishman alone is
prosaic and uninventive. Her few poets have
been awakened by the influence of the farm-labourers,
potato-diggers, pedlars, and hedge-schoolmasters
of the eighteenth century, and
their imitators in this, and not by a scholastic
life, which, for reasons easy for all to understand
and for many to forgive, has refused the
ideals of Ireland, while those of England are but
far-off murmurs. An enemy to all enthusiasms,
because all enthusiasms seemed her enemies,
she has taught her children to look neither to
the world about them, nor into their own souls,
where some dangerous fire might slumber.</p>

<p>To remember that in Ireland the professional
and landed classes have been through the mould
of Trinity College or of English universities,
and are ignorant of the very names of the best
Irish writers, is to know how strong a wind
blows from the ancient legends of Ireland, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
vigorous an impulse to create is in her heart
to-day. Deserted by the classes from among
whom has come the bulk of the world’s intellect,
she struggles on, gradually ridding
herself of incoherence and triviality, and slowly
building up a literature in English, which,
whether important or unimportant, grows
always more unlike others; nor does it seem
as if she would long lack a living literature in
Gaelic, for the movement for the preservation
of Gaelic, which has been so much more successful
than anybody foresaw, has already its
poets. Dr. Hyde has written Gaelic poems
which pass from mouth to mouth in the west
of Ireland. The country people have themselves
fitted them to ancient airs, and many that
can neither read nor write sing them in Donegal
and Connemara and Galway. I have, indeed,
but little doubt that Ireland, communing with
herself in Gaelic more and more, but speaking
to foreign countries in English, will lead many
that are sick with theories and with trivial
emotion to some sweet well-waters of primeval
poetry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>P.S.</i>—This essay, written in 1895, though
revised from time to time, sounds strangely
to my ears to-day. I still admire much that I
then admired, but if I rewrote it now I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
take more pleasure in the temper of our writers
and deal more sternly with their achievement.
The magnanimous integrity of their politics,
and their own gallant impetuous minds, needed
no commendation among the young Irishmen
for whom I wrote, and a very little dispraise of
their verses seemed an attack upon the nation
itself. Taylor, the orator, a man of genius and
of great learning, never forgave me what I have
said of Davis here and elsewhere, and it is easier
for me to understand his anger in this year than
thirteen years ago when the lofty thought of
men like Taylor and O’Leary was the strength of
Irish nationality. A new tradition is being built
up on Gaelic poetry and romance and on the
writings of the school I belong to, but the very
strength of the new foundations, their lack of
obvious generalization, their instinctive nature,
the impossibility of ill-educated minds shaping
the finer material, has for the moment marred
the moral temper among those who are young
enough to feel the change.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I think</span> this book is the best that has come
out of Ireland in my time. Perhaps I should
say that it is the best book that has ever come
out of Ireland; for the stories which it tells
are a chief part of Ireland’s gift to the imagination
of the world—and it tells them perfectly
for the first time. Translators from the Irish
have hitherto retold one story or the other
from some one version, and not often with any
fine understanding of English, of those changes
of rhythm, for instance, that are changes of
the sense. They have translated the best and
fullest manuscripts they knew, as accurately as
they could, and that is all we have the right
to expect from the first translators of a difficult
and old literature. But few of the stories
really begin to exist as great works of imagination
until somebody has taken the best out of
many manuscripts. Sometimes, as in Lady
Gregory’s version of <i>Deirdre</i>, a dozen manuscripts
have to give their best before the beads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
are ready for the necklace. It has been as
necessary also to leave out as to add, for
generations of copyists, who had often but
little sympathy with the stories they copied,
have mixed versions together in a clumsy
fashion, often repeating one incident several
times, and every century has ornamented what
was once a simple story with its own often
extravagant ornament. One does not perhaps
exaggerate when one says that no story has
come down to us in the form it had when the
story-teller told it in the winter evenings. Lady
Gregory has done her work of compression and
selection at once so firmly and so reverently
that I cannot believe that anybody, except now
and then for a scientific purpose, will need
another text than this, or than the version<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> of
it the Gaelic League has begun to publish in
Modern Irish. When she has added her translations
from other cycles, she will have given
Ireland its <i>Mabinogion</i>, its <i>Morte D’Arthur</i>, its
<i>Nibelungenlied</i>. She has already put a great mass
of stories, in which the ancient heart of Ireland
still lives, into a shape at once harmonious and
characteristic; and without writing more than
a very few sentences of her own to link together
incidents or thoughts taken from different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
manuscripts, without adding more indeed than
the story-teller must often have added to amend
the hesitation of a moment. Perhaps more than
all, she has discovered a fitting dialect to tell them
in. Some years ago I wrote some stories of mediæval
Irish life, and as I wrote I was sometimes
made wretched by the thought that I knew
of no kind of English that befitted them as
the language of Morris’s prose stories—that
lovely crooked language—befitted his journeys
to woods and wells beyond the world. I knew
of no language to write about Ireland in but
our too smooth, too straight, too logical modern
English; but now Lady Gregory has discovered
a speech as beautiful as that of Morris, and a
living speech into the bargain. As she lived
among her people she grew to love the beautiful
speech of those who think in Irish, and to understand
that it is as true a dialect of English as
the dialect that Burns wrote in. It is some
hundreds of years old, and age gives a language
authority. One finds in it the vocabulary of
the translators of the Bible, joined to an idiom
which makes it tender, compassionate, and
complaisant, like the Irish language itself. It
is certainly well suited to clothe a literature
which never ceased to be folk-lore even when
it was recited in the Courts of Kings.</p>

<p>Lady Gregory could with less trouble have
made a book that would have better pleased
the hasty reader. She could have plucked
away details, smoothed out characteristics till
she had left nothing but the bare stories; but
a book of that kind would never have called
up the past, or stirred the imagination of a
painter or a poet, and would be as little thought
of in a few years as if it had been a popular
novel.</p>

<p>The abundance of what may seem at first
irrelevant invention in a story like the death
of Conaire, is essential if we are to recall a
time when people were in love with a story,
and gave themselves up to imagination as if
to a lover. One may think there are too many
lyrical outbursts, or too many enigmatical
symbols here and there in some other story,
but delight will always overtake one in the
end. One comes to accept without reserve an
art that is half epical, half lyrical, like that of
the historical parts of the Bible, the art of a
time when perhaps men passed more readily
than they do now from one mood to another,
and found it harder than we do to keep to the
mood in which one tots up figures or banters
a friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The Church when it was most powerful
created an imaginative unity, for it taught
learned and unlearned to climb, as it were, to
the great moral realities through hierarchies
of Cherubim and Seraphim, through clouds of
Saints and Angels who had all their precise
duties and privileges. The story-tellers of
Ireland, perhaps of every primitive country,
created a like unity, only it was to the great
æsthetic realities that they taught people to
climb. They created for learned and unlearned
alike, a communion of heroes, a cloud of
stalwart witnesses; but because they were as
much excited as a monk over his prayers, they
did not think sufficiently about the shape of
the poem and the story. One has to get a
little weary or a little distrustful of one’s
subject, perhaps, before one can lie awake
thinking how one will make the most of it.
They were more anxious to describe energetic
characters, and to invent beautiful stories, than
to express themselves with perfect dramatic
logic or in perfectly-ordered words. They
shared their characters and their stories, their
very images, with one another, and handed
them down from generation to generation;
for nobody, even when he had added some new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
trait, or some new incident, thought of claiming
for himself what so obviously lived its own
merry or mournful life. The wood-carver
who first put a sword into St. Michael’s hand
would have as soon claimed as his own a
thought which was perhaps put into his mind
by St. Michael himself. The Irish poets had
also, it may be, what seemed a supernatural
sanction, for a chief poet had to understand
not only innumerable kinds of poetry, but how
to keep himself for nine days in a trance.
They certainly believed in the historical reality
of even their wildest imaginations. And so
soon as Christianity made their hearers desire
a chronology that would run side by side with
that of the Bible, they delighted in arranging
their Kings and Queens, the shadows of forgotten
mythologies, in long lines that ascended
to Adam and his Garden. Those who listened
to them must have felt as if the living were
like rabbits digging their burrows under walls
that had been built by Gods and Giants, or
like swallows building their nests in the stone
mouths of immense images, carved by nobody
knows who. It is no wonder that one sometimes
hears about men who saw in a vision ivy-leaves
that were greater than shields, and blackbirds
whose thighs were like the thighs of oxen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
The fruit of all those stories, unless indeed the
finest activities of the mind are but a pastime,
is the quick intelligence, the abundant imagination,
the courtly manners of the Irish country
people.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>William Morris came to Dublin when I was
a boy, and I had some talk with him about
these old stories. He had intended to lecture
upon them, but ’the ladies and gentlemen’—he
put a communistic fervour of hatred into
the phrase—knew nothing about them. He
spoke of the Irish account of the battle of
Clontarf and of the Norse account, and said,
that one saw the Norse and Irish tempers in the
two accounts. The Norseman was interested
in the way things are done, but the Irishman
turned aside, evidently well pleased to be out
of so dull a business, to describe beautiful
supernatural events. He was thinking, I
suppose, of the young man who came from
Aoibhill of the Grey Rock, giving up immortal
love and youth, that he might fight and die by
Murrough’s side. He said that the Norseman
had the dramatic temper, and the Irishman
had the lyrical. I think I should have said
with Professor Ker, epical and romantic rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
than dramatic and lyrical, but his words, which
have so great an authority, mark the distinction
very well, and not only between Irish and
Norse, but between Irish and other un-Celtic
literatures. The Irish story-teller could not
interest himself with an unbroken interest in
the way men like himself burned a house, or
won wives no more wonderful than themselves.
His mind constantly escaped out of daily
circumstance, as a bough that has been held
down by a weak hand suddenly straightens
itself out. His imagination was always running
to Tir-nan-og, to the Land of Promise, which
is as near to the country-people of to-day as
it was to Cuchulain and his companions. His
belief in its nearness, cherished in its turn the
lyrical temper, which is always athirst for an
emotion, a beauty which cannot be found in
its perfection upon earth, or only for a moment.
His imagination, which had not been able to
believe in Cuchulain’s greatness, until it had
brought the Great Queen, the red-eyebrowed
goddess, to woo him upon the battlefield, could
not be satisfied with a friendship less romantic
and lyrical than that of Cuchulain and Ferdiad,
who kissed one another after the day’s fighting,
or with a love less romantic and lyrical than
that of Baile and Aillinn, who died at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
report of one another’s deaths, and married
in Tir-nan-og. His art, too, is often at its
greatest when it is most extravagant, for he
only feels himself among solid things, among
things with fixed laws and satisfying purposes,
when he has reshaped the world according to
his heart’s desire. He understands as well as
Blake that the ruins of time build mansions in
eternity, and he never allows anything, that we
can see and handle, to remain long unchanged.
The characters must remain the same, but the
strength of Fergus may change so greatly, that
he, who a moment before was merely a strong
man among many, becomes the master of
Three Blows that would destroy an army, did
they not cut off the heads of three little hills
instead, and his sword, which a fool had been
able to steal out of its sheath, has of a sudden
the likeness of a rainbow. A wandering lyric
moon must knead and kindle perpetually that
moving world of cloaks made out of the fleeces
of Mananan; of armed men who change themselves
into sea-birds; of goddesses who become
crows; of trees that bear fruit and flower at
the same time. The great emotions of love,
terror, and friendship must alone remain untroubled
by the moon in that world, which
is still the world of the Irish country-people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
who do not open their eyes very wide at the
most miraculous change, at the most sudden
enchantment. Its events, and things, and
people are wild, and are like unbroken horses,
that are so much more beautiful than horses
that have learned to run between shafts. One
thinks of actual life, when one reads those
Norse stories, which had shadows of their decadence,
so necessary were the proportions of
actual life to their efforts, when a dying man
remembered his heroism enough to look down
at his wound and say, ‘Those broad spears
are coming into fashion’; but the Irish stories
make us understand why the Greeks called
myths the activities of the dæmons. The great
virtues, the great joys, the great privations
come in the myths, and, as it were, take mankind
between their naked arms, and without
putting off their divinity. Poets have chosen
their themes more often from stories that are
all, or half, mythological, than from history or
stories that give one the sensation of history,
understanding, as I think, that the imagination
which remembers the proportions of life is but
a long wooing, and that it has to forget them
before it becomes the torch and the marriage-bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>One finds, as one expects, in the work of men
who were not troubled about any probabilities
or necessities but those of emotion itself, an
immense variety of incident and character and
of ways of expressing emotion. Cuchulain
fights man after man during the quest of the
Brown Bull, and not one of those fights is like
another, and not one is lacking in emotion or
strangeness; and when one thinks imagination
can do no more, the story of the Two Bulls, emblematic
of all contests, suddenly lifts romance
into prophecy. The characters too have a
distinctness we do not find among the people
of the <i>Mabinogion</i>, perhaps not even among
the people of the <i>Morte D’Arthur</i>. We know
we will be long forgetting Cuchulain, whose
life is vehement and full of pleasure, as though
he always remembered that it was to be soon
over; or the dreamy Fergus who betrays the
sons of Usnach for a feast, without ceasing to
be noble; or Conal who is fierce and friendly
and trustworthy, but has not the sap of divinity
that makes Cuchulain mysterious to men, and
beloved of women. Women indeed, with their
lamentations for lovers and husbands and sons,
and for fallen rooftrees and lost wealth, give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the stories their most beautiful sentences; and,
after Cuchulain, one thinks most of certain
great queens—of angry, amorous Maeve, with
her long pale face; of Findabair, her daughter,
who dies of shame and of pity; of Deirdre,
who might be some mild modern housewife
but for her prophetic wisdom. If one does
not set Deirdre’s lamentations among the
greatest lyric poems of the world, I think one
may be certain that the wine-press of the poets
has been trodden for one in vain; and yet I
think it may be proud Emer, Cuchulain’s fitting
wife, who will linger longest in the memory.
What a pure flame burns in her always, whether
she is the newly-married wife fighting for precedence,
fierce as some beautiful bird, or the
confident housewife, who would awaken her
husband from his magic sleep with mocking
words; or the great queen who would get him
out of the tightening net of his doom, by
sending him into the Valley of the Deaf, with
Niamh, his mistress, because he will be more
obedient to her; or the woman whom sorrow
has set with Helen and Iseult and Brunnhilda,
and Deirdre, to share their immortality in the
rosary of the poets.</p>

<p>‘“And oh! my love!” she said, “we were
often in one another’s company, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
happy for us; for if the world had been
searched from the rising of the sun to sunset,
the like would never have been found in one
place, of the Black Sainglain and the Grey of
Macha, and Laeg the chariot-driver, and myself
and Cuchulain.”</p>

<p>‘And after that Emer bade Conal to make
a wide, very deep grave for Cuchulain; and
she laid herself down beside her gentle comrade,
and she put her mouth to his mouth, and she
said: “Love of my life, my friend, my sweetheart,
my one choice of the men of the earth,
many is the woman, wed or unwed, envied
me until to-day; and now I will not stay living
after you.”’</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>To us Irish these personages should be very
moving, very important, for they lived in the
places where we ride and go marketing, and
sometimes they have met one another on the
hills that cast their shadows upon our doors at
evening. If we will but tell these stories to
our children the Land will begin again to be a
Holy Land, as it was before men gave their
hearts to Greece and Rome and Judea. When
I was a child I had only to climb the hill
behind the house to see long, blue, ragged hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
flowing along the southern horizon. What
beauty was lost to me, what depth of emotion is
still perhaps lacking in me, because nobody told
me, not even the merchant captains who knew
everything, that Cruachan of the Enchantments
lay behind those long, blue, ragged hills!</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A few</span> months ago I was on the bare Hill
of Allen, ’wide Almhuin of Leinster,’ where
Finn and the Fianna are said to have had
their house, although there are no earthen
mounds there like those that mark the sites of
old houses on so many hills. A hot sun beat
down upon flowering gorse and flowerless
heather; and on every side except the east,
where there were green trees and distant hills,
one saw a level horizon and brown boglands
with a few green places and here and there the
glitter of water. One could imagine that had
it been twilight and not early afternoon, and
had there been vapours drifting and frothing
where there were now but shadows of clouds,
it would have set stirring in one, as few places
even in Ireland can, a thought that is peculiar
to Celtic romance, as I think, a thought of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
mystery coming not as with Gothic nations
out of the pressure of darkness, but out of
great spaces and windy light. The hill of
Teamhair, or Tara, as it is now called, with its
green mounds and its partly-wooded sides, and
its more gradual slope set among fat grazing
lands, with great trees in the hedgerows, had
brought before one imaginations, not of heroes
who were in their youth for hundreds of years,
or of women who came to them in the likeness
of hunted fawns, but of kings that lived brief
and politic lives, and of the five white roads
that carried their armies to the lesser kingdoms
of Ireland, or brought to the great fair that
had given Teamhair its sovereignty all that
sought justice or pleasure or had goods to
barter.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It is certain that we must not confuse these
kings, as did the mediæval chroniclers, with
those half-divine kings of Almhuin. The
chroniclers, perhaps because they loved tradition
too well to cast out utterly much that they
dreaded as Christians, and perhaps because
popular imagination had begun the mixture,
have mixed one with another ingeniously,
making Finn the head of a kind of Militia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
under Cormac MacArt, who is supposed to
have reigned at Teamhair in the second century,
and making Grania, who travels to enchanted
houses under the cloak of Aengus, god of Love,
and keeps her troubling beauty longer than did
Helen hers, Cormac’s daughter, and giving the
stories of the Fianna, although the impossible
has thrust its proud finger into them all, a
curious air of precise history. It is only when
we separate the stories from that mediæval
pedantry, as in this book, that we recognise
one of the oldest worlds that man has imagined,
an older world certainly than we find
in the stories of Cuchulain, who lived, according
to the chroniclers, about the time of the
birth of Christ. They are far better known,
and we may be certain of the antiquity of
incidents that are known in one form or another
to every Gaelic-speaking countryman in
Ireland or in the Highlands of Scotland. Sometimes
a labourer digging near to a cromlech,
or Bed of Diarmuid and Grania as it is called,
will tell one a tradition that seems older and
more barbaric than any description of their
adventures or of themselves in written text
or in story that has taken form in the mouths
of professed story-tellers. Finn and the Fianna
found welcome among the court poets later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
than did Cuchulain; and one finds memories
of Danish invasions and standing armies mixed
with the imaginations of hunters and solitary
fighters among great woods. One never hears
of Cuchulain delighting in the hunt or in
woodland things; and one imagines that the
story-teller would have thought it unworthy
in so great a man, who lived a well-ordered,
elaborate life, and had his chariot and his
chariot-driver and his barley-fed horses to
delight in. If he is in the woods before dawn
one is not told that he cannot know the leaves
of the hazel from the leaves of the oak; and
when Emer laments him no wild creature
comes into her thoughts but the cuckoo that
cries over cultivated fields. His story must
have come out of a time when the wild wood
was giving way to pasture and tillage, and
men had no longer a reason to consider every
cry of the birds or change of the night. Finn,
who was always in the woods, whose battles
were but hours amid years of hunting, delighted
in the ’cackling of ducks from the Lake of
the Three Narrows; the scolding talk of the
blackbird of Doire an Cairn; the bellowing
of the ox from the Valley of the Berries; the
whistle of the eagle from the Valley of Victories
or from the rough branches of the Ridge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the Stream; the grouse of the heather of
Cruachan; the call of the otter of Druim re
Coir.’ When sorrow comes upon the queens
of the stories, they have sympathy for the
wild birds and beasts that are like themselves:
‘Credhe wife of Cael came with the others
and went looking through the bodies for her
comely comrade, and crying as she went. And
as she was searching she saw a crane of the
meadows and her two nestlings, and the cunning
beast the fox watching the nestlings; and
when the crane covered one of the birds to
save it, he would make a rush at the other
bird, the way she had to stretch herself out
over the birds; and she would sooner have
got her own death by the fox than the nestlings
to be killed by him. And Credhe was looking
at that, and she said: “It is no wonder I to
have such love for my comely sweetheart, and
the bird in that distress about her nestlings.”’</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>One often hears of a horse that shivers with
terror, or of a dog that howls at something a
man’s eyes cannot see, and men who live
primitive lives where instinct does the work
of reason are fully conscious of many things
that we cannot perceive at all. As life becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
more orderly, more deliberate, the supernatural
world sinks farther away. Although the gods
come to Cuchulain, and although he is the son
of one of the greatest of them, their country
and his are far apart, and they come to him as
god to mortal; but Finn is their equal. He
is continually in their houses; he meets with
Bodb Dearg, and Aengus, and Mananan, now
as friend with friend, now as with an enemy
he overcomes in battle; and when he has need
of their help his messenger can say: ‘There
is not a king’s son or a prince, or a leader of
the Fianna of Ireland, without having a wife
or a mother or a foster-mother or a sweetheart
of the Tuatha de Danaan.’ When the Fianna
are broken up at last, after hundreds of years
of hunting, it is doubtful that he dies at all,
and certain that he comes again in some other
shape, and Oisin, his son, is made king over a
divine country. The birds and beasts that
cross his path in the woods have been fighting-men
or great enchanters or fair women, and in
a moment can take some beautiful or terrible
shape. We think of him and of his people
as great-bodied men with large movements,
that seem, as it were, flowing out of some
deep below the shallow stream of personal
impulse, men that have broad brows and quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
eyes full of confidence in a good luck that proves
every day afresh that they are a portion of the
strength of things. They are hardly so much
individual men as portions of universal nature,
like the clouds that shape themselves and reshape
themselves momentarily, or like a bird
between two boughs, or like the gods that
have given the apples and the nuts; and yet
this but brings them the nearer to us, for we
can remake them in our image when we will,
and the woods are the more beautiful for the
thought. Do we not always fancy hunters to
be something like this, and is not that why we
think them poetical when we meet them of a
sudden, as in these lines in <i>Pauline</i>?——</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>One must not expect in these stories the epic
lineaments, the many incidents, woven into
one great event of, let us say, the story of the
War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne, or that
of the last gathering at Muirthemne. Even
<i>Diarmuid and Grania</i>, which is a long story, has
nothing of the clear outlines of <i>Deirdre</i>, and is
indeed but a succession of detached episodes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
The men who imagined the Fianna had the
imagination of children, and as soon as they had
invented one wonder, heaped another on top of
it. Children—or, at any rate, it is so I remember
my own childhood—do not understand large
design, and they delight in little shut-in places
where they can play at houses more than in
great expanses where a country-side takes, as it
were, the impression of a thought. The wild
creatures and the green things are more to
them than to us, for they creep towards our
light by little holes and crevices. When they
imagine a country for themselves, it is always
a country where one can wander without aim,
and where one can never know from one place
what another will be like, or know from the
one day’s adventure what may meet one with
to-morrow’s sun. I have wished to become a
child again that I might find this book, that
not only tells me of such a country, but is
fuller than any other book that tells of heroic
life, of the childhood that is in all folk-lore,
dearer to me than all the books of the western
world.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Children play at being great and wonderful
people, at the ambitions they will put away
for one reason or another before they grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
into ordinary men and women. Mankind as
a whole had a like dream once; everybody
and nobody built up the dream bit by bit, and
the ancient story-tellers are there to make us
remember what mankind would have been like,
had not fear and the failing will and the laws
of nature tripped up its heels. The Fianna
and their like are themselves so full of power,
and they are set in a world so fluctuating and
dream-like, that nothing can hold them from
being all that the heart desires.</p>

<p>I have read in a fabulous book that Adam
had but to imagine a bird and it was born into
life, and that he created all things out of himself
by nothing more important than an unflagging
fancy; and heroes who can make a ship out of a
shaving have but little less of the divine prerogatives.
They have no speculative thoughts
to wander through eternity and waste heroic
blood; but how could that be otherwise? for
it is at all times the proud angels who sit
thinking upon the hill-side and not the people
of Eden. One morning we meet them hunting
a stag that is ’as joyful as the leaves of a tree in
summer-time’; and whatever they do, whether
they listen to the harp or follow an enchanter
over-sea, they do for the sake of joy, their joy
in one another, or their joy in pride and movement;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and even their battles are fought more
because of their delight in a good fighter than
because of any gain that is in victory. They
live always as if they were playing a game;
and so far as they have any deliberate purpose at
all, it is that they may become great gentlemen
and be worthy of the songs of poets. It has
been said, and I think the Japanese were the
first to say it, that the four essential virtues are
to be generous among the weak, and truthful
among one’s friends, and brave among one’s
enemies, and courteous at all times; and if
we understand by courtesy not merely the
gentleness the story-tellers have celebrated, but
a delight in courtly things, in beautiful clothing
and in beautiful verse, one understands that it
was no formal succession of trials that bound
the Fianna to one another. Only the Table
Round, that is indeed, as it seems, a rivulet
from the same well-head, is bound in a like
fellowship, and there the four heroic virtues are
troubled by the abstract virtues of the cloister.
Every now and then some noble knight builds
himself a cell upon the hill-side, or leaves kind
women and joyful knights to seek the vision
of the Grail in lonely adventures. But when
Oisin or some kingly forerunner—Bran, son of
Febal, or the like—rides or sails in an enchanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
ship to some divine country, he but looks for
a more delighted companionship, or to be in
love with faces that will never fade. No
thought of any life greater than that of love,
and the companionship of those that have
drawn their swords upon the darkness of the
world, ever troubles their delight in one another
as it troubles Iseult amid her love, or Arthur
amid his battles. It is one of the ailments of
our speculation that thought, when it is not the
planning of something, or the doing of something
or some memory of a plain circumstance
separates us from one another because it makes
us always more unlike, and because no thought
passes through another’s ear unchanged. Companionship
can only be perfect when it is founded
on things, for things are always the same under
the hand, and at last one comes to hear with
envy the voices of boys lighting a lantern to
ensnare moths, or of the maids chattering in the
kitchen about the fox that carried off a turkey
before breakfast. This book is full of fellowship
untroubled like theirs, and made noble by a
courtesy that has gone perhaps out of the world.
I do not know in literature better friends and
lovers. When one of the Fianna finds Osgar
dying the proud death of a young man, and asks
is it well with him, he is answered, ‘I am as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
would have me be.’ The very heroism of the
Fianna is indeed but their pride and joy in one
another, their good fellowship. Goll, old and
savage, and letting himself die of hunger in
a cave because he is angry and sorry, can speak
lovely words to the wife whose help he refuses.
‘It is best as it is,’ he said, ’and I never took the
advice of a woman east or west, and I never will
take it. And oh, sweet-voiced queen,’ he said,
‘what ails you to be fretting after me? And
remember now your silver and your gold, and
your silks ... and do not be crying tears after
me, queen with the white hands,’ he said, ’but
remember your constant lover Aodh, son of
the best woman of the world, that came from
Spain asking for you, and that I fought on
Corcar-an-Dearg; and go to him now,’ he
said, ’for it is bad when a woman is without
a good man.’</p>

<p>They have no asceticism, but they are more
visionary than any ascetic, and their invisible
life is but the life about them made more
perfect and more lasting, and the invisible
people are their own images in the water.
Their gods may have been much besides this,
for we know them from fragments of mythology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
picked out with trouble from a fantastic history
running backward to Adam and Eve, and many
things that may have seemed wicked to the
monks who imagined that history, may have
been altered or left out; but this they must
have been essentially, for the old stories are
confirmed by apparitions among the country-people
to-day. The Men of Dea fought against
the mis-shapen Fomor, as Finn fights against
the Cat-Heads and the Dog-Heads; and when
they are overcome at last by men, they make
themselves houses in the hearts of hills that are
like the houses of men. When they call men
to their houses and to their Country Under-Wave
they promise them all that they have
upon earth, only in greater abundance. The
god Midhir sings to Queen Etain in one of the
most beautiful of the stories: ‘The young never
grow old; the fields and the flowers are as
pleasant to be looking at as the blackbird’s
eggs; warm streams of mead and wine flow
through that country; there is no care or no
sorrow on any person; we see others, but we
ourselves are not seen.’ These gods are indeed
more wise and beautiful than men; but men,
when they are great men, are stronger than they
are, for men are, as it were, the foaming tide-line
of their sea. One remembers the Druid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
who answered, when some one asked him who
made the world, ‘The Druids made it.’ All
was indeed but one life flowing everywhere,
and taking one quality here, another there. It
sometimes seems to one as if there is a kind of
day and night of religion, and that a period
when the influences are those that shape the
world is followed by a period when the greater
power is in influences that would lure the soul
out of the world, out of the body. When Oisin
is speaking with St. Patrick of the friends and
the life he has outlived, he can but cry out
constantly against a religion that has no meaning
for him. He laments, and the country-people
have remembered his words for centuries: ‘I
will cry my fill, but not for God, but because
Finn and the Fianna are not living.’</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Old writers had an admirable symbolism
that attributed certain energies to the influence
of the sun, and certain others to the lunar influence.
To lunar influence belong all thoughts
and emotions that were created by the community,
by the common people, by nobody
knows who, and to the sun all that came from
the high disciplined or individual kingly mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
I myself imagine a marriage of the sun and
moon in the arts I take most pleasure in; and
now bride and bridegroom but exchange, as it
were, full cups of gold and silver, and now
they are one in a mystical embrace. From
the moon come the folk-songs imagined by
reapers and spinners out of the common impulse
of their labour, and made not by putting words
together, but by mixing verses and phrases,
and the folk-tales made by the capricious mixing
of incidents known to everybody in new ways,
as one deals out cards, never getting the same
hand twice over. When one hears some fine
story, one never knows whether it has not
been hazard that put the last touch of adventure.
Such poetry, as it seems to me, desires an
infinity of wonder or emotion, for where there
is no individual mind there is no measurer-out,
no marker-in of limits. The poor fisher has
no possession of the world and no responsibility
for it; and if he dreams of a love-gift better
than the brown shawl that seems too common
for poetry, why should he not dream of a glove
made from the skin of a bird, or shoes made
from the skin of a herring, or a coat made from
the glittering garment of the salmon? Was
it not Æschylus who said he but served up
fragments from the banquet of Homer?—but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Homer himself found the great banquet on an
earthen floor and under a broken roof. We
do not know who at the foundation of the
world made the banquet for the first time, or
who put the pack of cards into rough hands;
but we do know that, unless those that have
made many inventions are about to change the
nature of poetry, we may have to go where
Homer went if we are to sing a new song.
Is it because all that is under the moon thirsts
to escape out of bounds, to lose itself in some
unbounded tidal stream, that the songs of the
folk are mournful, and that the story of the
Fianna, whenever the queens lament for their
lovers, reminds us of songs that are still sung
in country-places? Their grief, even when it
is to be brief like Grania’s, goes up into the
waste places of the sky. But in supreme art
or in supreme life there is the influence of the
sun too, and the sun brings with it, as old
writers tell us, not merely discipline but joy;
for its discipline is not of the kind the multitudes
impose upon us by their weight and pressure,
but the expression of the individual soul turning
itself into a pure fire and imposing its own
pattern, its own music, upon the heaviness and
the dumbness that is in others and in itself.
When we have drunk the cold cup of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
moon’s intoxication, we thirst for something
beyond ourselves, and the mind flows outward
to a natural immensity; but if we have drunk
from the hot cup of the sun, our own fulness
awakens, we desire little, for wherever one
goes one’s heart goes too; and if any ask what
music is the sweetest, we can but answer, as
Finn answered, ‘What happens.’ And yet the
songs and stories that have come from either
influence are a part, neither less than the other,
of the pleasure that is the bride-bed of poetry.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Gaelic-speaking Ireland, because its art has
been made, not by the artist choosing his
material from wherever he has a mind to, but
by adding a little to something which it has
taken generations to invent, has always had a
popular literature. We cannot say how much
that literature has done for the vigour of the
race, for who can count the hands its praise
of kings and high-hearted queens made hot
upon the sword-hilt, or the amorous eyes it
made lustful for strength and beauty? We remember
indeed that when the farming people
and the labourers of the towns made their last
attempt to cast out England by force of arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
they named themselves after the companions
of Finn. Even when Gaelic has gone, and
the poetry with it, something of the habit of
mind remains in ways of speech and thought
and ’come-all-ye’s’ and poetical saying; nor is
it only among the poor that the old thought
has been for strength or weakness. Surely
these old stories, whether of Finn or Cuchulain,
helped to sing the old Irish and the old Norman-Irish
aristocracy to their end. They heard
their hereditary poets and story-tellers, and
they took to horse and died fighting against
Elizabeth or against Cromwell; and when an
English-speaking aristocracy had their place,
it listened to no poetry indeed, but it felt about
it in the popular mind an exacting and ancient
tribunal, and began a play that had for spectators
men and women that loved the high wasteful
virtues. I do not think that their own mixed
blood or the habit of their time need take all,
or nearly all, credit or discredit for the impulse
that made our gentlemen of the eighteenth
century fight duels over pocket-handkerchiefs,
and set out to play ball against the gates of
Jerusalem for a wager, and scatter money before
the public eye; and at last, after an epoch of
such eloquence the world has hardly seen its
like, lose their public spirit and their high heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and grow querulous and selfish as men do who
have played life out not heartily but with noise
and tumult. Had they known the people and
the game a little better, they might have created
an aristocracy in an age that has lost the understanding
of the word. When one reads of the
Fianna, or of Cuchulain, or of some great hero,
one remembers that the fine life is always a part
played finely before fine spectators. There also
one notices the hot cup and the cold cup of intoxication;
and when the fine spectators have
ended, surely the fine players grow weary, and
aristocratic life is ended. When O’Connell
covered with a dark glove the hand that had
killed a man in the duelling-field, he played
his part; and when Alexander stayed his army
marching to the conquest of the world that
he might contemplate the beauty of a plane-tree,
he played his part. When Osgar complained
as he lay dying of the keening of the
women and the old fighting-men, he too played
his part; ‘No man ever knew any heart in
me,’ he said, ’but a heart of twisted horn, and
it covered with iron; but the howling of the
dogs beside me,’ he said, ’and the keening of
the old fighting-men and the crying of the
women one after another, those are the things
that are vexing me.’ If we would create a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
great community—and what other game is so
worth the labour?—we must recreate the old
foundations of life, not as they existed in that
splendid misunderstanding of the eighteenth
century, but as they must always exist when
the finest minds and Ned the beggar and
Seaghan the fool think about the same thing,
although they may not think the same thought
about it.</p>

<p>When I asked the little boy who had shown
me the pathway up the Hill of Allen if he
knew stories of Finn and Oisin, he said he did
not, but that he had often heard his grandfather
telling them to his mother in Irish. He did
not know Irish, but he was learning it at school,
and all the little boys he knew were learning
it. In a little while he will know enough
stories of Finn and Oisin to tell them to his
children some day. It is the owners of the
land whose children might never have known
what would give them so much happiness. But
now they can read this book to those that shall
come after them, and it will make Slieve-naman,
Allen, and Benbulben, the great mountain that
showed itself before me every day through all my
childhood and was yet unpeopled, and half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
country-sides of south and west, as populous
with memories as are Dundealgan and Emain
Macha and Muirthemne; and after a while
somebody may take boy and girl to some famous
place and say, ‘This land where your fathers
lived proudly and finely should be dear and
dear and again dear’; and perhaps when many
names have grown musical to their ears, a more
imaginative love will have taught them a better
service.</p>

<p>I need say nothing about the translation and
arrangement of this book except that it is worthy
to be put beside <i>Cuchulain of Muirthemne</i>. Such
books should not be commended by written
words but by spoken words, were that possible,
for the written words commending a book,
wherein something is done supremely well,
remain, to sound in the ears of a later generation,
like the foolish sound of church bells
from the tower of a church when every pew
is full.</p>

<h2>MR. SYNGE AND HIS PLAYS</h2>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a><br /><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Six</span> years ago I was staying in a students’ hotel
in the Latin quarter, and somebody, whose
name I cannot recollect, introduced me to an
Irishman, who, even poorer than myself, had
taken a room at the top of the house. It was
J. M. Synge, and I, who thought I knew the
name of every Irishman who was working at
literature, had never heard of him. He was a
graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, too, and
Trinity College does not, as a rule, produce
artistic minds. He told me that he had been
living in France and Germany, reading French
and German Literature, and that he wished to
become a writer. He had, however, nothing
to show but one or two poems and impressionistic
essays, full of that kind of morbidity that
has its root in too much brooding over methods
of expression, and ways of looking upon life,
which come, not out of life, but out of literature,
images reflected from mirror to mirror. He
had wandered among people whose life is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
picturesque as the middle ages, playing his
fiddle to Italian sailors, and listening to stories
in Bavarian woods, but life had cast no light
into his writings. He had learned Irish years
ago, but had begun to forget it, for the only
language that interested him was that conventional
language of modern poetry which has
begun to make us all weary. I was very weary
of it for I had finished <i>The Secret Rose</i>, and felt
how it had separated my imagination from life,
sending my Red Hanrahan, who should have
trodden the same roads with myself, into some
undiscoverable country. I said ‘Give up Paris,
you will never create anything by reading
Racine, and Arthur Symons will always be a
better critic of French literature. Go to the
Arran Islands. Live there as if you were one
of the people themselves; express a life that
has never found expression.’ I had just come
from Arran, and my imagination was full of
those gray islands where men must reap with
knives because of the stones.</p>

<p>He went to Arran and became a part of its
life, living upon salt fish and eggs, talking Irish
for the most part, but listening also to the
beautiful English which has grown up in Irish-speaking
districts, and takes its vocabulary from
the time of Malory and of the translators of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Bible, but its idiom and its vivid metaphor
from Irish. When Mr. Synge began to write
in this language, Lady Gregory had already
used it finely in her translations of Dr. Hyde’s
lyrics and plays, or of old Irish literature,
but she had listened with different ears. He
made his own selection of word and phrase,
choosing what would express his own personality.
Above all, he made word and phrase
dance to a very strange rhythm, which will
always, till his plays have created their own
tradition, be difficult to actors who have not
learned it from his lips. It is essential, for it
perfectly fits the drifting emotion, the dreaminess,
the vague yet measureless desire, for which
he would create a dramatic form. It blurs
definition, clear edges, everything that comes
from the will, it turns imagination from all that
is of the present, like a gold background in a
religious picture, and it strengthens in every
emotion whatever comes to it from far off,
from brooding memory and dangerous hope.
When he brought <i>The Shadow of the Glen</i>, his
first play, to the Irish National Theatre Society,
the players were puzzled by the rhythm, but
gradually they became certain that his woman
of the glens, as melancholy as a curlew, driven
to distraction by her own sensitiveness, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
own fineness, could not speak with any other
tongue, that all his people would change their
life if the rhythm changed. Perhaps no Irish
countryman had ever that exact rhythm in his
voice, but certainly if Mr. Synge had been born
a countryman, he would have spoken like that.
It makes the people of his imagination a little
disembodied; it gives them a kind of innocence
even in their anger and their cursing. It is
part of its maker’s attitude towards the world,
for while it makes the clash of wills among
his persons indirect and dreamy, it helps him
to see the subject-matter of his art with wise,
clear-seeing, unreflecting eyes; to preserve the
innocence of good art in an age of reasons and
purposes. Whether he write of old beggars
by the roadside, lamenting over the misery and
ugliness of life, or of an old Arran woman
mourning her drowned sons, or of a young
wife married to an old husband, he has no wish
to change anything, to reform anything; all
these people pass by as before an open window,
murmuring strange, exciting words.</p>

<p>If one has not fine construction, one has not
drama, but if one has not beautiful or powerful
and individual speech, one has not literature,
or, at any rate, one has not great literature.
Rabelais, Villon, Shakespeare, William Blake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
would have known one another by their speech.
Some of them knew how to construct a story,
but all of them had abundant, resonant, beautiful,
laughing, living speech. It is only the
writers of our modern dramatic movement, our
scientific dramatists, our naturalists of the stage,
who have thought it possible to be like the
greatest, and yet to cast aside even the poor
persiflage of the comedians, and to write in
the impersonal language that has come, not out
of individual life, nor out of life at all, but out
of necessities of commerce, of parliament, of
board schools, of hurried journeys by rail.</p>

<p>If there are such things as decaying art and
decaying institutions, their decay must begin
when the element they receive into their care
from the life of every man in the world, begins
to rot. Literature decays when it no longer
makes more beautiful, or more vivid, the language
which unites it to all life; and when
one finds the criticism of the student, and the
purpose of the reformer, and the logic of the
man of science, where there should have been
the reveries of the common heart, ennobled
into some raving Lear or unabashed Don
Quixote. One must not forget that the death
of language, the substitution of phrases as nearly
impersonal as algebra for words and rhythms
varying from man to man, is but a part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
tyranny of impersonal things. I have been
reading through a bundle of German plays, and
have found everywhere a desire not to express
hopes and alarms common to every man that
ever came into the world, but politics or social
passion, a veiled or open propaganda. Now
it is duelling that has need of reproof; now it
is the ideas of an actress, returning from the
free life of the stage, that must be contrasted
with the prejudice of an old-fashioned town;
now it is the hostility of Christianity and
Paganism in our own day that is to find an
obscure symbol in a bell thrown from its tower
by spirits of the wood. I compare the work
of these dramatists with the greater plays of
their Scandinavian master, and remember that
even he, who has made so many clear-drawn
characters, has made us no abundant character,
no man of genius in whom we could believe,
and that in him also, even when it is Emperor
and Galilean that are face to face, even the
most momentous figures are subordinate to
some tendency, to some movement, to some
inanimate energy, or to some process of thought
whose very logic has changed it into mechanism—always
to something other than human life.</p>

<p>We must not measure a young talent,
whether we praise or blame, with that of men
who are among the greatest of our time, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
we may say of any talent, following out a definition,
that it takes up the tradition of great
drama as it came from the hands of the masters
who are acknowledged by all time, and turns
away from a dramatic movement, which,
though it has been served by fine talent, has
been imposed upon us by science, by artificial
life, by a passing order.</p>

<p>When the individual life no longer delights
in its own energy, when the body is not made
strong and beautiful by the activities of daily
life, when men have no delight in decorating
the body, one may be certain that one lives in
a passing order, amid the inventions of a fading
vitality. If Homer were alive to-day, he
would only resist, after a deliberate struggle,
the temptation to find his subject not in Helen’s
beauty, that every man has desired, nor in the
wisdom and endurance of Odysseus that has been
the desire of every woman that has come into the
world, but in what somebody would describe,
perhaps, as ’the inevitable contest,’ arising out
of economic causes, between the country-places
and small towns on the one hand, and, upon the
other, the great city of Troy, representing one
knows not what ’tendency to centralization.’</p>

<p>Mr. Synge has in common with the great
theatre of the world, with that of Greece and
that of India, with the creator of Falstaff, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Racine, a delight in language, a preoccupation
with individual life. He resembles them also
by a preoccupation with what is lasting and
noble, that came to him, not as I think from
books, but while he listened to old stories in
the cottages, and contrasted what they remembered
with reality. The only literature of the
Irish country-people is their songs, full often
of extravagant love, and their stories of kings
and of kings’ children. ‘I will cry my fill, but
not for God, but because Finn and the Fianna
are not living,’ says Oisin in the story. Every
writer, even every small writer, who has belonged
to the great tradition, has had his dream
of an impossibly noble life, and the greater he is,
the more does it seem to plunge him into some
beautiful or bitter reverie. Some, and of these
are all the earliest poets of the world, gave it
direct expression; others mingle it so subtly
with reality, that it is a day’s work to disentangle
it; others bring it near by showing one
whatever is most its contrary. Mr. Synge,
indeed, sets before us ugly, deformed or sinful
people, but his people, moved by no practical
ambition, are driven by a dream of that impossible
life. That we may feel how intensely
his woman of the glen dreams of days that
shall be entirely alive, she that is ’a hard
woman to please,’ must spend her days between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a sour-faced old husband, a man who goes mad
upon the hills, a craven lad and a drunken
tramp; and those two blind people of <i>The
Well of the Saints</i> are so transformed by the
dream, that they choose blindness rather than
reality. He tells us of realities, but he knows
that art has never taken more than its symbols
from anything that the eye can see or the hand
measure.</p>

<p>It is the preoccupation of his characters
with their dream that gives his plays their
drifting movement, their emotional subtlety.
In most of the dramatic writing of our time,
and this is one of the reasons why our dramatists
do not find the need for a better speech, one
finds a simple motive lifted, as it were, into the
full light of the stage. The ordinary student
of drama will not find anywhere in <i>The Well
of the Saints</i> that excitement of the will in the
presence of attainable advantages, which he is
accustomed to think the natural stuff of drama,
and if he see it played he will wonder why act
is knitted to act so loosely, why it is all, as it
were, flat, why there is so much leisure in the
dialogue, even in the midst of passion. If he
see the <i>Shadow of the Glen</i>, he will ask, why
does this woman go out of her house? Is it
because she cannot help herself, or is she content
to go? Why is it not all made clearer?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
And yet, like everybody when caught up into
great events, she does many things without
being quite certain why she does them. She
hardly understands at moments why her action
has a certain form, more clearly than why her
body is tall or short, fair or brown. She feels
an emotion that she does not understand. She
is driven by desires that need for their expression,
not ‘I admire this man,’ or ‘I must go,
whether I will or no,’ but words full of suggestion,
rhythms of voice, movements that escape
analysis. In addition to all this, she has something
that she shares with none but the children
of one man’s imagination. She is intoxicated
by a dream which is hardly understood by
herself, but possesses her like something half-remembered
on a sudden wakening.</p>

<p>While I write, we are rehearsing <i>The Well
of the Saints</i>, and are painting for it decorative
scenery, mountains in one or two flat colours
and without detail, ash trees and red salleys
with something of recurring pattern in their
woven boughs. For though the people of the
play use no phrase they could not use in daily
life, we know that we are seeking to express
what no eye has ever seen.</p>

<h2>LIONEL JOHNSON</h2>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Contemporary</span> Irish poets believe in a spiritual
life, invisible and troubling, and express this
belief in their poetry. Contemporary English
poets are interested in the glory of the world,
like Mr. Rudyard Kipling; or in the order of
the world, like Mr. William Watson; or in the
passion of the world, like Mr. John Davidson;
or in the pleasure of the world, like Mr. Arthur
Symons. Mr. Francis Thompson, who has
fallen under the shadow of Mr. Coventry Patmore,
the poet of an older time and in protest
against that time, is alone preoccupied with a
spiritual life; and even he, except at rare
moments, has less living fervour of belief than
pleasure in the gleaming and scented and
coloured symbols that are the footsteps where
the belief of others has trodden. Ireland, upon
the other hand, is creating in English a poetry
as full of spiritual ardour as the poetry that
praised in Gaelic <i>The Country of the Two Mists</i>,
and <i>The Country of the Young</i>, and <i>The Country
of the Living Heart</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>‘A.E.’ has written an ecstatic pantheistic
poetry which reveals in all things a kind of
scented flame consuming them from within.
Miss Hopper, an unequal writer, whose best
verses are delicate and distinguished, has no
clear vision of spiritual things, but makes
material things as frail and fragile as if they
were but smouldering leaves, that we stirred in
some mid-world of dreams, as ’the gossips’ in
her poem ’stir their lives’ red ashes.’ Mrs.
Hinkson, uninteresting at her worst, as only
uncritical and unspeculative writers are uninteresting,
has sometimes expressed an impassioned
and instinctive Catholicism in poems that are,
as I believe, as perfect as they are beautiful,
while Mr. Lionel Johnson has in his poetry
completed the trinity of the spiritual virtues by
adding Stoicism to Ecstasy and Asceticism.
He has renounced the world and built up a
twilight world instead, where all the colours
are like the colours in the rainbow that is cast
by the moon, and all the people as far from
modern tumults as the people upon fading and
dropping tapestries. He has so little interest
in our pains and pleasures, and is so wrapped
up in his own world, that one comes from his
books wearied and exalted, as though one had
posed for some noble action in a strange <i>tableau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
vivant</i> that cast its painful stillness upon the
mind instead of the body. He might have cried
with Axel, ‘As for living, our servants will do
that for us.’ As Axel chose to die, he has
chosen to live among his books and between
two memories—the religious tradition of the
Church of Rome and the political tradition of
Ireland. From these he gazes upon the future,
and whether he write of Sertorius or of Lucretius,
or of Parnell or of ‘Ireland’s dead,’ or of
’98, or of St. Columba or of Leo XIII., it is
always with the same cold or scornful ecstasy.
He has made a world full of altar lights and
golden vestures, and murmured Latin and incense
clouds, and autumn winds and dead leaves,
where one wanders remembering martyrdoms
and courtesies that the world has forgotten.</p>

<p>His ecstasy is the ecstasy of combat, not of
submission to the Divine will; and even when
he remembers that ‘the old Saints prevail,’ he
sees the ‘one ancient Priest’ who alone offers
the Sacrifice, and remembers the loneliness of
the Saints. Had he not this ecstasy of combat,
he would be the poet of those peaceful and unhappy
souls, who, in the symbolism of a living
Irish visionary, are compelled to inhabit when
they die a shadowy island Paradise in the West,
where the moon always shines, and a mist is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
always on the face of the moon, and a music of
many sighs is always in the air, because they
renounced the joy of the world without accepting
the joy of God.</p>

<h2>THE PATHWAY</h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a><br /><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>



<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Most</span> of us who are writing books in Ireland
to-day have some kind of a spiritual philosophy;
and some among us when we look backward
upon our lives see that the coming of a young
Brahmin into Ireland helped to give our vague
thoughts a shape. When we were schoolboys
we used to discuss whatever we could find to
read of mystical philosophy and to pass crystals
over each others’ hands and eyes and to fancy
that we could feel a breath flowing from them
as people did in a certain German book; and
one day somebody told us he had met a Brahmin
in London who knew more of these things than
any book. With a courage which I still admire,
we wrote and asked him to come and teach us,
and he came with a little bag in his hand and
<i>Marius the Epicurean</i> in his pocket, and stayed
with one of us, who gave him a plate of rice
and an apple every day at two o’clock; and
for a week and all day long he unfolded what
seemed to be all wisdom. He sat there beautiful,
as only an Eastern is beautiful, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
little gestures with his delicate hands, and to
him alone among all the talkers I have heard,
the delight of ordered words seemed nothing,
and all thought a flight into the heart of truth.</p>

<p>We brought him, on the evening of his
coming, to a certain club which still discusses
everything with that leisure which is the compensation
of unsuccessful countries; and there he
overthrew or awed into silence whatever metaphysics
the town had. And next day, when we
would have complimented him, he was remorseful
and melancholy, for was it not ‘intellectual
lust’? And sometimes he would go back over
something he had said and explain to us that
his argument had been a fallacy, and apologise
as though he had offended against good manners.
And once, when we questioned him of some
event, he told us what he seemed to remember,
but asked us not to give much weight to his
memory, for he had found that he observed
carelessly. He said, ‘We Easterns are taught to
state a principle carefully, but we are not taught
to observe and to remember and to describe a
fact. Our sense of what truthfulness is is quite
different from yours.’ His principles were a
part of his being, while our facts, though he
was too polite to say it, were doubtless a part
of that bodily life, which is, as he believed,
an error. He certainly did hold that we lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
too much to understand the truth or to live
long, for he remembered that his father, who
had been the first of his family for two thousand
years to leave his native village, had repeated
over and over upon his deathbed, ‘The West is
dying because of its restlessness.’ Once when
he had spoken of some Englishman who had
gone down the crater of Vesuvius, some listener
adventured: ‘We like men who do that
kind of thing, because a man should not think too
much of his life,’ but was answered solidly, ‘You
do not think little of your lives, but you think
so much of your lives that you would enjoy
them everywhere, even in the crater of Vesuvius.’
Somebody asked him if we should pray,
but even prayer was too full of hope, of desire,
of life, to have any part in that acquiescence
that was his beginning of wisdom, and he
answered that one should say, before sleeping:
‘I have lived many lives. I have been a slave
and a prince. Many a beloved has sat upon my
knees, and I have sat upon the knees of many
a beloved. Everything that has been shall be
again.’ Beautiful words, that I spoilt once by
turning them into clumsy verse.</p>

<p>Nearly all that we call education was to him
but a means to bring us under the despotism
of life; and I remember the bewilderment of
a schoolmaster who asked about the education<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of children and was told to ‘teach them fairy
tales, and that they did not possess even their
own bodies.’ I think he would not have taught
anybody anything that had to be written in
prose, for he said, very seriously, ‘I have
thought much about it, and I have never been
able to discover any reason why prose should
exist.’ I think he would not have trained
anybody in anything but in the arts and in
philosophy, which sweeps the pathway before
them, for he certainly thought, as William
Blake did, that the ‘imagination is the man
himself,’ and can, if it be strong enough, work
every miracle. A man had come to him in
London, and had said, ‘My wife believes that
you have the wisdom of the East and can cure
her neuralgia, from which she has suffered for
years.’ He had answered: ‘Are you certain
that she believes that? because, if you are, I can
cure her.’ He had gone to her and made a
circle round her and recited a poem in Sanscrit,
and she had never had neuralgia since. He
recited the poem to us, and was very disappointed
because we did not know by the sound
that it was a description of the spring. Not
only did he think that the imaginative arts
were the only things that were quite sinless,
but he spent more than half a day proving, by
many subtle and elaborate arguments, that ‘art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
for art’s sake’ was the only sinless doctrine, for
any other would hide the shadow of the world
as it exists in the mind of God by shadows of
the accidents and illusions of life, and was but
Sadducean blasphemy. Religion existed also for
its own sake; and every soul quivered between
two emotions, the desire to possess things, to
make them a portion of its egotism, and a delight
in just and beautiful things for their own sake—and
all religions were a doctrinal or symbolical
crying aloud of this delight. He would not
give his own belief a name for fear he might
seem to admit that there could be religion that
expressed another delight, and if one urged him
too impetuously, he would look embarrassed
and say, ‘This body is a Brahmin.’ All other
parts of religion were unimportant, for even
our desire of immortality was no better than
our other desires. Before I understood him, I
asked what he would answer to one who began
the discussion by denying the immortality of
the soul, for the accident of a discussion with
religious people had set him grafting upon this
stock, and he said, ‘I would say to him, What
has that to do with you?’</p>

<p>I remember these phrases and these little
fragments of argument quite clearly, for their
charm and their unexpectedness has made
them cling to the memory; but when I try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
remember his philosophy as a whole, I cannot
part it from what I myself have built about it,
or have gathered in the great ruined house of
‘the prophetic books’ of William Blake; but I
am certain that he taught us by what seemed
an invincible logic that those who die, in so
far as they have imagined beauty or justice, are
made a part of beauty or justice, and move
through the minds of living men, as Shelley
believed; and that mind overshadows mind even
among the living, and by pathways that lie
beyond the senses; and that he measured labour
by this measure, and put the hermit above all
other labourers, because, being the most silent
and the most hidden, he lived nearer to the
Eternal Powers, and showed their mastery of
the world. Alcibiades fled from Socrates lest he
might do nothing but listen to him all life long,
and I am certain that we, seeking as youth
will for some unknown deed and thought, all
dreamed that but to listen to this man who threw
the enchantment of power about silent and
gentle things, and at last to think as he did,
was the one thing worth doing and thinking;
and that all action and all words that lead to
action were a little vulgar, a little trivial. Ah,
how many years it has taken me to awake out
of that dream!</p>

<h3><i>NOTE.</i></h3>

<p class="unindent"><i>I began to make this bibliography a good many years ago,
putting into an old note-book a list of all the writings of
Mr. Yeats that I knew, and adding others from time to
time, as chance led me to find them in newspapers or
periodicals. I had no thought in doing this but my own
pleasure, and it is with a kind of wonder that I see my
notes taking the form of a book or part of a book at Mr.
Bullen’s beautiful Shakespeare Head Press.</i></p>

<p><i>I do not think the arrangement of the bibliography needs
any explanation. I have not found it possible always to
identify the first appearance of poems and essays, particularly
in the earlier collections; nor have I thought it
necessary to include a reference to every letter written by
Mr. Yeats to the Press, since many of these have dealt
merely with small points of fact in this or that controversy
of the moment. But otherwise I have tried to make the
work as complete as possible, and have given many details
to serve as guides to those who would study the path along
which beauty has come into the world. I have watched
the roses blossoming in the garden, though I may not know
the secret of their growth.</i></p>

<p><i>My thanks for help and suggestions are due to Mr. Yeats
himself and to Mr. A. H. Bullen, Mrs. Tynan Hinkson,
Miss A. E. F. Horniman, Mr. John Masefield and Mr.
T. W. Rolleston. The details of the American editions of
Mr. Yeats’s books have been kindly supplied by Mr. John
Quinn of New York.</i></p>

<p><i>Note.</i></p>

<p><i>A Prologue.</i> Originally appeared in <i>The United Irishman</i>,
September 9, 1903.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>[The Prologue, which was accidentally dropped
from later editions, ran thus:—</p>

<p class="center">A PROLOGUE.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hang1">

<i>An <span class="normal">Old Man</span> with a red dressing-gown, red slippers and
red night-cap, holding a brass candlestick with a guttering
candle in it, comes on from side of stage and goes in
front of the dull green curtain.</i></div>

<p><i>Old Man.</i> I’ve got to speak the prologue. [<i>He
shuffles on a few steps.</i>] My nephew, who is one of the
play actors, came to me, and I in my bed, and my
prayers said, and the candle put out, and he told me
there were so many characters in this new play, that
all the company were in it, whether they had been
long or short at the business, and that there wasn’t
one left to speak the prologue. Wait a bit, there’s
a draught here. [<i>He pulls the curtain closer together.</i>]
That’s better. And that’s why I am here, and maybe
I’m a fool for my pains.</p>

<p>And my nephew said, there are a good many plays
to be played for you, some to-night and some on
other nights through the winter, and the most of
them are simple enough, and tell out their story to
the end. But as to the big play you are to see to-night,
my nephew taught me to say what the poet had taught
him to say about it. [<i>Puts down candlestick and puts
right finger on left thumb.</i>] First, he who told the story
of Seanchan on King Guaire’s threshold long ago in
the old books told it wrongly, for he was a friend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the king, or maybe afraid of the king, and so he put
the king in the right. But he that tells the story now,
being a poet, has put the poet in the right.</p>

<p>And then [<i>touches other finger</i>] I am to say: Some
think it would be a finer tale if Seanchan had died at
the end of it, and the king had the guilt at his door,
for that might have served the poet’s cause better in
the end. But that is not true, for if he that is in the
story but a shadow and an image of poetry had not
risen up from the death that threatened him, the
ending would not have been true and joyful enough
to be put into the voices of players and proclaimed
in the mouths of trumpets, and poetry would have
been badly served.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>He takes up the candlestick again.</i></p>

<p>And as to what happened Seanchan after, my
nephew told me he didn’t know, and the poet didn’t
know, and it’s likely there’s nobody that knows. But
my nephew thinks he never sat down at the king’s
table again, after the way he had been treated, but
that he went to some quiet green place in the hills
with Fedelm, his sweetheart, where the poor people
made much of him because he was wise, and where
he made songs and poems, and it’s likely enough he
made some of the old songs and the old poems the
poor people on the hillsides are saying and singing
to-day.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>A trumpet-blast.</i></p>

<p>Well, it’s time for me to be going. That trumpet
means that the curtain is going to rise, and after a
while the stage there will be filled up with great ladies
and great gentlemen, and poets, and a king with a
crown on him, and all of them as high up in themselves
with the pride of their youth and their strength
and their fine clothes as if there was no such thing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the world as cold in the shoulders, and speckled shins,
and the pains in the bones and the stiffness in the
joints that make an old man that has the whole load
of the world on him ready for his bed.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>He begins to shuffle away, and then stops.</i><br />
</p>

<p>And it would be better for me, that nephew of
mine to be thinking less of his play-acting, and to
have remembered to boil down the knap-weed with
a bit of threepenny sugar, for me to be wetting my
throat with now and again through the night, and
drinking a sup to ease the pains in my bones.</p>

<h2>PART III.<br />
<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS TO PERIODICALS.</h2>

<div class="smaller">
<p>[This part gives a chronological list of Mr. Yeats’s contributions

amount of repetition in noting the later history of the collected
writings than to set folk astray with a misleading list
of titles.]</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

cannot be read by your equipment.

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
