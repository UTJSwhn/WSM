<h3><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h3>


<p>Nineteen Hundred and Seven. In the
"strangers' room" of the Porru house a
woman sat crying. Crouched on the floor near the
bed, her knees drawn up, her arms resting on her
knees, and her forehead on her arms, she wept and
sobbed continuously, shaking her head from time
to time as though to indicate that there was no more
hope, absolutely none at all; while her plump shoulders
and straight young back rose and fell in the
tightly fitting yellow bodice, like a wave of the sea.</p>

<p>The room was nearly in darkness; there were no
windows, but through the open door which gave
upon a bricked gallery, a stretch of dull grey sky
could be seen, growing momentarily darker; and
far, far away, against this dusky background,
gleamed the yellow ray of a little, solitary star.
From the courtyard below came the shrill chirping
of a cricket, and the occasional stamp of horses'
hoofs on the stone pavement.</p>

<p>A short, heavy woman, clad in the Nuorese dress,
with a large, fat, old-woman face, appeared in the
doorway; she carried a four-branched iron candlestick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
in one socket of which burned a wick soaked
in oil.</p>

<p>"Giovanna Era," said she in a gruff voice,
"what are you about all in the dark? Are you
there? What are you doing? I believe you are
crying! You must be crazy! Upon my word,
that's just what you are&mdash;crazy!"</p>

<p>The young woman began to sob convulsively.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh!" said the other, drawing near, and
in the tone of one who is deeply shocked and
amazed. "I said you were crying. What are you
crying for? There's your mother waiting for you
downstairs, and you up here, crying like a crazy
creature!"</p>

<p>The young woman wept more violently than ever,
whereupon the other hung the candlestick on a large
nail, gazed vaguely about her, and then began hovering
over her disconsolate guest, searching for
words wherewith to comfort her; she could only
repeat, however: "But, Giovanna, you are crazy,
just crazy!"</p>

<p>The "strangers' room"&mdash;the name given to that
apartment which every Nuorese family, according
to immemorial custom, reserves for the use of
friends from the country&mdash;was large, white, and
bare; it had a great wooden bedstead, a table covered
with a cotton cloth and adorned with little
glass cups and saucers, and a quantity of small pictures
hung close to the unpainted wooden ceiling.
Bunches of dried grapes and yellow pears hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
from the rafters, filling the room with a faint fragrance;
and sacks of wool stood about on the floor.</p>

<p>The stout woman, who was the mistress of the
house, laid hold of one of these sacks, dragged it
to another part of the room, and then back again
to where she had found it.</p>

<p>"Now then," said she, panting from her exertion,
"do stop. What good does it do? And
why should you give up, anyhow? What the devil,
my dearie! Suppose the public prosecutor <i>has</i>
asked for the galleys, that doesn't mean that the
jury are all mad dogs like himself!"</p>

<p>But the other only kept on crying and shaking
her head, moaning: "No, no, no!" between her
sobs.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I tell you," urged the woman. "Get
up now, and come to your mother," and, taking
hold of her, she forced back her head.</p>

<p>The action revealed a charming countenance;
rosy, framed in a thick mass of tumbled black hair;
the big dark eyes swollen and glistening with tears,
and surmounted by heavy black eyebrows that met
in the middle.</p>

<p>"No, no," wailed Giovanna, shaking herself free.
"Let me cry over my fate, Aunt Porredda."<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a></p>

<p>"Fate or no fate, you just get up!"</p>

<p>"No, I won't get up! I won't get up! They'll
sentence him to thirty years at the very least! Do
you hear me? Thirty years! That's what they'll
give him!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"That remains to be seen. And after all, what
is thirty years? Why, you carry on like a wildcat!"</p>

<p>The other gave a shrill cry, and tore her hair
in an access of wild despair.</p>

<p>"Thirty years! What is thirty years!" she
shrieked. "A man's whole lifetime, Aunt Porredda!
You don't know what you are talking about,
Aunt Porredda! Go away, go away and leave me
alone! for the love of Christ, oh, leave me to myself!"</p>

<p>"I'm not going away," said Aunt Porredda.
"The idea! In my own house! Get up, you child
of the devil! Stop this before you make yourself
ill. To-morrow will be time enough to pull your
hair out by the roots; your husband isn't in the
galleys yet!"</p>

<p>Giovanna dropped her head, and began to cry
again in a subdued, hopeless way, heartbreaking
to listen to. "Costantino, Costantino," she
moaned in the tone of one bewailing the dead, "I
shall never see you again, never again! Those mad
dogs have seized you and bound you fast, and they
will never let you go; and our house will be empty,
and the bed cold, and the family scattered. Oh,
my beloved! my lamb! you are dead for this world.
May those who have done it die the same death!"</p>

<p>Aunt Porredda, distracted by Giovanna's grief,
and unable to think of anything more to say, went
out on the gallery, and began calling: "Bachissia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Era! come up here; your daughter is losing her
mind!"</p>

<p>A step was heard on the outer stair. Aunt Porredda
turned back into the room, and behind her
appeared a tall, tragic-looking figure all in black.
The gaunt, yellow face, shaped like that of some
bird of prey, was framed in the folds of a black
handkerchief; two brilliant green spots indicated
the eyes, deep set, overhung by fierce, heavy brows,
and surrounded by livid circles. Her mere presence
seemed to exercise a subduing effect upon the
daughter.</p>

<p>"Get up!" she said in a harsh voice.</p>

<p>Giovanna arose. She was tall and lithe, though
cast in a heavy mould and having enormous hips.
Beneath the short, circular petticoat, adorned below
the waist with a band of purple, and with a broad,
green hem, appeared two little feet shod in elastic
gaiters, and the suggestion of a pair of shapely
legs.</p>

<p>"What are you worrying these good people
for?" demanded the mother. "Have done now;
come down to supper, and don't frighten the children,
or throw a wet blanket over the happiness
of these good people."</p>

<p>The "happiness of these good people" was in allusion
to the arrival of the son of the house, a law
student, home for the holidays.</p>

<p>Giovanna, recognising that her mother meant to
be obeyed, quieted down without more ado. Pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the woollen kerchief from her head, and thereby
disclosing a cap of antique brocade, from whence
escaped waves of coal-black hair, she turned towards
a basin of water standing on a chair, and
began to bathe her face.</p>

<p>The two women looked at one another, and Aunt
Porredda, taking her lips between her right thumb
and forefinger in sign of silence, noiselessly left the
room.</p>

<p>The other, accepting this hint, said nothing more,
and when Giovanna had finished bathing, and had
set her hair in order, silently led the way down the
outer stair.</p>

<p>Night had fallen; warm, still, profound. The
solitary yellow star had been followed by a multitude
of glittering asterisks, and the Milky Way lay
like a scarf of gauze embroidered with silver spangles.
The air was heavy with the penetrating odour
of new-mown hay.</p>

<p>In the courtyard, the crickets, hidden away in the
trelliswork, kept up their shrill chirping; the ruminative
horse still stamped with his iron-shod hoofs
upon the stones, and from afar floated the melancholy
note of a song.</p>

<p>The kitchen opened on the courtyard, as did a
ground-floor bedroom sometimes used as a dining-room.
Both doors were standing open.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, beside the lighted stove, stood
Aunt Porredda engaged in preparing the macaroni
for supper. A child, clad in a loose black frock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
fair, untidy, and barefooted, was quarrelling with
a stout little urchin, fat and florid like his grandmother.</p>

<p>The girl was swearing roundly, naming every
devil in turn; while the boy tried to pinch her bare
legs.</p>

<p>"Stop it," said Aunt Porredda. "There now,
will you leave off, you naughty children?"</p>

<p>"Mamma Porru, she's cursing me; she said:
'Go to the devil who gave you birth.'"</p>

<p>"Minnia! what a way to talk!"</p>

<p>"Well, he stole my purse, the one with the picture
of the Pope, that Uncle Paolo brought me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not so, I didn't!" shouted the boy. "You'd
better not be talking about stealing, Minnia," he
added with a meaning look.</p>

<p>The girl became suddenly quiet, as though a spell
had been cast over her, but presently her tormentor,
seizing a long stick, tried to hook the curved handle
around her legs. Minnia began to cry, and the
grandmother faced about, ladle in hand.</p>

<p>"I declare, I'll beat you with this ladle, you
wretched children! Just you wait a moment!" she
cried, running at them. The children made a dash
for the courtyard, and collided violently with Giovanna
and her mother.</p>

<p>"What's all this? What's all this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, those children, they'll drive me wild! I
believe the devil is in them," said Aunt Porredda
from the doorway.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment a slim little figure in black
emerged from the main gateway leading into the
street, calling excitedly: "They are coming, Grandmother;
here they are now!"</p>

<p>"Well, let them come; you would do better, Grazia,
to pay some attention to your brother and sister;
they have been fighting like two cocks."</p>

<p>Grazia made no reply, but taking the iron candlestick
from Aunt Bachissia she blew out the light, and
hid it behind a bench in the kitchen, saying in a low
voice: "You ought to be ashamed, Grandmother,
to have such a looking candlestick, now that Uncle
Paolo is here."</p>

<p>"Uncle Paolo! Well, I declare! Do you suppose
he was brought up on gold?"</p>

<p>"He has been to Rome."</p>

<p>"To Rome! The idea! They only don't have
lights like that there, because they have to buy their
oil by the pennyworth. Here, we can use as much
oil as we want."</p>

<p>"You must be green if you believe that!" said
the girl; then, suddenly catching the sound of her
grandfather's and uncle's voices, she flew to meet
them, trembling with excitement.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Giovanna; Aunt Bachissia, how
goes it with you?" said the hearty voice of the
student. "I? Very well, the Lord be praised! I
was sorry to hear of your misfortune. Never mind,
courage! Who knows? The sentence is to-morrow,
is it not?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>He led the way into the room where the supper-table
was laid, followed by the two women and the
children, whom their uncle's presence filled with
mixed terror and delight.</p>

<p>He was short and limped slightly, one foot being
smaller than the other, and the leg somewhat
shorter; this circumstance had earned him the nickname
of Dr. Pededdu,<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> a jest which he took in very
good part, declaring that it was far better to have
one foot smaller than the other, rather than a head
smaller than those of other people.</p>

<p>His fresh, round, smiling face, with its little
blond moustache, was surmounted by a big, tattered
black hat. He proclaimed himself a Socialist.
Sitting down on the side of the bed, with both legs
swinging, he threw an arm around each staring,
open-mouthed child, and drew it to him, giving his
attention meanwhile to Aunt Bachissia's recital of
their misfortunes. From time to time, however, his
gaze wandered to Grazia, the angles of whose girlish,
undeveloped figure were accentuated by an ill-fitting
black frock much too small for her. Her own
hard, light-coloured orbs never left her uncle's face.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Aunt Bachissia, in her harsh voice,
"I will tell you the whole story. Costantino Ledda
had an uncle by blood, his own father's brother.
His name was Basile Ledda, but they called him
'the Vulture'&mdash;may God preserve him in glory if
he's not fast in the devil's clutches already&mdash;because
he was so grasping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
"He was a wretch, a regular yellow vulture.
God may have forgiven him, but there, they say he
starved his wife to death! He was Costantino's
guardian; the boy had some money of his own, his
uncle spent it all, and then began to ill-use him. He
beat him, and sometimes he would tie him down
between two stones in the open field, so that the bees
would come and sting him on the eyes. Well, one
day Costantino ran away; he was sixteen years old.
For three years nothing was heard of him; he says
he was working in the mines; I don't know, but
anyhow, that's what he says."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, he was working in the mines," interrupted
Giovanna.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the mother, pursing up her
lips with an air of doubt, "well, anyway, the fact
remains that one day, during the time that he was
off, some one fired at Basile the Vulture out in the
field. It is true he did have enemies. When Costantino
came back he admitted that he had run away
for fear he might be tempted to kill his uncle, he
hated him so.</p>

<p>"Afterwards, though, he tried to make his peace
with him, and succeeded too. But now listen to
this, Paolo Porru&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dr. Porru! Dr. Porreddu!" shouted the small
nephew, correcting the guest. The latter, turning
on the boy angrily, started to box his ears, whereupon
Giovanna laughed. On beholding their heartbroken
guest&mdash;she who up to that moment had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
surrounded by a halo of romance and tragedy&mdash;actually
laughing, the pale, lank Grazia broke into
a nervous laugh as well, and then Minnia laughed,
and then the boy, and then the student.</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia glared about her, and, lifting one
lean, yellow hand, was about to bring it down on
some one&mdash;she had not quite decided whether her
daughter or the boy&mdash;when Aunt Porredda appeared
in the doorway, bearing a steaming dish of
macaroni.</p>

<p>She was followed by Uncle Efes Maria Porru, a
big, imposing-looking man, whose broad chest was
uncomfortably contracted in a narrow blue velvet
jacket. He was a peasant, but affected a literary
turn; his large, colourless face resembled a mask of
ancient marble; he wore a short, curling beard, and
had thick lips always parted, and big, clear eyes.</p>

<p>"Come, sit down at once," said Aunt Porredda,
planting the dish in the centre of the table.
"What! laughing, are you? The little doctor is
making you all laugh?"</p>

<p>"I was just about to give your grandson a box
on the ear," said Aunt Bachissia.</p>

<p>"And why were you going to do that, my soul?
Come now, sit down, all of you; Giovanna, here; Dr.
Porreddu, over there."</p>

<p>The student threw himself back full-length on the
bed, stretched out his arms, lifted his legs high in
air, dropped them again, sat up, and jumped to
his feet with a yawn.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The children and Giovanna began to laugh again.</p>

<p>"A little gymnastic exercise does one good.
Great Lord! how I shall sleep to-night! My bones
feel as though they had lost all their joints. How
tall you have grown, Grazia; you look like a bean-pole."</p>

<p>The girl reddened and dropped her eyes; while
Aunt Bachissia thrust out her lips, annoyed at the
student's lack of interest, as well as at the general
indifference to Costantino's fate. To be sure,
Giovanna herself had apparently forgotten, and it
was only when Aunt Porredda placed before her a
bountiful helping of macaroni covered with fragrant
red gravy, that she suddenly recollected herself;
her face clouded over, and she refused to
eat.</p>

<p>"There now! what did I tell you?" cried Aunt
Porredda. "She is crazy, absolutely crazy! Why
can't you eat? What has eating your supper to-night
to do with the sentence to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Aunt Bachissia crossly.
"Don't be foolish, don't go to work and spoil these
good people's pleasure."</p>

<p>"A brave heart," said Uncle Efes Maria pompously&mdash;fastening
his napkin under his chin and seeing
an opportunity for a learned observation&mdash;"a
brave heart defies fate, as Dante Alighieri says.
Come now, Giovanna, prove yourself a true flower
of the mountains; more enduring than the rocks
themselves. Time softens all things."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Giovanna began to eat, but with a lump in her
throat that made swallowing a difficult matter.</p>

<p>Paolo, meanwhile, had not spoken a word, but sat
bowed over his plate, which, by the time Giovanna
had managed to get down her first mouthful, was
entirely clean.</p>

<p>"Why, you are a perfect hurricane, my son!"
said Aunt Porredda. "What a ravenous appetite
you have, to be sure! Do you want some more&mdash;yes?&mdash;and
more still&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Well done!" cried Uncle Efes Maria. "It
looks as though you had found very little to eat in
the Eternal City!"</p>

<p>"Eh, that is precisely what I was saying just
now," said Aunt Porredda. "Beautiful streets, if
you will; but&mdash;when it comes to buying anything&mdash;the
pennies have to be counted down! I've been
told all about it! On my word, they say that there
are no provisions stored in the houses as there are
here, and you all know for yourselves that with no
provisions in the house it is not easy to satisfy one's
appetite!"</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia nodded affirmatively; she knew
only too well what happens when there is nothing
in a house to eat.</p>

<p>"Is that true or not, Dr. Porreddu?"</p>

<p>"True, perfectly true," said he, laughing, and eating,
and waving his large, white hands with their
long nails, in the air.</p>

<p>"It is that that makes him such a leech, a regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
vampire," said Uncle Efes Maria, turning to his
guests. "I'll not have a drop of blood left in my
veins. Body of the devil! how the money must go
in Rome!"</p>

<p>"Ah, if you only knew!" sighed Paolo. "Everything,
every single thing is so frightfully dear.
Twenty centimes for a single peach! There, I feel
better now."</p>

<p>"Twenty centimes!" exclaimed all the company
in chorus.</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Bachissia, and then? After Costantino
came back?" asked Paolo.</p>

<p>"Well, Paolo Porru&mdash;you see I go on addressing
you familiarly, even though you will be a doctor
soon; when you were a little chap I used to go so
far as to give you a cuff now and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no recollection of it, but go on with your
story," said the young man, while Grazia's nostrils
fairly dilated with anger.</p>

<p>"Well, as I said, Costantino disappeared for three
years, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was working in the mines, all right; then he
came back and was reconciled to his uncle. What
then?"</p>

<p>"He met my Giovanna here, and they fell in love
with each other; but the uncle made objections because
my girl was poor. Then they began to hate
one another worse than ever. Costantino was working
for the Vulture, and he would never let him
have a centime. So, then, one day Costantino came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to me and said: 'I'm a poor man; I haven't got any
money to buy trinkets for the bride, or to provide
a feast and all the rest for a Christian wedding; and
you are poor, too. Now then, suppose we do this
way: we will have the civil ceremony, and all live
and work together; then, when we have saved
enough, we will be married by God. A great many
do it that way, why shouldn't we?' So we did; we
had the civil ceremony very quietly, and afterwards
we all lived together and were happy enough. But
the Vulture was furious; he used to come and yell
things at us even in our own street, and he tried to
interfere with Costantino in every way he could.
But we just kept on working. So at last, when the
vintage was over last autumn, we began preparing
the sweets and things for the wedding, and then Basile
Ledda was found dead one day, murdered in his
own house! The evening before, Costantino had
been seen going in there; what he went for was to
tell his uncle about the wedding, and to try to make
his peace with him. Ah, poor boy! he would not
run off and hide somewhere as I begged and implored
him to do, so of course they arrested him."</p>

<p>"He would not go because he was innocent,
mamma, my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There you go, you simpleton, beginning to cry
again! If you don't stop, I'll not say another word,
so there! Well, then, Costantino was arrested, and
now the trial is just over, and the public prosecutor
has asked to have him sent to the galleys; but he's a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
dog, that public prosecutor! They have evidence, to
be sure; Costantino was seen on the night of the
murder entering his uncle's house, where he lived
all by himself, like the wild beast that he was; and
then their relations in the past&mdash;all true enough, but
there are no proofs. Costantino was very contradictory,
and full of remorse about something; he
kept repeating: 'It is the mortal sin'; for you must
know that he is a good Christian, and he thinks that
this misfortune has been sent as a punishment because
he and Giovanna lived together before they
were married by religious ceremony."</p>

<p>"But tell me one thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just wait a moment. I should add that now they
<i>have</i> been married by religious ceremony&mdash;in prison!
Yes, my dear, in prison; fancy what a horrid thing
that was! Now don't begin crying again, Giovanna;
if you do, I'll throw this salt-cellar at your head.
There she is, the goose! Every one told her not to
do it. 'Don't be married now,' they said. 'If he's
found guilty and sentenced, you can marry some one
else!'"</p>

<p>"How contemptible!" began the young woman,
with flashing eyes, but the mother merely turned a
cold, penetrating look upon her, and she broke off
at once.</p>

<p>"Did <i>I</i> say so?" demanded the other. "No, it
was other people, and they said it for your own
good."</p>

<p>"For my good, for my good," moaned Giovanna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
burying her face in her hands; "there is no more
good for me, ever again, ever again!"</p>

<p>"Have you children?" asked Paolo.</p>

<p>"Yes, one, a boy. If it were not for him&mdash;alas,
alas! if Costantino is sentenced, and there were no
child&mdash;then, oh, misery, misery&mdash;&mdash;!" And she
seized her hair by the roots, and began to drag her
head violently from side to side, like an insane person.</p>

<p>"You mean that you would kill yourself, my beloved?"
asked Aunt Bachissia ironically.</p>

<p>To the student there was something artificial in
the action; it reminded him of a famous actress
whom he had once seen in a French comedy, and
this open display of grief only aroused his cynicism.</p>

<p>"After all," said he, "the new divorce law has
been approved, and any woman whose husband is
serving a sentence can regain her freedom."</p>

<p>Giovanna did not appear so much as to take in
what he said, and continued to rock her head from
side to side. Aunt Porredda, however, spoke up in
a decided tone: "What an idea! as though any one
but God could undo a marriage!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I read about that in the papers," said Uncle
Efes Maria jocularly. "Those are the divorces they
get on the Continent, where men and women marry
over and over again without troubling themselves
about priests, or magistrates either, for that matter,
but here!&mdash;shame!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Daddy Porru, that's not on the Continent,
it's in Turkey," said Grazia.</p>

<p>"Here too, here too," said Aunt Bachissia, who
had eagerly followed every word.</p>

<p>As soon as supper was over the two Eras went
off to see their lawyer.</p>

<p>"What room have you given them?" asked Paolo.
"The 'strangers' room'?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course; why?"</p>

<p>"Because I really thought I should like to sleep
there myself; it is suffocating down here. What
better 'stranger' could there be than I?"</p>

<p>"Be patient just till to-morrow, my boy. Remember
these are poor guests."</p>

<p>"O Lord! what barbarous customs! Will there
ever be an end to them?" he exclaimed impatiently.</p>

<p>"That's just what I should like to know," said
Uncle Efes Maria. "These women are draining my
pockets. Well, what do you think of the new Ministry?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything of it at all!" laughed the
student, recalling a character in the <i lang="fr">Dame chez
Maxim</i>, a favourite play at the Manzoni Theatre,
which he frequented. Then he sauntered off to look
at some books he had left on a shelf at the other end
of the room. Minnia and the boy had run out into
the courtyard; Grazia, seated at the table, with both
cheeks resting on her closed fists, was still gazing
at her uncle. He turned towards her:</p>

<p>"You read novels, don't you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"I? No," she answered, turning red.</p>

<p>"Well, I only wanted to say that if I ever catch
you reading certain books&mdash;I'll rap you over the
head with them."</p>

<p>Her under-lip began to tremble, and, not to let
him see her cry, she jumped up and ran out. In the
courtyard she found the two children still quarrelling
over the purse with the picture of the Pope. "As
for stealing," the boy was saying, "you had better
keep quiet about that; you, and she there&mdash;the bean-pole&mdash;you
two sold some wine to-day, and kept the
money!"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lie!" cried Grazia, falling upon him
and dealing him a blow, but crying herself bitterly
all the while.</p>

<p>The courtyard was filled with the chirping of the
crickets and the noise of the horses' hoofs; and the
warm, starlit air was heavy with the scent of the
hay.</p>

<p>"You must not be hard on her, she is a poor
orphan," said Aunt Porredda, speaking in Grazia's
behalf (they were the three children of an older son
of the Porrus', a well-to-do shepherd whose wife had
died the year before). "And why not let her read
if she wants to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, let her read by all means," said Uncle
Efes Maria pompously. "Ah! if they had only
allowed <i>me</i> to read when I was young&mdash;I would
have been an astronomer, as learned as a priest!"
To Uncle Efes Maria an astronomer represented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
height of learning and cultivation&mdash;a philosopher,
as it were.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the Pope, my son?" asked Aunt
Porredda, from an association of ideas.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What! You have never seen the Pope?"</p>

<p>"Oh! what do you expect? The Pope is kept
shut up in a box; if you want to see him, you've
got to pay well for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, go along!" said she. "You are an infidel,"
and, going out to where the children were still fighting,
she made a rapid descent upon them, separated
the belligerents, and sent each flying in a different
direction. "On my word!" she cried, "you are
just like so many cocks. The Lord have mercy on
me! Here they are, the chicken-cocks! Bad children,
every one of you, bad, bad children!"</p>

<p>And the lamentations of the youngsters arose and
mingled with the noises of the summer evening.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h3>


<p>The next morning Giovanna was the first to
awaken. Through a pane of glass set in the
door came a faint, roseate, sunrise glow; and the
early morning silence was broken only by the chattering
of the swallows. Not yet fully aroused, her
first sensations were agreeable; then, all at once it
was as though a terrific clap of thunder had sounded
in her ear. She remembered!</p>

<p>This was the day that was to decide her husband's
fate. She knew for a certainty that he would be
condemned, and yet she persisted in hoping still. It
mattered very little to her whether or no he were
guilty; probably she had not at any time troubled
herself much with that aspect of the case, and what
wholly concerned her now were the consequences.
The thought of being parted, perhaps forever, from
this man, young, strong, and active as a greyhound,
with his caressing hands and ardent lips, was agony;
and as the full consciousness of her misery came over
her, she jumped out of bed, and began drawing on
her clothes, saying breathlessly: "It is late, late,
late."</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia opened her little firefly eyes, and
then she also got up; but she realised too clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
what that day, and the next, and the year following,
and the next two, and five, and ten years would
probably be like, to be in any haste to begin them.
She dressed deliberately, plunged her hands into
water, passed them across her face, and dried it,
then carefully arranged the folds of her scarf about
her head.</p>

<p>"It is late," repeated Giovanna. "Dear Lord,
how late it is!" But her mother's calm demeanour
presently quieted her. Aunt Bachissia went down to
the kitchen and Giovanna followed. Aunt Bachissia
prepared the <i>café-au-lait</i> and bread for Costantino
(the two women were allowed to take food to the
prisoner), placed them in a basket, and started for
the jail, Giovanna still following.</p>

<p>The streets were deserted; the sun, just appearing
above the granite peaks of Orthobene, filled the atmosphere
with fine, rose-gold dust. The sky was
so blue, the little birds so gay, and the air so still
and fragrant, that it was like the early morning of
some festal day, before the human bustle and the
ringing of the church bells have disturbed the stillness
and charm.</p>

<p>Giovanna, crossing the street that leads from the
station&mdash;near which the Porrus lived&mdash;to the prison,
gazed upon her own violet-coloured mountains in the
distance, hemming in the wild valleys below like a
setting of amethysts; she inhaled the delicious air
filled with the perfume of growing things; she
thought of her little slate-rock house, of her child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of her lost happiness, and it seemed as though her
heart would burst.</p>

<p>The mother walked briskly on in front, poising the
basket on her head. Presently they reached the
great, round, white, desolate pile in which are the
prisons. A sentry stood, mute and immovable, looking
in the morning light like a statue carved out of
stone. A single green shrub growing against the
blank expanse of wall seemed the rather to accentuate
the dreariness of the spot. A huge, green
door, which from time to time opened and shut
like the mouth of a dragon, now opened and swallowed
up the two women. Every one in that
dismal abode had come to know them; from the
florid, important-looking head-keeper, who might
have been a general at the very least, down to the
junior custodian, with his pale face, his straight
blond moustache, and his pretensions to elegance.</p>

<p>The visitors were not allowed to penetrate beyond
the gloomy passageway, whose fetid atmosphere,
however, gave some idea of the horrors that lay beyond.
The pale and elegant guard, coming forward,
took their basket, and Giovanna asked in a low voice
if Costantino had slept.</p>

<p>Yes, he had slept, but he kept dreaming all the
time. He did nothing but repeat over and over
again the words&mdash;"<i>The mortal sin!</i>"</p>

<p>"Ah! may he go to the devil with his mortal
sin!" exclaimed Aunt Bachissia angrily; "he ought
to stop it!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma, dear, why need you swear at him?
Has not fate cursed him enough as it is?" murmured
Giovanna.</p>

<p>The women now left the building and stood outside,
waiting for the prisoner to be brought forth.
When Giovanna's eyes fell upon the group of carbineers
who were to escort him to court, she fell to
trembling violently, although on all the preceding
days she had seen precisely the same thing; and her
big, black eyes, stretched to their widest extent,
fastened upon the great doorway with the unseeing
stare of a crazy woman. Slowly the minutes
lagged by, then the dragon mouth opened, and once
more, surrounded by stony-faced guards with
fierce black moustaches, the figure of Costantino
appeared.</p>

<p>He was tall and as lithe as a young poplar tree;
a long lock of lustrous black hair hung down on
either side of a face, beardless, pallid from prison
confinement, and almost feminine in its beauty. The
eyes were large, and chestnut-brown in colour; the
mouth small, and as innocent as a child's, and there
was a little cleft in the middle of the chin. He
looked like a young Apollo.</p>

<p>The moment his eyes fell upon Giovanna, although
he too had been waiting for that moment,
he grew whiter than ever, and stopped short, resisting
the guards. Giovanna rushed forward, sobbing,
and seized hold of his manacled hands.</p>

<p>"Forward!" said one of the carbineers; then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
gently, to her: "You know, my girl, it is not allowed."</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia now stepped forward as well, darting
rapid glances out of her little green eyes. The
escort halted for an instant, and Costantino, smiling
bravely, said in a voice that was almost cheerful:
"Courage! Courage!"</p>

<p>"The lawyer is waiting for you," said Aunt Bachissia,
and then the guards pushed the women
gently aside.</p>

<p>"Stand back, good people! Out of the way!"
said one, and they led the prisoner off, still smiling
back at Giovanna, his gleaming white teeth showing
between lips that were still round and full, albeit
colourless. Thus he disappeared from view between
his stony-faced conductors.</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia now, in her turn, dragged off Giovanna,
who wanted to follow her husband, and insisted
that she should return first to the Porrus' for
breakfast.</p>

<p>They found the courtyard bathed in sunlight. It
played upon the shining leaves of the grape-vines,
from which hung bunches of unripe grapes like pale-green
marble; the swallows disporting in it were
moved to pour forth floods of song; and it tricked
out Uncle Efes Maria, preparing to set out for the
country on his chestnut horse. How full of light
and cheerfulness seemed that little, enclosed spot,
with its low stone-wall, beyond which could be seen
a broad expanse of open country, stretching away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to the distant horizon! The children sat on the
threshold of the kitchen door, devouring their breakfast
of bread soaked in <i>café-au-lait</i>; Grazia had taken
hers to a retired corner, possibly in order not to be
seen engaged upon anything so prosaic by the student-uncle.
He, meanwhile, stood in his shirt-sleeves
in the middle of the enclosure, gulping down the
contents of a great bowl.</p>

<p>"How large is St. Peter's?" asked Aunt Porredda,
who was polishing the doctor's shoes, and
marvelling the while to hear of the wonderful things
he had seen.</p>

<p>"How large? Why, as large as a <i lang="it">tanca</i>.<a name="Anchor-3" id="Anchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> You
can't even pray there; no one could say his prayers
in a <i lang="it">tanca</i>. The angels are as large as that gateway&mdash;the
littlest ones&mdash;those that hold the holy-water
basins."</p>

<p>"Ah! then you have to go upstairs to reach the
water?"</p>

<p>"No; they are on their knees, I think. Give me
a little more <i>café-au-lait</i>, mamma; is there any?"</p>

<p>"Of course there is. It seems to me you have
come back very hungry, my little Paolo; you're a
regular shark!"</p>

<p>"Do you know how much this breakfast would
cost in Rome? One franc! not a centime less; and
then the milk is all water!"</p>

<p>"The Lord preserve us! Why, that is frightful!"
"What do you think? I saw some dolphins at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sea; the strangest-looking creatures&mdash;&mdash;Oh! here
are our guests; good-morning; what have you been
about?"</p>

<p>Giovanna described the meeting with her husband,
and was beginning to cry again, when Aunt Porredda
took her by the hand and led her into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>"You have need of all your strength to-day, my
soul," said she, setting before her a large cup of
<i>café-au-lait</i>. A little later the two women started
out again for the Court of Assize; Paolo promising
to join them there.</p>

<p>"Courage!" said Aunt Porredda, as she took
leave of Giovanna, and the latter heard her husband's
sentence in the kind hostess's tone, and went
off with the look of a whipped dog.</p>

<p>Paolo followed her with his eyes; then, limping
across the courtyard to his mother, he said a singular
thing:</p>

<p>"Listen to me, mamma; before two years have
gone by that young woman will be married to some
one else!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by saying such a thing, Dr.
Pededdu!" cried the mother, who always addressed
her son by his nickname when she was angry with
him. "Upon my word, you must be crazy!"</p>

<p>"Oh! mamma, I have crossed the sea," he replied.
"Let us hope, at all events, that she will
engage me as her lawyer."</p>

<p>"That young man devours his food like a dog,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
said Giovanna to her mother, as they descended the
steep little street. "May the Lord have mercy on
him!"</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia, walking along plunged in thought,
answered through her clenched teeth, "He will
make a good lawyer; he will gnaw his clients to
the bone and then swallow them whole!"</p>

<p>Then the two walked on in silence, but a moment
later Aunt Bachissia stumbled, and as she did so,
for some reason that she could not fathom, it flashed
into her mind that, should it ever so fall out that
Giovanna were to apply for a divorce, she would
ask Paolo to be their lawyer.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock when they reached the Cathedral
Square, and the small windows of the Court
House close by were sending back dazzling reflections
of the early morning sun.</p>

<p>The little granite-paved square was already
crowded with country friends and neighbours, witnesses
in the trial. Some of these immediately
approached the two women, and greeted them
with the inevitable commonplace: "Courage! Courage!"</p>

<p>"Oh! courage; yes, we have plenty of it, thank
you," said Aunt Bachissia. "Now leave us in
peace." And she continued on her way, as proud
and erect as a race-horse. The road was only too
familiar already, and she followed it straight to the
fateful hall. Behind her came Giovanna, and behind
her, the others: heavily bearded, roughly clad men;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a handful of idlers; last of all, a near-sighted old
woman with no teeth.</p>

<p>The jury, most of them old and fat, were already
in their places. One of them had an enormous
hooked nose; two others, fierce-eyed, thickly bearded
men, looked like bandits; three sat in a little group
with their heads close together, laughing over something
in a newspaper.</p>

<p>In a few moments the judge appeared, his rosy
face surrounded by a straggling white beard. Then
came the public prosecutor, a young man with a fair,
drooping moustache, flushed and tyrannical-looking.
Then the registrar, the ushers&mdash;all of these functionaries
looking to Giovanna, in their black robes,
like so many evil genii come to weave their fatal
spells about poor Costantino.</p>

<p>And there he was himself! Erect in the cage, like
some frightened animal held in leash by the two
stony-faced carbineers. His gaze was fastened upon
Giovanna, but now there was no smile; he seemed
overpowered by the weight of his misery; and, as his
glance fell upon those men, the arbiters of his fate,
his clear, childlike eyes contracted and grew dark
with terror.</p>

<p>Giovanna, too, seemed to feel the grip of an iron
hand on her heart, and at times the sensation was
so acute as to give her actual physical pain.</p>

<p>The lawyer for the defence, a little pink-and-yellow
man, with a high-pitched, querulous voice,
began his speech.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>His defence had been sufficiently unfortunate
from the first; now he merely repeated what had
already been said; and his words seemed to fall into
space like drops of water dripping into a great empty
vessel. The public prosecutor, with his drooping
moustaches, maintained an air of insolent indifference.
A few of the jury appeared to take credit to
themselves for sitting through it with patience;
while the others, so far as could be observed, did
not so much as pretend to listen. The only persons
present, in fact, who really took any interest in the
summing up of the defence were Aunt Bachissia,
Giovanna, and the prisoner; and the longer their
advocate talked, the more did these feel that their
case was hopelessly lost.</p>

<p>From time to time some new arrival would take
one of the seats behind Giovanna, and whenever this
happened, she would turn quickly to see if it were
Paolo. For some reason she found herself ardently
wishing for him; she felt as though his mere presence
in the courtroom might help them in some
way.</p>

<p>At last the lawyer ceased. Instantly, Costantino
arose, and, growing very red in the face, asked if
he might speak. "The&mdash;the"&mdash;said he, pointing in
the direction of the advocate&mdash;"the gentleman-lawyer
has spoken&mdash;he has defended me&mdash;and I thank
him kindly; but he has not spoken the way I could
have wished; he did not say&mdash;well, he did not
say&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped, breathing hard.</p>

<p>"Add anything to your defence that occurs to
you," said the judge.</p>

<p>The prisoner stood for a moment with his eyes
cast down, in an attitude of deep thought. The
flush died out of his face, leaving it whiter than
before; presently he passed his hand across his forehead
with a convulsive movement, and raised his
head.</p>

<p>"This is it," he began in a low tone. "I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
but again his voice failed; then, suddenly clenching
his fists, he turned towards the lawyer, and burst
out in a voice of thunder: "But I am innocent! I
tell you I am innocent!"</p>

<p>The lawyer hastily motioned with his hand to
quiet him; the judge raised his eyebrows, as though
to say: "And suppose he had said so a hundred
times, is it our fault that we are not convinced?"
And a woman's sob was heard through the courtroom.</p>

<p>Giovanna had broken down, and Aunt Bachissia
at once dragged her towards the door, reluctant and
tearful. Every one but the public prosecutor
watched the struggle between the two women.</p>

<p>A little later the court withdrew to deliberate.</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia, followed by two of the neighbours,
hauled Giovanna into the square, where, instead
of trying to comfort her, she fell to scolding
her roundly. Was she quite mad? Did she want to
be removed by force? "If you don't behave yourself,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
she concluded, "I declare I'll give you a good
beating!"</p>

<p>"Mamma, oh! mamma," sobbed the other.
"They are going to condemn him! They are going
to take him from me, and I can do nothing, I can do
nothing&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"What do you expect to do?" asked one of the
neighbours. "As sure as I am alive there is nothing
for you to do. Be patient, though, and wait a little
longer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment three figures in black appeared,
one of them laughing and limping. They were
Paolo Porru and two young priests, friends of
his.</p>

<p>"There she is now," said the student. "It looks
as though he had been sentenced already!"</p>

<p>"Upon my word," remarked one of the priests,
"she is indeed a young colt! One that knows how
to kick, too! She looks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The other one, meanwhile, was staring curiously
at Giovanna, and as they all three approached the
Eras, Paolo asked if the argument had closed. "It's
the man who murdered his uncle, isn't it?" enquired
one of the priests. The other continued to stare
at Giovanna, who had begun to regain her self-control.</p>

<p>"He has murdered no one at all," said Aunt Bachissia
haughtily. "Murderer yourself, black crows
that you are!"</p>

<p>"Crows, are we? Well, you are a witch!" retorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the priest. Upon which the bystanders began
to laugh.</p>

<p>Giovanna, meanwhile, at the solicitation of Paolo,
had become quite calm, and she now promised
not to make a scene if they would let her return to
the courtroom. They all, accordingly, went in together,
and found that the jury, after a brief deliberation,
were already taking their seats. A profound
silence fell upon the dim, hot room. Giovanna
heard an insect humming and buzzing against
one of the windows; her limbs grew heavy; she felt
as though her body, her arms, her legs, were strung
on rods of ice-cold iron. Then the judge pronounced
the sentence in a low, careless voice, while the prisoner
looked at him fixedly and held his breath. Giovanna
kept hearing the buzzing of the fly, and was
conscious of a feeling of intense dislike for that rosy,
white-bearded man, not so much on account of what
he was saying, but because he said it with such an
air of indifference. And this was what it was:</p>

<p>A sentence of twenty-seven years' imprisonment
"for the homicide who, after long premeditation,
had at last committed the crime upon the person of
his guardian and own uncle by blood!"</p>

<p>Giovanna had so entirely prepared her mind to
expect thirty years, that for the first moment twenty-seven
seemed a respite, but it was only for a moment;
then, swiftly realising that in thirty years
three count for nothing, she had to bite her lips violently
to keep back the shriek that rose to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Everything grew dim before her; by a desperate
effort of the will she forced herself to look at
Costantino, and saw, or thought she saw, his face
old and grey, his eyes, dim and vacant, wandering
aimlessly about him. Ah! he was not looking
at her, he was not even looking at her any more!
Already he was parted from her forever. He was
dead, though still among the living; they had killed
him! Those fat, self-satisfied men, who sat there
in perfect indifference, awaiting their next victim.
She felt her reason forsaking her, and suddenly a
succession of piercing shrieks rent the air; some one
seized her, and she was dragged out again into
the sunlit square.</p>

<p>"Daughter! daughter! Do you know what you
are doing? You must be mad! You are howling
like a wild beast!" cried Aunt Bachissia, grasping
her by the arm. "And what good will it do? There
is the appeal still,&mdash;the Court of Cassation,&mdash;do be
quiet, my soul!"</p>

<p>All this had happened in a few moments. The witnesses,
the lawyer, Paolo Porru, and the others now
came crowding around the women, trying to think
of something to say to comfort them. Giovanna,
dry-eyed and staring, was sobbing in a heartbroken
way, disjointed sentences falling from her lips, expressions
of passionate tenderness for Costantino,
and wild threats and imprecations addressed to the
jury. She begged so hard to be allowed to remain
until the condemned man should be brought out, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
they agreed. At last he appeared; bent, livid,
sunken-eyed; grown prematurely old.</p>

<p>Giovanna rushed forward, and, as the carbineers
made no motion to stop, she went ahead of them,
walking backwards, smiling into her husband's face,
telling him that it would all be set right in the Court
of Cassation, and that she would sell everything, to
the very clothes on her back, in order to save him.
But he only stared back at her, wide-eyed, unseeing;
and when the carbineers pushed her gently aside, one
of them saying: "Go away, my good woman, go off
now, and try to be patient," he too said: "Yes, go
away, Giovanna, try to get permission to see me
before I am taken away, and&mdash;bring the child, and
take courage."</p>

<p>So Giovanna and her mother went back to the
house, where Aunt Porredda embraced and wept
over them; then, however, appearing to repent of
such weakness, she set about to remedy it.</p>

<p>"Well," said she. "Twenty-seven years, what is
that after all? Suppose he had been sentenced to
thirty, would not that have been worse? What!
You are going away? In this heat! Why, you
must be crazy, both of you; upon my word, I shan't
let you go."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Aunt Bachissia; "we must get off;
the others are all going back now, and will be company
for us. But if it won't be putting you out too
much, Giovanna will return in a few days and bring
the boy."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, bless you! is not this house the same as
your own?"</p>

<p>They sat down to dinner, but Giovanna, though
now perfectly calm, would touch nothing. Two or
three times Aunt Porredda attempted to talk on
indifferent subjects: she asked if the boy had cut
his first teeth; remarked that travelling in such heat
might make them ill; and enquired about the barley-crop
in their neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Profound peace brooded over the courtyard. The
sun poured down on the grape-vines overhead, and
traced delicate lacework patterns on the paving
where it filtered through the leaves. The swallows
flew hither and thither, singing joyously. Paolo sat
reading the newspaper as he ate his dinner. Grazia
and Minnia,&mdash;the boy had gone off with his grandfather,&mdash;in
their sparse, tumbled little black dresses,
kept falling asleep over theirs, overpowered by the
noontide somnolence. Aunt Porredda's words
floated dreamily out into all this sunlight and peace,
into which Aunt Bachissia's tragic mien, and Giovanna's
mute air of woe, seemed to strike a note of
discord.</p>

<p>The moment the meal was ended, the visitors
packed their wallet, saddled their horse, and said
farewell. Paolo promised to see their lawyer about
the appeal to the Court of Cassation, and as soon
as they were well out of sight, began to play with
Minnia, forcing her to shake off her drowsiness, and
pretending that he was crazy. He would first laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
uproariously, shaking in every limb; then, suddenly
become perfectly silent, staring ahead of him with
wild fixed gaze; then break forth once more into
peals of laughter.</p>

<p>The girls were highly diverted; they too fell to
laughing immoderately; and the sun-bathed courtyard
and tranquil house, freed at last from the
gloomy presence of the guests, was filled with sunshine,
and merriment, and peace.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h3>


<p>Meanwhile, the Eras pursued their journey
under the burning July sun. The road
at first led downwards to the bottom of the valley;
then crossed it and ascended the violet-coloured
mountains that, shutting in the horizon beyond, lost
themselves in the haze that rose from the heated
earth. It was a melancholy progress. The two
women rode one horse, a dejected-looking beast,
tractable and mild. Their travelling companions
had gradually drifted away; some riding on ahead;
others falling behind, but all alike were silent and
depressed, overpowered by the suffocating heat, the
stillness, and the sad outcome of their journey. They
felt Costantino's misfortune almost as keenly as the
women themselves, and out of respect for Giovanna's
dumb agony, either remained silent, or, if they spoke,
did so in undertones that awoke no echoes, and failed
even to break the intense silence.</p>

<p>Thus they travelled on, and on; descending steadily
towards the bed of a torrent, whose course ran
through the bottom of the valley. The path, though
not very steep, was rugged and at times difficult to
follow as it wound its way between rocks, stretches
of barren, dusty ground, and yellow stubble. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
long intervals a scraggy tree would raise its solitary
head; lifeless, immovable in the breathless atmosphere,
like some lonely hermit of the wilderness; its
shadow falling athwart the sun-baked earth, like
that of a little wandering cloud, lost and frightened
in the great expanse of light its presence alone seems
to mar. Occasionally the shrill note of a wild bird
would issue from one of these oases of shade, only
to die away instantly, choked and overpowered by
the weight of the all-embracing silence. Big purple
thistles, pink-belled convolvuluses, and lilac mallows,
rearing themselves here and there in defiance of the
sun, seemed only to enhance the general air of desolation;
while below and above stretched endless lines
of ancient grey stone-walls, covered with dry yellow
moss. Fields of uncut grain, with spears like
yellow pine-cones, closed in the distance.</p>

<p>On, and on, they went. Giovanna's head was
burning beneath her woollen kerchief upon which the
sun's rays beat mercilessly; and big tears coursed
silently down her cheeks. She tried to hide them
from her mother, who was riding on the saddle,
while she was seated on the crupper, but Aunt Bachissia
heard, Aunt Bachissia saw, even out of the
back of her head; and presently she could contain
herself no longer.</p>

<p>"Look here, my soul," said she suddenly, as they
traversed the bottom of the valley, between great
thickets of flowering oleanders; "will you have the
goodness to stop? What are you crying for, anyhow?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Haven't you known it for months and
months?"</p>

<p>Instead of stopping, however, Giovanna only burst
forth into loud sobs. Aunt Bachissia glanced
around; the others had all gone on ahead, and they
were quite alone.</p>

<p>"Haven't you known all along how it would be?"
she repeated, in low, even tones that seemed to Giovanna
to come from an immeasurable distance and,
sweeping by them, to be swallowed up in the surrounding
void. "Are you such a fool, my soul, as
not to have known it from the first? Did he or did
he not kill that infamous Vulture? If he killed
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he never said he had done it!" interrupted
Giovanna.</p>

<p>"Well! that was all that was needed, for him to
be crazy enough to say so. My soul! just think for
a moment, nothing more was wanting! For my
own part, I always expected that some time or other
he would crush that Vulture as one crushes a wasp
that has stung him. You say Costantino is a good
Christian! My soul! one would have thought that
by this time you would begin to have some idea of
what it means to hate! Would you, yes or no, if
you had the chance, murder those men back there
who condemned him? Very well, then. He murdered
the Vulture, and to a certain extent I sympathise
with him, because I know the human heart.
But I have not forgiven him, and I never will forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
him, for taking the risks he did. No, that I
will not, not for the love of God! He had a wife
and a child, and if he were going to do it he should
have gone about it more carefully. And now, that's
enough of it. Let the whole matter drop. You are
still young, Giovanna; you must think of him as of
one who is dead."</p>

<p>"But he is not dead!" wailed Giovanna desperately.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said Aunt Bachissia angrily.
"Go and hang yourself. There, do you see that tree
over yonder? Well, go and hang yourself from it;
but don't torment me any more. You have always
been a torment. If you had married Brontu Dejas
everything would have been right; but no, you must
have that beggar; very well, the best thing for you
to do now is to hang yourself!"</p>

<p>Giovanna made no reply. In the bottom of her
heart she too believed Costantino to be guilty, but
she had long ceased to care. In her present misery
all she took note of was the central fact of his condemnation,
and she could not understand why ordinary
mortals should have the power so to dispose
of a fellow-creature. Ah, how she hated that mysterious,
invincible power! She felt towards it as she
did towards those horrible spirits, unseen, but <i>felt</i>,
which fly abroad on stormy nights!</p>

<p>On, and on, they went. Now they had crossed
the valley and were slowly ascending the mountain
on its further side. The sun began to sink towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the west, the horizon to open; the sky grew soft, and
the landscape lost its look of utter desolation. The
shadows of the mountain-peaks stretched down now,
clear into the dim depths of the valley, where a few
late dog roses still bloomed; a little breeze sprang up
and filled the air with the odour of wild growing
things.</p>

<p>Insensibly every one's spirits revived under the
influence of this unlooked-for shade and coolness.
One of their companions, joining the two women,
began to recount an adventure a friend of his had
had close to that very spot; at one point the story
became so entertaining that even Giovanna smiled
faintly.</p>

<p>On, and on. Now the sun was setting, and from
the height they had attained they could make out
the sea, a bluish circle, bounded by the horizon.
Finally, beyond a thick-growing mass of trees and
bushes so sturdy as to withstand alike the wild winter
blasts and the scorching heats of summer, lying
in the midst of the melancholy uplands like an island
in a sea of light and solitude, they descried their own
village, the eyrie of a strong, handsome, and primitive
people; shepherds for the most part, or peasants
occupied in raising grain and honey.</p>

<p>Green, rocky pastures, gay in the springtime with
daffodils, and fragrant with mint and thyme, and
fields of grain, hemmed in the little group of slate-stone
cottages that gleamed in the sun like burnished
silver. Here and there a good-sized tree cast its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
shadow athwart this quail's nest, hidden away, as
it were, amid the billows of ripening grain. Lines
of green tamarisks, and a wilderness of thyme and
arbute, lay beyond. Further still were the limitless
stretches of the uplands, and above all spread a sky
of indescribable softness and beauty. On the right,
against this sky, the lonely mountain-peaks reared
themselves like a company of sphinxes, blue in the
morning, lilac at noonday, and purple or bronze-coloured
at evening; their rugged sides covered with
forests, the home of eagles and vultures.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when the Eras at last reached
the village. Mount Bellu, the colossus of that company
of sphinxes, had enveloped itself in a cloak of
purple mist, and stood out against the pale, grey
sky. The street was already silent and deserted, and
the clatter of the horse's hoofs on the rough stone
paving resounded like the blows of a hammer. One
after another their companions turned off, so that
when they reached their own home, the two women
were quite alone.</p>

<p>The Era cottage stood on a little flat clearing,
above the level of the street. Higher up on the hillside,
overlooking it, was another house, a white one.
A large almond-tree, growing beside a piece of
crumbling wall that extended from one corner of
the cottage, overhung the street, which, beyond this
point, merged into the open country.</p>

<p>Scattered about on the level stretch of ground between
the two houses,&mdash;the grey cottage of the Eras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and the white dwelling of the Dejases,&mdash;beneath the
shadow of the almond-tree, lay a quantity of great
boulders, convenient and comfortable resting-places;
hence the spot had come to be used by the villagers
as a sort of common or place of public resort.
Hardly had the horse stopped before the cottage,
when Giovanna slid down and, with lagging steps
and hanging head, advanced towards a woman,&mdash;a
relative left in charge during their absence,&mdash;who
came forward to meet them with the baby in her
arms. Taking the child from her, Giovanna clasped
it closely to her breast, and began to weep, burying
her head on the chubby little shoulder. Her tears
were now flowing quietly enough, a feeling of numbness
and of utter despair crept over her, and the unhappiness
of the preceding months seemed as nothing
in comparison with the misery and desolation of
the present moment. The baby, hardly yet five
months old, had clear, violet eyes, and little, unformed
features set in a stiff, red cap with fringe
hanging down over the forehead. He recognised
his mother, and began pulling with all his strength
on the end of her kerchief, kicking both little feet,
and crying: "Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;aah&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Malthinu, my little Malthineddu, my sole comfort
in all the earth; your daddy is dead," sobbed
Giovanna.</p>

<p>The woman, understanding that Costantino had
been found guilty, began to cry as well. Suddenly
Aunt Bachissia descended swiftly upon them. Pushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Giovanna into the cottage, she asked the woman
to help her unload the horse.</p>

<p>"Are you stark mad, both of you?" she demanded
in a low voice. "What need is there to carry on
like that, right out here in sight of the white house?
I can see the beak of that old Godmother Malthina
now. Ah! she will be delighted when she hears
of our bad luck."</p>

<p>"No," said the woman, "she has come several
times to ask for news of Costantino, and she always
seemed to feel very sorry. She told me she had
dreamed that he was condemned to penal servitude."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! that is the kind of sorrow that an ill-tempered
cur feels! I know her! She's a venomous
snake, and she can't forgive us. After all," she
added a few minutes later, walking towards the cottage
with the wallet on her back, "she's right; we
can't forgive ourselves."</p>

<p>Aunt Martina Dejas was the owner of the white
house on the hill, and the mother of that Brontu
Dejas whom Giovanna had refused to marry. She
was very well off, but a miser, and Aunt Bachissia
was quite mistaken in supposing that she hated them.
As a fact, the refusal had affected her very little,
either one way or the other.</p>

<p>"See here," said Aunt Bachissia, when they had
finished unloading the horse. "Will you do me one
favour more, Maria Chicca? Will you take back the
horse and tell her that Costantino is to get twenty-seven
years in prison? Then watch her face."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman took hold of the bridle, the animal
having been hired from the Dejases, and led it towards
the white house.</p>

<p>This house, formerly the property of a merchant
who had failed, had been bought at public sale a few
years before. It was large and commodious, with
a portico in front that gave it an almost seignorial
air, but which was used as a promenade by Aunt
Martina's chickens and pigs. It was an inappropriate
dwelling for rough shepherds like the Dejases,
as was shown by its rude furnishings, composed
mainly of high clumsy wooden bedsteads, roughly
fashioned chests, and heavy chairs and stools. Aunt
Martina was seated on the portico, spinning&mdash;she
could spin even in the dark&mdash;when Maria Chicca
approached, leading the horse. The house was entirely
unlighted, Brontu and the men being off at
the sheepfolds, while Aunt Martina never kept a
servant. She had other sons and daughters, all married,
with whom she lived in a constant state of
warfare on account of her miserly habits. Whenever
there was any especial stress of work, she got
in some of the neighbours to help. Often Giovanna
and her mother were hired in this way, being paid
in stale or injured farm produce. The Eras, however,
were too poor to refuse anything they could
get.</p>

<p>"Well, what was the result?" asked the old
woman, laying the spindle and a little ball of flax
on the bench beside her. She had a thin, nasal voice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
round, light eyes, placed close together; a delicate,
aquiline nose, and lips that were still full and red.
"You are crying, Maria Chicca. I saw those two
poor women arrive, but I was afraid to go and ask,
because I dreamed last night that he had been sentenced
to penal servitude."</p>

<p>"Ah, no! they have given him twenty-seven years'
imprisonment."</p>

<p>Aunt Martina appeared to be disappointed; not,
indeed, that she bore Costantino any ill-will, but
because she had a firm belief in the infallibility of
her dreams.</p>

<p>She took the horse by the bridle, saying:</p>

<p>"I will go to the Eras' this evening, if I possibly
can, but I'm not sure. There's a man coming, he
who worked for Basile Ledda; he is going to hire
out to us. He was one of the witnesses; but I believe
he's back, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think he is," said the other. And, returning
to the cottage, she began at once to relate
how Aunt Martina felt very sorry; and how she
had dreamed that Costantino had got penal servitude;
and that Giacobbe Dejas&mdash;he was a poor relation
of the other Dejases&mdash;was going to work for
them. Giovanna, who was nursing the child, and
gazing down at it sorrowfully, did not so much as
raise her eyes. Aunt Bachissia, on the contrary,
asked innumerable questions: Had she found the old
Dejas alone? Was she spinning,&mdash;spinning there in
the dark?&mdash;etc., etc.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen," she said to Giovanna. "She may be
here this evening."</p>

<p>Giovanna neither moved nor looked up.</p>

<p>"My soul! do you hear me?" cried the mother
angrily. "She may come down this evening."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Giovanna, in the tone of a person
just awake.</p>

<p>"Malthina Dejas!"</p>

<p>"Well, let her go to the devil!"</p>

<p>"Who is to go to the devil?" asked a sonorous
voice from the doorway. It was Isidoro Pane, an old
leech-fisher related to the Eras. He had come on a
visit of condolence. Tall, with blue eyes and a yellow
beard, a bone rosary about his waist, and clasping
a long staff with a bundle fastened to the top,
Uncle Isidoro looked like a pilgrim. He was the
poorest and the gentlest and the most peaceable inhabitant
of Orlei. When he wanted to swear, all he
said was: "May you become a leech-fisher!" He
and Costantino were great friends. Often and often
had the two sung the holy lauds in church together,
and the Eras had named him as a witness for the
defence, because no one could testify better than he
to the blameless character of the accused man. His
name had, however, been rejected. What, indeed,
would the testimony of a poor leech-fisher amount to
when confronted with the majesty of the law!</p>

<p>The moment she saw him, Giovanna gave way
and began to sob.</p>

<p>"The will of God be done!" said Isidoro, leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
his staff against the wall. "Be patient, Giovanna
Era, you must not lose your trust in God."</p>

<p>"You know?" asked Giovanna.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard. Well, he is innocent. And
I tell you that even though he has been condemned
to-day, to-morrow his innocence may be proved."</p>

<p>"Ah! Uncle Isidoro," said Giovanna, shaking her
head. "Your confidence doesn't impress me any
longer. Up to yesterday I believed in you, but now
I have lost faith."</p>

<p>"You are not a good Christian; this is Bachissia
Era's doing."</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia, who regarded the fisherman with
scant favour, and was always afraid of his bringing
vermin into the house, turned on him angrily, and
was about to launch forth into abuse, when another
visitor arrived. He was presently followed by
others, and still others, until at last the little cottage
was filled with condoling neighbours; while Giovanna,
who was really tired by this time even of
weeping, felt it incumbent upon her to continue to
sob and lament desperately.</p>

<p>All the time, Aunt Bachissia kept watching for
the rich neighbour, but she did not appear. Instead,
there came Giacobbe Dejas, the man who was about
to enter her service. He was a cheerful soul, about
fifty years old; ordinary-looking, short, thin, smooth-shaven,
and bald; with no eyebrows, and a decided
squint; the eyes, small and cunning, were of a nondescript
colour, something between yellow and green.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
He had worked for Basile Ledda for twenty years,
and had been called as a witness for the defence. In
his testimony he had alluded to the ill-treatment
Costantino had received from his uncle, but told
also how the old miser had maltreated every one,
his women and servants as well. Why, the very day
before his death he had struck and kicked him&mdash;Giacobbe
Dejas!</p>

<p>"Malthina Dejas is expecting you," said Aunt
Bachissia. "You had better go on up there."</p>

<p>"The devil cut off her nose!" replied Giacobbe.
"I'll go presently. What I'm afraid of is of falling
out of the frying-pan into the fire! She's a worse
miser than even <i>he</i> was."</p>

<p>"If she pays you what you earn, you've no right
to judge her," said the ringing voice of Uncle Isidoro.</p>

<p>"Ah! you are there, are you?" said Giacobbe
mockingly. "How are the legs? Pretty well punctured?"</p>

<p>Isidoro regarded his legs, which were wrapped
about with bits of rag. It was his habit to stand
in stagnant water until the leeches attached themselves
to him.</p>

<p>"That need not concern you," he answered
quietly. "But it is not well to curse the woman
whose bread you are going to eat."</p>

<p>"I shall eat my own bread, not hers, and that is
our affair. Come now, Giovanna, take heart! What
the devil! Do you remember that story I was telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
you on the road from Nuoro? Be sensible now,
for this little chap's sake. Costantino is not going
to die in prison, I can tell you that myself. Give
me the baby," he added, stooping down to take it,
but finding the little fellow asleep, he straightened
himself, and, placing a finger on his lips, "Aunt Bachissia,"
he said (he always used the "Aunt" and
"Uncle" even with people younger than himself),
"do me a favour; send your daughter to bed; she
has come to the end of her forces. And you, good
people," he continued, turning to the company, "let
us do something as well, let us take ourselves off."</p>

<p>One by one, accordingly, they all departed. Aunt
Bachissia, seizing the stool upon which Isidoro Pane
had been seated, took it outside and wiped it vigorously.
When she came in she found Giovanna
fallen into a sort of a doze, and had to shake her in
order to arouse her.</p>

<p>The young woman opened her eyes, which were
red and glassy; then she got up with the child in
her arms.</p>

<p>"Go to bed," commanded the mother.</p>

<p>She looked at the door, murmuring: "Never
again! He will never, never come back again! For
a moment I thought I was waiting for him."</p>

<p>"Go to bed, go to bed," said the mother, her voice
harsher than ever. She gave Giovanna a push, and
then, taking up the old brass candlestick, opened
the door.</p>

<p>The cottage consisted of a kitchen, with the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
stone fireplace in the centre and the oven in one
corner, and two bedrooms, furnished in the most
meagre way. Giovanna's bedstead was of wood,
very high, and provided with an extremely hard
mattress and a red cotton counterpane.</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia took the little Martino, who was
whimpering in his sleep, and laid him down, cradling
him between her two hands, while Giovanna got
ready for bed. When she was undressed and her
head bare, the beautiful hair wound around it somewhat
in the fashion of the ancient Romans, the
mother covered her carefully and went out.</p>

<p>No sooner was she left to herself, however, than
she threw off the covers and began to moan and
lament. She was completely worn out with sorrow
and fatigue, and her eyes were heavy with sleep, yet
she could not rest. Confused pictures kept crowding
through her brain, and, as though her mental anguish
were not already suffering enough, sharp
pains shot through her teeth and temples. Every
time she had one of these twinges it was as though
some one had poured a jug of boiling water down
her spine, and she shook with nervous terror. Altogether,
the night was one long horror.</p>

<p>From the adjoining room, the door of which
stood open, Aunt Bachissia could hear Giovanna
muttering and raving; now addressing Costantino
in terms of extravagant endearment; then the jury
with threats and imprecations. She herself, meanwhile,
lay wide awake, her brain clear and active,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
going over every detail of what had taken place,
and laying plans for the future. The sound of Giovanna's
grief only aroused a dumb sense of resentment
in her breast, and yet, after a while, she too
found herself weeping.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h3>


<p>On the evening of the following day, a Saturday,
Brontu Dejas, returning from the sheepfolds,
was hardly off his horse before he began to
grumble. Among themselves, the Dejases were notorious
grumblers, though with outsiders they were
always extremely suave. Apart from this trait he
was a good-natured devil; young and handsome,
very dark and thin, of medium height, with a short
curling red beard. He had beautiful teeth, and,
when talking to women, smiled continually in order
to show them. Coming home on this particular
evening, he began to grumble because he found
neither light nor supper awaiting him. It must be
admitted that there was some justification; for, after
all, he was a working-man, and week after week he
would return from six days of toil to find a house
as dark and squalid as a beggar's hovel.</p>

<p>"Eh! eh!" he said, as he began to unharness his
horse. "This might as well be Isidoro Pane's
shanty! Let us have some light, at any rate, so we
can see to swear. What is there for supper?"</p>

<p>"Bacon and eggs; there now, be patient," said
Aunt Martina. "Did you know that Costantino
Ledda had been sentenced to thirty years?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Twenty-seven. Well, are those the eggs? My
dear mamma, that bacon is rancid. Why don't you
give it to the chickens? the chickens, do you hear?"
and he snapped his handsome teeth angrily.</p>

<p>"They won't eat it," answered Aunt Martina
tranquilly. "Yes, twenty-seven. Ah! twenty-seven
years, that is a long time. I dreamed he had got
penal servitude."</p>

<p>"Have you been to see the women yet? How
pleased they must be now with their fine marriage!
Miserable beggars!"</p>

<p>He had asked the question with evident curiosity,
yet the moment his mother told him that she had
been, and that Giovanna was tearing her hair and
quite beside herself, while it was plain to see that
Aunt Bachissia wished now that she had strangled
her daughter before allowing her to make such a
match, he turned on her furiously.</p>

<p>"What business had you to go near the den of
those wretched beggars?"</p>

<p>"Ah! my son. Christian charity! You don't
seem to have any idea of what that is!" Aunt
Martina liked, indeed, to pretend that she was a
charitable person. "Priest Elias was there too this
morning; yes, he went to comfort them. Giovanna
wants to take the baby to Nuoro for Costantino to
see before they carry him off. I told her she was
crazy to think of such a thing in this heat; but
Priest Elias told her to go, and he nearly cried!"</p>

<p>"What does he know about children! He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
barren, like all the rest of them," snarled Brontu,
who hated the priests because his uncle, who had
been rector in the village before Priest Elias Portolu
came from Nuoro, had left all his property to
a hospital. Aunt Martina had not forgiven this
outrage either, but the old she-wolf knew how to
disguise her feelings, and when Brontu railed
against the priests she always made the sign of
the cross.</p>

<p>"What makes you talk that way, you fool?" said
she, hastily crossing herself. "You don't know
where your feet may carry you! Priest Elias is a
saint. If he were to hear such evil talk as that&mdash;beware!
He has the Holy Books, and if he chooses
to, he can curse our fields, and bring the locusts,
and make the bees die!"</p>

<p>"A fine saint!" exclaimed Brontu. Then he insisted
upon hearing all the particulars about the
Eras,&mdash;how Giovanna had cried out, what that old
kite, Aunt Bachissia, had said&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Giovanna's sobs were enough to melt the
very stones; and Aunt Bachissia was in despair
because now, in addition to all the rest, the lawyer's
fees and other expenses of the trial have stripped
them of everything they possessed, even to the
house."</p>

<p>The young man listened intently, his face beaming
with satisfaction, and his white teeth gleaming.
In his undisguised pleasure he was simply and
purely savage.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen," said Aunt Martina, when she had finished.
"Giacobbe Dejas will be here presently to
see you too. He wanted to begin his term of service
to-morrow, but I told him to wait till Monday.
To-morrow is a holiday, and there is no sense in
our having him eat at our expense."</p>

<p>"Beautiful St. Costantino! You <i>are</i> close,
mamma."</p>

<p>"Oh, you; you are just like a child! What use
is there in wasting things? Life is long and it
takes a great deal to live."</p>

<p>"And how are those two women going to live?"
asked Brontu after a short silence, seating himself
before the eggs and bread.</p>

<p>"They will catch snails, I suppose," said Aunt
Martina scornfully. She had taken up her spindle
again, and was spinning close to the open door.
"You take a great interest in them, Brontu Dejas."</p>

<p>Silence. Within the room the only sounds were
the rattle of the spindle and the noise of Brontu's
strong teeth, as he munched the hunks of hard
bread; outside, though, beyond the portico, the
crickets were chirping incessantly; and from the far-away,
deserted woods, through the warm, dim atmosphere
of the falling night, came the melancholy
cry of an owl. Brontu poured out some wine, raised
the glass, and opened his mouth, but not to drink.
There was something he wanted to say to his
mother, but the words would not come. He drank
the wine, brushed some drops off his beard with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the back of his hand, and again opened his mouth,
but still the words died away.</p>

<p>A sound of heavy boots was heard, tramping
across the open space before the house. Aunt Martina,
still spinning, arose, told her son that Giacobbe
Dejas was coming, and, taking the food and wine,
put them away in the cupboard.</p>

<p>Giacobbe saw the action as he entered, and at
once understood that she was hiding something in
order not to have to offer it to him; but, as he himself
would have put it, he was too much a "man
of the world" to allow any expression of resentment
to escape him.</p>

<p>He advanced, therefore, smiling and cheerful.</p>

<p>"I will wager," said he, laying one finger on his
nose, "that you were talking about me."</p>

<p>"No, we were speaking of poor Costantino
Ledda."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, poor fellow!" returned Giacobbe, becoming
serious at once. "And when you think that
he is innocent! As innocent as the sun! No one
can be more sure of it than I."</p>

<p>Brontu threw himself back in an easy attitude,
crossed his legs, and, turning slightly around,
showed his teeth as he did when talking to women.
"As to that, opinions may differ," he said sharply.
"There, for instance, is my mother; she dreamed
that he had got the death sentence."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Brontu! What are you talking about?
Penal servitude!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, it amounts to the same thing. Now, we
will talk business."</p>

<p>"Very well, let us talk business, by all means,"
assented Giacobbe, crossing his legs as well.</p>

<p>A little later the two men, having settled the
matter in hand, went off together, Brontu leading
the way to the tavern. He himself was not in the
least close, and if he never offered a visitor a glass
in his own house, it was only not to irritate Aunt
Martina. At the tavern, though, he was superb,
and on this particular evening he made Giacobbe
drink so much, and drank so much himself, that
they both became tipsy.</p>

<p>Coming out at last into the silent, deserted street,
filled with the odour of the dry fields, they began
talking again of Costantino, and Brontu said, with
brutal frankness, that he was glad of the sentence.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil!" shouted Giacobbe. "You
have no heart!"</p>

<p>"All right, that's it; I have no heart."</p>

<p>"Just because Giovanna wouldn't have you, you
are glad to hear of the death, or worse than death,
of a brother."</p>

<p>"He's not dead, and he's not a brother; and it
was I who would not have Giovanna Era. If I
had wanted her to, she would have licked the soles
of my shoes."</p>

<p>"Bum&mdash;bum&mdash;look out, or you'll have a tumble,
my little spring bird. You lie like a servant-maid."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;not&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;servant-maid," stammered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Brontu, furious. "If you say anything like
that again, I'll take you by the crown of your head
and choke you."</p>

<p>"Bum&mdash;I tell you, you'll fall down, little spring
bird," repeated Giacobbe at the top of his lungs.
Their voices rang out through the quiet street; then
they suddenly ceased talking, and stillness reigned
once more. In the distance, under the light of the
stars which overhung the mountain crests like garlands
of golden flowers, the owl still sounded his
melancholy note.</p>

<p>All at once Brontu began to cry in a strange,
drunken fashion, with neither sobs nor tears.</p>

<p>"Well, what is the matter now?" demanded Giacobbe
in a low tone. "Are you drunk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. Drunk with poison, you galley
refuse. I only hope you will be strangled yet!"</p>

<p>At this the other felt very indignant. Not only
had he never been to prison, but he had never so
much as been accused of any offence against the
law. Yet, mingled with his resentment, there was
a vague feeling of terror.</p>

<p>"You are going crazy!" said he in a still lower
tone. "What's the matter with you? Why should
you talk to me like that? Have I ever done anything
to you?"</p>

<p>Whereupon the other became confidential, and,
groaning as though he were in physical pain, he
declared that he was, in truth, madly in love with
Giovanna, and that he had hoped, and prayed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
devil, from the beginning, that Costantino would
be found guilty.</p>

<p>"Even if the devil were to get my soul it
wouldn't matter, because, you see, I don't believe in
him!" said he, breaking into a foolish, cackling
laugh, more disagreeable to listen to even than
his previous maudlin distress. "I intend to marry
Giovanna," he presently added.</p>

<p>Giacobbe was greatly astonished at this, but he
pretended to be still more so. "What!" said he.
"You take my breath away! How&mdash;why&mdash;what on
earth do you mean? How can you marry her?"</p>

<p>"She will get a divorce, that's all. Well, what
of that? There's a law that gives a woman the
right to marry again if her husband has been sent to
prison for a long sentence."</p>

<p>Giacobbe had heard some talk of this, but no
case of legal divorce, still less of remarriage, had
as yet been heard of in Orlei. Nevertheless, not to
appear ignorant, he said: "Oh, yes, I know; but it
is a mortal sin. Giovanna Era will never do it!"</p>

<p>"That's just what I am worrying about, Giacobbe
Dejas. Will you talk to her on the subject
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course! To-morrow! You're an
ass, Brontu Dejas! You may be rich, but you are
as stupid as a lizard, stupider than one! Here,
when you might marry a maid,&mdash;some rich young
girl, as fresh as a rose with the dew still on it,&mdash;you
want instead to have that woman! Upon my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
word, it will give me something to laugh at for
the next seven months!"</p>

<p>"All right, you can laugh till you split in two,
like a ripe pomegranate! But I'm going to marry
her!" said Brontu angrily. "There's no other
woman like her, and I shall marry her; you will
see!"</p>

<p>"Well, do marry her, my little spring bird!"
cried the other, bursting into a loud laugh. Brontu
joined in, and they continued on their way uproariously
till they saw a tall figure with a staff silently
approaching them.</p>

<p>"Uncle Isidoro Pane, did you have good sport?"
shouted Giacobbe. "And your legs, have they
plenty of punctures?"</p>

<p>"You had better turn leech-fisher yourself," said
the other, coming up to them. "Whew! what a
smell of brandy! Some one must have broken a
cask near here!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you think we are drunk?"
demanded Brontu in a bullying tone. "The only
reason you don't get drunk yourself is because you
haven't anything to do it with! Get away! get
away, I tell you, or I'll crush you like a frog!"</p>

<p>The old man laughed softly, and walked on.</p>

<p>"Idiot!" said Giacobbe in an undertone. "Don't
you know that he could have helped you with Giovanna?
He's a friend of hers."</p>

<p>"Here! here!" shouted Brontu, turning around,
and gesticulating with both arms. "Come back!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
come back, I tell you! 'Sidore Pane, <i lang="it">che ti morsichi
il cane</i>!"<a name="Anchor-4" id="Anchor-4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> he laughed, delighted with his rhyme.
But Isidoro did not stop.</p>

<p>"Do you hear me?" yelled the tipsy Brontu, stammering
somewhat. "I tell you to come here! Ah!
you won't do it, you little toad? I tell&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Isidoro silently pursued his way.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to him like that; what sort of way
is this to carry on?" remonstrated Giacobbe.
Brontu thereupon adopted a new method.</p>

<p>"Little flower, come here, come here! Come
listen to what I have to say. You may tell <i>her</i>&mdash;that
friend of yours&mdash;well, yes, Giovanna, that
is who I mean. You may tell her that if she gets
a divorce I'll marry her!"</p>

<p>This had the desired effect. The old man stopped
short, and turning around, called in a distinct voice:</p>

<p>"Giacobbe Dejas!"</p>

<p>"What is it, my dear?" answered the herdsman
mockingly.</p>

<p>"Make&mdash;him&mdash;keep&mdash;quiet!" returned Isidoro
in the tone of a person who means to be obeyed.</p>

<p>For some unexplained reason, Giacobbe felt a
sudden sense of chill as he heard the tone and those
four emphatic words. Taking his new master by
the arm he drew him quickly away, murmuring:</p>

<p>"You are a dunce! You behave as though you
had no sense at all! What a way to talk!"</p>

<p>"Didn't you tell me to yourself?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I? You are dreaming! Am I crazy?"</p>

<p>They continued on their way, staggering along
together, arm in arm. On the portico they found
Aunt Martina, still spinning. She saw at once that
her son was tipsy, but said nothing, knowing by
experience that to irritate him when he was in that
condition was only to arouse him to a state of fury.
When he asked for wine, though, she said there
was none.</p>

<p>"Ah! there is none? No wine in the Dejas'
house! The richest people in the neighbourhood!
What a miserly mother you are." Then he began
to bluster: "I'm not going to make a scandal, but
I can tell you I am going to marry Giovanna Era!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, you are going to marry her," said
Aunt Martina to quiet him. "But in the meantime,
go to bed, and don't make such a noise; if she hears
you, she won't have you."</p>

<p>He quieted down, but made Giacobbe unroll a
couple of rush mats and spread them on the floor;
then, throwing himself down, nothing would do but
the herdsman must lie down as well, and sleep beside
him; and rather than have any trouble, Aunt
Martina was obliged to agree.</p>

<p>Thus it fell out that instead of beginning his
term of service on the Monday, Giacobbe entered
his new place on Saturday evening.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h3>


<p>Sunday morning, a fortnight later, found all
the personages of our story assembled at
Mass, with Priest Elias officiating. The country
people said that when he celebrated he seemed to
have wings.</p>

<p>Giovanna alone was absent; and this for two
reasons. First, her late misfortune required the
observance of a sort of mourning; she was expected
not to show herself outside the house except when
her work made it necessary. Apart from this, however,
she had fallen into a state of lethargy, and
appeared to be quite unable to move about, to go
anywhere, to work, or even to pray. She had, indeed,
never been much of a Christian at any time,
though before the trial she had made a vow to walk
barefoot to a certain church in the mountains, and,
if Costantino were acquitted, to drag herself on her
hands and knees from the point where the church
first came into view to its doors; that is, a distance
of about two kilometres.</p>

<p>Now, she had ceased praying, or talking, or eating,
and even seemed to have lost all interest in
her child. Aunt Bachissia had to feed him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
bread crumbled up in milk in order to keep the poor
little fellow alive. Some of the neighbours said
that Giovanna was losing her mind; and indeed it
did look so. She would remain for hours at a time
in a sort of stupor, crouched in a corner with her
glassy eyes fixed on vacancy, and when she aroused
it was only to fly into violent paroxysms, tearing
her hair, and crying out wildly.</p>

<p>After the final interview with Costantino, when
she had had the child with her, she could think of
nothing else, and described the scene in the prison
over and over again, with the monotonous insistence
of a monomaniac:</p>

<p>"He was there, and he was laughing. He was
livid, and yet he laughed, standing there behind the
bars. Malthineddu seized hold of the bars, and he
touched his little hands and then he laughed! My
heart! my heart! don't laugh like that; it hurts me,
because I know that that is how dead people laugh!
And the guards, standing there like harpies! At
first they were good to us, those guards who watch
over human flesh; but afterwards, when Costantino
had been condemned, they were cruel, as cruel as
dogs! Malthinu was frightened when he saw
them, and cried; and his father laughed! Do
you understand? The baby, the little, innocent
thing, cried; he understood that his father had
been condemned, and he cried! Oh, my heart! my
heart!"</p>

<p>Then Aunt Bachissia, beside herself with impatience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and unable to hold in any longer, would exclaim:</p>

<p>"Honestly, Giovanna, any one would take you
to be two years old! That child there has more
sense than you. Simpleton!" And sometimes she
would threaten to beat her; but prayers, sympathy,
and threats were equally unavailing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, word came from Nuoro that, while
waiting to hear from the appeal, Costantino had
been removed to the jurisdiction of Cagliari. Then
came a short, sad, little letter from the prisoner himself.
The journey had gone well, but there, at Cagliari,
the heat was suffocating, and certain red insects,
and others of different colours, tormented him
night and day. He sent a kiss to the child, and
urged Giovanna to bring him up in the fear of God.
He also asked to be remembered to his friend Isidoro.
On this Sunday, therefore, at the close of
the Mass, Aunt Bachissia waited till the fisherman
should have finished singing the sacred lauds in his
ringing voice, in order to deliver Costantino's message.</p>

<p>Priest Elias remained kneeling on the steps of the
high altar, with white ecstatic face, and Isidoro still
sang on, but the people began to leave, filing past
Aunt Bachissia, as she stood waiting.</p>

<p>Aunt Martina passed, with the fiery bearing of a
blooded steed, old but indomitable still; Brontu
passed, dressed in a new suit of clothes, his hair
shining with oil; he railed at the priests, but on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Sunday he went to Mass; and Giacobbe passed, in
a pair of new linen trousers, smelling strong of the
shop. Still Isidoro sang on.</p>

<p>The church, at last, became almost empty; the fisherman's
sonorous voice resounded among the dusty,
white rafters; the boards and beams of the roof;
the side altars, covered with coarse cloths, adorned
with paper flowers, and presided over by melancholy
saints of painted wood.</p>

<p>When Uncle Isidoro stopped at length, there were
only the priest, a boy who was extinguishing the
candles, Aunt Bachissia, and an old blind man
left.</p>

<p>Isidoro had to repeat the final response to the
lauds himself; then he got up, put away the little
bell used to mark the Stations of the Rosary, and
moved towards Aunt Bachissia, who stood waiting
for him near the door. They went out together,
and she gave him Costantino's message; then she
begged him to do her a favour; it was to ask Priest
Elias to go to see Giovanna and try to reason her
out of the condition she had allowed herself to
fall into. He promised to do so, and they separated.</p>

<p>On the way home Aunt Bachissia was joined by
Giacobbe Dejas, who had been standing on the open
square before the church, looking down at the village
and the yellow fields, all bathed in sunlight.</p>

<p>"How are you?" asked the herdsman.</p>

<p>"Ah, good Lord! bad enough, without being actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
ill. And you, how do you like your new
place?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I told you how it would be. I'm out of
the frying-pan into the fire! The old woman is as
close as the devil; she expects me to work till I
fall to pieces, and will hardly let me come in to
Mass once a fortnight."</p>

<p>"And the master?"</p>

<p>"Oh! the master? Well, he's just a little beast,
that's all."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by saying such a thing as
that, Giacobbe?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's the simple truth, little spring bird.
He growls and snarls over every trifle, and gets
drunk, and lies like time. I suppose Isidoro Pane
told you&mdash;&mdash;" He paused, and Aunt Bachissia, fixing
her small green eyes upon him, reflected that, if
he talked like that about his master, he must have
some object.</p>

<p>"Well," he resumed, "Isidoro Pane must have
told you&mdash;of course he told you, about Brontu being
drunk that evening; it was just here, where we are
now, Brontu yelled out: 'Tell Giovanna Era that if
she gets a divorce I'll marry her!' The beast, that's
just what he is, a beast! He drinks brandy by the
cask."</p>

<p>Of the last clause of this speech, however, Aunt
Bachissia took in not one word. The fact that
Brontu had said he would marry Giovanna if she
got a divorce was all she comprehended. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
green eyes flashed as she asked haughtily: "And
you wish him not to, Giacobbe?"</p>

<p>"I? What difference would it make to me, little
spring bird? But you ought to be ashamed of yourself
to think of such a thing, Aunt Kite, hardly two
weeks after&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm not a kite," snapped the old woman angrily;
and though the other laughed, she could see
that he too was furious.</p>

<p>"You might, at least, wait to hear from the appeal,"
said he. "And then you can devour Costantino
as you would a lamb without spot. Yes, devour
him if you want to, but I can tell you that
Giovanna will get a brandy-bottle for a husband,
and just as long as Martina Dejas is alive you
will starve worse than ever."</p>

<p>"Ah! you bald-pate&mdash;&mdash;" began Aunt Bachissia.
But Giacobbe walked rapidly away, and she had
only the satisfaction of hurling abuse at his retreating
back. Not that she proposed to have Giovanna
apply for a divorce. Heaven forbid! With poor
Costantino still under appeal, and waiting there in
that fiery furnace, devoured by horrible insects!
No, indeed, but,&mdash;what right had that vile servant
to talk of his master so? What business was it of
his to meddle in his master's concerns? And Aunt
Bachissia decided then and there that that "bald
raven" had himself taken a fancy to Giovanna;
and, filled with this new idea, she reached the cottage.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Her immediate thought was to repeat the whole
story to Giovanna, but finding her, for the first time
in two weeks, bathed, and tranquilly engaged in
combing out her long hair, which fell down in heavy,
tumbled masses, she was afraid to say a word.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h3>


<p>Time passed by; the autumn came, and then
the winter. Costantino's appeal had, of
course, been rejected, as appeals always are. One
night he was fastened by a chain to another convict,
whom he had never seen, and the two took their
places in a long file of others, all dressed in linen,
all silent; like a drove of wild beasts controlled by
some invisible power. They were going&mdash;where?
They did not know. They were silent&mdash;why? They
could not say. Presently they were all marched
down to the water's edge, put on board a long, black
steamer, and shut into a cage&mdash;still like wild beasts.
All about them lay the crystal sea, across whose
dark, green waters the ruby and emerald reflections
from the ship's lights danced and sparkled like
strings of glittering jewels; while above, engirdling
the great ring of water, hung the deep blue
sky, like an immense, silent vale dotted over with
yellow, starry flowers. At first Costantino's sensations
were not altogether unhappy. True, he was
going into the unknown to fulfil a cruel destiny,
but down in the bottom of his heart he firmly believed
that before very long he would be liberated,
and he never lost hope.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The bustle on deck, the rattle of the chains, and
the first motion of the ship as it got under way,
filled him with childish curiosity. He had never
been to sea, but, as a boy, he had often stood scanning
the horizon, and gazing at the grey stretch of
the Mediterranean, sometimes dotted over with the
white wings of sailing vessels. At such times, as
he stood among the wild shrubs and undergrowth
of his native mountains, he would dream of some
day crossing that far-away sea to distant, unknown
lands, and to the golden cities of the Continent. He
could read and write, and had a book in which St.
Peter's at Rome was depicted; and in the chapter
on sacred history there was an engraving of ancient
Jerusalem. Ah! Jerusalem. According to his
ideas, Jerusalem must be the finest and largest city
in the world; and, as he stood there dreaming
among the bushes on Mount Bellu, and gazing off
at the grey Mediterranean, it was to Jerusalem that
he longed to go. And now, here he was crossing
the sea; but how different from his dreams! Yet,
so splendid was his conception of Jerusalem that
if it had been thither that he was bound, even a
chained and condemned prisoner on his way to expiate
a crime, he would, nevertheless, have been
content to go.</p>

<p>The pitching and rolling of the ship was accompanied
by the ceaseless rush of the water from the
bows. Some of the convicts chattered among themselves,
laughing and cracking jokes. Costantino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
fell asleep and dreamed, as he always did, that he
was at home again. He had been set free almost
immediately,&mdash;he dreamed,&mdash;and had gone home
without letting Giovanna know a word about it so
as to give her the unutterable joy of the surprise.
She kept saying: "But this is a dream, this is a
dream&mdash;&mdash;" The expenses of the trial had stripped
the little house bare of everything, even the bed
was gone; but nothing made any difference. All
the riches in the world could not compare with the
bliss of being free and of living with Giovanna and
Malthineddu. But he was terribly tired, so he
curled himself up in the baby's cradle; the cradle
rocked, harder and harder all the time. Giovanna
laughed and called out: "Be careful not to fall out,
Costantino, my dear, my lamb!" And the cradle
rocked more than ever. At first he laughed as
well, but all at once he found he was suffering,
then he fell head foremost on the ground, and
woke up.</p>

<p>There was a heavy sea on, and Costantino was
sick. The ship struggled up to mountain-heights
and then plunged swiftly into bottomless gulfs of
water, the waves breaking even over the third deck.</p>

<p>All the convicts were ill; some still attempted to
joke, while others swore, and one, with a yellow,
cunning face,&mdash;he was Costantino's companion&mdash;moaned
and lamented like a child.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he groaned, cowering down, gasping
and frightened. "I was dreaming that I was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
home, and now&mdash;now&mdash;oh! dear St. Francis, have
pity on me!"</p>

<p>Notwithstanding his own misery, both physical
and mental, Costantino felt sorry for him. "Patience,
my brother, I was dreaming too about being
at home."</p>

<p>"I feel," cried another, "as though my soul were
melting away. What the devil is the matter with
this ship! It seems to be trying to dance the Sardian
dance!" Whereat some of the others still had
sufficient spirit left to laugh.</p>

<p>The storm was increasing. At times Costantino
thought he was dying, and was frightened; yet,
on the other hand, he felt an unutterable weariness
of life. His soul seemed to be steeped in the same
bitter fluid that his stomach was casting up. Never,
not even at the moment when the sentence of condemnation
had been passed upon him, had he experienced
anything like his present condition of hopeless
misery. He too began to swear and groan,
doubling his fists, and twisting his chilled toes.
"May you die just as I am dying now, you murderous
dogs, who brought all this on me!" he muttered,
while tears as bitter as gall welled up into
his eyes.</p>

<p>Towards dawn the wind subsided, but even when
the sickness had passed, Costantino found no relief;
he felt as though he had been beaten to the point of
death, and he was shaking with cold, and exhaustion,
and dread. The steamer relentlessly pursued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
its way. Oh, if it would only stop for just one
moment! A single moment of quiet, it seemed to
Costantino, would suffice to restore his strength;
but this continuous forging ahead, the constant rolling,
the never-ceasing roar of the waves as they
lashed the sides of the vessel, kept him in a state
of nervous tremor. On, and on, and on; the long
hours of agony dragged slowly by; night came
again; and all the time his subtle-faced, yellow-visaged
companion hardly ceased to sigh and lament,
driving Costantino into a perfect frenzy of irritation.
Sleep came at length, and then, strange to
relate, he had the same dream as on the previous
night, only this time it was Giovanna who was in
the cradle, and the cradle was rocking quite gently.</p>

<p>When Costantino awoke, the boat seemed hardly
to move; in the silence that precedes the dawn, he
heard a voice say: "That is Procida."</p>

<p>He was shaking with cold, and wondered if they
were to land there, where, he thought he remembered
to have heard, the galleys were.</p>

<p>Presently his companion awoke, shivering and
yawning prodigiously.</p>

<p>"Are we there?" asked Costantino. "How do
you feel?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well. Are we there?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; we are near Procida; is that
where the galleys are?"</p>

<p>"No; they're at Nisida," said the other. "But
we are not galley-birds!" he added, with a touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of pride, and then fell to yawning again. "Oh,
how I was dreaming!" he said, and then stopped,
overcome by the memory of his dream.</p>

<p>The prisoners were landed at Naples and immediately
placed in a black-and-yellow van, something
like a movable sepulchre. Costantino caught a brief
glimpse of a wide expanse of smooth green water,
a quantity of huge steamers, and innumerable small
craft filled with gaily dressed men who shouted out
all manner of incomprehensible things. All around
the boats, on the surface of the green water, floated
weeds, scraps of paper, refuse of all kinds. Enormous
buildings were outlined against a sky of deepest
blue. At Naples, the convicts were separated;
Costantino was taken off to the prison at X&mdash;&mdash;
and saw his yellow-visaged companion no more.</p>

<p>On reaching his destination, Costantino was at
once consigned to a cell where he was to pass the
first six months of his term in solitary confinement.
This cell measured hardly two metres in length by
six palms in breadth: it was furnished with a rude
folding bed, which, during the day, was closed and
fastened against the wall. From the tiny window
nothing could be seen but a strip of sky.</p>

<p>Of the entire term of his imprisonment this was
the dreariest period. He would sit immovable for
hours with his legs crossed and his hands clasped
about his knee&mdash;thinking; but strangely enough he
never either lost hope or rebelled against his fate.
He was persuaded that what he was enduring was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in expiation of that mortal sin, as he regarded it,
of having lived with a woman to whom he had not
been married by religious ceremony, and he felt an
absolute certainty that, this sin atoned for, his innocence
would some day be established and he would
be set free. At the same time, although he did not
despair, he suffered acutely, and passed the days,
hours, minutes in a state of nervous expectation of
some change that never came, and a prey to a devouring
homesickness. Thus day by day, hour by
hour, moment by moment, he lived in his thoughts
close to Giovanna and the child, recalling with minute
precision every little unimportant detail of the
cottage life, his past existence, and the happiness
that had once been his. In addition, moreover, to
his own misery, he suffered at the thought of what
Giovanna was enduring: now and again an access of
passionate tenderness, having her far more than the
child for its object, would seize him and arouse him
from his usual state of pensive melancholy; then,
leaping to his feet, he would stride back and forth,&mdash;two,
or at most three, steps bringing him to the
opposite wall, where he would presently stop, and,
throwing himself against it, would beat his head as
though trying to dash out his brains. These were
his moments of utmost desperation.</p>

<p>Hope always returned, however, and then he
would begin to weave fantastic dreams of an immediate
and romantic restoration to freedom, and the
guard never entered his cell that his heart did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
begin to beat violently, fancying that he was the
bearer of some joyful tidings.</p>

<p>Sometimes he played <i lang="it">morra</i> with himself, and he
cared so much whether he lost or won that he would
laugh aloud like a child. At other times he would
sit for hours looking at his outstretched palm, imagining
that it was a plain divided into <i lang="it">tancas</i>, with
walls, rivers, trees, herds of cattle, and shepherds;
and weaving stories about them all, full of exciting
adventures. And sometimes he prayed, counting
on his fingers, and repeating the lauds aloud, trying
even to improvise new verses. In this way it came
about that he actually did compose a laud of four
strophes, dedicated to St. Costantino, in which the
saint's aid was particularly invoked in behalf of
all prisoners wrongfully condemned. The refrain
ran:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Saint Costantino, we implore thee</span><br />
<span class="i0">For thy condemned innocent!"</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>The composing of this laud completely occupied
him for many days, and made him, for the time
being, almost happy. When it was finished he was
wild with joy, but instantly an overpowering desire
to tell some one about it seized him; whom was
there, though, to tell? The guard was a little Neapolitan;
bald, clean-shaven, with a flat, snub nose
like that of a skeleton; he talked to him sometimes,
but he was not sufficiently intelligent to understand
the laud; then there were the other prisoners whom
he saw during the exercise hour, but to them he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
not allowed to speak; finally he bethought him of
the chaplain, and asked to confess in order that he
might have the opportunity to repeat the laud to
him. The chaplain was a Northerner, a young man,
tall and lean, with quick, nervous movements, and
great flashing black eyes filled with intelligence. He
listened patiently while Costantino repeated his laud,
and then enquired if he did not think that, in asking
to confess for the purpose of reciting it, he had been
guilty of the sin of vanity.</p>

<p>Costantino reddened and said "No," whereupon
the confessor smiled indulgently, reassured him,
praised his verses, and sent him off in a state of
beatification.</p>

<p>A few days later the prisoner again asked to
confess. "Well, have you written another laud?"
asked the chaplain.</p>

<p>"No," said the other, looking down, "but I want
to ask a favour."</p>

<p>"What is it? Let us hear."</p>

<p>Costantino held his breath a moment, frightened
at his own temerity; then he said quickly: "Well,
this is it: I want to send the laud home!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the chaplain, "I can't do that; how
could you write it, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know how to write!" exclaimed the prisoner,
raising his clear eyes to the other's face.</p>

<p>"Yes; but the trouble is, my brother, that you are
not allowed to write."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can manage that!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, well, but I can't; I can't do it."</p>

<p>Costantino looked extremely dejected and all but
wept; then he confessed; asked whether it might
not be better to dedicate the laud to SS. Peter and
Paul, since they too had been in prison, and begged
to be forgiven if he had presumed too much in making
such a request. The young chaplain gave the absolution
and prayed for some moments aloud, the
prisoner, meanwhile, praying to himself; then, laying
one hand on the other's head, the priest said in a
low voice: "Listen; write out your laud if you
can manage it, and&mdash;keep a brave heart."</p>

<p>A wave of joy swept over Costantino, and from
that moment he had no other thought than of how
he might contrive to transcribe his verses. "I have
been a student," he said one day to the guard. "But
I know how to make shoes as well. Would you
like to have me make you a pair? Oh, I can fit
you!"</p>

<p>"You want something," said the man in Neapolitan.
"But it's no use, I will do nothing."</p>

<p>"Now, Uncle Serafino, be kind! Remember
your immortal soul!"</p>

<p>"I remember my immortal soul well enough, and
I've told you before that I'm not your uncle; you
killed your uncle."</p>

<p>"All right; it does not signify; only in our part
of the country we always call all the important
people 'uncle.'"</p>

<p>Don Serafino, however, wanted his own title,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
which Costantino, for his part, could not bring himself
to employ, since in Sardinia it is used only in
addressing people of noble birth; so for that day
nothing was accomplished.</p>

<p>On the following morning the prisoner returned
to the charge: he recounted how he was of good
family, had received an education, and fallen heir
to a fortune; this, his uncle, he whom he had been
accused of murdering, had spent, and had then shut
him up in a dark little room, and forced him to
make shoes; and once he had torn almost the entire
skin off one of his feet. He even offered to show
the foot, but Don Serafino declined with an expression
of horror, and cursed the dead man's cruelty
under his breath.</p>

<p>The result was that Costantino presently found
himself in possession of a sheet of paper, and by
means of blood and a small stick, he succeeded in
writing out the laud for condemned prisoners. Thus
the winter wore away.</p>

<p>One March day a visit of inspection was made to
Costantino's cell; it was under the direction of a
big man, with two round, staring, pale-blue eyes,
and so little chin that what he had was completely
hidden by a heavy light moustache.</p>

<p>"Hello! you there," he cried to the prisoner.
"What can you do?" Don Serafino was with the
party, and as his eye fell upon him, Costantino suddenly
recalled the fancy sketch he had once given
him. "I can make shoes," he replied.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello!" said the big man with the staring blue
eyes. "You can? Well, you murdered your uncle."</p>

<p>As the remark seemed to call for no reply, Costantino
merely moved his lips, as though to say:
"Certainly, I murdered my uncle; may it please
your mightiness!"</p>

<p>The party moved on, but before long Don Serafino
returned and informed the prisoner that his
term of solitary confinement had been shortened by
more than a third, and that he would soon be released
from his cell. Costantino supposed that he
owed this favour to his good behaviour, but Don
Serafino explained that it was because he had interceded
for him with the authorities, telling them that
the prisoner was of good family, that one of his feet
had been flayed, and that he could make shoes.</p>

<p>A few days after this Costantino was taken from
the cell and set to work, in company with a number
of others, at making shoes; he had, moreover, the
privilege of writing once every three months to Giovanna.
All of these concessions made him quite
happy. Then the spring came, and the convicts, who
had suffered intensely from cold, became gay and
cheerful, keeping up a continual flow of chaff during
working hours. Two brothers from the Abruzzi,
however, who had asked as a special favour to be
allowed to work together, quarrelled so incessantly
over the division of a piece of property that was to
be settled on their release&mdash;that is to say, in ten
years' time&mdash;that, after falling upon one another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
one day, they had to be separated and confined for
two weeks in cells. Even then, the very first time
they encountered each other during the exercise
hour, they began fighting again.</p>

<p>It was during this hour of comparative freedom,
when the prisoners took their exercise in the courtyard,
that Costantino made the acquaintance of a
compatriot, another Sardinian. This man, who had
received the nickname of the <i>King of Spades</i>, on
account of his triangular-shaped face, his big body,
and spindle legs, was white and puffy, and so closely
shaven as to look quite bald; he was an ex-marshal
of carbineers, convicted of peculation, and, according
to his own account, was related to a Cardinal
who was secretly in friendly relations with the King
and Queen. This personage, he declared, might
shortly be expected to procure his pardon, and not
alone his but that of any among his friends whom
he should recommend; those, for instance, who supplied
him with cigars, money, or stamps. He had
been assigned for duty in the clerk's office, and thus
had many opportunities to communicate with persons
outside, to arrange clandestine correspondences
between the prisoners and their families, and to
smuggle in money, tobacco, stamps, and liquor; all
greatly to his own profit and advantage. It was
not long before he asked Costantino if he did not
wish to send a letter home.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the young man, "but I am poor;
I have nothing to give you."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind," said the other generously; "that
makes no difference, we are compatriots!" and
forthwith he launched into an account of his exploits
as a marshal. He had, it appeared, killed
ten or more bandits in the course of his career, and
had received ten medals; once when he happened
to be in Rome the King had invited him to his box
at the theatre! He was, in short, a hero; but of
his crowning exploit he never spoke, merely observing
that he had been sent to prison through the
machinations of powerful enemies.</p>

<p>At first, in spite of his equivocal appearance, Costantino
believed it all, and felt deeply sympathetic;
but gradually, as day by day the accounts of the
marshal's adventures grew more varied and marvellous,
he became sceptical, and ended by placing
as little faith in what he said as did the others,
though they all pretended to be greatly impressed in
order to obtain favours.</p>

<p>Every member, indeed, of the little community,
not excepting the guards, was both a liar and a
hypocrite. The prisoners all tried to make out that
they were something quite different from what they
appeared to be, and each one had some remarkable
explanation of how he happened to be there; while
the very fact of their being compelled, quite against
their will, to associate closely and intimately together,
destroyed every spark of mutual regard that
might, under different circumstances, have sprung
up among them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Costantino noted with surprise that those who
were held for the more serious charges, while they
were the greatest braggarts and boasters, seemed in
other respects to be better than the rest. The minor
delinquents were, almost without exception, cowardly,
surly, and treacherous; fawning upon any one
who could do them a service, and betraying their
friends without hesitation, when the occasion arose.</p>

<p>"There is hardly a man in this place," remarked
the <i>King of Spades</i> one day to Costantino, "but
what is utterly corrupt; most of them are hardened
criminals, versed in every form of vice. Why, the
very air we breathe is contaminated, and a man,
suddenly deprived of his liberty and cut off from
society, quickly goes to decay in such a place; he
loses all moral sense, becomes deceitful, cowardly,
and violent, and soon grows so depraved that he
cannot even realise his own depravity." And he
gave some startling instances in illustration of his
point. "It is my belief," he continued, "that among
all who are here now, we two, the <i>Duck-neck</i> and
the <i>Delegate</i>, are the only honest ones; all the others
are criminals. Be very wary with them, Costantino,
my dear fellow-countryman; this place is nothing
but a den of bandits, of a worse class even than
those whom I put an end to!"</p>

<p>Sometimes Costantino felt quite depressed, reflecting
that if his own honesty made no better impression
than that of the <i>King of Spades</i> there was
little to be proud of.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Duck-neck</i> was a Sicilian student, a consumptive
with white hair, a long neck, and the
body of a child. Though he spent most of his
time reading, was timid and shrinking, and rarely
spoke, he would occasionally fly into such violent
rages that he was obliged to submit to the embraces
of <i>Ermelinda</i>, as the prisoners called the strait-jacket.
In one such paroxysm he had once killed
a professor.</p>

<p>The <i>Delegate</i>, who looked like a gentleman, was
likewise a Southerner; he, it appeared, had been
sent to prison out of pure envy! He had a swelling
chest and a noble head; his nose was large and Grecian,
and there was a cleft in the middle of his
lower lip; his expression was haughty and repellent,
but as soon as he was approached he became extremely
affable, even servile. Notwithstanding the
"powerful influence" that was being exerted in his
favour, certain lofty personages, a minister in particular,
were persecuting him unrelentingly. The
student had lent him some scientific books, and he
was now bent upon writing a great scientific work
himself. Being also assigned to the clerk's office,
he was able secretly to devote a good deal of time
to this splendid undertaking, of which the <i>King of
Spades</i> gave glowing accounts.</p>

<p>"See here," said he one day to Costantino; "that
man will make all our fortunes. We work every
day on the book and have a set of phrases of our
own, referring to it; but the utmost caution is necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
otherwise&mdash;beware!&mdash;everything may be
ruined, and it is a real scientific discovery. I will
run over the main heads for you. How the atmosphere
was formed&mdash;that is, the air. How the ocean
was formed&mdash;that is, all bodies of water. Origin
of the organic world. A rational demonstration
of the existence of a primordial continent in the
central tract of the Pacific Ocean. Upon this continent
human life first made its appearance, passing
the period of infancy in those tropical regions. Immigration
into Africa and Asia. The continent disappears
by reason of a great cataclysm. Identification
of this cataclysm with the flood of the Bible.
The other continents emerge. Then&mdash;End of atmosphere&mdash;End
of oceans&mdash;End of the heavenly
bodies&mdash;End of the earth!"</p>

<p>"And end of imprisonment?" enquired Costantino
with a smile. He had understood very little of
the other's discourse, only taking it for granted that,
as usual, he was relating fiction. The <i>King of Spades</i>
had to have a listener, however, so he continued
tranquilly: "Just wait a moment, the other chapters
are: Amplification of the accepted doctrine of evolution.
Evolution of our species from the anthropomorphic
apes. Causes of the inclination of the axis
of the planets,&mdash;but not Saturn. Reasons for this
anomaly. Sun spots, etc.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, go to the devil!" said Costantino to himself,
yawning prodigiously. He was staring across the
bare courtyard, with its fountain playing in the middle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
"And how about the magpie?" he presently
asked, pointing to one that had domesticated itself
in the establishment. The convicts gorged him with
food, and he had become fat and somnolent. If by
any chance he felt hungry, he called certain of
them by name in a queer, shrill voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, let him burst!" said the <i>King of Spades</i>
fretfully. "You are nothing but a child, Costantino;
more interested in that silly bird than in a
scientific work of the very first importance. Indirectly
I can lay claim to the <i>magnum</i> part of the
discovery, as it was I who brought the <i>Delegate</i>
and the <i>Duck-neck</i> together. We have already succeeded
in despatching an abstract of the work, together
with a letter addressed to the King, to the
Prime Minister. But remember&mdash;not a word of this
to any one! One eminent scientist, on reading the
abstract, exclaimed: 'This is the loftiest manifestation
we have yet had of Italian genius!' Take
my word for it, Costantino, my dear compatriot,
the <i>Delegate</i> has reached a dizzy height. He has
some powerful friends who are now in Rome for
the express purpose of working for his pardon;
but then, he has powerful enemies as well! However,
he will be liberated before long on account
of this book."</p>

<p>Costantino found all this extremely tiresome, but
he pretended to listen as he was hoping soon to
get an answer to his letter to Giovanna, and wanted
to keep in the other's good graces. The answer did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
arrive, sure enough, in May, and gave him the most
intense happiness. Giovanna wrote that the boy had
been unwell, possibly because the anguish she had
endured had affected her milk; now, however, he
was entirely well again. Isidoro Pane had received
the lauds to San Costantino written in blood, and
had wept when he read them, and now he sang them
in church, the whole congregation accompanying
him. No one knew who had written the verses, but
Isidoro said an old man with a long, snowy beard,
all dressed in white, had appeared one day on the
river-bank, and had handed them to him. People
said it was San Costantino, or perhaps Jesus Christ
himself! And Giacobbe Dejas had hired himself
out to his rich relatives. And the Nuoro lawyer
had taken possession of the title to their house, allowing
the two women to live there for a small rent.
The rich Dejases often had work for Aunt Bachissia,
and for her, Giovanna, as well; so they managed to
get along. Pietro Punia had been ill with carbuncles,
and had died. Annicca "with the silver shoulders"
was married. An old shepherd had been arrested
for stealing beehives. Thus the letter went
on, entirely filled with such simple chronicles, which,
to Costantino, however, were fraught with the most
intense interest. As he read he seemed to breathe
again his native air; each item set before him a
picture of the rocks and bushes, the people and objects,
to which he was bound by the closest ties of
habit and affection. Only, it disturbed him a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to learn that Giovanna sometimes worked at the
Dejases'. He knew of Brontu's passion for her, and
that she had refused him, and as he read this part
of the letter he experienced a first, vague sensation
of alarm. Three francs were enclosed, and when
he reflected that this money might probably have
come from the Dejases, he hated to touch it. Two
francs he offered to the <i>King of Spades</i>, rather
expecting that his dear compatriot would refuse to
take them. His dear compatriot, on the contrary,
accepted them with alacrity, remarking that they
would serve as part payment for the person who
conducted the clandestine correspondence.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances this would have angered
Costantino, but just then he was so anxious
to write again to Giovanna, to maintain some sort
of intercourse with his little, far-off world, that he
would have sacrificed the half of his life to secure
the good offices of the <i>King of Spades</i>.</p>

<p>He read and re-read his letter till he knew every
word by heart. During the day he hid it in the
sole of his shoe, ripping this open again each night.
And always, as he sat silently bending over his
work, his mind dwelt continuously on the people
and events in that little, distant village, and he identified
himself so completely at times with the subjects
of his thoughts that he lost sight of his real
surroundings. He saw the old shepherd steal cautiously
up to the hives, his face and hands wrapped
in cloths. The spot is sunny, deserted; all about lie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
green fields dotted over with flowers, dog-roses,
honeysuckle, sweet-peas, undulating lines of colour
stretching away in all directions as far as the eye
can reach. The warm air is heavy with the odour
of pennyroyal and other aromatic herbs, and the
brooding silence is broken only by the low hum of
the bees.</p>

<p>Anxiously Costantino follows every movement
of the old thief as he first detaches the little cork
hives from the flat stones on which they stand;
then, tying them all together with a stout cord,
places them in a bag, and makes off. Just at this
point Costantino could not quite make up his mind
as to the next act in the drama, and as he was
considering, a shrill voice broke in on his reflections:
"Cos-tan-ti! Cos-tan-ti!" and arousing himself
with an effort he saw the magpie, fat and sleek,
hopping lazily about in the courtyard, and stretching
its blue wings in the sun.</p>

<p>At night, with the precious letter safely deposited
beneath his pillow, he would resume the thread of
his thoughts. Now it was the sonorous voice of his
friend the fisherman that he would hear, singing the
lauds, and sometimes he almost wondered if Isidoro
had not in truth seen&mdash;on the river-bank, among the
oleander bushes bending over with their weight of
fragrant pink blossoms&mdash;the figure of an old man
dressed in white, with a long beard as snowy as
the wool of a little newborn lamb! Ah, surely it
was the Saint himself, good San Costantino, come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to tell Isidoro that he had not forgotten the prisoners
unjustly condemned!</p>

<p>Costantino readily accepted this picture of the
Saint, although the statue of him in the village
church represented a robust and swarthy warrior.</p>

<p>"Good old Saint! Good San Costantino! Soon,
soon thou wilt free us all, blessed forever be thy
name!"</p>

<p>Then the scene changes. Now it is the portico of
the rich Dejas's house; every one is busy with the
spun wool, dividing it into long skeins preparatory
to weaving it. Giovanna comes and goes, carrying
huge bunches in her hands. Brontu is there too,
seated on the threshold of the kitchen door, with his
legs well apart, and between them, laughing and
unsteady, stands the little Malthineddu. Ah, intolerable
thought! Presently, however, remembering
that Brontu is never at home except on holidays,
he is somewhat comforted, and then he falls asleep,
his heart steeped in a mingled sensation of joy and
pain.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h3>


<p>Summer had come again.</p>

<p>"How quickly the time passes," said Aunt
Martina, as she sat spinning on the portico. "It
seems only yesterday, Giacobbe, that you took service
with us, and yet, here you are back again to
renew the contract! Ah, the time does indeed pass
quickly for us poor employers! You have saved
thirty silver scudi at the very least, and have begun
to build a house of your own, but what have we to
show for it?"</p>

<p>"That's all very well, but how about the sweat
of my brow, little spring bird? The sweat of my
brow, doesn't that count for anything?" replied the
herdsman, who was busily greasing a leather cord
with tallow.</p>

<p>"But there's your keep," rejoined the old woman.
"Ah, you have forgotten to allow for that!"</p>

<p>May the crows pick your bones! thought Giacobbe,
who would have liked to say it aloud, but
was afraid to. He thoroughly detested both his employers,
the miserly old woman and the weak, hot-headed
son, who tormented him continually with
his project of marrying Giovanna if she would get
a divorce. It was important, though, for him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
renew the contract, so he held his tongue. He
greased the thong thoroughly, rolled it up, and took
it into the house; then he asked permission to go
off to attend to a piece of business of his own, and
having received a grudging assent, departed.</p>

<p>Walking in the direction of the Era cottage, the
herdsman presently descried little Malthineddu bestriding,
with very unsteady seat, a spirited stick
horse, the sun gilding his dirty little white frock,
his stout legs and bare arms.</p>

<p>Stooping down with outstretched arms, Giacobbe
barred the way. "Where are we off to?" he asked
caressingly. "There's the sun, don't you see it?
Ahi! ahi! Maria Pettina<a name="Anchor-5" id="Anchor-5"></a><a href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> will come with her fire-comb
and snatch you up, and carry you off to the
hobgoblins! Run back quickly to the house."</p>

<p>"No-o-o, no-o-o-o," shouted the child, jumping
up and down on his steed.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Giacobbe, lowering his voice
and closing one eye as he pointed to the white house,
"Aunt Martina is up there, and to save bread she
eats little children; don't you see her?"</p>

<p>The boy seemed to be impressed, and allowed himself
to be led back to the cottage, still insisting,
however, upon riding his stick.</p>

<p>Giovanna was sewing at the door, as round and
fresh and rosy as though no misfortune had ever
befallen her. Above her pretty face the mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
wavy hair lay in thick, glossy coils. Seeing Giacobbe
approach with the child, she raised her head
and smiled.
"Here he is," said the herdsman. "I am bringing
him safely back to you; but I found him playing
in the sun, and travelling straight towards Aunt
Martina, who eats children so as to save bread."</p>

<p>"Oh, go away!" said Giovanna. "You ought
not to tell children such things!"</p>

<p>"I tell them to grown people as well, for Aunt
Martina eats them too. Look out, Giovanna Era,
the first thing you know she will eat you, and all
the more because you are like a ripe quince&mdash;no,
not that either, quinces are yellow, aren't they?
You are more like a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An Indian fig!" she suggested, laughing.</p>

<p>"And how is Aunt Bachissia? Is it long since
you heard from Costantino?"</p>

<p>At this Giovanna became suddenly grave, replying
with an air of mystery that they had had news of
the prisoner only a short time before.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the man, without pressing the matter
further. "Can you tell me if Isidoro Pane is anywhere
about? I want to see him."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied sadly, taking up her work
again. "He is at home."</p>

<p>Giacobbe said good-bye, and walked thoughtfully
away in the direction of Isidoro's house,&mdash;if house it
could be called,&mdash;which stood at the other end of
the village.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The fisherman, in justice to whom it should be
said that he fished for trout and eels as well as
leeches whenever he had the opportunity, was seated
in the shadow of his hut, mending a net. This
hut, which stood in the fields, a little apart from
the rest of the village, was a prehistoric structure
composed of rough pieces of slate dating possibly
from the time when men, not yet having mastered
the art of cutting stones for themselves, used such
pieces as had already been detached by nature. It
was roofed over with sticks and bits of tile, above
which flourished a vigorous growth of vegetation.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking after a day of intense heat.
Not a leaf stirred in the row of dusty trees along
the scorched, deserted village street. Far off, the
yellow uplands, furrowed by long, slanting shadows,
were immersed in floods of crimson light; and beyond
them rose the rugged line of purplish mountains&mdash;a
row of huge red sphinxes covered with a
veil of violet gauze. The all-pervading stillness was
pierced by the distant note of a blackbird. Wild
figs with coarse, dark foliage, and a hedge of wild
robinia, among whose branches hairy nettles and the
whitish-leaved henbane had wound and interlaced
themselves, surrounded the hut; and from the doorway
could be seen a wide expanse of country, lonely
and vapourous as the sea. The atmosphere was
filled with the acrid odour of stubble and dried asphodel,
and the ground was so thickly covered with
dead leaves, and twigs, and bits of straw that Giacobbe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
had got quite close to the old fisherman before
the latter perceived him.</p>

<p>"What are we about now?" cried the herdsman
gaily.</p>

<p>The other raised his eyes without lifting his head,
and, regarding his visitor curiously for a moment,
made no reply.</p>

<p>Dropping cross-legged on the ground, Giacobbe
watched him as he mended the net with waxed twine
threaded in a huge, rusty needle.</p>

<p>"Well, really!" said the herdsman presently,
with a laugh. "I should think the little fishes would
find no difficulty in coming and going at their pleasure!"</p>

<p>"Then let them come and go at their pleasure,
little spring bird," said the fisherman, mimicking
Giacobbe's favourite mode of address. "What are
you doing here? Have you left your place?"</p>

<p>"No; on the contrary, I have just made a new
contract with those black-beetles of rich relations.
But I want to speak to you about something serious,
Uncle 'Sidore. First, though, tell me how your
legs are? And is it long since you last saw San
Costantino on the river-bank?"</p>

<p>The old man frowned; he disliked to hear sacred
things alluded to with irreverence. "If that is what
you came for," said he, "you can take yourself off
at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, there is no need to get angry! Here,
I'll tell you what I came for; it really is important.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
But, as for irreverence&mdash;if you find me turning into
a heathen you must blame the little master, he is
always pitching into the saints. He gets terribly
frightened, though, whenever he thinks he is going
to die. Just listen to this: the other night we saw
a shooting star; it fell plumb down from the sky,
like a streak of melted gold, and looked as though
it had struck the earth. Brontu threw himself down
full-length on the ground, yelling: 'If this is the
last day, have mercy on us, good Lord!' And
there he stayed until, I swear, I wanted to kick
him!"</p>

<p>"And you were not frightened?"</p>

<p>"I? No, indeed, little spring bird; I saw the star
disappear right away."</p>

<p>"But the very first moment that you saw it,
tell the truth now, you were scared then, weren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, go to the devil! Perhaps I was. But
see here, what I came for was to talk to you about
him&mdash;the master. If he is not crazy, then no one
is in the whole world. He wants you to go to
Giovanna Era and to suggest to her to get a divorce
and marry him!"</p>

<p>Isidoro dropped his work, a mist rose before his
calm, honest eyes: he clasped his hands, resting his
chin on them, and began shaking his head.</p>

<p>"And how about you?" he asked in a stern voice.
"Are you not just as crazy to dare to come to me
with such a proposition? Oh, yes! I understand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
you are afraid of losing your place! What a poor
creature you are!"</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" cried the other banteringly. "So
that's your idea, is it? You and your leeches!"</p>

<p>"Oh! you mean to be funny, do you? Well, it
is time this was put a stop to! Tell your master
that he has got to bring this business to an end.
The whole neighbourhood has heard about it, and
people are talking."</p>

<p>"My dear friend, we have only just begun! And
here are you talking of ending it! I have had
enough of it, I assure you, for morn, noon, and
night, that brandy-bottle does nothing but talk to
me about it! I had to promise him at last that
I would see you, so here I am! But I can tell you
not to talk on his side! There is only one person,
Uncle Isidoro, who can really put a stop to this
scandalous business, and that is Giovanna herself.
You must go to her, and tell her to make that beast
shut up. I can do nothing more."</p>

<p>Isidoro gazed at him with wide, unseeing eyes;
he appeared not to be listening. Presently he resumed
his work, murmuring: "Poor Costantino!
poor lamb! What have they done to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, he is innocent," said Giacobbe.
"And any day at all he may come back! This craze
of Brontu's has got to be stopped. Then there is
Aunt Bachissia as well, hovering over her like a
vulture over its prey!"</p>

<p>"Poor Costantino! poor lamb! What have they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
done to you?" repeated Isidoro, paying not the
smallest heed to anything that Giacobbe said. The
latter became annoyed. Raising his voice until it
echoed through the surrounding silence and solitude,
he shouted: "What <i>have</i> they done to him?
What are they <i>going</i> to do to him? Why don't
you listen to what I am telling you, you old rag-heap?
You must go and talk to her, right away!
There she is, cheerful and rosy, and ready to fall
at the first touch, like a ripe apple! At heart,
though, she is not bad, and if you will predispose
her against it&mdash;make her see what she ought to do&mdash;the
whole thing may be prevented. Get up! get
along! move! do something! Here is your chance
to perform miracles, if you really are a saint, as the
sinners seem to think!"</p>

<p>"Ah! ah! ah!" sighed the old man, rising to
his feet. His tall figure, majestic even in its rags,
stood out in the crimson light, against the background
of dark hedge and distant, misty horizon,
like that of some venerable hermit. "I will go,"
he said, sighing heavily. And at the words Giacobbe
felt as though a great weight had been rolled
from his breast.</p>

<p>From then on, the two men worked, steadily together
in the interest of the far-away prisoner,
finding themselves opposed, however, by three active
and united forces, as well as by the passive resistance
of Giovanna. The three forces against which they
had to contend were: the brute passion of Brontu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the grasping greed of Aunt Bachissia, and Aunt
Martina's self-interest, she being now wholly in favour
of Brontu's scheme. Giovanna, she argued,
was, though poor, both healthy and frugal, and she
knew how to work like a beast of burden. A woman
in good standing coming into the house as a bride,
might entail all manner of extravagance and outlay,
and the wedding alone would be sure to mean
a heavy expense. Whereas, in the case of Giovanna,
the marriage would be conducted almost
in secret, and she would steal into the house like a
slave! Shrewd Aunt Martina!</p>

<p>Thus the months rolled over the little slate-stone
village, the desolate mountains, the yellow stretch
of uplands. Autumn came&mdash;soft, melancholy days,
when the sea lay beneath a veil of mist on the horizon,
and dark clouds, like huge crabs, travelled
slowly across the pale sky, trailing long lines of
vapour behind them. Sometimes, though, it would
turn cold, and the atmosphere would be like a spring
of limpid water, fresh, clear, and sparkling.</p>

<p>On such an evening as this, when a long, violet-coloured
cloud hung in the eastern heavens like an
island in a crystal sea, and the scent of burning
thyme came from the fields which the peasants were
making ready for sowing, Brontu would swallow
great gulps of brandy to take off the evening chill,
and then, throwing himself down in the back of
the hut, would lie dreaming, as warm and happy
as a cat, his eyes fixed on the violet-coloured cloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
on the distant horizon. All about the cabin, in
every direction, as far as the eye could reach,
stretched the broad <i lang="it">tancas</i> of the Dejases, billowy
undulations, losing themselves in the fading daylight.
Here and there amid the golden-brown stubble
were dark squares of newly-turned earth,
swollen by the rain, and patches of fresh grass and
purple, autumnal flowers sending out a damp perfume.
Clouds of wild birds, and large crows as
black and shining as polished metal, poured out of
the clumps of <i lang="it">assenzio</i>, which, half-hidden among
the wild roses and the clustering arbute with its
shining leaves and yellow berries, looked like <i>tumuli</i>
of ashes.</p>

<p>In one of the <i lang="it">tancas</i> two peasants, farm hands of
the Dejases, were burning brush preparatory to
ploughing for the wheat and barley crops. The
flames crackled as the wind blew them hither and
thither, pale yet, in the evening light, and transparent
as yellow glass, the smoke hanging over them
in low, light clouds, like fragrant incense, then melting
away. Along the tops of the hedges enclosing
the sheepfolds, each bare, thorny twig seemed to
stand out separately in the crystal atmosphere, like
a tracery of amethyst-coloured lace. The animals
had all been herded for the night, except a few
horses which could be seen here and there, with
noses to the ground, cropping the short grass.</p>

<p>From without the hut came the sound of Giacobbe's
voice, then the faint tinkle of a cowbell; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
prolonged, far-away howl of a dog; the harsh
screaming of a crow.</p>

<p>Within, extended like a Bedouin on a pile of skins
and warm coverings, Brontu dreamed his one, unvarying
dream, while the fiery liquor, coursing
through his veins, filled him with a delicious sense
of warmth and comfort.</p>

<p>Ah, how the young proprietor did love brandy!
Not so much for its penetrating odour and sharp,
biting taste, as for that glowing sensation of happiness
that stole over his heart after drinking it. But
woe betide any one who meddled with him at such
times! Instantly his mood would change, and the
sweetness turn to gall. It seemed to him that dogs
must feel just as he did then, when some one tramples
on their tails as they lie asleep. He would
arouse in a state of fury, and lose the thread of
his dream.</p>

<p>Yes, he loved brandy; wine was good too, but
not so good as brandy. His father before him had
liked ardent spirits; so much so, in fact, that one
day, after drinking heavily, he fell into the fire and
was so badly burned that&mdash;Heaven preserve us!&mdash;he
died of the effects! But there! enough of such
melancholy thoughts! Nowadays people are more
careful, they don't allow themselves to tumble into
the fire! Moreover, to balance the passion for
brandy, Brontu had his other passion, for Giovanna.
Ah, brandy and Giovanna! The two most beautiful,
ardent, intoxicating things in the whole world! But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
where Giovanna was concerned Brontu was as timid
and fearful as he was reckless in the matter of
brandy. He trembled merely at the thought of approaching
her&mdash;of speaking to her. On those days
when he knew that she was working for his mother
he fairly yearned to go home, to gaze at her, to
see her working there in his own house, and yet
he dared not stir from the <i lang="it">tanca</i>! Now, though,
as time went on, he was growing weary of waiting;
a devouring anxiety, moreover, had seized upon
him. What if, by hesitating so long, he were to
meet with another refusal! Tormented by this
thought, he longed to tell her of his solicitude for
her; how, in order to console her for all that had occurred,
he would gladly have married her at once,
immediately after Costantino's sentence! His ideas
differed from those of most people, but he was made
that way and could not change. At bottom, like
most drunkards, he had not a bad heart, nor was
he immoral: his one passion, apart from drink, had
always been for Giovanna, ever since when, as
a boy, he had come with his family to live in the
house on the hill. She was only fifteen then, and
very fresh and beautiful. Every time he looked at
her, even in those days, he had flushed even to his
hands, and though she had noticed it, she had not
seemed to mind. He never said anything, though,
and so at last, when one day he screwed up his
courage to the point of persuading his mother to
go to Aunt Bachissia with an offer of marriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
it was too late, the position had been filled! Giovanna,
at that time, had been as spirited and passionate
as a young colt, and as utterly indifferent
to worldly considerations. She might have married
Brontu Dejas at first for his beautiful teeth,
but having once fallen in love with Costantino, she
would not have thrown him over for the Viceroy
himself, had Sardinia still possessed one.</p>

<p>The twilight deepened; the sky grew more and
more crystalline, like a vast mirror; the little, violet
cloud grew leaden and opaque, then long and scaly,
like some monster fish; the sounds from without,
rising clearer than ever in the intense stillness of the
hour and place, it seemed to Brontu that he must
be dreaming when the voice of Aunt Bachissia suddenly
broke in upon his revery.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it">Santu Juanne Battista meu!</i>" exclaimed the
harsh, melancholy voice. "If I am not mistaken,
that is Giacobbe Dejas?"</p>

<p>"At your service," replied the herdsman, in a
tone of amazement. "But what wind blows you
to these parts, little spring bird?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I am here at last! Where is Brontu Dejas?"</p>

<p>Brontu rushed out of the hut, his knees shaking
and his brain in such a whirl that he could hardly
discern Aunt Bachissia's black-robed figure as she
stood holding her shoes in one hand, and balancing
a bundle on her head.</p>

<p>"Aunt Bachissia!" he cried, in great agitation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
"Here I am! Good-evening! Come here, come
right in here!"</p>

<p>The woman flew towards him, closely followed
by the herdsman. "Ah, Brontu, my dear boy! If
I am not dead to-night, it must mean that I never
shall be! Three hours I have been walking! I lost
my way. I must see you about something, but be
patient for a moment."</p>

<p>Patient! With his whole being in such a state
of turmoil that he could hardly keep back the tears!
Taking her by the hand he led her inside the hut,
while Giacobbe, seeing that he was to have no part
in the interview, went around to the back and listened
with all his ears, raging meanwhile, inwardly,
like a wild bull. Not a word, however, reached him.
The conference was extremely short, Aunt Bachissia
refusing even to sit down. She said that she had
lost her way looking for Brontu's sheepfolds, and
that Giovanna would be getting very anxious, as
she thought she had merely gone into the fields to
look for greens. Yes, it was quite true, they had to
depend largely upon greens for their food, so bitter
was their poverty: and what had brought her now
was nothing less than to ask Brontu for some
money. Oh, a loan! yes, thank Heaven, only a loan!
If they should not be able to repay it, then she and
Giovanna would work it off. For months they had
not paid any rent&mdash;rent&mdash;! for their own house&mdash;!
Now, the lawyer was threatening to evict them.
"And where would we go, Brontu Dejas?" concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Aunt Bachissia, clasping her gnarled and
yellow hands. "Tell me where we would go,
Brontu, my soul!"</p>

<p>His breast heaved; he wanted to seize the old
woman in his arms, and shout: "Why, to my house;
that is where you would go!" But he did not dare.</p>

<p>As there was no money at the hut Brontu decided
to go home for it at once; he wished, anyhow, to
return with Aunt Bachissia. Going outside, he
called to Giacobbe to saddle the horse immediately.
"What has happened?" asked the man. "Is your
mother dead? God rest her soul!"</p>

<p>"No," replied Brontu cheerfully. "Nothing has
happened that in any way concerns you."</p>

<p>Giacobbe began saddling the horse, but he was
consumed with curiosity to know why Aunt Bachissia
had come, and why Brontu was going back with
her. She has come to borrow some money, he reflected,
and he has none; he is going home to get
it for her. "Listen, Brontu!" he called, and when
the other had come quite close, he said: "If she
wants money, and you haven't got any here, I can
let you have some."</p>

<p>"Yes, she does; she wants to borrow some
money," said Brontu in a low tone, quivering with
delight and excitement. "But I am going back
with her to get it, whether you have it here or not;
that makes no difference; I am going to see Giovanna
this very evening, at her own house; I am
going to talk to her and do for myself what not one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of all you donkeys has had sense enough to do for
me!"</p>

<p>"Man!" cried Giacobbe angrily, "you must be
going mad!"</p>

<p>"All right; let me go mad. See here, draw the
girth tighter. Ah! swelling out your sides, are
you?" he added, addressing the horse. "You don't
fancy night excursions? What will you say when
the old woman is mounted on the crupper?"</p>

<p>"She too?" exclaimed Giacobbe.</p>

<p>"She too, yes; what business is it of yours? Isn't
she my mother-in-law?"</p>

<p>"You go too fast, upon my word! Look out, or
you will have a fall and break your neck, little spring
bird. Ah! you are really in earnest? You really
mean to marry that beggar, that married woman,
when you might have a flower for your wife? Well,
I can tell you one thing, Costantino Ledda is innocent;
some day he will come back, remember that;
some day he will come back!"</p>

<p>"Let me alone, Giacobbe Dejas, and attend to
your own affairs. There, put a bag on the crupper.
Aunt Bachissia!" he called to the old woman.</p>

<p>Giacobbe ran quickly into the hut, and fell over
Aunt Bachissia, who was just coming out.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself," he said,
trembling. "You are worse than any beggar! Oh,
I'm going to talk to Giovanna! I am going to talk
to her myself!"</p>

<p>"You are a fool," said the woman; then, lowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
her voice, she called him by an outrageous name,
and passed out.</p>

<p>A few moments later the two set forth.</p>

<p>Giacobbe watched them as they slowly moved
away in the fading light, across the solitary <i lang="it">tanca</i>:
further and further, along the winding path, beyond
the thickets, beyond the clumps of bushes, beyond
the smoke of the brushwood fires; until, at last,
they were lost to sight. Then an access of blind
fury seized him; clutching the cap from his head,
he flung it from him as far as he could; then
picked it up again, and fell to beating the dog. The
poor beast set up a prolonged howl that filled the
silent waste, and was echoed back again with a
sound like the despairing cry of some wandering
phantom.</p>

<p>Night fell. Giacobbe, throwing himself down on
the paillasse which Brontu had quitted shortly before,
smelled an odour of brandy; he got up, found
his master's flask, and drank. Then he lay down
again, and presently he too felt something bubble
up in his breast, bathe his heart, scorch his eyelids,
mount gurgling to his brain. His anger melted
suddenly away and was replaced by a feeling of
melancholy. Through the open door he could see
the bright red glow of the brush fires gradually
overpowering the fading twilight; as the two merged
they formed a single hue of violet, indescribably
melancholy in tone. Now and again the dog gave
another long howl. Oh! what misery, what misery!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Why had he, Giacobbe, beaten that poor dog?
What had it done to him? Nothing. He was filled
with remorse, the foolish, emotional remorse of the
drunkard; yet, so irritating were the sounds that
he had a strong impulse to rush out and beat the
unfortunate beast again.</p>

<p>All at once his mind recurred to Brontu and Aunt
Bachissia, whom he had forgotten for the moment,
and he began to tremble violently. What had happened?
Had Giovanna given in? Ah! what made
that dog bark like that? It was like the shriek of
a dead person,&mdash;the voice of Basile Ledda, who was
murdered! "Pooh, pooh, the dead cannot cry out.
That is nothing but the howling of a dog." He
laughed softly, drowsily, to himself; his heavy eyelids
closed, shutting out the opaque, violet-coloured
mist that hung like a curtain before the open door;
he felt as though a sack filled with some soft but
heavy substance were pressing down upon him, so
that he could not move; yet the sensation was agreeable.
A thousand confused images chased one another
through his brain. Among other things he
dreamed that he was dead, and that his soul had
entered into the body of a dog, a gaunt, little yellow
cur, who was running around and around Aunt Bachissia's
kitchen searching for bones. Costantino
was sitting by the fire; he was dressed in red,
and there was a great chain lying at his feet; all
at once he saw the dog, and flung the chain at it.
The creature's head was caught fast, encircled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
one of the iron rings, and Giacobbe, stricken with
terror, forced himself to cry out, in order to make
them understand it was he. He awoke, perspiring
and shouting: "Little spring bird!"</p>

<p>Night had fallen; the deserted <i lang="it">tanca</i>, stretching
away beneath a clear sky sparkling with big, yellow
stars, glowed with the red light of the brush fires.</p>

<p>Giacobbe could not get to sleep again; he turned
and twisted from one side to the other, but the intoxicating
effects of the brandy had passed, leaving
his mouth dry and feverish. He got up and drank;
then he remembered that he had taken nothing to
eat that evening. For a long time he stood leaning
against the door of the hut, his face lighted up by
the glow of the fires. "Shall I get something to
eat or not?" he asked himself, hardly conscious that
he did so. Then he looked up at the stars. Almost
midnight. What had that little beast&mdash;his master&mdash;accomplished?
he wondered, and his anger rose
again, but chiefly against Aunt Bachissia. What
impudence to come all the way to this distant spot
just to further the little proprietor's outrageous
plans! For he knew perfectly well that the loan
was merely an excuse of that old harpy to draw
Brontu on, to bring him to a decision, to make him
commit himself. Ah, what a low creature that
woman was! Had she no conscience at all? Did
she not believe in God? At this point Giacobbe
grew thoughtful, and presently he threw himself
down again, still debating whether or no he were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
hungry, and whether it were worth while to get
something to eat. No, he decided; he was not hungry,
nor thirsty, nor sleepy; nor could he rest; lying
down, or sitting up, or standing. He yawned noisily
and began talking aloud, mumbling foolish, disconnected
things, in a vain effort to distract his
thoughts, which, however, continued to dwell persistently
upon <i>that thing</i>. It was horrible, horrible!
Marry a woman who had another husband already!
And suppose Costantino should come back? Who
knows? Everything is possible in this world. And
even if he were never to return, there was the boy,
how about him? What would he think when he
grew up and found that his mother had two husbands?
What a law that was! "Ha! the men who
make the laws are pretty queer!" And Giacobbe
laughed mirthlessly, for, down in the bottom of his
heart, his inclination was to do anything else but
laugh.</p>

<p>Getting up, he seized the brandy-flask, saying to
himself that if Brontu should display any curiosity
as to who had drunk his brandy, why so much the
worse for him. "I'll tell him it was the spirits!
Ha, ha!" He laughed again, took a deep draught,
and, throwing himself down, quickly fell into a
heavy sleep, and dreamed that he was telling a sister
of his all about his other dream of Costantino, and
the yellow dog, and the chain.</p>

<p>When he awoke the sun was already above the
horizon, pushing through a bank of bluish cloud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
The morning was cold, with light, drifting clouds,
and the thickets, bushes, stubble, every spear of
grass, sparkled with dew in the slanting rays of the
sun. Once more the birds bustled in and out among
the bushes, burst into song, rushed together in little
groups, or poised gracefully in the misty air. Now
and then the chorus of chirps and twitters would
swell into something so acute and piercing that it
was almost like the patter of metal raindrops: sometimes
a shrill whistle, or the strident note of a crow,
would break into this silvery harmony; then all
would die away, swallowed up in the vast silence of
the uplands.</p>

<p>Giacobbe came out of the hut yawning and stretching.
He yawned so violently that his jaws cracked,
and his smooth-shaven face folded into innumerable
tiny wrinkles about the round, open mouth; and his
little, oblique eyes, yellow in the sunlight, watered
like those of a dog. "Well," he thought, pressing
both hands to his stomach, "I have cramps here.
What did I do last evening?"</p>

<p>He threw open the folds; a ram with curved horns
came out, snuffing the ground, closely followed by
a yellowish bunch of sheep, all trying to tread in
his tracks, and all likewise snuffing the ground;
others came, and still others; the folds were empty;
still Giacobbe stood close to the enclosure&mdash;motionless&mdash;buried
in thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, last evening I had nothing to eat. I drank
the little master's brandy, and then I had dreams.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Yes, yes, that was it&mdash;Costantino&mdash;and the dog&mdash;and
my sister Anna-Rosa. Well, damn him! Why
didn't he come back, the little toad? I got drunk,
just like a beast. Yes,"&mdash;he moralised, walking towards
the hut,&mdash;"a drunken man is like a beast; he
does not know what he is doing, and brays out
everything in his mind. A dangerous thing that,
Giacobbe Dejas, you bald-pate! Get that well into
your head; it's dangerous. No, no, I'll never get
drunk again; may the Lord punish me if I do."</p>

<p>A little later the young master returned. Giacobbe,
intent and smiling, watched him closely.
"Ah!" said he, stepping forward solicitously, "you
look like a man who has had a whipping; what
has happened?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Get away."</p>

<p>But nothing was further from the other's intention.
He began to circle around his master, fawning
upon him and making little bounds towards him
like a dog, teasing persistently to be told what had
occurred. At last Brontu, who really longed to
unburden himself, yielded.</p>

<p>Well then, yes; Giovanna had, in fact, driven him
away like an importunate beggar. She had asked
him if he had forgotten that she had a son who
would one day spit at her, and demand to know
how it was that she had two husbands.</p>

<p>"My soul, I knew it!" cried Giacobbe, leaping
in the air for joy.</p>

<p>"What did you know?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, that she had a son."</p>

<p>"Well, I knew that myself. She chased me out
of the house; that's the whole of it. I could hear
the two&mdash;the mother and daughter&mdash;from the road,
quarrelling furiously together." And then Brontu
went to look for his brandy-flask.</p>

<p>Giacobbe was so overjoyed that he could have
laughed aloud for glee.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he called. "The spirits came last
night and drank your brandy. Ha! ha! ha! but
there must be some left; I am sure there is still some
left."</p>

<p>Brontu drank eagerly without making any reply.
Then he flung the flask angrily at the herdsman,
who caught it in the air; and Brontu, having drunk
for sorrow, Giacobbe proceeded to drink for joy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h3>


<p>One morning, about three years after his conviction,
Costantino awoke in a bad humour.
The heat was oppressive, and the air of the cell was
heavy and sickening. One of the prisoners was
snoring and puffing like a kettle letting off steam.</p>

<p>Costantino had slept with Giovanna's last letter
beneath his head, and a sad little letter it was; short,
and depressing in the extreme. She told of her
and her mother's dire poverty, and of the boy's serious
illness. It never occurred to Costantino to reflect
how cruel it was to write to him in this strain;
he wanted to know the truth about them, however
bad it might be, and he felt that to share all Giovanna's
sorrows and to agonise over his inability to
help her was a part of his duty. A barren duty,&mdash;alas!&mdash;merely
an increase of his misery.</p>

<p>He had become quite deft at his trade of shoemaking,
and worked rapidly, but he could make very
little money; all that was left, however, after the
<i>King of Spades</i> had been paid for his supposed good
offices he sent to Giovanna.</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said the ex-marshal, "you
are a goose. Spend it on yourself. They ought
to be sending you money."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"But they are so poor."</p>

<p>"Poor! Not they; haven't they got the sun?
What more do they want?" said the other. "If
you would only eat and drink more it would be a
real charity. You are nothing but a stick, my dear
fellow. Look at me! I'm getting fat. My bacon
may be all rind, but, all the same, I'm getting fat."</p>

<p>He was, in fact, as round as a ball, but his flesh
hung down in yellow, flabby rolls. Costantino, on
the other hand, had fallen away, his eyes were big
and cavernous, and his hands transparent.</p>

<p>The sun! he thought to himself bitterly. Yes,
they have indeed got that; but what good is the sun
even, when one has nothing to eat, and is suffering
every kind of privation? He was, no doubt, a great
simpleton, but as he thought of these things, he
sometimes cried like a child. Yet all the time he
never gave up hope. The years passed by; day followed
day slowly, regularly, uneventfully, like drops
of water in a grotto, dripping from stone to stone.
Almost every convict in the prison, especially those
whose terms were not very long, hoped for a remission,
and kept close count of the days already elapsed
and of those yet to come. Their accuracy was
amazing; they never made a mistake of so much as
a single day. Some even carried their calculations
so far as to count the hours. Costantino thought
it all very foolish; one might die in the mean time,
or regain his liberty! It was all in the hands of
God. Yet, all the same, he too counted on being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
freed before the appointed hour; only in his case the
appointed hour was so desperately, so hopelessly
far away!</p>

<p>This realisation was heavy upon him on that
morning when he awoke and fingered the warm
paper of Giovanna's last letter.</p>

<p>Getting up, he sighed heavily, and began to dress
himself. The man on his right stopped snoring,
opened one sleepy eye, regarded Costantino dully,
then closed it again. "Feeling badly?" he asked,
as Costantino sighed again. "Oh, yes! Your child
is ill. Why don't you tell the Director?"</p>

<p>"Why should I tell the Director? He would
clap me into a cell for receiving the letter, and that
would be the whole of it."</p>

<p>"Except <i lang="it">pane e pollastra</i>" (bread and water),
said an ironical voice.</p>

<p>There was a general laugh, and Costantino, realising
bitterly the utter indifference of all those men
among whom he was destined to pass his days, felt
as though he were wandering alone in a burning
desert, gasping for air and water.</p>

<p>He went to his work longing impatiently for the
exercise hour, when he would be able to talk over
his troubles with the <i>King of Spades</i>. The great,
fat, yellow man whom he despised so in his heart,
was, nevertheless, indispensable to him; his sole
comfort, in fact. He alone in that place understood
him, was sorry for him, and listened to him. He
was paid for it all, to be sure, but what did that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
signify? He was necessary in the same way to a
great many of the convicts, but to none, probably,
as much as to Costantino, who already, with a somewhat
selfish regret, was dreading the time when,
his term expired, the <i>King of Spades</i> would finally
depart.</p>

<p>On this particular day a new inmate made his
appearance in the workroom. He was a Northerner;
long and sinuous, with a grey, wrinkled face,
and small, pale eyes. It was not easy to tell his
age, but the men laughed when he announced himself
as twenty-two. He began at once to complain
of the heat and of the sickening smell of fish that
filled the room. Ah, he was no cobbler; no, indeed!
He was the only son of a wealthy wholesale shoe-dealer,&mdash;a
gentleman, in fact. And thereupon he
recounted his unfortunate history. He had, it appeared,
been so unlucky as to kill a rival in love;
there had been provocation and he had ripped him
open in the back,&mdash;simply that! The woman who
was the real cause of the crime had consumption,
and now she was dying from grief,&mdash;dying, simply
that! Moreover, there was a child in the question,
a son of the prisoner's by the sick woman. If
she died, the boy would be left orphaned and abandoned.
Costantino trembled at this; not, indeed,
that the man's story affected him particularly, but
because the picture of the woman and the child reminded
him of Giovanna and the sick Malthineddu.</p>

<p>The newcomer, who was cutting a pair of soles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
with considerable skill, now became silent, and bent
over, intent upon his work, his under lip trembling
like that of a child about to cry. Costantino, watching
him, reflected that though he knew that this
man must be suffering intensely he felt as indifferent
as did any of the others: he too, then, had lost the
power of sympathising with the sorrows of others!
The thought filled him with dismay and made him
more insanely anxious to get out than ever.</p>

<p>That day, as soon as he saw the <i>King of Spades</i>,
he drew him over to a corner where the sun-baked
wall cast a little spot of shade; but when he had
got him there he could not bring himself to begin
on his own troubles. Instead he repeated the story
told by the new arrival. The other shrugged his
shoulders and spat against the wall.</p>

<p>"If he wants to, even he can write," he said.
"But I should advise prudence, some one is nosing
about."</p>

<p>"How are we ever going to manage after you
have gone?" said Costantino thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You would like to keep me here forever, you
rascal?" demanded the other in a rallying tone.</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid! No, indeed; I only wish you
might get out to-morrow!"</p>

<p>The <i>King of Spades</i> sighed. His enemies, he
declared, were forever devising new and diabolical
schemes for keeping him out of the way; he
had abandoned all hope now of a pardon. In any
case, however, his term would expire before long;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
then he would go at once to the King, and lay a
plain statement of the facts before him. The King
would order an instant reversal of the verdict, and
he himself, his innocence finally established, would
be restored to his post. Who could tell, there might
even be another medal conferred, to keep the rest
company! But his first care would be to obtain
pardons for all his friends, especially for Costantino.
"That would be a noble work," he observed,
self-approvingly. Indeed, by virtue of making such
assurances frequently, he had come actually to believe
in them himself.</p>

<p>"To-morrow? Yes, indeed; a pardon might very
possibly come to-morrow, and a good thing that
would be for every one."</p>

<p>"Good, or bad," said Costantino despondently.</p>

<p>"After all," continued the other, "when I am
gone it may be that you will no longer have any
use for my services."</p>

<p>The moment the words were out of his mouth he
regretted having spoken, but seeing that Costantino
merely shook his head, evidently supposing that he
alluded to a possible pardon, he regarded him compassionately.</p>

<p>"Are you really and truly innocent?" he asked.
"By this time I should think you would be willing
to talk to me quite openly. Do you remember that
first time when I asked you? You said: 'May I
never see my child again, if I am guilty.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, so I did; and now, you mean to say, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
am perhaps not going to see him again? Well,
God's will be done; but I am innocent, all the same."</p>

<p>The <i>King of Spades</i> turned, and again spat upon
the wall. "Patience, old fellow, patience, patience,"
he said; and there was a note of real warmth and
feeling in his tone. He felt, in fact, quite proud of
himself for recognising and esteeming honesty
when he saw it in others, and it was this taste that
drew him to Costantino. He saw with wonder that
his fellow-countryman was so good, that his soul
was so pure, and his whole nature formed of so
fine a material, that even the boundless corruption
of prison life could not sully him.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the ex-marshal allowed
himself&mdash;as one of the privileges of his position of
go-between&mdash;to read the letters that passed through
his hands. Not long before, an anonymous letter had
come for Costantino, written in a villainous hand,
with great sprawling characters that looked like insects
crawling over the page. Venomous creatures
they proved, indeed, to be, and capable of inflicting
wounds as deadly as those of any living reptile.
In short, the letter announced that Giovanna, wife
of the prisoner, was permitting Brontu Dejas to pay
court to her, and that Aunt Bachissia was about to
go to Nuoro to consult a lawyer about applying for
a divorce for her daughter.</p>

<p>On reading this precious communication the ex-marshal
became furious; his friend, the <i>Delegate</i>,
immersed as he was in his great scientific researches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
heard him snorting, and puffing out his fat, yellow
cheeks. "Idiots! Fools! Sardinian asses!" he
sputtered. "Why on earth tell him about it at all!
What can he do, except batter out his brains against
the wall?"</p>

<p>He did not deliver the letter, and every time he
saw his friend he regarded him compassionately,
feeling at the same time pleased at his own goodness
of heart for caring so much.</p>

<p>Three days later the boy died. Costantino was
notified immediately of the event. He wept silently
and by stealth, trying hard to bear up with fortitude
before his companions. When Arnolfo Bellini,
the man whose mistress was dying, heard of the
Sardinian's misfortune, he fell into a fit of nervous
weeping, emitting curious noises like an angry
hen, his grey, old-young face doubling up in such
grotesque contortions that one of the quarrelsome
brothers from the Abruzzi burst out laughing; one
of the others leaned across and punched him in the
leg with an awl, whereupon the Abruzzese started,
ceased laughing, and continued his work without
protest.</p>

<p>Costantino, after staring a moment at Bellini in
amazement, shook his head and turned to his bench.
Silence reigned, and presently the man calmed down.</p>

<p>The low room was filled with the hot, reflected
glare from the courtyard, and the overpowering heat
drew a sickening odour from the leather and the
perspiring hands and feet of the convicts. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
were thirteen of them under the surveillance of a
tall, red-moustached guard, who never opened his
lips. The uniformity of dress, the close-cropped
heads and shaven faces, and the general vacuity of
expression lent them all a certain mutual resemblance;
they might have been brothers, or at least
nearly related to one another, and yet, never more
than on that particular day, had Costantino felt
himself so utterly apart, so wholly out of sympathy
with his companions in misery.</p>

<p>He stitched and stitched, bending over the shoe,
which rested between his knees in the hollow of
his leather apron. From time to time he would
pause, examine his work attentively, then go on
again drawing the thread through with both hands
with a jerk that seemed almost angry. Yes, one
must work, now that the boy was dead. Had he
loved him very dearly? Well, he could hardly say;
perhaps not so very much. He had only seen him
once during that time at Nuoro, through the iron
grating of the reception-room, held fast in the arms
of his weeping mother. The baby, he remembered,
had a little pink face, somewhat rough and scarred,
like certain kinds of apricots when they are ripe.
His round, violet-coloured eyes shone like a pair of
grape seeds from beneath their long fringe of lashes.
He had cried the whole time, terrified at the sight
of the stern-faced, rigid guards; and grasping the
iron bars convulsively with his little red hands.</p>

<p>This was the only memory Costantino had pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>served
of his son. Years had gone by since then;
yet he always imagined him flushed, tearful, with
little violet eyes shining out from beneath the dark
lashes. But he often pictured the future, when Malthineddu,
grown to be big and strong, would drive
the wagon, and ride the horse, and sow, and reap,
and be the comfort and support of his mother. The
prisoner constantly hoped that some day or other
he would be cleared, and able to return to his home,
but when at times this hope seemed to be more than
usually vain, then his thoughts would instantly revert
to the boy, and how he would be able to take
his place in a way; thus his feeling for him was
more a part of his love for Giovanna than that more
selfish affection which is the result, often, of habit
and propinquity.</p>

<p>Now the boy was dead, and the dream shattered;
the will of God be done. And Costantino, dwelling
upon Giovanna's grief, suffered himself, acutely.</p>

<p>When the <i>King of Spades</i>, accordingly, met his
friend that day in the shadow of the sun-baked wall,
he at once perceived that the other's grief was far
more for his wife than for the loss of the child;
nevertheless, his method of imparting comfort was
to say banteringly: "Why, my dear fellow, if, as
you say, the Lord has taken the innocent little soul
back to himself, why do you take it so much to
heart? It must be for his own good!"</p>

<p>"Why must it?" said Costantino, his head drooping,
and both arms hanging down with limp, open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
palms. "Why must he be better off? Simply because
he was poor!"</p>

<p>The <i>King of Spades</i> happened to be in a philosophising
mood. He explained, therefore, that poverty
was not always a misfortune; nothing of the
sort; it might at times be looked upon as a blessing,
even an unqualified one!</p>

<p>"There are many worse things than poverty,"
said he. "Reflect for a moment; your wife will
become reconciled."</p>

<p>"Oh! of course; she has the sun," said Costantino,
clenching his hands. "This burning sun, and
just how is it going to help her?"</p>

<p>"Pff! pff! pff!" puffed the other, inflating his
big, yellow cheeks. Then he grew thoughtful, and
fell to examining the little finger of his right hand
with minute attention.</p>

<p>"Suppose," he said suddenly, "your wife were
to marry again?"</p>

<p>Costantino did not quite take in what he meant,
but his arms stiffened instinctively.</p>

<p>"I hardly should have thought," said he in a
hurt tone, "that you would say such a thing as
that."</p>

<p>"Pff! pff! pff!" The ex-marshal swelled and
puffed meditatively. Then, after a short pause, he
began again:</p>

<p>"But listen, my dear fellow, you don't understand.
I don't for a moment mean to say that your
wife is not a perfectly honest woman; what I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
mean is&mdash;suppose she were actually to marry some
one else? And still you don't understand? Upon
my word, this Christian is extraordinarily slow at
taking an idea! One would suppose you were free,
you are so innocent. Perhaps, though," he added,
"you don't know that people can get divorces nowadays.
Any woman whose husband has been sentenced
for more than ten years, can be divorced and
marry some one else."</p>

<p>Costantino threw his head up for a moment, and
his sunken eyes opened round and wide; then the
lids dropped again.</p>

<p>"Giovanna would never do it," he said simply.</p>

<p>There was another brief interval of silence.</p>

<p>"Giovanna would not do it," he repeated; yet,
even as he pronounced the words, he had a strange
sensation, as though a frozen steel were slashing
his heart in twain; one part was convulsed with
agony, while the other shrieked again and again:
"She would never do it! she would never do it!"
And neither part gave a single thought to the little,
dead child.</p>

<p>"She would not do it, she would not do it," reiterated
one half of his heart with loud insistence,
until, at last, the other was convinced, and they
came together again, but only to find that both were
now devoured by that torturing pain.</p>

<p>"See here," said the <i>King of Spades</i>, "I don't
believe she would either. But tell me one thing;
now that the child is dead, and now that the mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
has nothing more to hope for, from either him or
you, would it not, after all, be the very best thing
she could do, supposing she had the opportunity?
For my own part, I think that if a chance came
along for her to marry again, she would be very
foolish not to take it."</p>

<p>"Brontu Dejas!" said Costantino to himself.
But he only repeated: "No, she would not do it."</p>

<p>"But you are a Christian, my friend; if she were
to do it, would she not be in the right?"</p>

<p>"But I am going back some day."</p>

<p>"How is she to know that?"</p>

<p>"Why, I have told her so all along, and I shall
never cease telling her so."</p>

<p>The <i>King of Spades</i> had a strong inclination to
laugh, but he restrained himself, feeling quite
ashamed of the impulse. Presently he murmured,
as though in answer to some inward question: "It
is all utter foolishness."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said Costantino. But all the
time, he was thinking of Brontu Dejas, of his house
with the portico, of his <i lang="it">tancas</i> and his flocks; and
then of Giovanna's poverty. Alas! the knife was
cutting deep into his heart now.</p>

<p>That very night he wrote a long letter to Giovanna,
comforting her, and assuring her of his unshaken
faith in the divine mercy. "It may be,"
he wrote, in the simple goodness of his heart, "that
God wishes to prove us still further, and so has
taken from us the offspring that we conceived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
sin; may his will be done! But now, a presentiment
tells me that the hour of my restoration to liberty
is at hand." He considered long whether or no
to tell her of the <i>dreadful thing</i> hinted at by the
ex-marshal, and thought himself quite shrewd and
cunning when he decided it would be better to let
her think that he did not so much as know of the
existence of that infernal law.</p>

<p>His letter despatched, he felt more tranquil. But
a little worm had begun to gnaw and gnaw in his
brain. The ex-marshal, moreover, from that day
on, with a pity that was heartless in its operations,
never ceased to instil the subtle poison into his veins.
He must become accustomed to the idea, thought
this diplomatist to himself, else the poor, simple
soul will die of heartbreak. There were times, however,
when he thought that it might be better, after
all, to let him die, and have done with it. Then,
remembering all his promises about obtaining a
pardon, he would pretend to himself that he was
really going to do this, and continue the torture
so that his victim might survive the shock when
news of the divorce actually came. He had no
doubt that his friend's wife was seriously contemplating
the step, and it made him angry to hear
Costantino speak affectionately of her.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said he one October day, puffing
as usual, "you don't know women. Empty
jugs, that's what they are; nothing but empty jugs!
I was once engaged to be married myself. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
can hardly believe it? Well, I can hardly believe
it either. What then? Nothing, except that she
betrayed me before I had even married her, and&mdash;that
you irritate me beyond measure. Here is your
wife in an altogether different situation; she is
young and poor, and has blood in her veins&mdash;she
has blood in her veins, I suppose, hasn't she? Well,
if this Dejas fellow wants her to marry him, I say
she would be a great goose not to do it."</p>

<p>"Dejas! Why&mdash;what&mdash;who told you?" stammered
Costantino in amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh! didn't you tell me yourself?"</p>

<p>Costantino thought he most certainly had not,
but then his mind had been in such a confused state
for some time back&mdash;but merciful God! Dear San
Costantino! How had he ever come to do such
a thing? What had made him utter that man's
name?</p>

<p>"Well, then," he burst out; "yes, I am afraid of
him! He courted her before we were married; he
wanted her himself. Ugh! he's a drunkard, and
as weak as mud. No, no; she could never do anything
so horrible! For pity's sake, let's talk of
something else."</p>

<p>So they did talk of something else, still in the
Sardinian dialect, so as not to be understood by the
other prisoners. They talked of the consumptive
student, who was drawing visibly nearer to the door
of the other world; of Arnolfo Bellini, who began
to sob whenever his eye fell on the dying man; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the <i>Delegate</i>, whom they could see pacing back and
forth by the fountain; of the magpie, who was
growing feeble, and losing all his feathers, from old
age.</p>

<p>Gossip, envy, hatred, identical interests, cowardice,
raillery, fear&mdash;such were the bonds which united
or kept apart the different members of the little
community&mdash;prisoners, guards, and officials alike.
To Costantino they were all equally objects of indifference;
he, the <i>Delegate</i>, and the student seeming
to live apart in a little world of their own, with
the ex-marshal&mdash;the pivot about which every detail
in the prisoners' lives seemed to revolve; he, meanwhile,
appearing to be as superior as he was necessary
to them all.</p>

<p>Many envied the friendly intercourse existing between
Costantino and him, and frequently the former
would be implored to use his influence with the <i>King
of Spades</i> to procure some favour. He merely
shrugged his shoulders on such occasions, though,
when they offered him money, as sometimes happened,
he was sorely tempted to take it, so intense
was his longing to be able to support Giovanna;
he had no other idea. The <i>King of Spades</i>, with
his eternal insinuations that cut like knives, was
becoming more and more hateful to him. One day
they actually quarrelled, and for some time did not
speak to one another. But Costantino could not
stand it; he felt as though he should suffocate, as
though he had been shut up in a cell, and cut off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
from all communication with the outer world. He
soon apologised and begged for a reconciliation.</p>

<p>The autumn drew on; the air grew cool, and the
sky became a delicate, velvety blue, distant, unreal,
dreamlike. Sometimes the breeze would waft a
perfume of ripening fruit into the prison enclosure.</p>

<p>Costantino was less acutely miserable, but he
had sunk into a state of settled melancholy; he grew
thinner and thinner, and deprived himself continually
of things which he stood in need of in order
to have more money to send to Giovanna. The
other prisoners all received presents of some sort
from their friends and relatives; he alone denied
himself even the little pittance he was able to earn.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," said the ex-marshal to
him one day. "Your complexion is pink and you
look younger than you did when you came, and
yet you are almost transparent."</p>

<p>Sometimes Costantino would flush violently, and
the blood would rush to his head; then he would
be utterly prostrated, and in his weakness he would
suffer more from homesickness than he had done
even in the first year of his imprisonment. He
would see before him the boundless sweep of the
uplands, sleeping in the autumnal haze, glowing
and yellow beneath the crystal sky; he would get
the breath of the vineyards, the scent of such late-maturing
fruits as flourish in that land of flocks and
beehives; images would rise before him of the foxes
and hares, the wild birds and cattle, the hedges thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with blackberries, all the hundred and one natural
objects which had constituted the sole element of
enjoyment in his otherwise miserable and barren
childhood. Then his thoughts would turn to his
uncle, the cruel old Vulture who, having tormented
him in his lifetime, seemed able to torment him still.
An impulse of bitter hatred would rise up in his
heart, only to be repressed, on remembering that
he was dead, and succeeded by a prayer for the
murdered man's soul.</p>

<p>There was no one else whom he was even tempted
to hate, no one at all; not even the real murderer,
or Brontu Dejas&mdash;who, in fact, had as yet given
him no cause for complaint&mdash;or the <i>King of Spades</i>,
though he subjected him to this continual martyrdom.
Indeed, it hardly seemed as though he had
sufficient strength effectually to hate any one. A
feeling of gentle melancholy pervaded him, a sort
of numbness like that of a person about to fall
asleep; his only sensation was one of tender, pitiful,
passionless love; as tranquil, as mild and all-embracing
as an autumnal sky, and having for its one
object&mdash;Giovanna. She was a part of the love itself,
and waking or sleeping, he thought only of
her, only of her, only of her.</p>

<p>As time went on this love became more and more
engrossing; she came to represent the far-off home,
family, liberty&mdash;life itself. All, all, was comprehended
in her: hope, faith, endurance, peace, the
very love of life! She became his soul.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>When the inexorable <i>King of Spades</i> threatened
him with <i>that horrible thing</i>, he did not know it,
but it was the death of his soul that he was holding
over him. For the certainty of not losing Giovanna,
Costantino would gladly have agreed to pass
forty years in prison; and, at the same time, he
panted for his freedom precisely in order that he
might not lose her.</p>

<p>During the winter that followed, he suffered intensely
from cold; his face and nails were livid, and
during the exercise hour, even when he stood in the
sun, his teeth chattered like those of an old man.
He asked often to confess, and confided all his
troubles to the young chaplain.</p>

<p>"Who puts such ideas as these into your head,
my son?" asked the confessor, his dark eyes flashing.</p>

<p>"A fellow-countryman of mine, the ex-marshal&mdash;Burrai.
The <i>King of Spades</i> they call him."</p>

<p>"May God bless and protect you!" said the other,
becoming thoughtful; he knew the <i>King of Spades</i>
well. Then he administered what comfort he could,
and asked what Giovanna had written herself, and
when.</p>

<p>Alas! she wrote but seldom now and never more
than a few lines at a time. It seemed almost as
if, after the child's death, she had nothing to write
about. In her last letter she had told him that the
weather was bitterly cold; there had been two snow-storms,
in one of which a man, while attempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to cross the mountains, had been frozen to death.
And then she had added that they were having a
famine.</p>

<p>These accounts, of course, preyed upon Costantino's
mind. He would dream constantly that he
had been taken to Nuoro and given his liberty; from
thence he would set forth on foot for home; it was
cold, bitterly cold; he could go no further&mdash;he was
dying, dying&mdash;then he would wake up shivering,
and with a heavy weight on his heart.</p>

<p>"You are so weak, my brother," said the confessor.
"It is bodily weakness that makes you
imagine all these things. Your wife is a good
Christian; she would never wrong you in the world.
Come, put all such ideas out of your head. You
should try to get back your strength; you must
eat more, and drink something now and then. Are
you earning anything?"</p>

<p>"A little; but I send it all to my wife, she
is so terribly poor. Oh! I eat plenty, and I
don't like to take anything to drink; it gives me
nausea."</p>

<p>"Well, take heart. I will talk to Burrai; he shall
not bother you any more."</p>

<p>He did, in fact, have an interview with the <i>King of
Spades</i>, and took him severely to task for putting
such wicked ideas into Ledda's head. "The poor
fellow is far from strong as it is," said he. "If
you don't let him alone, he will be ill."</p>

<p>Burrai regarded the priest calmly out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
shrewd little pig-eyes, then he gave a puff and shook
his head.</p>

<p>"I only do it for his own good," he said confidently.</p>

<p>"But what good, what possible good? You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you, my dear fellow&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;but
here it is, for the present&mdash;as long as the
cold weather lasts&mdash;there is very little to be feared,
so far as the young woman is concerned; that is,
I fancy that now it is only the old one, Costantino's
mother-in-law, who is at work, advising and
tormenting her daughter not to let her chance slip
by. But when the spring comes&mdash;then you'll see;
that's all."</p>

<p>The chaplain's face fell; he was disturbed and
puzzled. The other, watching him out of his sharp,
little eyes, concluded that the present would be a
good time to explain himself more fully, and accordingly
began to enlarge upon the mother-in-law's
grasping disposition, the youth of her daughter, the
dangers of the spring season, and so forth. The
chaplain now became really angry.</p>

<p>"This is too much!" he exclaimed, as he strode
up and down, striking the palms of his hands together,
and his eyes flashing. "How dare you
imagine all this string of things that may possibly
happen, and then repeat them to that poor creature
as though they were actual occurrences? Because
the young woman once had another suitor, you
mean to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear friend, there is no need to get so angry,"
said the other. "Here, look at this," and he
showed him the anonymous letter.</p>

<p>The chaplain saw at once that the matter was
more serious than he had supposed; he read the
letter, and then asked if Ledda paid him money.</p>

<p>"Of course, a trifle now and then. Perhaps you
think it wrong? Well, don't I take the risk of
being put in a cell in order to serve him?"</p>

<p>"And you consider that you are doing right when
you act in this manner?"</p>

<p>"What is doing right? If it is helping your
neighbour, then I most certainly think that I am."</p>

<p>The chaplain re-read the letter attentively.</p>

<p>"Yes," pursued the other. "I certainly am.
And what is more, if, when I get out of here, they
don't reinstate me in my position, I intend to arrange
a system of correspondence for all the prisons
in Italy. It will be a sort of agency&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see, my friend, that it will not be long before
we have you back again."</p>

<p>"Eh! eh! I shall know how to manage the thing;
a secret agency, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardons too!" said the priest, folding the letter
and returning it. "How can you have the heart
to fool those poor creatures so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, pardons too," replied Burrai calmly.
"Well, and suppose they are fooled; if it gives them
any comfort to hope, is not that an act of kindness
in itself? What is there for any of us, but hope?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said the other more mildly, "at least do
me the favour to leave that poor fellow alone. Allow
<i>him</i> to enjoy the pleasures of hope, otherwise
he will certainly fall ill."</p>

<p>The ex-marshal promised, though with bad grace.
It seemed to him a poor method.</p>

<p>"He will die of heartstroke, I verily believe," he
said to himself. "Wait till the spring; then we will
see whether a man of the world knows what he is
about or no." And he laid one hand on his breast.</p>

<p>When they next met, Costantino asked with a
smile if he had seen <i lang="it">Su Preideru</i>, as they called
the chaplain between themselves, and what he had
said to him.</p>

<p>The ex-marshal was leaning against the damp and
dingy wall, softly cursing some individual unknown,
in the Sardinian dialect.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it">Balla chi trapasset sa busacca, brasciai!</i>" (I
wish a ball would hit him in the pouch, the he-wolf!)
he murmured, as Costantino approached. "What
is it? Who?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing."</p>

<p>"You want to know if I have seen the priest?
Yes, and he scolded me like a child. What a child
it is! A little pig, really and truly, a little pig!
But the lard is yellow and rancid. Do you know,
I read somewhere that in Russia they think very
highly of rancid lard?"</p>

<p>"But tell me what he said."</p>

<p>"What he said? Let me see, what did he say?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
I don't remember; oh! yes, he told me that I had
imagined all that&mdash;what we have been talking about.
Yes, that was it, my dear fellow; I have, it seems,
a vivid imagination, and your wife will never wrong
you in the world! Never, as surely as we are
standing here!"</p>

<p>Costantino looked at him eagerly. No, the man
was not chaffing; he was perfectly serious, and evidently
meant what he said.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! he scolded you, did he? Good
enough!" he cried.</p>

<p>"This wall," said the <i>King of Spades</i>, straightening
himself, and regarding his hands, which were
red and scarred from contact with the rough stones,
"this wall looks as though it were made of chocolate;
it is warm and damp. Ah! if it only were,
there would be two advantages: we could eat it,
and then escape! Have you ever eaten any chocolate?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, and Giovanna too; she is very
fond of it, but it is fearfully dear. Well, and what
then?"</p>

<p>"What then?" exclaimed the other impatiently.
"My dear fellow, you drive me crazy. Oh! she will
wait for you twenty-three years&mdash;never fear!"</p>

<p>"No, not that long; I shall be out of here long
before that," replied Costantino confidently. "Then
too," he added with a gleam of humour, "there is
the pardon; you were to see the King, you know,
about a pardon for me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>"Precisely," said the other. "I was to see the
King. You don't believe me? I shall, however,
go to him at once; he receives every official, and
what am I if not an official? He is fond of the
army; he is young; I hear he is getting fat. Ah!
not as fat as I, though"&mdash;and he laughed.</p>

<p>From then on, whenever Costantino tried to
bring the conversation around to the old subject,
the other contrived to head him off; but at all events
he was no longer tormented.</p>

<p>One day about this time, Costantino was informed
that five francs had been paid in to his account.
"He did it!" he exclaimed. "I am sure it was the
priest. What a kind man he is! But I don't need
it; no, indeed, I don't need the money at all."</p>

<p>"You stupid," said the <i>King of Spades</i>. "Take
it; if you don't he will be offended. 'I don't want
it!' A pretty way that to acknowledge a present!"</p>

<p>"But I should be ashamed to take it. And what
could I do with it, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Why, eat, drink&mdash;you have need to, I can assure
you. You would like to send it home, I suppose?
The devil take you! If you do such an idiotic thing
as that I will spit in your face! Why, see here,
she doesn't even write to you any more; she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is there for her to write about?" said
Costantino, trying vainly to think of some excuse.
"Besides," he added, "she will be working now,
the winter is nearly over."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is nearly over, and then the spring will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
come," said the other in a tone that had almost a
menace in it. "It will come."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, it will come!"</p>

<p>"When does the warm weather begin with you?
We have it in March."</p>

<p>"Oh, with us, not till June. But then it is so
beautiful. The grass grows&mdash;oh! as tall as that,
and they clip the sheep, and the bees are making
honey!"</p>

<p>"An idyl, truly! You don't know what an idyl
is? Well, I'll tell you. It is&mdash;sometimes it is&mdash;infidelity.
Wait till June. How long is it since
you've been to confession?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've not been for a fortnight."</p>

<p>"A long time, I declare! What a good Christian
you are, my friend. For my own part, I've
never been at all. My conscience is as clear and
unsullied as a mirror. Now there," said he, pointing
to the pasty-faced student, whose hair was so
white that it looked as though it had been powdered,
"there is one who had better confess without
delay; he is knocking now at the door of eternity."</p>

<p>Sure enough, only a few days later the student
was removed to the infirmary, and at the end of
March he died.</p>

<p>Bellini, the man whose mistress was dying of the
same disease, asked after him anxiously every day,
and when he died cried for hours in a weak, childish
fashion. It was not from any grief he felt at
parting from the sick man, but at the thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
what might happen to his mistress. His grief subsided
at length, and then, as he no longer had the
reminder of the student before his eyes, he gradually
came to think less and less about his own sorrow.</p>

<p>The death of the student had a totally different
effect upon the <i>King of Spades</i>; he became quite
melancholy, took to philosophising about life and
death, and would engage in lengthy discussions with
the <i>Delegate</i>, who rolled his eyes about and expounded
his views in a deep bass voice.</p>

<p>When talking with Costantino, the ex-marshal
was apt to drop into rather homesick reminiscences
about the distant land of their birth.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he one day, "I was once quite close
to your home, or its neighbourhood. I can't tell you
precisely, but I know there was a wood, all arbute,
and cork-trees, and rock-roses; it looked as though
there had been a rain of blood all over them. And
there was a smell&mdash;oh! the queerest kind of smell,
it was something like tobacco. Then there was a
cross on a stone, and you could see the water far
away in the distance."</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" cried Costantino. "That was
the forest of <i>Cherbomine</i> (Stagman). I should say
I did know it. Once a hunter saw a stag there with
golden horns. He fired, and shot it dead, but as
the stag fell it gave a cry like a human being, and
said: 'The penance is completed!' They say it
was some human soul that had been forced to ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>piate
a terrible sin of some sort. The cross was
erected afterwards."</p>

<p>"And how about the horns?"</p>

<p>"They say that as the hunter drew near the horns
turned black."</p>

<p>"Pff! pff! how superstitious you all are, you peasants!
Ah! here is the spring coming at last," he
continued, staring up at the sky. "For my own
part, the spring gets on my nerves. If I could
but go hunting once. There was one time when
I was hunting in the marshes near Cagliari: ah!
those marshes, they look just like ever so many
pieces of looking-glass thrown down from somewhere
above; and all around there were quantities
of purple lilies. A long line of flamingoes were
flying in single file; they stood out against the sky
which was so bright you could hardly raise your
eyes to it. Pum! pum! one of the flamingoes fell,
the others flew on without making a sound. I
rushed right into the middle of the marsh to get
the one I had shot. I was as quick and agile as
a fish in those days; I was only eighteen years old."</p>

<p>"What are flamingoes good for?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; they stuff them; they have great, long
legs like velvet. Have you ever been in that part
of the country? Oh! yes, I remember, when you
worked in the mines, you passed through Cagliari.
I shall go back there some day, to die in blessed
peace!"</p>

<p>"You are melancholy nowadays."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"What would you have, my friend? It is the
spring; it is so depressing to have to pass Easter
in prison. I shall take the Easter Instruction this
year."</p>

<p>"I have taken it already."</p>

<p>"Ah! you have taken it already?" And the two
prisoners fell into a thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>Thus April passed by, and May, and June. The
dreary prison walls turned into ovens; unpleasant
insects came to life, and once more preyed upon the
unfortunate inmates; again the air was filled with
sickening odours, and in the workroom, presided
over by the same red-faced, taciturn guard, perspiration,
fish, and leather fought for pre-eminence in
the fetid atmosphere.</p>

<p>Costantino, weaker than ever, suffered tortures
from the insects. In former years he had slept so
profoundly that nothing could disturb him, but now
it was different, and a sudden sting would arouse
him with a bound, and leave him trembling all over.
Then insomnia set in, and periods of semi-consciousness
that were worse than actual sleeplessness,
haunted, as they sometimes were, with nightmare.
Sharp twinges, not always from insects, shot through
his entire body, and he would toss from side to side,
gasping and sighing.</p>

<p>Sometimes the torture became almost unendurable,
and often the orange glow of sunrise would
shine through the window before he had been able
to close an eye; then, overpowered by exhaustion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
he would fall into a heavy slumber just as it was
time to get up!</p>

<p>Giovanna had now entirely ceased writing. Once
only, towards the end of May, a letter had come,
begging him not to send her any more money, as
she now earned enough to live on, with care. After
that there was nothing more.</p>

<p>And yet he maintained his tranquil faith in her
loyalty. Even this last letter he took as a fresh proof
of her affection for him.</p>

<p>Every day the <i>King of Spades</i>, waiting for his
friend in the exercise hour, would betray a certain
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Well," he would say uneasily, his sharp little
demon-eyes snapping from out of the big, clean-shaven,
yellow face. "Well, what news?" And
when Costantino would seem to be surprised at the
question, he too would look surprised, though he
never would say at what.</p>

<p>"It is warm weather," he would observe.</p>

<p>"Yes, very warm."</p>

<p>"The spring is over."</p>

<p>"I should say that it was!"</p>

<p>"Have they finished harvesting where you come
from?"</p>

<p>"Of course they have. My wife says there is no
need to send her anything more now."</p>

<p>"Ah! I knew that already, my dear fellow."</p>

<p>The ex-marshal hardly knew what to think; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was almost annoyed to find that his forebodings
were not being verified.</p>

<p>One day, however, Costantino failed to put in
an appearance at the "exercise," and when the ex-marshal
was told that his friend had been taken
to the infirmary, he felt a strange tightening at the
heart. Presently the old magpie came fluttering
about, and, settling down with a shake of its half-bald,
rumpled head, croaked out dismally: "Cos-tan-ti,
Cos-tan-ti."</p>

<p>"'Costanti' has had a stroke, my friend," said
the <i>King of Spades</i>. The other convicts began to
crowd around him curiously. But he waved them
all off. "I know nothing about it," he said. "Let
me alone." Up to nine o'clock, Bellini told them,
Costantino had been at work with the rest as usual.
Then a guard had said that he was wanted, no
one knew what for; he had gotten quickly up, and
gone off with him, as white as a sheet, and his
eyes starting out of their sockets; he had not returned.</p>

<p>To the last day of his life Costantino never forgot
that morning. It was hot and overcast; the shadows
of the clouds seemed to hang over the workroom,
throwing half of it into deep gloom. The convicts
all looked livid by this light, the leather aprons
exhaled a strong and very disagreeable odour, and
every one was out of humour. A man who was
afraid of ghosts had been telling how in his part
of the country, long, white, flowing forms could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
be seen on dark nights, floating on the surface of
the river; he asked Bellini if he had ever seen
them.</p>

<p>"I? No; I don't believe in such foolishness."</p>

<p>"Ah! you think it's foolishness, do you?" said
the other in a dull, monotonous tone, and staring
into the shoe he was at work on.</p>

<p>"Calf!" murmured another, without looking up
from his work.</p>

<p>The believer in ghosts thereupon raised his head
with an angry movement, and was about to reply in
kind, when the first broke in, protestingly: "Oh,
really," said he, "can't I talk to myself? If I
choose to say&mdash;calf,&mdash;or ram,&mdash;or sheep,&mdash;or dog,&mdash;what
business is it of yours? Can't I say things
to my shoe, I'd like to know?"</p>

<p>It was at this point that the guard had come, and
called Costantino away, and the latter, who had
passed a sleepless night, had opened his drowsy
eyes, turned pale, and leaped to his feet. "Who
wants me?" he had asked, and then he had followed
the guard.</p>

<p>He was taken to a dingy room, filled with shelves
of dusty papers. The dirty windows were closed;
beyond them, through a red grating, could be seen
the sky&mdash;dull and grey, as though it too were dirty.
A man was seated writing, at a tall, dusty desk,
piled so high with papers that between the papers
and the dust the man himself could hardly be seen.
As the prisoner entered he raised a flushed face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the small chin completely hidden by a heavy, blond
moustache. He fixed a pair of big, round, dull-blue
eyes upon Costantino, but apparently without
seeing him, for he dropped them again immediately,
and went on writing.</p>

<p>Costantino, who had seen this man before, stood
waiting, his heart thumping in his breast. Mechanically
his thoughts dwelt upon the description of
the water-phantoms he had just been listening to,
and the voice saying: "calf"; he wondered vaguely
if one would be justified in feeling angry at that.
Not a sound broke the stillness of the room, except
the scratch, scratch, of the pen, as it travelled over
the coarse paper. Again the pale blue eyes were
fixed upon the prisoner, and again lowered to the
sheet. Costantino, trembling and unnerved, gazed
desperately around the room. Still the man wrote
on. The prisoner could feel his heart beating furiously;
a thousand dark fancies, hideous, terrifying,
rushed through his brain, like clouds driven before
an angry tempest. And still the man wrote on, and
on. Suddenly, without warning, all the dark fancies
vanished,&mdash;dispersed and swallowed up, as it were,
in a single glorious flood of light. A thought, so
dazzling and beautiful as almost to be painful, shot
into his mind. "They have discovered that I am
innocent!"</p>

<p>The idea did not remain for long, but it left
behind it a vague, tremulous light.</p>

<p>The man was still writing, and did not stop as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
presently said in a loud, hard voice: "You are
named&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Costantino Ledda."</p>

<p>"Where from?"</p>

<p>"Orlei, in Sardinia, Province of Sassari."</p>

<p>"Very good."</p>

<p>Silence. The man wrote a little while longer;
then suddenly he dug his pen into the paper, raised
his red face, and fastened his round, expressionless
eyes upon the man standing before him. Costantino's
own eyes dropped.</p>

<p>"Very good. Have you a wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Any children?"</p>

<p>"We had one, but he died."</p>

<p>"Are you fond of your wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Costantino, and raised his terrified
eyes as far as the fat, red hand resting on the
desk, with a ring on one finger having a purple
stone; and between the thumb and forefinger, the
stiff, black point of the pen. Not knowing where
to fix his perplexed gaze, Costantino followed the
movements of this pen, conscious all the while only
of a feeling of supreme agony, as when one dreams
that he is about to be swallowed up in a cataclysm.</p>

<p>The hard voice was speaking again, in a low,
measured tone.</p>

<p>"You know, of course, that your wife's whole
life has been ruined by your fault. Young, handsome,
and blameless, the rest of her days must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
spent in struggle and privation. The world holds
out no promise of happiness for her, and yet she
has never done any harm at all. As long as your
child lived she endured her lot patiently, her hopes
were fixed upon him. But now that he is dead
what has she left? When you return to her,&mdash;if,
indeed, God should be so merciful as to allow you
to do so,&mdash;you will be old, broken-down, useless,
and she will be the same. She sees stretching before
her a terrible future&mdash;nothing but sorrow,
shame, poverty, and a miserable old age. No resource
but to beg; thus her life is a worse punishment
even than yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Costantino, as white as death, panting, agonising,
tried to protest, to say that he would surely be liberated
before long, but the words died away on his
lips; the other, meanwhile, gave him no chance,
but pursued his theme in smooth, even tones, his
dull eyes never leaving the prisoner's face.</p>

<p>"Her life is thus a worse punishment even than
yours. You should think of these things, and, abandoning
all hope, repent doubly of your crime." He
cleared his throat, and then continued in a different
tone: "Now, however, the law has provided a means
by which this great injustice can be rectified. You
of course know very well that an act of divorce has
gone into effect which enables a woman whose husband
is guilty of a certain class of crime, to marry
again. Should your wife&mdash;sit down, keep quiet&mdash;should
your wife apply for such a divorce, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
be your duty to grant it at once. I know that you
are, or pretend to be, after all, a good Christian&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Costantino, who was leaning on the table, shaking
in every limb, but making a heroic effort to
control himself, now broke in. "Has she applied
for it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sit down there," said the other, motioning
with his pen; he wanted to continue his
harangue, but Costantino again spoke, in a clear,
firm voice that contrasted strangely with the trembling
of his limbs. "I know my duty perfectly," he
said, "and I shall never give my consent. I shall
undoubtedly be freed before very long, and then
my wife would bitterly repent of her mistake."</p>

<p>Two deep wrinkles furrowed the red cheeks of
the lecturer, and an ugly smile shone from his dull
eyes.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" he said. "Well, the consent of the
prisoner is asked merely as a formality. It is, of
course, his duty to give it, and his good-will counts
for something in his favour. But it all comes to
the same thing, whether he gives it or no&mdash;Eh,
there! what&mdash;why&mdash;what is the matter?" For
Costantino had given a sudden lurch, and collapsed
on the floor like a bundle of limp rags.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h3>


<p>Nineteen Hundred and Ten. In the
"strangers' room" of the Porru house,
Giovanna was looking over some purchases made
that day in Nuoro. She was stouter than ever, and
had lost something of her girlish look, but, nevertheless,
she was both fresh and handsome still. She
examined the pieces of linen and woollen stuff attentively,
turning them over and over and feeling
them with a preoccupied air, as though not altogether
satisfied with the selection; then, folding
them carefully, she wrapped them in newspaper and
laid them away in her bag.</p>

<p>These things were the materials for her wedding
outfit, for, having at last obtained her divorce,
she was shortly to marry Dejas. She and
her mother had come to Nuoro for the express
purpose of making the purchases. The money had
been borrowed with the utmost secrecy from Aunt
Anna-Rosa Dejas, Giacobbe's sister, who had always
taken a particular interest in Giovanna because
of having been for a short time her foster-mother.
It was the dead of winter, but the
two women had courageously defied the fatigues
and discomforts of the journey in order to lay in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
a supply of linen, cotton, kerchiefs, and woollen
stuffs. The ceremony, a purely civil one, was to
be conducted in the strictest privacy, more so, even,
than on the occasion of a widow's marriage. But
this made no difference to Aunt Bachissia, who was
determined that her daughter should enter her new
home fitted out in every respect like a youthful bride
of good family.</p>

<p>The country-side was still wondering and gossipping
over the scandalous affair, and it was rumoured
that another couple contemplated applying for a
divorce&mdash;by mutual consent. A great many people
already looked askance at the Eras, and some said
that Brontu had evil designs upon Giovanna. Giacobbe
Dejas, Isidoro Pane, and a number of other
friends had stopped going to the house after making
final scenes that were almost violent. Giacobbe had
snarled like a dog, and had used prayers and even
threats in a last, vain effort to dissuade Giovanna
from the step, until Aunt Bachissia had, at length,
driven him out. Even Aunt Porredda at Nuoro,
although it was her son who had obtained the divorce
for Giovanna, had received her friends with marked
coolness. The "Doctor," as she called her son, was,
on the contrary, most cordial and attentive in his
manner towards their guests.</p>

<p>So Giovanna was folding up her possessions in
a thoughtful mood, her preoccupation having, however,
to do solely with those bits of stuff. The linen,
it appeared, was somewhat tumbled; the fringe of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the black Thibet kerchief, with its big crimson
roses, was too short; one piece of ribbon had a spot
on it,&mdash;worrying matters, all of them.</p>

<p>Night was falling&mdash;like that <i>other time</i>&mdash;but the
surroundings, and the weather, and&mdash;her heart,
were all, quite, quite different. The "strangers'
room" now had a fine window, through whose
panes shone the clear, cold light of a winter evening.
The furniture, all entirely new, exhaled a powerful
smell of varnished wood, while its surface glistened
like hoarfrost. The door opened on the same covered
gallery, but new granite steps now led down
to the courtyard. The "Doctor's" practice was
growing, and the entire house had been done over.
He now had an office in the busiest part of the town,
and was much in demand both for civil and penal
processes. The most desperate cases, the worst
offenders, all that class of clients who have the least
to hope from the law, entrusted their affairs to him.</p>

<p>Giovanna folded, wrapped, and packed her possessions,
and then, the bag being somewhat over-full,
she shook it vigorously to make the contents
settle down; this accomplished, she turned with
knitted brows, and slowly descended the outer stair,
both hands thrust deep in the pockets always to be
found just below the waist in the skirt of a Sardinian
costume.</p>

<p>It was an evening in January, clear but extremely
cold. Some silver stars, set in the cloudless blue of
the sky, seemed to tremble in the frosty atmosphere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Crossing the courtyard Giovanna could see, through
the window of the lighted dining-room, Grazia's
pale face and great, eager eyes as she sat turning
over the leaves of a fashion paper. The child had
developed into a tall and pretty girl; she was dressed
in the latest fashion, with great lace wings extending
from the shoulders behind the arms; they obliged
their wearers to walk sideways through any narrow
aperture, but made them look, by way of compensation,
like so many angels before the fall.</p>

<p>Grazia, seeing the guest, smiled at her without
getting up, and the latter entered the kitchen.</p>

<p>Here, too, everything was new; the white walls,
the stove of glistening bricks, the petroleum lamp
hanging from the ceiling. It was all so gorgeous
that Aunt Bachissia could not refrain from gazing
about her the whole time, her shining, little, green
beads of eyes, snapping and sparkling in the sallow,
hawklike face, set in the folds of a black scarf. She
at least, was unchanged&mdash;the old witch! She was
seated beside the servant-maid, a dirty, dishevelled
young person, whose loud and frequent laugh displayed
a set of protruding teeth. Aunt Porredda
was cooking, and scolding the maid for this annoying
habit of hers. Only fancy! Here was the mistress
doing the cooking, while the servant sat by the
stove and&mdash;laughed! What kind of way to do was
that? And, moreover, the good woman could never
have one single moment's peace, and she the mother
of a famous lawyer!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>Giovanna seated herself at some little distance
from the stove, stooping over with her hands still
buried in the pockets of her skirt.</p>

<p>"Just look!" exclaimed Aunt Bachissia in a tone
of envy. "This kitchen might be a parlour! You
must do <i>your</i> kitchen up like this, Giovanna."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the young woman absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>"Yes? Well, upon my soul, I should say so!
Godmother Malthina is close, but you have got to
make her understand that money is meant to spend.
A kitchen like this&mdash;why, it is heaven&mdash;upon my
soul! This is living."</p>

<p>"What do you always say 'upon my soul' for?"
asked the giggling servant-maid.</p>

<p>"If she doesn't choose to spend her money, how
am I to make her?" said Giovanna with a sigh.</p>

<p>The servant was still laughing, but Aunt Porredda,
who wanted to keep out of her guests' conversation,
turned on her, and sharply ordered her
to grate some cheese for the macaroni. The girl
obeyed.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?" asked Aunt Bachissia
as Giovanna sighed again.</p>

<p>"She remembers!" said Aunt Porredda to herself.
"After all, she is a Christian, not an animal,
and she can't help herself!"</p>

<p>But Giovanna spoke up crossly:</p>

<p>"Well, it's just this; they've cheated us. That
is not good linen, and the ribbon is spotted. Oh!
it is too much."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Upon my soul!" said the maid, mimicking
Aunt Bachissia's voice and accent, and grating away
vigorously on the cheese.</p>

<p>Aunt Porredda thereupon let out upon her all the
vials of wrath she would fain have emptied upon
her guests, calling her by all the names which, in
her secret heart, she was applying to Giovanna&mdash;"shameless,"
"vile," "ungrateful," "despicable,"
and so on, and threatening to strike her over the
head with the ladle. In her terror, the girl grated
the skin off one finger, and she was in the act of
displaying it with the blood streaming down when
the lawyer-son limped briskly into the room. He
was enveloped in a long, black overcoat, so full
that it looked like a cloak with sleeves. His smooth,
fresh-coloured little face beamed with the self-satisfied
expression of a nursing child. Asking immediately
what there was to eat, he dropped into a
seat beside Aunt Bachissia, and sat there chatting
until supper was ready. After him the little Minnia
came running in, rosy, breathless, and dishevelled,
and threw herself down by the servant-maid. The
boy had died three years earlier. The little girl's
dress, of black and red flannel, was pretty enough,
but her shoes were torn and her hands dirty. She
had spent the entire day tearing around in a neighbouring
truck-garden, and began to pour out confidences
to the servant in an eager undertone.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul!" repeated the servant, in the
same tone as before.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Next Uncle Efes Maria's big face, with its thick,
wide-open lips, appeared in the door, wanting to
know why they could not have supper right away.</p>

<p>The dining-room was now furnished with two tall,
shining cupboards of varnished wood, and the whole
apartment had quite an air of elegance&mdash;strips of
carpet on the stone floor, a stove, and so on. Poor
Aunt Porredda, with her big feet and hobnailed
shoes, never felt really at home there; while Uncle
Efes Maria had not yet cured himself of the habit
of staring proudly around him. Grazia, tall and elegant,
always withdrew into herself when her relations
came into this room, where she passed most of her
time eagerly devouring the <i>Unique Mode</i>, the <i>Petite
Parisienne</i>, and the fashion articles of a family
journal,&mdash;sufficiently immoral in its tone, since it
fomented such unhealthy dreams in her foolish head.
Ah, those low-cut gowns, covered with embroidery;
those scarfs worked in gold; those bodices with
their great wings of silver lace, the rainbow hues,
the spangles glittering like frost! Ah, those hats
covered with artificial fruits, and the long flower
boas, and petticoats trimmed with lace at thirty lire
a yard, and the painted gloves, and fans made of
human skin! How beautiful it all was,&mdash;horribly,
terrifyingly beautiful! Merely to read about these
things gave her a sort of spasm, they were so beautiful,
so beautiful, so beautiful. And afterwards,
how ugly and common and flat everything seemed,&mdash;the
simple old grandmother, with her fat, wrin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>kled
face; and the dull grandfather, gazing about
him with such ignorant satisfaction and pride! It
was all simply stultifying.</p>

<p>Just as on that other, far-away evening, Aunt
Porredda came in, bearing triumphantly the steaming
dish of macaroni, and all the members of the
party seated themselves around the table. Aunt
Bachissia, finding herself in the shadow, so to speak,
of Grazia's wings, forthwith broke anew into loud
exclamations of wonder and admiration, this time
<i>à propos</i> of those glorious objects:</p>

<p>"No, we have never seen anything like that in
our neighbourhood, but then, we have no ladies
there. Here they all look like angels, the ladies."</p>

<p>"Or bats," said Uncle Efes Maria. "Eh, it's
the fashion, my dears. Why, I remember when I
was a child the ladies were all big and round; they
looked like cupolas. There hardly were any ladies
in those days,&mdash;the Superintendent's wife, the family&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then that thing behind," interrupted Aunt
Porredda. "Oh! I remember that, it looked like
a saddle. Well, if you'll believe me, upon my word
and honour, I remember one time some one sat
down on one of them."</p>

<p>"The last time we were here," said Aunt Bachissia,
"those wings were little things; now they
are growing, growing."</p>

<p>Grazia sat eating her supper as though she did
not hear a word of what the others were saying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
The "Doctor" eat his too&mdash;like a gristmill&mdash;staring
at his niece all the while with the look of a
pleased child. "Growing, growing," said he.
"The next thing we know they'll all take flight."</p>

<p>Grazia shrugged her shoulders, or rather her
wings, and neither spoke nor looked up. She frequently
found her uncle,&mdash;that hero of her first,
young dream,&mdash;very trying, and worse than trying&mdash;foolish!
It was the common talk of the town
that the uncle and niece were going to marry, and
he, when interrogated on the subject, would answer
neither yes nor no.</p>

<p>The conversation continued for some time on
impersonal topics. Every now and then Aunt Porredda
would get up and pass in and out of the room,
and occasionally the talk would die away, and long
pauses ensue that were almost embarrassing. Like
that <i>other time</i> every one instinctively avoided the
subject uppermost in the minds of the guests; who,
on the whole, were just as well pleased to have it
so. But, just as before, it was Aunt Bachissia, this
time without intending to, who introduced the unwelcome
topic. She asked if the report that the
"Doctor" was to marry his niece were true
or no.</p>

<p>The Porrus looked at one another, and Grazia,
bending her head still lower over her plate, laughed
softly to herself.</p>

<p>Paolo glanced at the girl, and, with an irony that
seemed a little forced, replied:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh, no! She is going to marry the Very Right
Honourable Sub-Prefect!"</p>

<p>Grazia raised her head with a sudden movement
and opened her lips, then as quickly lowered
it, the blood meanwhile rushing up to her forehead.</p>

<p>"Oh! he's old," said Minnia. "I know him;
he's always walking about the station. Ugh! he
has a long, red beard, and a high hat."</p>

<p>"A high hat too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a high hat&mdash;a widower."</p>

<p>"The high hat is a widower?"</p>

<p>"You shut up!" said the child sharply, turning
on her sister.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not going to shut up. He's a Freemason;
he won't have his children baptised, or be
married in church. That's the way of it; he'll not
marry in church."</p>

<p>"The young lady is well informed," said Uncle
Efes Maria, polished as usual.</p>

<p>Thereupon Aunt Porredda, who had almost
shrieked aloud at the word "Freemason," waved
both arms in the air, and burst out:</p>

<p>"Yes, a Freemason! One of those people who
pray to the devil. Upon my word, I believe my
granddaughter there would just as leave have him!
We are all on the road to perdition here, and why
not? There's Grazia, forever reading bad books,
and those infernal papers, till now she doesn't want
to go to confession any more! Ah, those prohib<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>ited
books! I lie awake all night thinking of them.
But now, this is what I want to say: Grazia reads
bad books; Paolo,&mdash;you see him, that one over
there, Doctor Pededdu,&mdash;well, he studied on the
Continent where they don't believe in God any more;
now that's all right, at least, it isn't, it's all wrong,
but you can understand a little why those two poor
creatures have stopped believing in God. But the
rest of us, who don't know anything about books
and who have never in our lives ridden on a rail-road,&mdash;that
devil's horse,&mdash;why should <i>we</i> cease to
believe in God, in our kind Saviour, who died for
us on the cross? Why? why? tell me why. You
there, Giovanna Era, tell me why you should be
willing to marry a man by civil ceremony when
you already have a husband living?"</p>

<p>The final clause of Aunt Porredda's oration fell
with startling effect upon her audience. Grazia,
who, with a smile upon her lips, had been busily
engaged in rolling pieces of bread into little pellets,
raised her head quickly, and the smile died away;
Paolo, who, likewise smiling, had been fitting the
blade of a knife in and out of the prongs of his
fork, straightened himself with a brusque movement;
and Uncle Efes Maria turned his dull, round
face towards Giovanna, and fixed her with an impassive
stare.</p>

<p>Giovanna herself, the object of this wholly unlooked-for
attack, though she flushed crimson, replied
with cynical indifference:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"I haven't any husband, my dear Aunt Porredda.
Ask your son over there."</p>

<p>"My son!" exclaimed the other angrily. "I
have no son. He's a child of the devil!"</p>

<p>It almost seemed as though Giovanna had succeeded
in throwing the responsibility of her act upon
Paolo, because he had won her case for her!</p>

<p>Every one laughed at Aunt Porredda's outbreak,
even Minnia, and the servant who entered the room
at that moment, carrying the cheese. Notwithstanding
her wrath, Aunt Porredda took the dish
and handed it politely to her guests.</p>

<p>"Upon my soul," said Aunt Bachissia, carefully
cutting herself a slice, and speaking in a tone of
gentle melancholy, "you are as good as gold, there
is no doubt about that, but&mdash;you live at your ease,
you have a house like a church, and a husband like
a strong tower [Uncle Efes Maria coughed], and
you have a circle of stars about you&mdash;motioning
towards them&mdash;so it is easy enough to talk like that.
Ah! if you knew once what it meant to be in want,
and to look forward to having to beg your bread
in your old age! Do you understand? In your
old age!"</p>

<p>"Bravo!" cried Paolo. "But I would like to
have a clean knife."</p>

<p>"What difference does that make, Bachissia
Era?" answered Aunt Porredda. "You are afraid
to trust in Divine Providence, and that means that
you have lost your faith in God! How do you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
whether you will be poor or rich when you are old?
Is not Costantino Ledda coming back some day?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to be a beggar too," said Aunt Bachissia
coldly.</p>

<p>"And God alone knows whether he ever will
come back," observed the young lawyer brutally,
taking the knife which the servant held out to him,
blade foremost.</p>

<p>They had all heard that Costantino was ill, and
there was a report that his lungs were affected.</p>

<p>In order to appear agitated,&mdash;and possibly she
really was so to some extent,&mdash;Giovanna now hid
her face in her hands and said brokenly:</p>

<p>"Besides&mdash;if it is only to be a civil ceremony&mdash;it
is&mdash;it is because&mdash;&mdash;" Then she stopped.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you go on?" cried Paolo.
"You are to be married by civil ceremony because
the priests won't give you any other! They don't
understand, and they never will understand; just as
you will never understand, Mamma Porredda.
What is marriage, after all? It is a contract made
between men, and binding only in the sight of
men. The religious ceremony really means nothing
at all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is a sacrament!" cried Aunt Porredda, beside
herself.</p>

<p>"Means nothing at all," continued Paolo. "Just
as some day the civil ceremony will mean nothing
at all. Men and women should be at liberty to
enter spontaneously into unions with one another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and to dissolve them when they cease to be in harmony.
The man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, you are no better than a beast!" exclaimed
Aunt Porredda, though it was, in fact, not the
first time that she had heard her son express these
views. "It is the end of the world. God has grown
weary; and who can wonder? He is punishing us;
this is the deluge. I have heard that there have been
terrible earthquakes already!"</p>

<p>"There have always been earthquakes," observed
Uncle Efes Maria, who did not know whether to
side with his wife or his son. Probably, in the
bottom of his heart his sympathies were with the
former, but he did not want to say so openly for
fear of being looked down upon by the gifted
Paolo.</p>

<p>The latter made no reply. Already he regretted
having said so much, being too truly attached to his
mother to wish to give her needless pain. Giovanna
now took her hands from her face, and spoke in a
tone of gentle humility:</p>

<p>"Listen," said she. "When I was married before&mdash;<i>to
that unfortunate</i>&mdash;I had only the civil ceremony,
and if he had not been arrested, who knows
when we ever would have had the religious marriage!
And yet, were we not just as much man and
wife? No one ever said a word, and God, who
knows all, was not offended&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But he punished you," said Aunt Porredda
quickly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"That remains to be seen!" shouted Aunt Bachissia,
whose bile was beginning to rise. "Was the
punishment for that, or for Basile Ledda's murder?"</p>

<p>"If it had been for the murder, only Costantino
would have been punished."</p>

<p>"Well," said the old witch, her green eyes glittering
with triumph, "is not that just what I am
saying? My Giovanna here is not to be punished
any longer for his fault, since God has given her the
opportunity to marry a young man who is fond of
her, and who will make her forget all her sufferings!"</p>

<p>"And who is also rich," remarked Uncle Efes
Maria, and no one could tell whether he spoke ingenuously
or no.</p>

<p>Giovanna, who had quite lost the thread of her
discourse, was, nevertheless, determined to continue
her rôle of patient martyr. "Ah, my dear Aunt
Porredda," said she, "you don't know all, but God,
who alone can see into our hearts, he will forgive
me even if I live in mortal sin, because he will know
that the fault is not with me. I would gladly have
the religious ceremony, but it cannot be."</p>

<p>"Yes, because you are married already to some
one else, you child of the devil!"</p>

<p>"But that other one is as good as dead! Just
tell me now, can he help me to earn a living? And
if the lawyers, who are educated and learned, and
who know what life really is, can dissolve civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
marriages, why can't the priests dissolve religious
ones? Perhaps they don't understand about it.
There is that priest whom we have&mdash;Elias Portolu&mdash;the
one who is so good, you know him? he talks
like a saint, and never gets angry with any one.
Well, even he can't say anything but 'No, no, no;
marriage can only be dissolved by death&mdash;and go
and be blessed, if you don't know what is right!'
Does a body have to live? Yes, or no? And when
you can't live, when you are as poor as Job, and can't
get work, and have nothing, nothing, nothing! And
just tell me, you, Aunt Porredda, suppose I had
been some other woman, and suppose there had been
no divorce, what would have happened? Why,
mortal sin, that is what would have happened, mortal
sin!"</p>

<p>"And in your old age&mdash;want," said Aunt Bachissia.</p>

<p>The servant brought in the fruit: bunches of
black, shining, dried grapes, and wrinkled pears,
as yellow as autumn leaves.</p>

<p>The old hostess handed the dish to her old guest,
with an indescribable look of compassion. Her
anger, and disdain, and indignation had suddenly
melted away as she realised the sordid natures of
the mother and daughter. "Good San Francisco,
forgive them," she prayed inwardly. "Because
they are so ignorant, and blind, and hard!" Then
she said mildly: "You and I, Bachissia Era, are
old women, and you, Giovanna, will be old some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
day. Now tell me one thing: what is it that comes
after old age?"</p>

<p>"Why, death."</p>

<p>"Death; yes, death comes after. And after death
what is there?"</p>

<p>"Eternity?" said Paolo, laughing softly to himself
as he devoured his grapes like a greedy child,
holding the bunch close to his mouth, and detaching
the seeds with his sharp little teeth.</p>

<p>"Eternity, precisely; eternity comes after&mdash;where
are you going, Minnia? Stay where you
are." But the child, tired of the conversation,
slipped out of the room. "What do <i>you</i> say, Giovanna
Era, does eternity follow? yes, or no? Bachissia
Era&mdash;yes, or no?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the guests.</p>

<p>"Yes? and yet you never think of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! what is the use of thinking of it?" said
Paolo, getting up, and wiping his mouth with his
napkin; he felt that it was high time for him to be
off; he had already wasted too much time on these
women, who, after all, were interesting solely from
the fact that they had not yet paid him. "There
are some people waiting to see me at the office&mdash;several
people, in fact," he said. "I will see you
again; you are not leaving yet awhile?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning at daybreak."</p>

<p>"Not really? Oh! you had better stay longer,"
he said indifferently, as he struggled into his huge
overcoat. When it was on, Aunt Bachissia&mdash;watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>ing
him out of her sharp green eyes&mdash;thought that
the little Doctor looked like a <i lang="it">magia</i>, that is, one
of those grotesque and frightening figures whom
wizards evoke by their arts.</p>

<p>He departed, and immediately afterwards Miss
Grazia, who had hardly spoken throughout the entire
meal, arose and left the room as well. Uncle
Efes Maria settled himself back in his chair, and
began to read the <i>New Sardinia</i>. Bursts of laughter
came from the two girls in the kitchen, and the
women sat, each eating a pear, in perfect silence.
A weight hung over them; upon Aunt Porredda as
well as upon the others, for she was realising in her
simple untutored mind that the disease that had
attacked the souls of her ignorant guests was one
and the same as that from which her sophisticated
son and granddaughter were suffering.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h3>


<p>The next morning, just as on that day so long
before, Giovanna was the first to stir, while
Aunt Bachissia, who like most elderly people usually
lay awake until late into the night, still slept, though
lightly and with laboured breath.</p>

<p>The light of the early winter morning, cold but
clear, shone through the curtained window-panes.
Giovanna had fallen asleep the night before feeling
sad,&mdash;though Aunt Porredda's outbreak had annoyed
rather than distressed her,&mdash;but now, as she
looked out and saw the promise of a bright day
for the journey, she felt a sensation of joyous anticipation.</p>

<p>Yes, she had felt quite melancholy on the previous
evening before falling asleep, thinking of Costantino,
and eternity, and her dead child, and all sorts
of depressing things. "I have not a bad heart," she
had reflected. "And God looks into our hearts and
judges more by our intentions than by our actions.
I have considered everything, everything. I was
very fond of Costantino, and I cried just as long as
I had any tears to shed. Now I have no more; I
don't believe he will ever come back, and if he does
it will not be until we are both old; I can't go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
crying forever. Why should it be my fault if I
can't cry now when I think of him? And then,
after all, I am just a creature of flesh and blood,
like every one else; I am poor and exposed to sin
and temptation, and in order to save myself from
these I am taking the position which God has provided
for me. Yes, my dear Aunt Porredda, I do
remember eternity, and it is to save my soul that I
am doing what I am doing&mdash;no, I am not bad; I
have not a bad heart." And so she very nearly
persuaded herself that her heart not only was not
bad, but that it was quite good and noble; at least,
if this was not the conviction of that innermost
depth of conscience, that depth which refused to lie,
and from whence had issued the disturbing veil of
sadness that hung over her, it was of her outer and
more practical mind, and at last, quite comforted,
she fell asleep.</p>

<p>And now the frosty daybreak was striking with
its diaphanous wings&mdash;cold and pure as hoarfrost&mdash;against
the window-panes of the "strangers'
room," and Giovanna thought of the sun and her
spirits rose. The older woman presently awoke
as well, and she too turned at once to the window.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she exclaimed in a tone of satisfaction.
"It is going to be fine." They dressed and went
down. Aunt Porredda, polite and attentive as usual,
was already in the kitchen. She served her guests
with coffee, and helped them to saddle the horse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
To all appearances she had quite forgotten the discussion
of the previous evening, but no sooner had
the two women passed out the door than she made
the sign of the cross, as though to exorcise the
mortal sin as well. "Very good," she said to herself,
closing the door after them. "A pleasant
journey to you, and may the Lord have mercy on
your souls!"</p>

<p>Through the crystalline stillness of the morning
came the sound of shrill cock-crowing&mdash;close at
hand, further away, and further still; but the little
town still slept beneath its canopy of china-blue.</p>

<p>This time the Eras were to make the journey
alone. They had to descend into the valley, cross
it, and then climb the mountain-range which they
could see beyond, showing grey in the early light, its
snowcapped peaks standing out boldly against the
horizon.</p>

<p>It was very cold; there was no wind, but the air
cut keenly. As they descended into the wild valley
the intense stillness seemed only to be intensified by
the monotonous murmur of a mountain stream. The
short winter grass, bright green in colour, and shining
with hoarfrost, showed here and there in vivid
patches along the edges of the winding path. From
the rocks came a smell of damp moss, and the green
copses sparkled with a glittering layer of frost.
The whole valley was radiantly fresh and sweet
and wild, but here and there gnarled outlines of
solitary trees stood out like hermits penitentially ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>posing
their bent and naked forms to the cold brilliance
of the winter's morning.</p>

<p>In the fields the earth showed black and damp;
and long lines of dilapidated wall, climbing the
hillsides and descending into the hollows, looked,
with their coating of green moss, like huge green
worms. On, and on, and on, journeyed the two
women, their hands and feet and faces numb and
stiff with cold. They crossed the stream at a ford
where the water ran broad and shallow and quiet,
then they reascended the valley and began to climb
the mountain at its further end. The sun, now well
above the horizon, was shining with a cold, clear
radiance, and the mountains of the distant coast-range
showed blue against the gold of the sky. The
wind had risen as well, and, laden with the odour
of damp rocks and earth, was stirring among the
shrubs and bushes. The two women proceeded silently
on their way, each buried in her own thoughts.
In the middle of a small defile, overhung by rocks,
and shadowed by the lofty snowcapped summits of
the mountains, they met a man of Bitti journeying
on foot: the travellers exchanged greetings, although
unknown to one another, and passed on their respective
ways. As the women mounted higher and
higher, the sun enveloped and warmed them more
and more; and they thought of the half of the journey
already accomplished, of the purchases they were
carrying back in the wallet, of what they would
do when they got home; and Aunt Bachissia thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of Aunt Martina's amazement when she should see
Giovanna's outfit, while Giovanna thought of Brontu
and of the queer things he would sometimes say
when he was drunk. Preoccupied as they were,
however, when they caught sight of the white walls
of the church of San Francisco glistening among
the green bushes half-way up the mountain side,
each thought of Costantino, and said an Ave Maria
for him.</p>

<p>Shortly after midday they reached home. Orlei,
set in its circle of damp fields, and blown upon by
the frozen breath of the mighty sphinxes whose
heads were now wreathed in bands of snow, was
far colder than Nuoro, and the sun could barely
warm life into the scanty herbage in its narrow,
melancholy streets. The roofs were covered with
rust and mildew, some of them overgrown with
dog-grass; the walls were black with damp; the
trees, nude and brown. Here and there a thin line
of smoke could be seen curling upwards into the
limitless space above; but, as usual, the village appeared
to be utterly silent and deserted. In the
crevices of the walls the little purple and green
cups of the Venus's looking-glass bloomed chillily;
speckled lizards crawled into the sun, and snails
and shining beetles mounted patiently from stone
to stone.</p>

<p>Aunt Martina, seated on her portico, spinning in
the sun, saw the arrival of the travellers, and was
instantly devoured by curiosity to know what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
had in their wallet; she controlled herself, however,
and returned their greeting with courteous composure.</p>

<p>Towards evening Brontu arrived; he visited his
betrothed every three days, and this evening his
mother decided to accompany him, in order to see
the purchases made by her neighbours in Nuoro.</p>

<p>A sparse little fire of juniper-wood was burning
on Aunt Bachissia's hearth, throwing out fitful
gleams of light across the paved flooring, and lighting
up the earthen walls of the kitchen with a faint,
rosy glow. Giovanna wanted to bring a candle, but
the visitors prevented her, Aunt Martina from
an instinct of economy, and Brontu because in
the dim firelight he felt freer to gaze at his betrothed.</p>

<p>The attitude of the latter towards her future
mother-in-law and towards Brontu himself was quite
perfect. She had a gentle, subdued manner, and
spoke in childlike tones, albeit expressing sentiments
of profound wisdom. She gave shy glances from
beneath her long, thick lashes, and might have been
a girl of fifteen so guileless and innocent was her
bearing. She was not, in truth, consciously acting
a part; what she did was purely instinctive.</p>

<p>Brontu was madly in love with her, and now,
when he had been drinking, he would run to her,
and, throwing himself on his knees, repeat certain
puerile prayers learned in infancy. Then he would
begin to cry because he realised that he was tipsy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and would swear that never, never again would he
touch a drop.</p>

<p>This evening, however, he was entirely himself,
and sat talking quietly, enfolding Giovanna all the
while in a passionate gaze, and smiling and displaying
his teeth, which gleamed in the firelight.</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia began to tell about their trip; she
spoke of the greatcoat worn by the young lawyer,
and of the "wings" in fashion among the Nuorese
ladies; then she described the Porrus' kitchen,
and told of their meeting a man on the road; but
of the discussion started by Aunt Porredda at the
supper-table, and of the purchases she and Giovanna
had made, she said never a word. She knew, however,
very well that Aunt Martina could hardly wait
to see the new possessions, and was herself no less
anxious to display them.</p>

<p>"And what have you to say about it all, Giovanna?"
said Brontu, stirring the fire with the end
of his stick. "You are very quiet to-night. What
is the matter?"</p>

<p>"I am tired," she replied, and then suddenly
asked about Giacobbe Dejas.</p>

<p>"That crazy man? He torments the life out of
me; I shall end some day by kicking him out. He
does not need to work now for a living, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I don't know how it is," said Aunt Bachissia.
"He used to be such a cheerful soul, and now,
when he has a house and cattle, and they even say
he is going to be married, his temper is some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>thing&mdash;&mdash;!
You knew, didn't you, that he threatened
to beat us?"</p>

<p>"Did he ever come back?"</p>

<p>"No; never since that time."</p>

<p>"Nor Isidoro Pane either," said Giovanna in a
dull voice.</p>

<p>"I thought I saw him go by here yesterday evening,"
said Aunt Martina.</p>

<p>Giovanna raised her head quickly, but she did
not speak, and Brontu laughingly remarked that
he supposed she did not stand in any particular
need of leeches just at present.</p>

<p>"Well," said Aunt Martina at length, "didn't you
bring me anything from Nuoro? You keep one a
long time in suspense!" They had, in fact, brought
her an apron, but Aunt Bachissia feigned surprise
and mortification. "Of course," said she, "we had
forgotten for the moment&mdash;&mdash;" And she gave a
shrill laugh, but sobered down instantly on observing
that Giovanna took no part in these pleasantries,
and seemed unable to shake off her melancholy.</p>

<p>"No, no; we never thought about it, but Giovanna
will show you a few trifles that we
bought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Giovanna got up, lighted a candle, and went into
the adjoining room, Brontu's ardent gaze following
her. Aunt Martina sat waiting for her present.
Several moments passed and Giovanna did not return.</p>

<p>"What is she doing in there?" asked Brontu.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who knows?"</p>

<p>Another minute elapsed.</p>

<p>"I am going to see," he said, jumping up and
walking towards the door.</p>

<p>"No, no; what are you thinking of?" said Aunt
Bachissia, but so faint-heartedly that Aunt Martina&mdash;scandalised&mdash;called
to her son to come back
with energetic: "Zss&mdash;zss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Brontu, however, paying no attention, tiptoed to
the door. Giovanna was standing before an open
drawer, re-reading a letter which she had found
slipped underneath the door when they got home
that day. It was a heartbroken appeal from Costantino.
In his round, unformed characters he
implored her for the last time not to do this thing
that she was about to do. He reminded her of the
far-away time of their early love; he promised to
come back; he assured her solemnly of his innocence.
"If you have no pity for me," the letter concluded,
"at least have some for yourself, for your own
soul. Remember the mortal sin: remember eternity!"</p>

<p>Ah, the same words that Aunt Porredda had used;
the very same, the very same! Uncle Isidoro must
have slipped the letter in while they were away.
How long it had been since they had had any direct
news of the prisoner! The tears rushed to her
eyes, but what moved her were probably more the
memories of the past than any thoughts of that
eternal future.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly she heard the door being pushed softly
open, and some one stealing in behind her. Leaning
quickly over, she began to rummage in the
drawer, with trembling hands and misty eyes.</p>

<p>Brontu stood directly behind her with outstretched
arms, he clasped her around the shoulders,
and she, pretending to be frightened, began to
tremble.</p>

<p>"What is it? What are you doing?" he asked in
a low, broken voice.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am looking&mdash;looking&mdash;the apron we got
for your mother&mdash;I don't know what I have done
with it. Let me go, let me go," she said, trying
to free herself from his embrace. Close to her
face she saw his white teeth gleaming between the
full, smiling lips, as red and lustrous as two ripe
cherries; then, suddenly, she felt his hand behind
her head, and those two burning lips were pressed
close to her own in a kiss that was like the blast
from a fiery furnace.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she panted. "We have forgotten eternity!"</p>

<p>A little later she was seated once more in her
place by the fire, laughing with all the abandonment
of a happy child; while Brontu regarded her
with the same look in his eyes that he had when
he had been drinking.</p>

<p>The winter passed by. Costantino's friends never
abandoned their efforts to break off the accursed
match, but in vain. The Dejases and Eras were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
like people bewitched, and remained deaf alike to
prayers, threats, and innuendoes. The syndic, even
the syndic, a pale and haughty personage who resembled
Napoleon I., was against this "devil's marriage,"
and when Brontu and Giovanna came to him
in great secrecy to have it published, he treated
them with the utmost contempt, spitting on the
ground all the time they were there.</p>

<p>When the question of the divorce had first been
mooted, people talked and wondered, but nothing
more; then, when it was said that Brontu and Giovanna
were in love with each other, there was general
disapproval, yet at bottom the community was
not ill-pleased to have such a fruitful theme to gossip
about; but when there was talk of a marriage!&mdash;then
every one said it was simply and purely an
impossibility. The neighbours laughed, and rather
hoped that Brontu was amusing himself at the expense
of the Eras. After that, had the young people
merely lived together in "mortal sin" probably
nothing more would have been said, and people
would have ceased to laugh and thought no more
about it. It would not have been the first time that
such a thing had occurred, nor was it likely to be
the last; and Giovanna could cite her youth and
poverty by way of excuse. But&mdash;<i>marry</i> a woman
who already had a husband! <i>marry</i> her! That was
a thing not to be stood! What would you have?
People are made that way. And then the disgrace
and scandal of it! Why, it was a sin, a horrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
sin, and it was feared that God might punish the
entire community for the fault of these two. There
were even threats of making a demonstration on
the marriage day&mdash;whistling, stone-throwing, and
beating the bride and bridegroom. When rumours
of these things reached their ears Brontu became
very angry. Aunt Bachissia said: "Leave them
to me!" and Aunt Martina threw up her head
with the movement of a war-horse when it scents
the smell of the first volley.</p>

<p>Ah! she would rather like to fight and&mdash;win.
She was beginning to feel old, she was tired of
work, and well pleased at the prospect of having a
strong servant in the house without wages. Moreover,
she liked Giovanna, and Brontu wanted her,
and so people might burst with envy if they chose.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day when the marriage
was published, Uncle Isidoro Pane was working
hard in his miserable hut by the brilliant, ruddy
light of a large fire. This was the one luxury
which Uncle Isidoro was able to allow himself&mdash;a
good fire&mdash;since he collected his wood from
the fields, the river-banks, and the forests. During
the winter his chief occupation was weaving cord
out of horsehair; he knew, in fact, how to do a
little of almost everything,&mdash;spin, sew, cook (when
there was anything to cook), patch shoes,&mdash;and
yet he had never been able to escape from dire
poverty.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door was thrown open; there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
a momentary glimpse of the March sky&mdash;not
stormy, but overcast&mdash;and Giacobbe Dejas silently
seated himself beside the fire.</p>

<p>The fisherman's kitchen looked like one of those
pictures of Flemish interiors, where the figures are
thrown out in a ruddy glow against a dark background.
By the uncertain light, a grey spider-web
could be dimly discerned, with the spider in the
middle; in the corner near the hearth, a glass jug
filled to the brim with water in which black leeches
swam about; a yellow basket against the wall; and
finally the figures of the two men and the black
hair cord, its loose ends held between the bony,
red fingers of the old fisherman.</p>

<p>"And how goes it now?" asked Giacobbe.</p>

<p>"How goes it now? How does it go now?"
repeated the old man. "I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, it's been published," said Giacobbe more
as though he were talking to himself. "The thing
is actually done! The drunkard never even came
near the pastures to-day, so I just took myself off
as well. They may steal his sheep if they want to;
I don't care; here I am, and something has got to
be done, Isidoro Pane! Hi! Isidoro Pane! leave
that cord alone and listen to me. Some&mdash;thing&mdash;has&mdash;got&mdash;to&mdash;be&mdash;done&mdash;&mdash;Do
you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear you; but what is there to do? We
have done all we can&mdash;implored, expostulated,
threatened&mdash;&mdash;The syndic has interfered, the
clerk. Priest Elias&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Priest Elias! What did he do? Talked
to them with sugar in his mouth! He should have
threatened them; he should have said: 'I'll take
the Holy Books and I'll curse you! I'll excommunicate
you; you shall never be able to satisfy your
hunger, nor to quench your thirst, nor to have any
peace; you shall live in a hell upon earth!' Ah,
then you would have seen some result! But no, he
is a dunce&mdash;a warm-milk priest; and he has not
done his duty. Don't speak of him to me, it makes
me angry."</p>

<p>Isidoro laid down the cord: "It's of no use
to get angry," said he. "Priest Elias has no
business with threats, and he has not used them;
but never fear, excommunication will fall on that
house all the same!"</p>

<p>"Well, I am going to leave them; yes, I am
going away. I'll eat no more of their accursed
bread!" said Giacobbe with a look expressive of his
loathing and disgust. "But before going, I should
like to have the pleasure of administering a sound
thrashing to those favourites of the devil."</p>

<p>"You are crazy, little spring bird," said Isidoro
with a melancholy smile, imitating Giacobbe.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, I'm crazy; but even so, what do you
care? You haven't done anything either to stop
this sacrilege. Oh, it's disgraceful! I've lost all
my good spirits&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It has made me ten years older."</p>

<p>"All my good spirits, and I keep thinking all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
time of what Costantino will say to us for not being
able to put a stop to it. Is it true that he is ill?"</p>

<p>"Not now; he was ill, but now he is only desperate,"
said Uncle Isidoro, shaking his head. Then
he picked up the cord and began plaiting it again,
murmuring below his breath: "Excommunicate&mdash;excommunicate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I get so furious that I foam at the mouth&mdash;the
way a dog does," said Giacobbe, raising his
voice. "Just exactly like a dog. No, after all, I
don't think I'll quit that house; I'll stay there if
I burst, and see them when the blast of excommunication
strikes them. Yes, if there is one thing
that is sure, it is that God punishes both in this life
and the other too, and I want to be on hand when
it comes. What is that that you are making, Uncle
'Sidoro?"</p>

<p>"A horsehair cord."</p>

<p>There was a short silence; Giacobbe sat staring
at the cord, his eyes dim with grief and anger.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with it when it is
done?"</p>

<p>"Sell it, over in Nuoro; I sell them here too
sometimes; the peasants use them to tie their cows.
What makes you look at it like that? You are not
thinking of hanging yourself, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, little spring bird, you can do that for yourself,
if it is God's will. Yes," he continued, again
raising his voice. "They have actually published the
notice."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Another silence; then Isidoro said: "Who
knows? I can't help hoping yet that that marriage
may never come off. I have faith in God, and I
believe that San Costantino may still perform some
miracle to stop it."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly; why not? A miracle by all
means!" said Giacobbe scornfully.</p>

<p>"Yes; why not?" replied Isidoro calmly. "The
real murderer of Basilio Ledda might die now,
for instance, and confess. In that case the divorce
could not hold good."</p>

<p>"Of course, die just at this precise time!" said
the other in the same tone as before. "You are
as innocent as a three-year-old child, Isidoro, with
your Christian faith!"</p>

<p>"Well, who knows? Or he might be found out."</p>

<p>"Why, to be sure, he might be found out! Just
in the nick of time! Only what has any one ever
known about it? And who is to find him out?"</p>

<p>"Who? Why, you&mdash;I&mdash;any one."</p>

<p>"There you go again! Just like a three-year-old
child! Or, rather, a snail before it's out of the
shell. And how, pray, are we to find him out?
Are we even certain that Costantino did not do it
himself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are certain, entirely so," said Isidoro.
"It might have been any one of us, but never him.
I might have done it, or you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Giacobbe got up. "Well, what can you suggest
to do? If there is anything to be done, tell me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any one but him," repeated Uncle Isidoro, without
raising his head. "Yes, there is one thing to do,&mdash;commit
ourselves into the hands of God."</p>

<p>"Oh, you make me so angry!" cried the other,
stamping about the forlorn little room like an imprisoned
bull. "I ask if there are any steps to be
taken, and you answer like a fool. I'll go and
choke Bachissia Era; that will really be something
to do!" And he marched off as he had come, without
greeting or salutation of any kind, angry this
time in earnest.</p>

<p>Uncle Isidoro, likewise, did not so much as raise
his head, but, noticing presently that his visitor had
left the door open, he got up to close it, and stood
for some moments looking out.</p>

<p>It was a mild March night, moonlit but overcast.
Already one got faint, damp whiffs, suggestive of
the first stirrings of vegetation. All about the old
man's hovel the hedges and wild shrubs seemed to
lie sleeping in the faint, mysterious light of the
veiled moon.</p>

<p>Far away, just above the horizon, a streak of
clear sky wound and zigzagged its way among the
vapourous clouds like a deep blue river, on whose
banks a fire burned.</p>

<p>Isidoro shut the door, and with a heavy sigh
resumed his work.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h3>


<p>It was the vigil of the Assumption, a hot, cloudy
Wednesday. Aunt Martina sat on the portico
spinning, while Giovanna, who was pregnant, sifted
grain near by. Usually two women perform this
task, but Giovanna was doing it alone. First she
stirred the grain around in the sieve and extracted
all bits of stone, then she sifted it carefully into a
piece of cloth placed in a large basket that stood
before her. She was seated on the ground, and
beside her was another basket heaped with grain
that looked as though it were piled with gold
dust.</p>

<p>Instead of growing fat the "wife with two husbands,"
as she was called in the neighbourhood, had
become much thinner; her nose was red and somewhat
puffed; there were dark circles around her
eyes, and her lower lip was drawn down with an
expression of discontent.</p>

<p>Some dishevelled-looking roosters, which now and
again fell to fighting and strewed the floor with
feathers, were laying siege to the basket; from time
to time one of them would succeed in thrusting his
bill inside; then Giovanna, with loud cries and
threats, would drive him off, but only to stand watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>ful
and alert, ready to return to the charge the moment
her attention wandered.</p>

<p>Her attention wandered frequently. Her expression
was sad, or rather, indifferent&mdash;that of a
self-centred person dwelling continually on her individual
woes. The skies might fall, but she would
consider only how the event might be expected to
affect her personally. She was barefoot and quite
dirty, as Aunt Martina hated to have her soap used.</p>

<p>The two women worked on in silence, but the
older one watched her companion out of the corner
of her eye, and whenever she was slack about driving
off the chickens, she screamed at them herself.</p>

<p>At length one, bolder than the rest, jumped on
the edge of the basket and began greedily pecking
within.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;h&mdash;ah, a&mdash;a&mdash;ah!" shrieked Aunt Martina.
Giovanna turned with a sudden movement,
and the rooster, spreading its wings, flew off, leaving
a trail of yellow grains behind it, which, in
dread lest her mother-in-law should scold her (she
was always in dread of that), she hastily began to
gather up.</p>

<p>"What a nuisance they are!" she exclaimed
peevishly.</p>

<p>"Ah, I should say they were, a downright nuisance,"
said the other mildly. "No, don't lean over
like that, my daughter, you'll hurt yourself; let me
do it," and leaving her spindle she stooped down
and began to pick up the grains one at a time, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
a hen seized the opportunity to pull at the bunch
of flax on her distaff.</p>

<p>"Ah! ah, you! I'll wring your neck for you!"
shrieked Aunt Martina, suddenly turning and espying
it, and as she drove it off, the others all instantly
fell to gobbling up the grain.</p>

<p>The younger woman went on with her task, bending
over the sieve, silent and abstracted.</p>

<p>From the portico could be seen the deserted common,
Aunt Bachissia's bare little cottage in the sultry
noontide glare, a burning stretch of road, yellow,
deserted fields, and a horizon like metal.</p>

<p>The clouds, banked high one upon another,
seemed to rain heat, and the stillness was almost
oppressive. A tall, barefooted boy passed by, leading
a couple of small black cows; then came a young
woman, likewise barefoot, who stared at Giovanna
with two round eyes, then a fat white dog with its
nose to the ground; but that was all; no other incident
broke the monotony of the sultry noontide.</p>

<p>Giovanna sifted and stirred ever more and more
languidly. She was weary; she was hungry, but
not for food; she was thirsty, but not for drink;
through her whole physical nature she was conscious
of a need of something hopelessly lost.</p>

<p>Her task finished, she leaned over and began
pouring the grain back from one basket to another.</p>

<p>"Let it be, let it be," said Aunt Martina solicitously.
"You will do yourself some harm."</p>

<p>Giovanna, starting presently to carry the grain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to the "mill" (a grind-stone turned by a small
donkey, which grinds a hundred litres of grain in
four days), her mother-in-law prevented her and
took it herself. Left alone, Giovanna went into the
kitchen, looked cautiously around, and then began
to search through the cupboards. Nothing anywhere;
not a piece of fruit, no wine, not so much
as a drop of liquor wherewith to quench the intolerable
thirst that tormented her. She did, at last,
find a little coffee, which she heated, and sweetened
with a bit of sugar from her pocket, carefully
re-covering the fire when she had done.</p>

<p>The mouthful of warm liquid seemed, however,
the rather to augment her thirst. Giovanna felt that
what she wanted was some soft, delicious drink,
something that she had never tasted in all her life
and&mdash;never would. A dull anger took possession
of her, and her eyes grew bitter. Walking over to
the door of the storeroom, she shook it, although
knowing perfectly well that it was locked; her lips
grew white, and she murmured a curse below her
breath. Then, barefoot as she was, she went out,
noiselessly crossed the common, and called her
mother.</p>

<p>"Come in," answered the latter from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"I can't; there's no one in the house."</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia came and stood in the doorway;
glancing up at the sky, she remarked that it looked
threatening, and that there would probably be a
storm that night.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I don't care," said Giovanna sullenly. "It
may rain every bolt out of heaven!" Then she
added more gently: "But may that which I bear
be saved from harm."</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, you are in a bad humour. What
has become of the old witch? I saw you sifting
grain."</p>

<p>"She has taken it to the 'mill.' She was afraid
to let me go for fear I might steal some."</p>

<p>"Patience, my daughter; it will not always be
like this."</p>

<p>"But it is like this, and like this, and I can't stand
it any longer. What sort of a life is it? She has
honey on her lips and a goad in her hand. 'Work,
work, work.' She drives me like a beast of burden,
and gives me barley-bread, and water, and no light
at night, and bare feet. Oh, as much of all that as
ever I want!"</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia listened, unable to offer any consolation.
She was, indeed, accustomed to hear these
plaints poured into her ears daily. Oh, Aunt Bachissia
had been fooled as well! and had to work
harder than ever before, though for that she cared
little; it was Giovanna's really wretched condition
that gave her the most concern.</p>

<p>"Patience, patience; better times are coming; no
one can rob you of the future."</p>

<p>"Bah, what does that amount to? I shall be
an old woman by that time,&mdash;if I haven't died already
of rage! What good will it do to be well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
off when you're old? You can't enjoy anything
then."</p>

<p>"Eh! yes, you can, upon my soul," said the other,
her green eyes gleaming like a couple of fireflies.
"I could enjoy a great many things well enough!
Eh, eh! To have nothing to do all day long, and
roast meat to eat, and soft bread, and trout, and
eels, and to drink white wine, and rosolis, and chocolate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Giovanna, with a groan; and she
told how she had been unable to find anything wherewith
to quench her burning thirst.</p>

<p>"You must have patience," repeated the mother.
"That comes from your condition. If you had the
most delicious things in the world to choose from&mdash;liquors
from the King's own table&mdash;you would still
be thirsty."</p>

<p>Giovanna kept gazing up at the house with the
portico, her eyes weary and hopeless, and her mouth
drawn down sullenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, we will have rain to-night," said the other
again.</p>

<p>"It can rain as much as it wants to."</p>

<p>"Is Brontu coming home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is, and I am going to tell him about
everything to-night; yes, I shall speak to him about
it this very night."</p>

<p>"My soul, you are? And what is it that you
are going to speak to him about?"</p>

<p>"Why, I am going to tell him that I can't stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
it any longer, and if he only wanted me so as to
have a servant and nothing else, he will find that
he has made a mistake, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will tell him nothing of the sort!" said the
old woman energetically. "Let him alone; doesn't
he have to work and live like a servant himself?
What is the use of bothering him? He might send
you packing, and marry some one else&mdash;in church."</p>

<p>Giovanna began to tremble violently, her expression
softened, and her eyes filled.</p>

<p>"He's not bad," she said. "But he gets tipsy
all the time, and smells as strong of brandy as a
still; it makes me sick sometimes. Then he gets
so angry about nothing at all. Ugh, he's unbearable!
It was better&mdash;it was far, far better&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," demanded Aunt Bachissia coldly, "what
was better?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>This was the kind of thing that went on all the
time. Giovanna did nothing but brood over memories
of Costantino; how good he had been, how
handsome, and clean, and gentle. A deep melancholy
possessed her, far more bitter than any sorrow
one feels for the dead; while her approaching
maternity, instead of bringing consolation, the
rather increased her despair.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on, grey and leaden; not a
breath of air relieved the suffocating stillness. Giovanna
established herself on the tumble-down wall,
beneath the almond-tree, and her mother came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
sat beside her. For a while neither of them spoke;
then Giovanna said, as though continuing a conversation
that had been interrupted:</p>

<p>"Yes, it is just the way it used to be at first,
after the sentence; I dream every night that he has
come back, and it is curious, but do you know, I
am never frightened,&mdash;though Giacobbe Dejas declares
that if Costantino ever did come back he
would kill me. I don't know, but I somehow feel
in my heart that he is coming back; I never used to
think so, but I do now. Oh! there is no use in
looking at me like that. Am I reproaching you
for anything? I should say not. You would have
a better right to reproach me. What good has it
all done you? None at all; you can't even come
to see me any more&mdash;up there&mdash;&mdash;" She thrust
out her lip in the direction of the white house. "My
mother-in-law is afraid you might carry some dust
off on your feet! And I can't give you anything, not
a thing; do you understand? Not even my work.
Everything is kept locked up, and I am treated exactly
like a servant."</p>

<p>"But I don't want anything, my heart. Don't
make yourself miserable over such trifles. I am not
in need of anything," said Aunt Bachissia very
gently. "You must not worry about me; all I care
about is that money I borrowed from Anna Dejas.
I don't see how I am ever to pay her, but she will
wait."</p>

<p>Giovanna reddened angrily, and wrung her hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
exclaiming in a high-pitched voice: "Well, anyhow,
I shall certainly speak to him about that to-night,
the nasty beast; I am going to tell him that at least
he might pay for the rags I have on my back. Pay
for them! Pay for them! May you be shot!"</p>

<p>"Don't speak so loud; don't get so excited, my
soul. There is no use, I tell you, in losing your
temper. What good will getting angry do you?
Suppose he were to turn you out."</p>

<p>"Well, he may if he wants to; it would be better
if he did. At least, I could work for myself then,
instead of slaving for those accursed people. Ah,
there she is, coming back," she added in a lower
tone as the black-robed figure of Aunt Martina appeared
in the open glare of the common. "Now,
I'll get a scolding for leaving the house empty;
she's afraid some one will steal her money. She
has heaps of it, and she doesn't even know about
it; she can't tell one note from another, nor the coins
either. She has ten thousand lire,&mdash;yes, a thousand
scudi&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, my soul, two thousand."</p>

<p>"Well, two thousand, hidden away. And I am
not allowed a drop of anything to refresh me, or
to slake this burning thirst inside me!"</p>

<p>"It will all be yours," said Aunt Bachissia, "if
you will only be patient and bide your time. When
the angels come some day and carry her off to Paradise,
it will all belong to you."</p>

<p>Giovanna cleared her throat, and rubbed it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
one hand; then she resumed hotly: "They may
drive me out if they want to, it makes no difference
to me. Listen: the communal clerk says I am
Brontu's wife, but it seems to me as though I were
just living with him in mortal sin. Do you remember
what sort of a marriage it was? Done secretly,
in the dark almost; without as much as a dog present;
no confections&mdash;nothing. And then Giacobbe
Dejas&mdash;choke him!&mdash;laughing and yelling out:
'Here he comes, the beauty!' and then the 'beauty'
came."</p>

<p>"Now you listen to me," said Aunt Bachissia in
a low penetrating voice. "You are simply a fool.
Upon my word, you always were, and you always
will be. Why do you give up so? and for such
trifles too? I tell you every poor daughter-in-law
has got to live just as you are living. Your harvest-time
will come; only be patient and obedient,
and you will see it will all come out right. Moreover,
just as soon as the baby is born I believe you
will find that things are very different."</p>

<p>"No, nothing will be different. And then&mdash;if
there were no children&mdash;they will only chain me
faster to that stone that is dragging me down and
trampling on me. Would you like to know something?
Well, my real husband is Costantino Ledda,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I'll stop your mouth! You are beside
yourself, my soul; be quiet!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and if he comes back," Giovanna went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
"I'll not be able to return to him on account of
having children."</p>

<p>"I will stop your mouth," repeated Aunt Bachissia,
trembling and rising to her feet with a movement
as though she were about to put her threat into
execution. There was no need, however, for Giovanna
saw her mother-in-law coming across the common
and broke off.</p>

<p>Aunt Martina, spinning as she walked, slowly
approached the two women. "Taking the air?"
she enquired, without raising her eyes from the
whirling spindle.</p>

<p>"Fine air! The heat is suffocating. Ah, to-night
we may get some rain," replied Aunt Bachissia.</p>

<p>"It undoubtedly is going to rain; let us hope
there will be no thunder, I am so afraid of thunder.
The devil empties out his bag of nuts then. I hope
and trust Brontu will be in before evening. What
shall we have for supper, Giovanna?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you like."</p>

<p>"Are you going to stay out here? Don't run
any risks; it might be bad for you."</p>

<p>"What will be bad for me?"</p>

<p>"Why, the evening air; it is always a little damp.
It is safer to stay inside; and you might be getting
supper ready. There are some eggs, my daughter;
eggs and tomatoes; prepare them for yourself and
your husband; I am not hungry. Really, do you
know," she continued, turning to Aunt Bachissia:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
"I have no appetite at all these days. Perhaps it is
the weather."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is the devil perched on your croup,
and your own stinginess!" thought the other. Giovanna
neither spoke nor moved; she seemed completely
immersed in her own dismal thoughts.</p>

<p>"The 'panegyric' is to be at eleven to-morrow,
such an inconvenient hour! Shall you go, Giovanna?
It has always been at ten o'clock in other
years."</p>

<p>"No; I shall not go," replied Giovanna in a
dull tone. She was ashamed now to be seen in
church.</p>

<p>"Yes, at that time it is apt to be warm; it is just
as well that you should not go. But it seems to
be raining," she added, holding out her hand. A
big drop fell and spread among the hairs on its
back. Tic, tic, tic,&mdash;other great drops came splashing
down, on the motionless almond-tree, and on the
ground, boring little holes in the sand of the common.
At the same time the sky appeared to be lightening;
there was a vivid gleam, and a great, yellow cloud,
with markings of a darker shade, sailed slowly
across the bronze background of the sky.</p>

<p>The women took refuge in their houses, and immediately
afterwards the rain began to fall in earnest;
a heavy, steady downpour, with neither wind
nor thunder, but almost frightening in its violence.
In ten minutes it was all over, but enough had fallen
to soak the ground.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"God! Oh, God! Oh, San Costantino! Oh,
Holy Assumption!" moaned Aunt Martina. "If
Brontu is out in this he'll be like a drowned chicken,"
and she studied the heavens anxiously, though never
for a moment ceasing to spin, while Giovanna began
to prepare the supper. Listening to the clatter of
the rain, she, too, felt a vague uneasiness; not, indeed,
on her husband's account, but in dread of
some unknown, indefinable evil.</p>

<p>All at once the yellow light that had accompanied
the downpour melted in the west into a clear, pale
blue sky; the rain stopped suddenly, the clouds
opened and parted, skurrying off,&mdash;under one another,
on top of one another&mdash;like a great crowd of
people dispersing after a reunion. The light was
sea-green; the air was fresh and reviving, filled with
the odour of damp earth and of dried grass that
has had a thorough soaking, and with the sound
of shrill, foolish crowings of roosters mistaking
this pale, clear twilight for the dawn. Then,&mdash;silence.
Aunt Martina's black figure, eternally spinning
on the portico, made a dark splotch against
the green sky. Giovanna was lighting the fire, bending
over the hearth, when a long, tremulous neigh
broke on her ears; the tremor in the sound seemed
to communicate itself to her, and she straightened
herself up, trembling as well, and looked out.
Brontu was arriving, and she was frightened&mdash;what
about&mdash;&mdash;? About everything and nothing at all.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>A tiny gleam flashed out from Aunt Bachissia's
cottage; by its light the old woman was endeavouring,
with the aid of a rough broom, to sweep out the
water that had poured over her threshold. The
sky, beyond the yellow fields, looked like a stretch
of still, green water; and in the foreground the
almond-tree, glossy and dripping, dominated everything
around it. Beneath the almond-tree, in the
last gleam of daylight, Brontu appeared on horse-back;
horse and rider alike black and steaming, and
lagging along as though sodden and weighted by
the deluge that had poured over them.</p>

<p>The two women came running out to meet him,
uttering many expressions of horror, possibly a trifle
exaggerated in tone, but he paid no attention to
them.</p>

<p>"The devil! the devil! the devil!" he muttered,
drawing his feet heavily out of the stirrups, and
lifting first one and then the other. "Go to the devil
who sent you!&mdash;My shoes are water-logged! Why
don't you get to work?" he added crossly, marching
off to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The two women began at once to unload the horse,
and when Giovanna followed him a little later, he
at once demanded something to drink, "to dry
him." "Change your clothes," she told him.</p>

<p>But no, he did not want to change his clothes;
he only wanted something to drink,&mdash;"to dry him"&mdash;he repeated,
and grew angry when Giovanna
would not get it for him. He ended, however, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
doing precisely as she said,&mdash;changed his clothes,
took nothing to drink, and, while waiting for supper,
sat carefully rubbing his wet hair on a towel, and
combing it out.</p>

<p>"What a deluge! what a deluge!" he said. "A
regular sea pouring straight out of heaven. Ah,
I got my crust well softened this time!" He gave
a little laugh. "How are you, Giovanna? All
right, eh? Giacobbe Dejas sent all kinds of messages.
You act like smoke in his eyes."</p>

<p>"You ought to stop his tongue," said Aunt Martina.
"He's only a dirty serving-man; if you didn't
let him take such liberties he would respect you
more."</p>

<p>"I stopped more than his tongue; he wanted me
to let him come in to-night. 'No,' I said; 'you'll
stay where you are, and split.' He's coming in to-morrow,
though."</p>

<p>"To-morrow? and why to-morrow? Ah, my
son, you let yourself be robbed quite openly; you
don't amount to anything!"</p>

<p>"Well, after all, to-morrow is the Assumption,"
said he, raising his voice, and putting the finishing
touches to his hairdressing. "And Giacobbe is a
relation, so let it rest. There, Giovanna, see how
handsome I am!" He smiled at her, showing his
splendid teeth.</p>

<p>He did, in truth, look so handsome, and clean,
and radiant, with his shining locks and fresh colour,
that Giovanna felt a momentary softening. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
he began to hum a foolish little song that children
sing when it rains:</p>

<p>
"'Rain! rain! rain<br />
Ripe grapes, and figs&mdash;&mdash;'"<br />
</p>

<p>And so, they all sat down to the evening meal in
high good humour and contentment. Aunt Martina,
excusing herself on the plea of having no appetite,
ate nothing but bread, onions, and cheese;
articles of diet, however, of which she happened to
be particularly fond,&mdash;but this in no wise interfered
with the general harmony of the supper. After they
had finished Brontu asked Giovanna to go out with
him for a little walk; just to ramble about with no
particular object, among the paths and deserted
lanes of the village.</p>

<p>The sky had completely cleared, a few flickering
stars glimmered faintly from out its pellucid depths;
and the air was full of the odour of dead grass and
wet stones. Quantities of sand and mud had been
washed over the paths, but Giovanna wore her skirts
very short, and such heavily nailed shoes that they
struck against the stones with a sound like metal.
Brontu took hold of her arm and began to invent
wonderful pieces of news, as his custom was when
he wanted to interest her.</p>

<p>"Zanchine," said he, naming one of the men,
"has found something. What do you suppose it
is? A baby."</p>

<p>"When?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, to-day, I think. Zanchine was digging
up a lentisk when he heard a 'wow, wow'; he
looked, and there was a baby, only a few days old.
Well, that wasn't so wonderful; but now comes
the queer part. A little cloud suddenly came flying
through the air, and swooped down on Zanchine
and seized the baby. It was an eagle who had evidently
stolen the baby somewhere and hidden it
among the bushes, and when he saw Zanchine looking
at it, he shot down and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get out!" said Giovanna. "I don't believe a
single word you say."</p>

<p>"Make me rich, if it's not true."</p>

<p>"Get out, get out!" said Giovanna again impatiently,
and Brontu, seeing that instead of being
amused, she was out of humour, asked her if she
had had a bad dream. She remembered the one
she had told her mother of, and made no reply.</p>

<p>In this way they came to the other side of the
village; that is, to the part where Isidoro Pane lived.
A spectacle of indescribable loveliness lay spread
before them. The moon, like a great golden face,
gazed down from the silver-blue west; and the black
earth, the wet trees, the slate-stone houses, the
clumps of bushes, and the wild stretch of upland&mdash;everything,
as far as the eye could reach, to the
very utmost confines of the horizon, seemed bathed
in a tender, half-tearful smile. The two young
people passed close by the fisherman's hut; they could
hear him singing. Brontu stopped.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on," said Giovanna, dragging him by the
arm.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment; I want to knock on the thing
he calls his door."</p>

<p>"No," she said, trembling. "Come away, come
on, I tell you; if you don't come, I'll leave you
by yourself."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, that's true; you and he have had a
quarrel; I haven't, though; I'm going to knock on
his door."</p>

<p>"I'm going on, then."</p>

<p>"He was singing the lauds of San Costantino,"
said Brontu, as he rejoined her a few moments later.
"The one the saint gave him on the river-bank that
time. That old man is stark mad."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h3>


<p>On the following morning at about eleven
o'clock, the religious services began in the
church. They were set for this late hour so as to
allow for the arrival of a young priest from Nuoro,
a friend of Priest Elias's, who was to give a "panegyric"
gratis to the people of Orlei. This panegyric
was a great event, and in consequence, by
ten o'clock the church overflowed with a gaily
dressed throng of persons.</p>

<p>The building itself was painted in the most vivid
colours&mdash;pink walls relieved by stripes of bright
blue; a yellow wooden pulpit; and rows of lusty
saints with red cheeks and blond hair, simpering
from their pink niches like so many Teutonic
worthies. San Costantino, however, the Patron
Saint, was clad in armour, and his face looked dark
and stern. This ancient statue was believed to perform
miracles, and, according to local tradition, had
been carved by San Nicodemus himself.</p>

<p>Through the wide-open door came a flood of sunshine,
which, pouring over the congregation, enveloped
them in a cloud of golden dust. At the
other end of the church, where the altar stood, it
seemed quite dark, notwithstanding the large M of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
lighted tapers, looking, with their motionless flames,
like so many arrowheads stuck on shafts of white
wood.</p>

<p>Priest Elias was celebrating Mass; and close by
stood his friend, wearing a lace alb, and with a small,
dark face like that of a shrewd child; he was singing
away at the top of his voice, and all wondered to
hear the little priest sing so loud, knowing that he
was to preach as well. Most of the people had,
indeed, come expressly to hear this sermon, and
were paying scant attention to the Mass, being taken
up with whispering and staring about them. True,
the heat was suffocating, and clouds of insects made
devotion difficult, even for the most pious. At last
Priest Elias, having finished chanting the gospel,
turned his pale, ascetic face towards the people, and
his lips were seen to move. Just then the figure of
Giacobbe Dejas appeared in the doorway, silhouetted
against the vivid, blue background of the sky.
His usual mocking expression was changed to one
of self-satisfaction. Aware that the priest was
speaking, he paused on the threshold to listen, holding
his long black cap in his hand; then, finding
that he could distinguish nothing, he stepped inside
and whispered to an old man with a long yellow
beard, who stood near the door, to know what had
been said.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I couldn't hear him; they make
as much racket as if they were out in the square,"
said the old man querulously.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>A tall, fresh-complexioned youth, with black hair
and an aquiline nose, turned and stared at Giacobbe.
Noting his unusual cleanliness, his new clothes, and
general air of complacency, he grinned ill-naturedly.</p>

<p>"I think," said he, "that Priest Elias said the
other priest was going to begin the panegyric now."</p>

<p>"Did you hear him say it?" asked the old man
crossly.</p>

<p>"I didn't hear him say anything at all," replied
the youth.</p>

<p>Giacobbe worked his way towards the front of
the church, pushing in and out among the men,
who turned to look at him as he pressed against
them. Suddenly a silence fell on the crowd. The
men all drew back against the walls, and the women
sat down on the floor. In the centre of the church,
where a stream of sunshine fell, was a sort of
wooden bedstead, painted blue, and watched over by
four little pink-cheeked cherubs, whose green, outstretched
wings gave them the appearance of four
emerald butterflies. On the bed, reposing with closed
eyes upon brocade cushions, was a tiny Madonna.
She was dressed entirely in white, with rings, necklaces,
and earrings of gold&mdash;it was the Assumption.
The dark, shrewd face of the little priest now appeared
above the edge of the pulpit. Giacobbe regarded
him fixedly for a moment, and then turned
his right ear towards him so as to hear better.</p>

<p>"People of Orlei, brothers, sisters&mdash;&mdash;" said the
priest in a clear, childish treble&mdash;"asked to preach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
you a little sermon on this solemn day&mdash;&mdash;" Giacobbe
liked the opening, but finding that he could
hear very well without paying strict attention, he
turned and began to observe the people, talking all
the while to himself, though without losing any of
the discourse.</p>

<p>"There's Isidoro Pane, the devil take him! if
he hasn't got on new clothes too; I wonder if he
is also thinking of getting married. Eh, eh! That
fresh-looking fellow down there by the door was
laughing at me; he saw how happy and prosperous
I looked, and thought of course that I must be going
to get married. Well, and what if I am? Is it
any business of yours, you puppy? Can't I get
married if I want to? I have a house of my own,
and cattle too.<a name="Anchor-6" id="Anchor-6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a></p>

<p>"Eh, eh! my sister will die without heirs&mdash;God
bless her!&mdash;there she is, looking like a pink, shiny,
little wax doll. Who would ever suppose that she
is older than I? She wants me to get a wife.
Well, I am perfectly willing, but whom shall I get?
I am not so easy to please, and then I'm afraid&mdash;I'm
afraid&mdash;I'm afraid. With this new law&mdash;the
devil roast all the lawyers&mdash;who in the world is one
ever to trust? There's that precious young master
of mine; there he is at this very minute, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
stamp of mortal sin on him. What is he doing
here? Why don't they horsewhip him? Why don't
they drive him out like a dog? And his old bird-of-prey
mother too? The old jade, there she is! Why
don't they drive both of them out?"
"Ah," he thought presently, "that is true,
though; if they turned every one out who did wrong,
the church would soon be empty. But those two
people, I hate them; I'd like to flog them till the
blood came. I'm not bad, though; didn't I stay up
at the folds only to-day, working to repair the
damage made by yesterday's storm? Then, when
I came down, there was Giovanna getting dinner
all by herself. She was dirty, and ill, and unhappy.
No holiday for her! The mother and son go off
together, and she, the maid-servant, stays at home
and does the work. Well, it serves her right&mdash;a
bad woman! And yet, I do feel sorry for her sometimes.
There, God help me, I do feel sorry for
her. When I said something ugly to her just now,
she never answered a word. After all, when you
come to think of it, she's the mistress, and I'm the
servant. But is it my fault if I can't help pitching
into you sometimes, little spring bird? I can't bear
the sight of you, and all the same I'm sorry for
you, and that's the way it is. Now, we must listen
to what the priest has to tell us. He's just like
a sparrow; that's it, a sparrow singing in its nest."</p>

<p>"Brothers, sisters, beloved&mdash;&mdash;" cried the little
preacher in the soft Loguedorese dialect, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
sounds almost like Spanish, and waving his small
white hands in the air&mdash;"the faith of Our Lady is
the most ideal, the most sublime of all faiths. She,
the gentle woman, daughter, wife, and Mother of
Our Lord, mounted to heaven all radiant and fragrant
as a chaplet of roses, and took her seat in
glory amongst the angels and seraphim&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's Priest Elias," thought Giacobbe, turning
his little squint-eyes, which shone like metal in
the bright light, towards the altar. "Yes, with his
hands folded together, a boiled-milk priest, who
can't preach anything except goodness and forgiveness,
and all the time he has the Holy Books, and
could strike right and left among the people if he
chose to. Ah, if he had only threatened Giovanna
Era&mdash;&mdash;! He always looks as if he were in a
dream, anyhow."</p>

<p>"No one," continued the little preacher, standing
erect in the yellow pulpit, "no one has ever been
able to say that he failed to get anything he asked
in true faith from Our Most Holy Lady. She, the
Lily of the Valley, the Mystical Rose of Jericho&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the audience was growing weary. The
women, seated on the floor like beds of ranunculuses
and poppies, were beginning to stir uneasily, and
had ceased to listen. The young priest understood,
and brought his discourse to a close, with a general
benediction, which included the entire gathering of
persons who, while ostensibly listening to the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of God, were, for the most part, wholly taken up
with their own and their neighbours' affairs.</p>

<p>Priest Elias, arousing from his dream, resumed
the celebration of the Mass. He alone, with possibly
Isidoro Pane, had listened to the sermon, and
the latter, so soon as the Mass was concluded, began
to sing the lauds, his clear, sweet voice flowing out
like a stream of limpid water rippling among rocks
and flowering moss.</p>

<p>The young stranger listened with ecstasy to those
liquid tones; the old fisherman's venerable figure,
his long, flowing beard, and gentle eyes, and the
bone rosary clasped between his knotted fingers, recalling
certain pilgrims he had seen in Rome.</p>

<p>He wanted to meet the old man, and Priest Elias,
accordingly, stopped him at the church door. Giacobbe,
who was watching, was almost consumed
with envy at the sight of the fisherman standing in
friendly conversation with the two priests.</p>

<p>"What the thunder were they saying to you?"
he demanded as the other came up.</p>

<p>"They wanted me to dine with them," said Isidoro,
with some show of importance.</p>

<p>"Oh! they wanted you to dine with them, did
they? So, my little spring bird, you are getting
to be somebody, it seems. Well, you come along
with me."</p>

<p>"To the Dejases'? Not I!" exclaimed Isidoro
in a tone of horror.</p>

<p>"No, no; I'm not going to eat with those children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of the devil to-day. I'm going home, so come
along."</p>

<p>It was past midday as the two men set off for
Aunt Anna-Rosa's house. The sun, pouring down
on the narrow streets, had dried the mud, and the
moisture on the trees. In all directions people could
be seen dispersing to their homes, and the heavy
tread of the shepherds resounded on the stone pavements.
Children, dressed in their Sunday-best,
peeped from over tumble-down walls, and through
open doors glimpses could be caught of dark
interiors, with here and there a copper saucepan
shining from a wall like some huge medal suspended
there. Thin curls of smoke floated up
through the clear atmosphere, and the music of a
mouth-organ, issuing from a usually deserted courtyard,
sounded as though it were coming from the
bowels of the earth, where some melancholy old
Fate was solacing herself.</p>

<p>The entire village wore an unaccustomed air of
gaiety, and yet this very festal look, the wide-open
doors, the wreaths of smoke, the children, so ill
at ease at their holiday attire, the sound of the
mouth-organ, the bare, unshaded houses exposed to
the full glare of the noontide sun&mdash;all combined to
produce an effect of profound melancholy. Giacobbe
led the way to his sister's house, and they
all three dined together. The little woman, herself
widowed and childless, adored her brother, and still
referred to him as "my little brother." But then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
she loved all her kind, without distinction, and her
eyes, slightly crossed, of no colour in particular, and
as pure and liquid as two tiny lakes illuminated by
the moon, were as innocent as the eyes of a nursing
child. She knew that evil existed, but was frightened
merely at the thought of men committing sin.
One of the great sorrows of her life had been Giovanna's
divorce and re-marriage&mdash;her own foster-child,
as it were! And to think that she had actually
lent them the money for the wedding outfit&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>Giacobbe dearly loved to tease her.</p>

<p>"Here's our friend Isidoro," he cried, as the
party seated themselves at table. "He is thinking
of getting married, and has come to consult you."</p>

<p>"Bless me, Isidoro Pane, and are you really going
to be married?"</p>

<p>"Oh! go along, go along," said the fisherman
good-humouredly.</p>

<p>"So you don't care about marrying?" cried Giacobbe,
holding a piece of roast meat in both hands,
and tearing it apart with teeth that were still sound
and strong. "Well, you are a dirty beast. Do
you know, sister, he has lovers, all the same."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that."</p>

<p>"It's true, though; take me to heaven if it's not.
Yes, he has lovers who suck his blood."</p>

<p>The others laughed like two children at this humourous
allusion to Isidoro's leeches. Giacobbe
began to cut his meat with a sharp knife, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
it between his teeth and left hand, and muttering
that it was as tough as the devil's ear, while his
sister and the guest, having once begun, were ready
to laugh at everything. Giacobbe's mood, however,
suddenly changed, and for some reason which
he himself was at a loss to explain, his good spirits
of a few hours before deserted him.</p>

<p>"When we have finished, I'll take you to see my
'palace,'" he said. "It will be done in a few days
now, and if I wanted to I could rent it right
away, but I don't want to; I intend to live in it
myself."</p>

<p>"Then you are not going to hire out any more?"</p>

<p>"No, not after a little while; I have worked
enough. I have been working for forty years; do
you take that in? Yes, it's forty years. No one
can say I stole the money I have laid away for my
old age."</p>

<p>"And you are going to marry?"</p>

<p>"Poh! Who is there to marry me? I should
despise any young woman who was willing to, and
I won't have an old one, not I. Take something
more to drink, Isidoro Pane."</p>

<p>"You must want to make me tipsy!&mdash;well, as
it's a holiday&mdash;here's to the bride and groom!"</p>

<p>"What bride and groom?"</p>

<p>"Giacobbe Dejas and Bachissia Era!" said the
fisherman, who was waxing merry.</p>

<p>Giacobbe made a quick movement as though to
throw himself upon him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll knock out your brains!" he cried, his eyes
flashing with anger.</p>

<p>"Ah, you murderer!" laughed the other.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush! One should not say such things,"
said Aunt Anna-Rosa.</p>

<p>Giacobbe drank off a couple of glasses of wine,
and then laughed in rather a forced way, looking
sideways at his sister and the fisherman. "See
here," he said suddenly; "why don't you two get
married? Isidoro Pane, my sister is rich, and you
see how fresh she is, just like the hip of a wild
rose. You'd think she had found some magic herb
and made an ointment to preserve her skin."</p>

<p>"God bless you! How queer you are sometimes!"
exclaimed the little woman.</p>

<p>"Yes; you two had better marry; I wish it. My
sister is rich; all my property will go to her, because
I am going to die first. Somehow, I don't
quite know why, but I feel as though I were going
to die soon; I feel as though I were going to be
killed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! If it happens to-day, it will
come from drinking too much."</p>

<p>"Dear little brother, what on earth are you talking
about? In the name of the wretched souls in
purgatory, don't say such things," said his sister,
greatly distressed.</p>

<p>"You have no enemies," said Isidoro. "And
besides, only those perish by the sword who have
used the sword."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I have slaughtered many and many an
innocent, unoffending fellow-creature," replied Giacobbe
seriously, burying his mouth in a slice of watermelon.
"You don't believe me? Sheep and
lambs without number!" and he lifted his face,
streaming with the pink juice, and laughed.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the two men went off to look at
the new house.</p>

<p>Its two stories&mdash;the ground-floor and one above
it&mdash;were divided into four large bedrooms, a kitchen,
and a stable; these accommodations being deemed
sufficient to earn for it the title of "palace," not
alone from Giacobbe, but from the entire neighbourhood
as well.</p>

<p>"Do you see this? Have you noticed that?"
Giacobbe kept calling out, drawing attention to
every detail and corner of his property; his clean-shaven
face, devoid even of eyebrows, growing,
meanwhile, almost youthful in its enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"You had better marry my sister," he said presently.
"This house will be hers some day."</p>

<p>"You are making fun of me," replied the other.
"Because I am poor, you think you can laugh at
me as much as you like."</p>

<p>The wooden floors filled the simple soul with
awe, and he hardly dared to walk on them. Giacobbe,
on the contrary, seemed to enjoy stamping
about in his great hobnailed boots, and making as
much noise as he could in the big, empty rooms, all
redolent of fresh plaster.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The two men paused for a moment at an open
window, whose stone sill, baked by the sun, felt hot
to the touch. The house stood high, and below
them, in black shadow, lay the village, looking like
a heap of charcoal beneath the green veil of trees.
All about stretched the yellow plain, and, beyond,
the great violet-grey sphinxes reared themselves
against a cloudless sky. The bell of the little church,
clamouring insistently, broke in on the noontide
heat and stillness, and the sound was like metal
striking against stone, as though far off, in the rocky
heart of those huge sphinxes, a drowsy giant were
wielding his pick. "Why don't you want to marry
my sister?" said Giacobbe again. "This house
will belong to her, and this will be her bedroom;
here at this very window you could smoke your
pipe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never smoke; do let me be," said the fisherman
impatiently. The other's talk began to annoy
him.</p>

<p>"I'm not joking, you old lizard," retorted Giacobbe.
"Only you are such a dull beggar that you
can't even tell that I'm not."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Isidoro. "You have given me my
dinner to-day, and so you think you have a right
to make game of me. Now, I tell you this, if you
want me to be grateful for it, you had better leave
me alone."</p>

<p>Giacobbe stared at him for a moment; then he
burst into a loud laugh.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on," he cried; "let's have something to
drink."</p>

<p>They went out, and Giacobbe led the way to the
tavern, but the other refused to enter, saying that
it was time for him to be getting back to the
church.</p>

<p>In the tavern Giacobbe found Brontu and a number
of others playing <i lang="it">morra</i>, their arms flung out
in tense attitudes, and all shouting the numbers at
the tops of their lungs.</p>

<p>Before five o'clock, the hour set for the procession,
they were all quite tipsy, Giacobbe more so
than any one: notwithstanding which fact he insisted
upon grasping his master by the arm, being
firmly under the impression that without his aid,
the other would not be able to walk. He then invited
the whole company to adjourn to his "palace"
to view the procession. A little later, accordingly,
the big, empty rooms echoed to the sound of hoarse
voices, bursts of aimless laughter, and uncertain
footsteps. The windows were all thrown wide
open, and quickly filled with wild, bearded faces.</p>

<p>Giacobbe and Brontu were standing at the same
window where the old fisherman had been shortly
before. By this time the sun had left it, but the
sill was still warm, while below them and beyond,
the village, and the plain, and the mountains
were striped with long bars of ever lengthening
shadows.</p>

<p>"Cu, cu!" shouted Brontu, staring out with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
round eyes. This was so intensely humourous that
the others all began imitating him, each one making
as much noise as possible. The house resounded
with the uproar; a crowd gathered in the street below,
and presently the drunkards within and those
without began to exchange abusive epithets, followed
by spitting and stone-throwing.</p>

<p>On a sudden, however, complete silence fell; a
sound of low, mournful chanting was heard approaching,
and immediately after a double line of
white, phantom-like figures appeared at the end of
the street, preceded by a silver cross held aloft
against the blue background of the sky. The men
in the street fell back against the walls, the heads
at the windows were lowered, and every one uncovered.</p>

<p>One of the white-robed brotherhood, boys for the
most part who, when the ceremonies were over,
would receive three soldi each and a slice of watermelon,
knocked at the door of the new house as he
passed, and the others followed his example.</p>

<p>"Curse you!" yelled Giacobbe furiously, leaning
far out of the window. "Boors! walking in the
procession, are you?" and he was about to spit on
them, but Brontu prevented him, telling him it
would not do.</p>

<p>Now came the green brocade standard, with its
hundred variegated ribbons and gilded staff; and
next the Madonna of the Assumption, extended with
closed eyes on her portable couch, covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
necklaces and rings that looked like relics of the
bronze age, and watched over by the four green
cherubs.</p>

<p>On each of the four sides, walking beside the
bearers, was a man wearing a white tunic and carrying
in his arms a child dressed as an angel.
They were charming little creatures, two blond
and two brunette, and they chattered gaily with
one another, shouting to make themselves heard.
One of them, tickled under the knee by the man
who carried him, squirmed and wriggled, one wing
hanging limply down.</p>

<p>The sight of these children touched some finer
emotion in Brontu, Giacobbe, and the others, and
bending their knees, they crossed themselves devoutly.
The children, for their part, gazed up at
the windows, and one of them, recognising an uncle
in the group, flung a red confetto at him, which,
missing fire, fell back into the road.</p>

<p>Priest Elias and the little stranger from Nuoro
came next, wearing brocade and lace robes, pale
and handsome in their bravery. They walked with
clasped hands and rapt faces, chanting in Latin.</p>

<p>"The devil!" exclaimed Giacobbe suddenly. "If
there isn't that dirty old Isidoro Pane! You'd
suppose he was running the whole procession; I'm
going to spit on him."</p>

<p>"No, you're not," commanded Brontu.</p>

<p>Giacobbe coughed to attract the fisherman's attention,
but the other did not so much as raise his eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
continuing to intone the prayers to which the people
responded as with a single voice.</p>

<p>The surging, vari-coloured crowd had flowed together
behind the procession, and above the sea of
heads could still be seen the swaying silver cross.
The men had all uncovered,&mdash;bald heads, shining
with perspiration, mops of thick black hair, rough,
curly pates,&mdash;and then the gay head-kerchiefs of the
women, some with black grounds and yellow
squares, others striped with red, or covered with
green spots,&mdash;all surmounting flushed faces, flashing
eyes, white bodices crossed on the breast, red, gesticulating
hands. Gradually the crowd thinned; an old
cripple came limping along, then a woman with two
children hanging to her skirts, then three old
women&mdash;a child with a yellow flower in its mouth&mdash;the
street grew empty and silent; the noise, and movement,
and colour receding in waves, and growing
ever fainter as the low, melancholy cadence of the
chanted invocations died away in the distance.</p>

<p>As the last sounds ceased, two cat's paws appeared
on the wall opposite Giacobbe's house, followed by
a little, white face, with wide startled eyes, then
the animal leaped on the wall, and sat staring intently
down into the street.</p>

<p>"Too late!" cried Brontu, waving a salute.</p>

<p>The others shouted with laughter, and when Giacobbe
presently told them it was time to be off,
they refused to go. The host, thereupon, seizing
a lath covered with plaster, tried to drive them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
out, and the entire troop of rough, bearded men
began to run from room to room, pushing one
another by the shoulders, yelling, tumbling over
each other, and shrieking with laughter like so
many schoolboys. Driven forth at length, they
continued their horseplay in the street, until Giacobbe,
having locked the door and put the key in
his pocket, led the way back to the tavern. At
dusk Brontu and the herdsman, supporting one another,
appeared at the white house.</p>

<p>Aunt Martina was sitting on the portico with
her hands beneath her apron, reciting the rosary.
When her eyes fell on the two men she remained
perfectly still and silent, but her lips tightened, and
she shook her head ever so slightly, as though to
say: "Truly, a fine sight!"</p>

<p>"Where is Giovanna?" demanded Brontu.</p>

<p>"She went to her mother's."</p>

<p>"Oh! she went to her mother's, the old harpy's?
Well, she's always going there, curse her."</p>

<p>"Don't shout so, my son."</p>

<p>"I will; I'll shout as much as I like; I'm in
my own house," and turning towards the common,
he began to call at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Giovanna! Giovanna!"</p>

<p>Giovanna appeared at the door of the cottage,
and started to cross the common hastily with an
alarmed air; as she drew near, however, her expression
changed to one of annoyance and disgust.
Pausing in front of the two men, she regarded them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
with a look of undisguised scorn. Giacobbe laughed,
but Brontu reddened to the tips of his ears with
anger.</p>

<p>"Well," she demanded; "what is the matter?
Have you got the colic?"</p>

<p>"He would have got it pretty soon if you hadn't
come," said Giacobbe.</p>

<p>Brontu opened his mouth and his lips moved, but
no sounds came forth, and his anger presently died
away as senselessly as it had come.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;" he stammered. "I wanted you. We
have hardly seen each other all day. What were
you doing at your mother's? Who was there?"</p>

<p>"Who was there?" she repeated, in a tone of
intense bitterness. "Why, no one. Who would
you expect to find at our house?"</p>

<p>"Why, San Costantino might come&mdash;t&mdash;o&mdash;o&mdash;gi&mdash;i&mdash;i&mdash;ve
you&mdash;u a po&mdash;em&mdash;&mdash;" sang Giacobbe
thickly. "Have you ever seen San Costantino?
Well, there's Isidoro Pane&mdash;he's perfectly crazy&mdash;he
doesn't like you; no, indeed, he doesn't, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up; hold your tongue!" said Aunt Martina.
"And the sheepfolds left all this time to take
care of themselves! That's the way you attend to
your master's business! You're all alike, accursed
thieves!"</p>

<p>Giacobbe sprang forward, erect and livid; and
Giovanna, fearing that he was really going to strike
the old woman, stepped quickly between them. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
turned, however, without saying a word, and sat
down, but with so lowering an expression that
Giovanna remained near her mother-in-law in an
attitude of protection.</p>

<p>Brontu, on the contrary, was struck with the
idea that his mother deserved a rebuke.</p>

<p>"What sort of manners are these?" he demanded
in a tone that was intended to be severe.
"Why, you treat people as though&mdash;as though&mdash;as
though they were beasts&mdash;everybody! To-day&mdash;to-day&mdash;no,
yesterday was a holiday. If he chose
to get drunk, what business was that of yours?"</p>

<p>"I got drunk on poison," remarked Giacobbe.</p>

<p>"Yes, poison," agreed Brontu. "And I did too.
And there's another thing. I'm tired of all this,
mother and wife&mdash;and the whole business. So
there! I'm going away. I'm going to spend the
night with him in his palace. After all, we are
relations, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say it right out!" shouted Giacobbe. "You
may be my heir; that's what you mean! Ha, ha,
ha!"</p>

<p>He laughed boisterously, emitting sounds that
were more like the howls of a wild beast than human
laughter. Brontu, trying to imitate him, only succeeded
in producing a noise like the cry of some
happy animal in the springtime.</p>

<p>Giovanna felt herself grow sick with dread; she
was afraid of the rapidly approaching darkness, of
the solitude that enwrapped the common, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
presence of these two men whom wine had turned
into quarrelsome beasts. "The excommunication,"
she thought, "has fallen on us all: on this servant,
who dares to defy his master; on the son, who upbraids
his mother; on me, Giovanna, who loathe and
despise them one and all!"</p>

<p>Aunt Martina arose, went into the kitchen, and lit
the candle. Giovanna followed her and set about preparing
the supper. When it was ready they all sat
down together, and for a little while everything went
well. Presently Brontu began to tell of how they had
watched the procession from the windows of Giacobbe's
"palace," his account of their foolish doings
bringing a smile to his mother's lips. Then he tried
to put his arm around his wife, but Giovanna's heart
was full of gall. For her the holiday had been, if
anything, sadder than an ordinary day; she had
worked hard, she had not been to church, she had not
so much as changed her dress; and yet, the moment
she had allowed herself to go for a little recreation
to the cottage,&mdash;the scene alike of her greatest
misery and of her most intense happiness,&mdash;she had
been ordered back as peremptorily as a dog is told
to return to its kennel. Consequently, she was in
no mood for endearments, and repulsed Brontu's
proffered caress, telling him he was drunk.</p>

<p>Giacobbe, thereupon, laughed delightedly, which
irritated Giovanna as much as it angered Brontu.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at, you mangy cur?"
demanded the latter.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"I might say I am not as mangy as you are
yourself. But then, I&mdash;I want to say that&mdash;that&mdash;well,
I'm laughing because I choose to."</p>

<p>"Eh! I can laugh too."</p>

<p>"Fools!" said Giovanna scornfully. "You
make me sick, both of you."</p>

<p>At this Brontu, quite beside himself, suddenly
turned on her:</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, anyhow?" he
demanded in a hard voice. "One would really like
to know. Here you are, living on me, and when
I offer to kiss you you fly out at me. You ought
to be thankful to kiss the very ground under my
feet; do you hear me?"</p>

<p>Giovanna grew livid. "What!" she hissed.
"Am I treated any better than a servant in this
house?"</p>

<p>"Well, a servant; all right, you can just stay
one. What else should you be, woman?"</p>

<p>Giacobbe's squint-eyes sparkled at this, but Giovanna,
rising to her feet, proceeded to pour out
all the concentrated bitterness of the past months.
Addressing her husband and mother-in-law, she
called them slave-drivers and tyrants; threatened
to go away, to kill herself; cursed the hour she had
entered that house, and, in the transport of her
rage, even revealed the debt to Giacobbe's sister.</p>

<p>At this, the herdsman fell to laughing softly to
himself, murmuring words of half-mocking reproach
addressed to Aunt Anna-Rosa. On a sud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>den,
however, his face grew black; the sombre figure
of Aunt Bachissia appeared in the doorway; she
had heard her daughter's angry voice resounding
through the stillness of the evening, and had come
at once.</p>

<p>"Here," said Aunt Martina, perfectly unmoved,
"is your daughter, gone mad to all appearances."</p>

<p>Brontu, completely sobered, was signing urgently
to his mother-in-law to come forward and try to
calm the furious woman, and Aunt Bachissia was
about to do so when Giacobbe suddenly leaped to
his feet and threw himself in front of her with an
ugly scowl.</p>

<p>"Get out of here!" he ordered, pointing to the
door.</p>

<p>"And are you the master?" asked Aunt Bachissia
ironically.</p>

<p>"Get out, I tell you," he repeated, and, as she
continued to advance, he laid hold of her.</p>

<p>She shook him off, and he went out himself instead,
and, sitting down on the portico, tried to
laugh; but, odd to relate, instead of laughter, he
presently found himself shaking all over with dry,
convulsive sobs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h3>


<p>Time passed on. The sky and weather
changed with the changing seasons, but
among the inhabitants of the little village all remained
much as usual. In the course of the winter
Giovanna gave birth to a weak, puling girl-baby,
which did nothing but cry. Doctor Porra, or Pededda,
as he still continued to be called, came all the
way from Nuoro expressly to stand for the poor
little creature. He arrived in a carriage, bundled
up like a bale of clothing, his rosy face beaming
as usual. Quite a number of persons had assembled
to see him, and he distributed smiles and greetings
indiscriminately to all who would have them, assuring
a group of Brontu's friends who had gone
to meet him, that he remembered perfectly seeing
all of them at Nuoro. This gratified them immensely,
all but one, that is, who said he had never
been to Nuoro. "It is of no consequence," said
the lawyer cheerfully, "I am sure to see you there
some day." This was a somewhat equivocal assurance,
as it seldom happened that any of them
went to Nuoro except on law business; however,
the man was highly pleased.</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia, watching the new arrival divest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
himself of his greatcoat, shawl, and various other
wraps, thought that he looked more than ever like
a <i lang="it">magia</i>.</p>

<p>"You seem to have grown stouter," she said,
looking at the layers of clothing.</p>

<p>"Oh! this is a mere nothing," he replied. At
which they all laughed delightedly.</p>

<p>The baptism was to be conducted with great
pomp, and Aunt Martina, probably for the first
time in her life, slackened the strings of her purse,
and sent to Nuoro for wines and sweets of the
best quality. She could not sleep the night before,
however, and passed a wretched day, tormented by
the fear that some of the delicacies might be spirited
away. On the morning of the ceremony Giovanna
got up early and helped her mother-in-law
to prepare the macaroni for dinner; then she went
back to bed, where she remained in a sitting posture,
propped up by pillows, and with the bedclothes
drawn up about her waist. Above that she wore
her blouse and bodice, and she had on her wedding
coif and bridal kerchief. She looked somewhat pale,
but very handsome, her great eyes seeming larger
even than usual.</p>

<p>The table was set in the bedchamber, and covered
with a linen cloth, which Aunt Martina now
took out from her chest for the first time since it had
been bought.</p>

<p>The ceremony was to take place at about eleven
o'clock of a very cold morning. From the pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
sky a thick, white vapour fell, enveloping the village
and all the surrounding country in a misty veil.
The narrow streets were deserted, and here and
there frozen puddles lay like pieces of broken, dirty
glass. An absolute silence reigned in the open
space before the Dejases' house, opposite which the
almond tree stretched its bare, black limbs against
the misty background.</p>

<p>All at once the common was invaded by a troop
of urchins, bundled up in ragged garments and
odds and ends of fur; with fringed, red caps on
their heads, and wearing old boots, some of them
almost as large as the little persons who wore them.
Groups of people stood about, principally shivering
women, coughing and sneezing and smelling of
soot and smoke. Then the baptismal procession
appeared. First came two children looking solemn
and important, and carrying candles from which
red ribbons fluttered; these were followed by the
woman with the infant wrapped in shawls, and
covered with a piece of greenish brocade, like the
standard of San Costantino.</p>

<p>Then the godfather appeared, his round little face
rosy and smiling as ever, emerging from the folds
of his big coat and black-and-white shawl. With
him walked the godmother, one of Aunt Martina's
daughters, a lank young woman with a long, narrow
face, who reminded one of a shadow seen at sunset.
She had to lean down in order to reach her companion's
ear. With the godparents came Brontu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
freshly shaven and gay, and behind them followed
a group of friends and relatives, marching along in
step, with a noise like the tramp of horses' hoofs.
Last of all came the godmother's servant-maid, a
shivering creature blue with cold; she carried a
small basin under one arm, and kept both hands
buried in the pockets of her gown. From time to
time she thrust out her tongue to catch the drops
that kept running down from her nose. The boys
trotted alongside, forming two wings to the procession,
their eyes eagerly fixed upon the godfather,
who returned their gaze with an amused stare and
hailed them jocosely:</p>

<p>"Why, hello! you here? What are you looking
for, little hedgehogs?"</p>

<p>"He's lame," said one.</p>

<p>"Hush, keep quiet, or he won't give us anything!"</p>

<p>The procession passed on; the faces of the urchins
fell; some of them were angry, and others
seemed on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>"Crippl&mdash;&mdash;" one began to call, but stopped suddenly.
The godfather had pitched a handful of
copper coins into the air, and the whole troop
flung themselves after them, yelling, tumbling over
one another, pushing, fighting, struggling, rolling
over and over, almost upsetting the maid-servant,
who instantly began to deal out blows and curses
in greater proportion even than the coins themselves.
Fresh handfuls of money and renewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
scuffling by an ever-increasing crowd of ragamuffins
continued to the very doors of the church, where
Priest Elias stood awaiting the party and listening
to something the red-robed sacristan was urging
upon him. The sacristan was, in fact, afraid that
Priest Elias, with his usual kindly indulgence, might
be persuaded to return to the house with the baptismal
party, whereas it was the custom of the neighbourhood
for the priest to do that only in cases
where the parents had been united by religious ceremony:
he was, therefore, exhorting the other to
practise severity with Brontu, with the godparents,
with the whole company in fact. "Your Honour,"
said he, "will surely not return to the house with
this infant? Why, it is almost illegitimate! On no
account should such respect be paid to it."</p>

<p>"Go and see if they are coming," said the priest.</p>

<p>"They are not in sight yet. No, your Honour
will not go."</p>

<p>"And how about you? Shall you not go?" enquired
the priest with a slight smile.</p>

<p>"Oh! with me it is an altogether different matter;
I go on account of the sweetmeats, not to do honour
to that rabble."</p>

<p>At this moment the company came in sight, and
the ceremony presently began. No sooner had the
baby's bald little red head been uncovered than
it began to emit sounds like the bleating of a hoarse
kid. The godfather stood by smiling, with a lighted
taper in his hand, doing his best to remember the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
creed, Giovanna having implored him to recite it
conscientiously, so that the baptism might be valid.</p>

<p>Almost the entire crowd of urchins had followed
the party inside the church, and there was a pattering
like rats running about, as the sacristan would
chase them all out, only presently to come stealing
back.</p>

<p>The woman who had carried the baby, and the
maid-servant with the basin, seated themselves on
the steps of a side altar, where they anxiously
awaited the godfather's present. At last the service
was over, the tips had been given, the baby
wrapped up again, and Brontu and his friends
stood waiting awkwardly for the priest, who had
gone into the sacristy to remove his robes. Would
he come back or not? Was he going to the house
with the newly baptised infant or no? There was
an uncomfortable pause, and then, as he did not
appear, the procession set out somewhat mournfully
on the return journey, followed by the triumphant
sacristan, to whom Brontu would dearly
have liked to administer blows in place of the expected
sweets.</p>

<p>All along the route the people came out to see them
go by, and many faces, especially those of the
women, lighted up with ill-natured smiles as they
perceived that the priest was not there. Poh! It
was like the baptism of a bastard!</p>

<p>Giovanna, albeit not really expecting the priest,
grew a shade paler when the company invaded her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
chamber without him. She kissed the little purple
creature sadly, feeling as though the outlook for
the poor child was very dark indeed.</p>

<p>"I remembered every word of the creed from
beginning to end," announced the godfather.
"Happy mother, your child will be a wonder, as
tall as its godmother and as gay as its godfather!"</p>

<p>"If only it may be as prosperous as its godfather,"
murmured Giovanna.</p>

<p>"And now," cried the young man, joyously clapping
his hands, "come to dinner. What a pleasant
custom it is! Upon my honour, it is a charming
custom!" And he clapped his hands again, as
though calling a crowd of children.</p>

<p>They all took their places at table, where the
macaroni, which had already been served, was to
be followed by a beautiful roast pig exhaling an
odour of rosemary.</p>

<p class="break">It was only a few days after the baptism that a
strange though not unprecedented event occurred
in Orlei.</p>

<p>Near Isidoro Pane's hut was an ancient dungheap,
abandoned for so long that it had become
almost petrified. It was covered with a growth of
sickly-looking vegetation, and emitted no odour,
looking like some sort of artificial mound.</p>

<p>One evening at about dusk, while the fisherman
was preparing his supper, he heard sounds in the
direction of this mound, and went to the door to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
see what they were. The weather was cold, and
in the clear, greenish twilight he saw a group of
black figures, chiefly women, advancing, singing to
the accompaniment of some instrument.</p>

<p>Isidoro understood what it was and went to
meet them. The women, about twenty in all, old
and young, were chanting in a melancholy monotone,
with sudden breaks and changes, a weird song
or exorcism against the bite of a tarantula; while
a blind beggar, a pallid young man, miserably clad
in soiled and ragged woman's clothing, accompanied
them on a primitive instrument called a
<i lang="it">serraia</i>&mdash;a sort of cithern, made out of a dried
sow's bladder.</p>

<p>There were only three other men in the party,
and in one of these, with a flushed, feverish face,
and one hand bound up, the fisherman recognised
Giacobbe Dejas.</p>

<p>Isidoro advanced, and joining the party laid one
finger on the bandaged hand, Giacobbe, meanwhile,
gazing at him wildly, his eyes transfixed with terror.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid you are going to die from a
tarantula bite? No, no," said Isidoro, smiling.</p>

<p>The women continued their chant. There were
seven widows, seven wives, and seven maids. One
of the widows was Giacobbe's sister. She walked
at his side, fresh and pink as ever, notwithstanding
her wild state of alarm and anxiety; and her shrill
little voice, like the note of a lively cricket, trilled
and trembled high above all the others.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is suffering," said one of the men to Isidoro
in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Ah?" said the fisherman gravely.</p>

<p>The words chanted by the women ran as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"Saint Peter he walked down to the sea<br /><br /></span>
<span>And into the water his keys dropped he.<br /><br /></span>
<span>Then the Lord unto him did say:<br /><br /></span>
<span>'My Peter, what is it ails thee to-day?'<br /><br /></span>
<span>'Of deadly bites I bear the smart<br /><br /></span>
<span>In my two feet, and my back, and my heart.'<br /><br /></span>
<span>'Peter, take of the sad thorn-tree<a name="Anchor-7" id="Anchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a><br /><br /></span>
<span>Pounded as fine as fine may be;<br /><br /></span>
<span>Take it three days for thy wound.<br /><br /></span>
<span>So shall Peter be made sound.'<br /><br /></span>
<span>Tarantula, with the painted belly,<br /><br /></span>
<span>You have a daughter straitly born,<br /><br /></span>
<span>Straitly is your daughter born.<br /><br /></span>
<span>One for the mountain I leave forlorn;<br /><br /></span>
<span>One for the mountain, and one for the valley.<br /><br /></span>
<span>You have killed me, and I will kill you."<br /><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Meanwhile the group had stopped in front of
the mound. The two men, who were provided with
spades, began to dig, and Isidoro stood waiting with
Giacobbe, the chanting women, and the blind man
still playing on his strange instrument. Giacobbe
silently watched the operations of his two friends,
and Isidoro watched him, puzzled by the transformation
he had undergone; he seemed, indeed, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
an altogether different person; his face was inflamed,
and drawn with fright, and the little eyes,
which usually twinkled so shrewdly from beneath
their bald brows, were dim with a childish terror
of death.
When they had come to the end of the chant, the
women began again at the first line, the instrument
continuing the accompaniment on the same
monotonous key as before. It sounded like the
humming of a swarm of bees in flight. Puffs of
icy wind blew from the west, cutting the faces of
the group gathered about the mound, like knives.
The purple-blue of the sky was fading into a greenish
tint, like the face of a lake when the sun has
left it; and over the entire scene there hung a pall
of indescribable melancholy&mdash;the dull, cold twilight,
the darkening uplands, the black village, the
shadowy group of people, performing a superstitious
rite with all the faith of heathen idolaters.<a name="Anchor-8" id="Anchor-8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a>
The two men dug with friendly zeal, throwing
up spadefuls of black earth mixed with rags, egg-shells,
and refuse of all kinds. As it covered their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
feet and legs, they would mount higher, bending to
their task, panting and sweating, while the women
continued their chant, and the blind man his monotonous
accompaniment.</p>

<p>A hole of sufficient depth having at last been dug,
Aunt Anna-Rosa, never ceasing for an instant to
emit the same shrill, mournful sounds, helped Giacobbe
to remove his coat, and then, taking him by
the hand, they led him to the edge of the excavation.
He jumped in at a bound, and the two men,
pushing him down with their hands, hastily piled
on the earth, until he was buried up to the neck.</p>

<p>The performance that then took place was even
more extraordinary. The head, looking as though
it had been severed from the body and stuck in
the centre of this heap of refuse, was surrounded
by sparse vegetation, which trembled in the breeze
as though affrighted; while overhead hung the
melancholy sky. Hardly had the two men completed
their task, and stood,&mdash;the one wiping the
perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve, and
the other knocking off the dirt that was sticking
to his hands,&mdash;when the women closed in a circle
around the head, and began to dance to the sound
of their own chanting voices and the instrument
still played by the blind man, who stood with his
sightless balls and pale, impassive face turned towards
the distant horizon. This continued for some
time; then the dancing ceased, the circle broke, but
the chanting still went on. Isidoro and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
men threw themselves on the mound, and with
spades and hands, had soon disinterred Giacobbe.
He was perspiring profusely when he emerged, covered
with dirt, and his face and neck were purple.
He said he had felt as though he would suffocate;
then he shook himself and thrust first one arm and
then the other into the sleeves of the coat which
his sister held ready.</p>

<p>"Well, so you are not going to die after all,
little spring bird?" said Isidoro jokingly. The
other, however, made no reply; the cold wind struck
his perspiring body with an icy chill, his face grew
pallid, and his teeth chattered.</p>

<p>They walked off in the direction of Aunt Anna-Rosa's
house, Isidoro, who by this time had lost
all interest in his supper, accompanying them.</p>

<p>"Did you kill it?" he enquired of the sick man,
remembering to have heard that if one kills a tarantula
with his ring finger he acquires the power to
cure the bite with a simple touch of the same
finger.</p>

<p>"No," said Giacobbe; and then, while the weird
chanting still continued, he gave an account of his
misfortune.</p>

<p>"I was asleep; suddenly I felt something like the
sting of a wasp. I woke up all in a perspiration.
Ah, it had stung me! It had stung me! The horrible
tarantula! I saw it as plain as I see you, but
it was some distance off, on the wall. Ah, the devil
take you, accursed creature! So I came right home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Do you know, I am afraid to die; I've been afraid
for ever so long."</p>

<p>"But we all have to die some time, whenever the
hour comes," said Isidoro seriously.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true; we all have to some time,"
agreed one of the men; "but that is poor consolation
for Giacobbe Dejas."</p>

<p>"My legs feel as though they had been broken,"
he groaned. "And oh, my spine! it is just as
though some one had struck it with an axe! I am
going to die; I know I am going to die&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As they passed along, the people came out of their
houses to watch them go by, but it was like a funeral
procession; no one spoke, nor did any one
follow them. Giacobbe's eyes grew dim, and presently
he stumbled and clutched hold of Isidoro for
support.</p>

<p>The women were moving along on a trot, like a
herd of colts; their voices rose, fell, rose again, and
seemed to die away into the chill night air, overpowered
at last by the even, strident notes of the
cithern, like the gasps of some wounded animal left
to die alone in the forest.</p>

<p>At last they reached the little widow's house. A
fire was burning in the slate-stone fireplace in the
centre of the kitchen, laid on a little heap of live coals
which had just been taken out of the oven. This
last, a huge, round affair having a hole in the top
to allow the smoke to escape, occupied one corner,
its square door being quite large enough to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of the passage of a man's body. Into its still hot
interior Giacobbe accordingly now crept, the soles
of his heavy shoes appearing in the opening, their
worn nails shining in the firelight.</p>

<p>Placing themselves around the oven and the fireplace,
the women continued their exorcism with renewed
vigour, the red and purple lights from the
fire falling upon their white blouses and yellow
bodices. Aunt Anna-Rosa's round, open mouth
looked like a black hole in the middle of her pink,
shining face. The blind man, conscious of the fire,
felt his way towards it little by little, though without
ceasing to play. Reaching the edge of the fireplace,
he put one of his bare feet upon the hot stone.
"Zs-s&mdash;&mdash;" whispered Uncle Isidoro warningly.
"Look out, boy, or you'll have a surprise."</p>

<p>The words were not out of his mouth when the
youth gave a sudden bound backwards, shaking his
burned foot in the air. For a moment he stopped
playing, but the women never faltered. Standing
there, erect and immovable around the huge oven,
they might have been intoning a funeral dirge over
some prehistoric sepulchre.</p>

<p>"He is coming out!" cried Aunt Anna-Rosa
suddenly, and Giacobbe's great feet could be seen issuing
from the oven. At the same instant the house-door
was thrown violently open, and the black-robed
figure of Priest Elias appeared. On hearing what
had occurred he had at once hastened to the house,
hoping to arrive in time at least to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
ordeal of the oven. He was flushed and breathless,
and his eyes flashed. On catching sight of him
one of the women gave a scream and others stopped
chanting, while the rest motioned to them to continue.
Giacobbe, meanwhile, had got out of the
oven.</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" commanded the priest, panting.
"Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? No?"</p>

<p>They all became silent.</p>

<p>"Go," he said, opening the door and holding it
with one hand, while with the other he almost
pushed the women out. When the last had gone
he became aware for the first time of the presence
of Isidoro, and his face fell. "You too?" he said
reproachfully. "Extraordinary, most extraordinary!
Don't you see what you have done among
you to that poor man?" Then changing his tone,
"Quick," he said, "go at once for the doctor as
fast as you can. And as for you," turning to Giacobbe,
"get to bed at once."</p>

<p>The sick man asked for nothing better; he was
burning with fever, his head was shaking, and he
could hardly see. Isidoro went off in search of the
doctor, somewhat mortified and yet, in spite of his
usually hard common sense, his intelligence, and his
deeply religious nature, quite unable to see what
harm there could be in trying to cure a tarantula
sting with the rites, chants, and incantations employed
by one's forebears from the days when giants
inhabited the <i>Nuraghes</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>The women had scattered into groups along the
street and were discussing the occurrence, some of
them a little ashamed, while others were inclined
to blame the priest. One irrepressible young girl
was beating her hands in time and singing the lament
which should have been chanted in chorus
around Giacobbe's bed had not the priest's arrival
prevented:</p>

<p>
"'Oh, mother of the spider!<br />
A stroke has fallen on me.'"<br />
</p>

<p>Some of the women would have stopped Isidoro,
but he strode quickly on, buried in thought. At last
they all dispersed, and the cold, still evening settled
down on the little widow's house, while overhead
the stars looked like golden eyes veiled in tears.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h3>


<p>The room where Giacobbe lay was extremely
lofty, and so large that the oil light did
not penetrate the corners. The furniture appeared
to have been built expressly with a view to its ample
proportions; a huge, red, wooden wardrobe which
stood against the end wall, reaching clear to the ceiling.
The bed, the lower part of which was draped
with yellow curtains, was as high and massive as
a mountain. Seen thus, in the dim, flickering light,
with its black corners and great lofty white ceiling
like a cloudy sky, the room had a mysterious, uncanny
look. Little Aunt Anna-Rosa seemed almost
in danger of losing her way as she moved about
among the bulky furniture, and her shoulders hardly
reached above the counterpane when she came and
stood beside the bed where her brother lay in the
uneasy grip of the fever.</p>

<p>He seemed to himself still to be in the mound,
only the two friends who had interred him, kept
on piling the earth higher and higher about his
head. He was suffocating, the torture was almost
unendurable, and yet he dared not stop them, fearing
the cure might not be efficacious unless his head
were buried as well; and his head seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Priest Elias, on whose breast the tail of a tarantula
could be seen wriggling about.</p>

<p>In his dream Giacobbe was conscious of an almost
insane fear of death. It had occurred to him when
he was in the oven that hell, perhaps, was a huge
heated oven where the damned would sprawl
throughout eternity.</p>

<p>Now, in his dream, precisely the same feeling
was reproduced. He was in the mound, the earth
reached higher and higher about him; he shut his
mouth tight to keep from swallowing it, and there,
opposite him, he suddenly saw a lighted furnace.
It was the infernal regions. Such a feeling of terror
seized upon him that even in his dream, in his
feverish semi-consciousness, he was aware of an
overmastering desire to prove to himself that this
horror was an illusion of the senses. In the effort
he awoke, but even awake he had something of the
same sensation that stones, were they endowed with
feeling, would have in a burning building, growing
all the while hotter and hotter, and yet unable to
stir an inch. Giacobbe felt like a burning brick himself,
or a piece of live coal, a part of the infernal
fires; and waking, his terror was even more acute
than in his dream. He emitted a groan and the
noise gave him comfort; it had an earthly, human
sound, breaking in on all those diabolical sensations.</p>

<p>Isidoro, who had stayed in case the little widow
might have need of him, heard the groan from where
he sat dozing in the adjoining kitchen, and bounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to his feet in terror; he thought that Giacobbe had
died. Approaching the bed, he found the sick man
lying flat on his back, his face drawn, his eyes,
which looked almost black, wet with tears.</p>

<p>"Are you awake?" asked the fisherman in a
low voice. "Do you want anything?" He felt his
pulse, and even laid his ear against it as though
trying to hear the throbs.</p>

<p>At the same instant Giacobbe observed the round
little visage of his sister appear above the other
edge of the bed, enveloped in the folds of a large
white kerchief.</p>

<p>Then a curious thing happened: the face of the
sick man contracted, his mouth opened, his eyes
closed, and a deep sob broke the stillness of the room.
Instantly memory carried the woman back to a far-distant
day when her brother, a tiny lad, had sat
weeping on this very bed; and opening her arms
just as she had done then, she took him to her
kind bosom, murmuring words of loving remonstrance.</p>

<p>"In the name of the holy souls in purgatory!
What is it? What is the matter, little brother?"</p>

<p>Isidoro, quite at a loss, continued to feel his
friend's pulse, trying now one vein, and now another,
and muttering to himself: "How strange,
how very strange!"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it? Won't you tell me what it
is? You, Isidoro Pane, what happened?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing happened. He called out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
that was all. May be he had a bad dream. We'll
give him a drink of water. There now, here's a
little fresh water. That's it, he wants it&mdash;see how
he is drinking! You were thirsty, weren't you?
It's the fever, you see; that's what ails him!"</p>

<p>Giacobbe sat up in bed, and after drinking the
water calmed down. He had on an old white knitted
cotton shirt, through which could be seen the outline
of his small wiry body, the thick growth of
black hair on his chest contrasting oddly with the
perfectly smooth face and bald head above it. He
remained in a sitting posture, leaning forward, and
thoughtfully passing his well hand up and down the
injured arm.</p>

<p>"Yes," he remarked suddenly in the panting,
querulous tone of a person with fever. "Yes; I
had a bad dream. Whew! but it was hot! Holy
San Costantino, how hot it was! I was dreaming
of hell."</p>

<p>"Dear me, dear me, what an idea!" said his sister
reprovingly; and Uncle Isidoro said playfully:
"And so it was hot, little spring bird?"</p>

<p>The sick man seemed to be annoyed.</p>

<p>"Don't joke, and don't say 'little spring bird.'
I don't like it; I shall never say it again, and I
shall never laugh at any one again.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," he said, bending forward and
continuing to rub his arm. "Hell is a dreadful
place. I've got to die, and I've got to tell you
something first. Now listen, but don't get fright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>ened,
Anna-Rosa, because I am certainly going to
die; and Uncle Isidoro, you know it already, so I
can tell you. Well, this is it. It was I who killed
Basile Ledda."</p>

<p>Aunt Anna-Rosa's eyes and mouth flew wide
open; she leaned against the side of the bed, and
began to shake convulsively.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> knew it already?" exclaimed Isidoro. "Why,
I knew nothing at all!"</p>

<p>Giacobbe raised a terrified face, and began to
tremble as well.</p>

<p>"Don't have me arrested," he implored. "I'm
going to die, anyhow; you can tell them then. I
thought you knew. What is the matter, Anna-Ro?
Don't be frightened; don't have me arrested."</p>

<p>"It's not that," she said, raising herself. Her
first sensation of having received a blow on the head
was passing away, but now, in its place, there came
a singular feeling of some change that was taking
place within her; her own spirit seemed to have
fled in dismay, and in its place had come something
that regarded the world, life, heaven, earth&mdash;God
himself&mdash;from a totally different standpoint; and
everything viewed in the light of this new spirit
was full of horror, misery, chaos.</p>

<p>"I will not tell any one. No, no! But how could
you ever suppose that I knew about it?" protested
Isidoro. He felt no especial horror of Giacobbe,
only profound pity; but at the same time he thought
it would be better, now, for him to die.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, simultaneously, their thoughts all flew to
Costantino, and hardly left him again.</p>

<p>"Lie down," said Isidoro, smoothing out the pillow.
But the other only shook his head and began
to talk again in the same querulous, laboured voice,
now beseeching, now almost angry:</p>

<p>"I thought you must know about it; and so, you
never did, after all? Well, that's so; how could
you? But I was afraid of you all the same. I had
an idea that I could read it in your eyes. Do you
remember that night at your house, when you said:
'It might be you who killed him'? I was frightened
that night. Then, there was that other time&mdash;Assumption
Day&mdash;here in this very house, you
called me 'murderer.' I knew it was a joke, but
it frightened me because I was afraid of you, anyhow.
So then, when I said that about you and
my sister getting married, I meant it. I thought it
might give me a sort of hold on you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Christ! Oh, holy little Jesus!" sobbed the
widow.</p>

<p>Giacobbe looked at her for a moment.</p>

<p>"You are scared, eh? You wonder what made
me do it? Well, I'll tell you. I hated that man; he
had flogged me, and he owed me money. But I
thought it would kill me when they condemned Costantino
Ledda. Why didn't I confess then? Is
that what you want to say? Ah, it sounds all very
easy now, but you can't do it. Costantino is a
strong young man, I thought to myself; I shall die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
long before he does, and then I'll confess the whole
thing. And I can tell you that that thing that Giovanna
Era did made me a hundred years older.
What is Costantino going to say when he comes
back? What is he going to say?" he repeated softly
to himself.</p>

<p>"What ought we to do?" said Aunt Anna-Rosa,
burying her face in the bedclothes and groaning. She
felt as though it must all be some frightful dream;
yet, not for a single instant did she contemplate concealing
her brother's crime. And afterwards?&mdash;One
of two equally horrible things must happen.
Either Giacobbe would die, or he would be sent to
prison. She could not tell which of the two she
dreaded most.</p>

<p>"Now we must lie down and rest; to-morrow
will be time enough to talk of what is the best thing
to do," said Isidoro, again smoothing out the pillow.
Giacobbe turned over and laid himself down; then,
raising his left hand, he began to count off on his
fingers: "Priest Elias, one; the magistrate, two;
then&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;Brontu Dejas; yes, I
want him particularly. They must all come here,
and I will make a confession."</p>

<p>"Brontu Dejas!" repeated Isidoro with stupefaction.</p>

<p>"Yes; they will take his word sooner than any
one's. But first, you've all got to swear on the crucifix
that you'll let me die in peace. I'm frightened.
You'll let me die in peace, won't you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, of course; don't worry now. And you,
little godmother, go back to bed; get as much rest
and sleep as you can," said the fisherman, quietly
drawing the clothes up about Giacobbe, who kept
throwing them off, turning restlessly, and shaking
his head.</p>

<p>"I'm hot," said he. "I tell you I'm hot. Let
me alone. Why aren't you more surprised. Uncle
'Sidoro? I went on hiring out to keep people from
suspecting anything; but you knew all along; oh,
yes! you knew well enough!"</p>

<p>"I tell you I knew nothing at all, child of grace."</p>

<p>"Then why aren't you surprised?"</p>

<p>"Because," replied the old man in a grave voice,
"such strange things are always happening; it is
the way of the world. Now keep the covers over
you, and try to go to sleep."</p>

<p>The widow, who appeared not to have been listening
to what the two men were saying, now raised
her face. Poor, little, fresh face! It had suddenly
grown yellow and wrinkled; all the years that had
passed over it without being able to leave any trace,
had, in the last five minutes, taken their revenge!</p>

<p>"Giacobbe," said the little woman, "what need
is there of calling in witnesses? Why should we
have any one else? Won't <i>I</i> do?" She straightened
herself and looked at Isidoro, who, in turn,
looked at the sick man.</p>

<p>"Why, that's true!" they exclaimed together.</p>

<p>A sudden atmosphere of relief fell on the dimly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
lighted room. The patient, with a sigh, stretched
himself quietly out, remained still for a few moments,
and finally fell asleep. The little widow,
likewise following Isidoro's advice, went back to
bed. The ponderous front of the great red wardrobe
seemed to be brooding over the scene; and the
shadowy ceiling to overhang it like the sky above
a deserted hamlet. All those inanimate objects
seemed to repeat gravely to one another the old
fisherman's words: "It is the way of the world!"</p>

<p class="break">The Orlei physician, Dr. Puddu, was a coarse, fat
beast of a man. Once upon a time he, too, had had
his high ideals; but Fate having cast him into this
out-of-the-way corner of the world where the people
were rarely, if ever, ill, he had taken to drink; at
first, because, being from the South, he felt the cold;
and afterwards because he found that wine and liquor
were very much to his taste. In these days,
in addition to his intemperate habits, he had become
a Free Thinker, so that even the villagers had lost
all respect for him. Giacobbe had complained of
a pain in his side, and Doctor Puddu, after cauterising
the tarantula bite, had said roughly:</p>

<p>"You fool, people don't die of these things. If
you do die, it will only be because you are an ass."
And Aunt Anna-Rosa had looked at him angrily,
and muttered something under her breath.</p>

<p>Poor little Aunt Anna-Rosa! It did not take
much to anger her in these days; she quarrelled, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>deed,
with every one except the patient. And how
old she looked! After that night her face had remained
yellow and drawn; she looked like a different
person, and her brother's revelation had worked
a singular change in her both physically and morally.
She was constantly tormented by the question
as to how Giacobbe ever could have brought himself
to kill any one. He, who was always as merry and
gentle as a lamb! How in the name of the holy
souls in purgatory had he ever done it? And our
father, he was no thief, not he! He was a God-fearing
man, and always so kind and gay that when
any of the neighbours were in trouble they invariably
came to him to be cheered up.</p>

<p>The little woman's heart swelled as she thought
of her old father long since dead, but suddenly a
mist seemed to rise in her brain, and her face contracted
with the horror of a terrible thought.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he, too, the kindly, good old man had
committed some crime! Why not? No one could be
trusted any more, living or dead, old or young."
And then she fell to crying, beating her breast with
her tiny fists, and bitterly repenting of her wicked
doubts.</p>

<p>When, approaching the bedside, she would find the
patient's face drawn with suffering, his wide, terror-stricken
eyes, meanwhile, seeming to implore death
to spare him, an infinite tide of pity would well up
within her, a rush of maternal tenderness, a sorrow
beyond words. More than ever was he her little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
brother, her boy, curled up on the great bed; so
frightened, so shrunken with suffering! And while
everything else, every one else, even the sacred dead,
even innocent children, aroused hateful suspicions, he
alone, he of them all, called for pity, tenderness, a
passionate and consuming love, that was like melting
wax within her. Yet she must see him, and she
was seeing him,&mdash;die. More than that, she must
wish for his death. All the while that she was
nursing him with tenderest care, she must hope that
her watchfulness, the medicines, everything, would
fail. Moreover, death, that awful thing which she
must ardently desire for the "little brother" whom
she loved, when it came would bring, not only the
deep, natural sorrow of her loss, but that other
horror, the announcement of his guilt.</p>

<p>Of all the burdens that pressed upon her, however,
the hardest to bear was the fact that the sick
man was perfectly conscious of her attitude towards
him.</p>

<p>On the third day of his illness, Isidoro had
brought, with great secrecy and mystery, a medicine
obtained from the sacristan. It was a concoction
made of olive-oil, into which had been plunged three
scorpions, a centipede, a tarantula, a spider, and
a poisonous fungus; it was considered a cure for
any kind of sting. Aunt Anna-Rosa applied it
at once to the patient's puffed and swollen hand,
he allowing her to do it, and watching the operation
intently. Then he said:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you take all this trouble for me, Anna-Ro?
Don't you want me to die?"</p>

<p>Her heart sank, while he continued quietly, addressing
Isidoro: "And you? You brought me this,
but just suppose it were to cure me, what would
you do then?"</p>

<p>"God will look after that; leave it to him," said
the fisherman.</p>

<p>Giacobbe lay quiet for a few moments; then he
said:</p>

<p>"Shall you two go together to the magistrate's?"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"To the magistrate's; it's cold, though, now, and
it's a long way to go; you must not go on horse-back,
Anna-Rosa, do you hear? You will have
to have a carriage to drive to Nuoro."</p>

<p>"What for?" she faltered distressedly, pretending
not to understand.</p>

<p>"Why, to see the magistrate, of course."</p>

<p>She scolded him, and then went into the kitchen
and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"Here is your oil," she said presently, as Isidoro
came out and prepared to leave. "You could not
do anything but bring it, of course. When is Priest
Elias coming?"</p>

<p>"This evening."</p>

<p>"Yes, he ought to; Giacobbe must confess. Time
is flying, and he is very ill; last night he didn't close
an eye. Ah!" she added suddenly, "he seems to
me just like some wounded bird."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have the Dejases been here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! They've been here, both of them,
mother and son. Brontu has been here twice. Oh,
they all come!" she said desperately, "but what
good does it do? They can't cure him; they can't
give him either life or death."</p>

<p>"Either one would be equally a blessing or a curse
to him," said Isidoro, carefully wrapping his red
handkerchief around the vial of oil.</p>

<p>"As they are for most of us!" said the woman.</p>

<p>Soon after, the doctor arrived in a shrunken overcoat,
with the collar turned up. He had been drinking
already, and smelled strong of spirits; his lips
were white, and he puffed, and spat about, sometimes
over himself. He seemed somewhat startled,
however, when he saw his patient's condition.</p>

<p>"What the devil's the matter with you?" he demanded
roughly. "Your side? your side? You've
got the devil in your side. Let's have a look." He
threw back the covers, exposing Giacobbe's hairy
chest; passing his hand up and down his side, he
listened with his ear close to the patient's back. "It's
all nonsense," he said. "You've worked yourself
up like some old woman." Then he replaced the
covers carelessly, and went out. At the door, however,
he turned and fixed Aunt Anna-Rosa with
his eye.</p>

<p>"Woman," he said, "let him see the priest at
once; he has pneumonia."</p>

<p>At dusk Giacobbe confessed; then he called his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
sister. "Anna-Ro," he said, "Priest Elias is going
to Nuoro with you too. You must be sure to have
a carriage on account of the cold."</p>

<p>It was, in fact, snowing then, and the big room
was filled with the white reflected light.</p>

<p>Priest Elias looked attentively at Aunt Anna-Rosa,
for whom he had an especially tender feeling
on account of a fancied resemblance to his mother.
The poor little black-robed figure seemed to him to
have shrunken in the past few days, and now she
was hanging her head in a pitiful, shamefaced way;
bowed with mortification at her "little brother's"
disgrace.</p>

<p>Instinctively the priest understood the heroic part
that quivering soul had been called upon to play
in this tragedy, and he breathed an inward benediction
upon her.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h3>


<p>It was the month of May, and the wild valley
of the Isalle, usually so forbidding and rugged,
lay smiling in the sun, adorned with tall grass and
clumps of flowering shrubs and fields of barley,
which rippled in the breeze like cloths of greenish
gold. It was as though some old pagan, drunk with
sunlight and sweet scents, had decked himself out
in branches and garlands.</p>

<p>The clear, liquid note of a wild bird would occasionally
pierce the silence of the valley, then die
away, drowned in the fragrance of the narcissuses
and flowering broom, which gleamed like nuggets of
molten gold on the very edges of the loftiest cliffs,
as though peeping over to see what lay in the ravine
below.</p>

<p>A spendthrift fay had passed along, scattering
flowers, colours, scents, with a reckless hand. Some
meadows in the distance, pranked with ranunculuses,
looked like stretches of green water reflecting a
starry sky. Here and there a group of trees nodded
and whispered together in the breeze. The sun had
but just sunk and the west was still glowing like
the cheek of a ripe peach; while in the east the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
mountains lay like a huge parure of precious stones
set in a case of lilac satin.</p>

<p>Costantino Ledda, liberated only a few hours before
at Nuoro, was returning to his native village
on foot, descending leisurely into the valley, his
small canvas pack slung on his back. Now and
then he would stop and look around him curiously.</p>

<p>"Ha! the valley seems smaller, perhaps because
I have seen the sea," he murmured.</p>

<p>He looked older; his face was clean-shaven and
intensely white; but otherwise he had none of the
tragic air which would have been appropriate under
the circumstances. He was coming back in this
manner,&mdash;alone and on foot,&mdash;because he had not
been able to say precisely what day he would be
freed; otherwise some one, relative or friend, would
certainly have gone to meet him. Besides, his impatience
to reach home would brook no delay.
Down and down the mountain-side he went; he was
almost gay, possibly because of some wine he had
drunk at Nuoro, where he had also provided himself
with more for the journey. As he continued
to descend his legs would occasionally double up
under him, but he cared little for so trifling an inconvenience
as that.</p>

<p>"Why," he said to himself, "when I am tired I
have only to lie down and go to sleep. I have
plenty of bread and wine in my bag; what more
could any one want? I'm as free as the birds
of the air. Yes, that's true; I am free; I'm a bach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>elor
now; that's a funny thing; once I was a married
man with a wife, and now I'm a bachelor." He
thought that he found this idea amusing.</p>

<p>Down and down, now watching the sandy path,
winding between high grass on either side, now
gazing at the birds to whom he had compared
himself, as they flew hither and thither, at times
almost skimming the ground, then darting into
the bushes where they would find a roosting-place
for the night. He thought of the prison magpie,
and felt a sudden tightening at his heart. Yes;
it was true he had been sorry, when the time came
to leave that place of torment&mdash;the companions
whom he disliked so heartily, the horrible, enclosing
walls, the strip of sky that for all those years had
seemed to overhang the prison courtyard like a
metal lid.</p>

<p>After the death of the real culprit days and
months had elapsed before Justice had completed
its leisurely formalities and the innocent man could
be liberated. During these months Costantino, informed
of the event, had been wild with impatience,
and the days had seemed like years; yet, when the
moment of departure actually came, he nearly wept.</p>

<p>This emotion, however, which was apparently
the outcome of pity and sympathy for the beings
whom he was leaving behind, was, in reality, for
the things he was leaving behind; for all those inanimate
objects that had engulfed and swallowed
up his life&mdash;both his past and his future. Now this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
sorrow was done with, everything was done with;
even that horrible torture that followed Giovanna's
act was all so much a thing of the past that he
really fancied that he could laugh at it.</p>

<p>Down, and down; he reached the bottom of the
valley and began to skirt the edge of the Isalle.
The sunset sky was still bright, and here and there
the water shone between the oleanders and rushes,
or reflected the rose and yellow lights in the sky.
The delicate lace umbrellas of the elder-flower, and
the brilliant coral blossoms of the oleanders stood
out in the clear atmosphere as though from a setting
of silver. Costantino, by this time very tired, began
to think that perhaps the valley was not, after
all, so small as it had seemed at first.</p>

<p>"I can sleep out of doors perfectly well," he
thought, "but it would have been so amusing to
walk up to Isidoro's door&mdash;Bang, bang&mdash;'Who's
there?' 'I'&mdash;'Who's I?' 'Why, Costantino
Ledda!' How astonished old Isidoro would look!
Perhaps he would be singing the lauds; may be
<i>those</i> lauds, who knows? Why, let's see! <i>I</i> wrote
a set of lauds once! How extraordinary that
seems!"</p>

<p>He wondered over many incidents of the past as
a boy will sometimes be astonished to think of things
he did as a child. But the present held many surprises
as well. The glory of the springtide amazed
him, as did the length of time it took to cross
a valley that appeared to be so small. But most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of all he wondered to think that he was crossing
it on his way back to his own village.</p>

<p>He was walking now between two fields of grain
above which the slanting light threw a veil of golden
haze, and its surface, rippled by the breeze, seemed
stroked by an invisible hand.</p>

<p>He went on picturing his arrival, Isidoro having
written to ask him to come straight to his house:
"'Come in,' he will say, and then, 'Giacobbe Dejas
is dead; it was he who did it!'&mdash;'I know that
already. The devil! Is that all you have to tell
me?' 'Well, then, your wife has married some one
else.' 'I know that too.' 'Then why don't you
cry?' 'Why on earth should I? I have cried
enough; I don't want to any more now. I've crossed
the sea; I've seen the world. I'm not a boy any
longer; nothing makes much difference to me any
more.'" But at the very moment when he was
boasting to himself of his indifference and worldly
cynicism, an icy grip closed about his heart.</p>

<p>Oh! to be going back to find the little house, Giovanna,
his child, his past!</p>

<p>"There is nothing left," he said aloud. "The
storm has swept over it and carried everything
away, everything, everything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He threw himself down on the edge of the field
of grain in an agony of grief. It was often this
way; the great tempest of sorrow had broken over
him long before and seemingly passed on; but instead
of that it had only hidden itself for a time; it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
there now, stealing along, keeping pace with him;
for long distances he would not see its evil shape;
then suddenly it would leap forth, bursting through
the ground at his very feet and whirling around its
victim, clutch him by the throat, beat him to the
ground, suffocate him&mdash;then leave him spent, exhausted.</p>

<p>After a while Costantino sat up, unfastened his
wallet, and drew out a dried gourd filled with wine,
throwing his head back, he took a deep draught;
then he put it away, and sat looking around him at
the sea of grain on whose golden-green surface
floated splotches of crimson poppies. Somewhat
revived he presently resumed his journey, but all
the eagerness and spring with which he had set
out had died away. What did it matter whether
he got home this day or the next, since there was
no one to expect him? And so he plodded on till
the first shadows of approaching night overtook
him just as he reached the end of the valley. The
crickets had turned out like a tribe of mowers with
their tiny silver sickles, the scent of the shrubs and
flowers hung heavy in the warm air; the breeze had
died away, and the birds were silent; but the black
triangles of the bats circled swiftly in the luminous
grey dusk.</p>

<p>Oh, that divine melancholy of a spring evening!
Felt even by happy souls, may it not be an inherited
homesickness, transmitted through all the ages?
A longing for the flowers, and perfumes, and joys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of that eternal, albeit earthly, paradise which our
first parents lost for us forever.</p>

<p>Costantino tramped on and on: he had passed
long years under a brutal oppression, between infected
walls, amid corrupt companions in an environment
whose very air was confined, and now&mdash;he
was walking in the open, treading grass and
stones under foot! As he ascended the mountain
from the valley below, every step brought more of
the horizon into view and a wider expanse of soft,
overhanging sky as boundless as liberty itself. And
yet,&mdash;and yet,&mdash;never in all those years of imprisonment
had he experienced a sense of such utter
hopelessness as that with which he now saw the
shadows fall from those free skies. He was pressing
on, but whither? and why? He had set forth
eager, elated, as one hastening to a place where
pleasant things await him. Now he wondered at
himself. In the uncertain twilight he seemed to
have lost his way; his journey had turned out to
be vain, abortive. He was trudging on aimlessly; he
had no country, nor home, nor family; he would
never reach any destination; he had gone astray,
and was wandering about in a boundless, desert
tract, as grey and cheerless as the sky above him,
where the stars were like camp-fires lighted by
solitary travellers who, unknown to one another,
wandered, lost like himself, in the unwished-for and
oppressive liberty of the trackless wilderness.</p>

<p>And yet it was not the actual thought of Gio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>vanna
herself that weighed him down, nor yet his
lost happiness, nor the misery that a wholly undeserved
fate had forced upon him; all these things
had long ago so eaten into his soul that they had
come to form a part of his very nature, and he had
grown almost to forget them, as one forgets the
shirt he has on his back. Now his grief fastened
upon memories of certain specific objects which had
passed out of the setting of his life, and which he
could never recover.</p>

<p>His mind dwelt, for instance, persistently on the
little common in front of Giovanna's cottage, the
stones in the old wall where they used to sit together
on summer evenings, and above all on the
great, wide bed, where he would lay himself down
beside her after the hard day's work was over. He
felt now as though he might be going home at the
close of one of those long, toilsome days. But now&mdash;now&mdash;where
was he to turn for rest and ease?
Thus, up through the load of unhappiness that bore
him down, all-pervading and indefinable as the fragrance
of the wild growth about him, a sense of
physical discomfort forced itself; he was conscious
of hunger and weariness.</p>

<p>Reaching the top of a knoll, he sat down and
opened his wallet. Night had fallen, but the atmosphere
was clear and bright; the mountains which
hid the sea on the east were bathed in moonlight,
and the Milky Way spanned the heavens like a
white, deserted causeway; in the west a pale, uncer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>tain
reflection hung over the distant sea; a magical
aurora encircled the mountains. The path stood
out distinctly, and the round, compact clumps of
bushes might have been a scattered flock of black
sheep. No sound broke the stillness but the mournful
hoot of an owl.</p>

<p>Costantino ate and drank; then, stretching himself
out on the ground, he allowed his gaze to wander
for a moment along that vast white roadway
that traversed the heavens; then he shut his eyes,
and the sense of bodily comfort, the repose for his
tired limbs, and the effect of the food and drink
were such that he became almost cheerful again.
Hardly, however, had his lids closed, when all his
prison companions began to troop before his vision,
and he seemed to be seated at work at his shoemaker's
bench. The thought of all the wonderful
things he would have to tell his friends at Orlei
then came into his mind, and filled him with such
childish pride that he had an impulse to get up at
once and push on so as to get there without delay.</p>

<p>"Yes, I must get up and go on," he said, and
then, "No, I won't; I shall stay here and go to
sleep; I am very sleepy; no, I must get on,"&mdash;the
words came confusedly this time. "Isidoro Pane
expects me. I shall say, 'What a lot of people I
have met! I have seen the sea; I know a man who
is a marshal, Burrai is his name; he's going to
get me a position of shoemaker in the king's household.'
Now I am going to get up and start&mdash;start&mdash;star&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
But he did not. Confused visions
flitted across his brain. The <i>King of Spades</i>, astride
of a donkey, came riding down that great white
road that stretched across the sky; all at once he
heard him cry out,&mdash;once,&mdash;twice,&mdash;three times.
He was calling Costantino, who, opening his sleepy
eyes, shut them again, and then opened them wide:
"Idiot," he muttered; "it's the owl; yes, I'm going
directly; I'm going&mdash;&mdash;" And he fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, the great, shining face of the
moon was still high in the heavens; with its flood
of steely light there came a fall of dew. Enormous
shadows, like vast black veils, hung over certain
parts of the mountains, but every crag, every thicket
and flower even, stood clearly out wherever the
moonlight fell. The owl still gave his penetrating
cry, sharp and metallic, cutting through the silence
like a blade of steel. Costantino shivered; he was
wet with dew, and getting up, he yawned loudly;
the prolonged "Ah&mdash;ah-h-h" fairly resounded in
the intense stillness. He scrutinised the heavens to
find out the hour. The <i>Star</i>, that is to say, Diana,
had not yet lifted her emerald-gold face above the
sea; dawn therefore was still a long way off, and
Costantino resumed his journey, hoping to reach
the village before the people should be about. He
did not want to meet the gaze of the curious, and
above all else he dreaded being seen by Giovanna
or her mother. He had made up his mind to avoid
them, if possible not even to see them or pass by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
their cottage; what good would it do? Everything
was over between them.</p>

<p>So he trudged on, and on; now up, now down;
along the moonlit mountain-side. The heaps of
slate-stone, the asphodels heavy with dew, the very
rocks themselves, gave out a damp, penetrating
odour, and here and there a rill of water stole in
and out between fragrant beds of pennyroyal. As
far away as the eye could reach, blue, vapoury skies
overhung blue, misty mountains, until, in the extreme
distance, they met and melted into one shimmering
sea of silver. The man walked on, and on;
his brain yet only half awake, but his body refreshed
and active. Now and then he would take a short-cut,
leaping from rock to rock, then pausing breathless,
with straining heart and pulses. In the
moon's rays his limpid eyes showed flecks of silver
light.</p>

<p>The further he went the more familiar the way
became; now he was inhaling the wild fragrance
of his native soil; he recognised the melancholy <i lang="it">salti</i>
sown with barley, the grain not yet turned; the
beds of lentisks, the sparse trees whispering in some
passing breath of wind, like old people murmuring
in their sleep; and there, far off, the range of mighty
sphinxes blue in the moonlight; and further still,
the flash of the sea, that sea that he was so proud
to have crossed in no matter what fashion. On
reaching the little church of San Francisco he
paused, and, cap in hand, said a prayer, a perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
honest and sincere one, for at that moment his freedom
gave him a sense of happiness such as he had
not as yet experienced at any time since leaving
the prison.</p>


<p class="break">Day had hardly begun to break when Isidoro
heard a tapping at his door. For fifteen&mdash;twenty
days, for four months, in fact, he had been waiting
for that sound, and he was on his feet before his
old heart had started its mad beating against his
breast.</p>

<p>He opened the door; in the dim light he saw, or
half saw, a tall figure not dressed in the costume
of the country, but wearing a fustian coat as hard
and stiff as leather, out of which emerged a long,
pallid face. He did not know who it was.</p>

<p>Costantino burst into a harsh laugh, and the fisherman,
with a pang, recognised his friend. Yes,
at last; it was Costantino come back, but in that
very first moment he knew it was not the Costantino
of other days. He threw his arms around him,
but without kissing him, and his heart melted into
tears.</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't know me, after all," said
Costantino, unstrapping his wallet. "I knew you
wouldn't."</p>

<p>Even his voice and accent were strange; and now,
after his first sensations, first of chill and then of
pity, Isidoro felt a sort of diffidence. "What are
you dressed that way for?" he asked. "If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
had let me know I would have brought you your
clothes to Nuoro, and a horse too. Did you come
all the way on foot?"</p>

<p>"No; San Francisco lent me a horse. What are
you about, Uncle Isidoro? I don't want any coffee.
Have you got any brandy?"</p>

<p>The fisherman, who had begun to uncover the
fire, got up from his knees, embarrassed and mortified
at having nothing better to offer his guest than
a little coffee.</p>

<p>"I didn't know," he stammered, spreading out
his hands, "but just wait a moment, I'll go right
off&mdash;you see I expected you, and I didn't expect
you&mdash;&mdash;" And he started for the door.</p>

<p>"Stop; where are you going?" cried the other,
seizing hold of him. "I don't want anything at
all. I only said it for a joke. Sit down here."</p>

<p>Isidoro seated himself, and began to look furtively
at Costantino; little by little he grew more
at ease with him, and presently passing his hand
over his trousers he asked if he intended to go
on dressing that way. In the early morning light
streaming through the open door, Costantino's face
looked worn and grey.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with another of those disagreeable
laughs, "I am going on dressing this way.
I am going away soon."</p>

<p>"Going away soon! Where to?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I have met so many people," began Costantino,
in the tone of one reciting a lesson. "And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
I have friends who will help me. What is there
for me to do here, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Why, shoemaking! Didn't you write to me
that that was what you wanted to do?"</p>

<p>"I know a marshal named Burrai," continued
Costantino, who always thought of the <i>King of
Spades</i> as still holding office. "He lives in Rome
now, and he's written me a letter; he's going to get
me a position in the King's household to be shoemaker."</p>

<p>Isidoro looked at him pitifully. "Ah, the poor
fellow, he was altogether different. What made
him talk like that, and tell all those foolish little
things when there were such heartrending topics
to discuss." Thus Uncle Isidoro to his own heart.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, however, he began to suspect that
Costantino was putting all this on, and that his
apparent indifference was assumed. But why? If
he could not be open and natural with him, with
whom could he be? "Come," said he, "let us talk
of other things now; we can discuss all that later.
Really, though, won't you have a little coffee? It
would do you good."</p>

<p>"What do you want to talk about?" asked Costantino
drearily. "I knew you would think it strange
that I don't cry, but I've cried until I haven't the
wish to any more. And I am going away; one
can't stay in this place after having crossed the sea&mdash;who
is that going by?" he asked suddenly, as
the sound of footsteps was heard outside. "I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
want any one to see me," and he jumped up and
shut the door.</p>

<p>When he turned, his whole expression had
changed and his features were working.</p>

<p>"I walked by <i>there</i>," he said, his voice sinking
lower and lower, "on my way here. I didn't
want to, but somehow I found myself there before
I knew it. How can I&mdash;how can I stay here? Tell
me&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He clasped both hands to his forehead and shook
his head violently; then, throwing himself at full
length on the ground, he writhed and twisted in an
agony of sobs, his whole body shaking with the
vehemence of his grief. He was like a young bull
caught and held fast in the leash, and made to submit
to the red-hot iron.</p>

<p>The old fisherman turned deathly white, but made
no attempt whatever to calm him. At last, at last,
he recognised his friend.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h3>


<p>No sooner had news of Costantino's return
got abroad than visitors began to stream to
Isidoro's hut. Throughout the entire day there was
an incessant coming and going of friends and relatives,
and even of persons who had never in their
lives so much as interchanged a word with the late
prisoner, but who now hastened with open arms to
invite him to make his home with them. The
women wept over him, called him "my son," and
gazed at him compassionately; one neighbour sent
him a present of bread and sausages. All these
kindly demonstrations seemed, however, only to annoy
their object.</p>

<p>"Why on earth should they be sorry for me?"
he said to Isidoro. "For Heaven's sake, send them
about their business, and let's get away into the
country."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we will go, all in good time, child of
the Lord, only have a little patience," said the
other, bending over the fireplace, where he was
cooking the sausage. "How naughty you are, I
declare!"</p>

<p>Since witnessing that paroxysm of grief in the
morning, Uncle Isidoro had felt much more at ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
with his guest, and even took little liberties with
him, scolding him as though he had been a child.
During the short intervals when they found themselves
alone, he told him the <i>facts</i>. Costantino listened
eagerly, and was annoyed when the arrival
of fresh visitors interrupted the narrative. Among
these visitors came the syndic, he who was a herdsman,
and looked like Napoleon I. His call was
especially trying.</p>

<p>"We will give you sheep and cows," he began,
wiping his nose on the back of his hand. "Yes,
every herdsman will give you a <i lang="it">pecus</i>,<a name="Anchor-9" id="Anchor-9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> and if there
is anything you need, just say so; are we not all
brothers and sisters in this world, and especially
in a small community like this?"</p>

<p>Costantino, thinking of the treatment he had received
at the hands of his "brothers and sisters"
of this particular small community, shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "my brothers have treated me
as Cain treated Abel; it would take a good deal
more than sheep and cows to make it up to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, well! that has nothing to do with it," replied
the syndic, absorbed in his idea. "You have
travelled; tell me now, have you never stood on
the top of some high mountain, and looked down
on the villages scattered about in the plain below?
Well, didn't they seem to you like so many houses,
each with its little family living inside?"
Costantino, who was tired of the conversation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
merely replied that all he wanted was to leave this
village and never come back to it again.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! You mustn't do that!" urged the other.
"Where would you go? No, no; you must stay
here, where we are all brothers."</p>

<p>The next to arrive was Doctor Puddu, carrying
a large, dirty, grey umbrella. He at once peered
into the earthenware saucepan to see what was
cooking.</p>

<p>"You are all degenerates, every one of you," he
announced in his harsh voice, rapping the saucepan
with his umbrella. "And I'll tell you the reason:
it's because you will eat pork."</p>

<p>"Don't break the saucepan, please," said Uncle
Isidoro. "And I beg your pardon, but that is not
pork; it's beans, and bacon, and sausage."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't bacon pork? You're all pigs.
Well&mdash;&mdash;," turning to Costantino. "And so, good
sheep, you've come back? I saw him die&mdash;what's
his name?&mdash;Giacobbe Dejas. He died a miserable
death, as he deserved to. You had better take a
purgative to-morrow; it's absolutely necessary after
a sea voyage."</p>

<p>Costantino looked at him without speaking.</p>

<p>"You think I'm crazy?" shouted the doctor,
going close to him, and shaking his umbrella. "A
purgative! do you understand? A purgative!"</p>

<p>"I heard you," said Costantino.</p>

<p>"Oh, so much the better! Well, I've heard that
<i>you</i> say you want to go away. Go-o-o&mdash;&mdash;! Go, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
all means. Go to the devil. But first of all, go to
the cemetery, go to that dunghill you call a cem-e-te-ry;
and dig and scratch like a dog, and tear up
Giacobbe Dejas's bones, and gnaw them."</p>

<p>He ground his teeth as though he were crunching
bones; it was both grotesque and horrible, and Costantino
could do nothing but stare at him in utter
amazement.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at me like that for?
You've always been a fool, my dear fellow&mdash;my
dear donkey! Just look at you now! calm and
amiable as a pope! They've robbed you of everything
you possessed, betrayed you, murdered you,
knocked you about among them as though you had
been a dried skeleton, and there you sit, bland and
stupid as ever! Why don't you do something?
Why don't you go to that vile woman, and take
her, and her mother, and her mother-in-law by the
hair of their heads, and tie them to the tails of the
cows they offer to give you as a charity, and set fire
to their petticoats, and turn them loose in the fields
so that they may spread destruction in every direction?
Do you understand? I say, do you understand,
idiot?"</p>

<p>He flung the words in the other's face, his breath
heavy with absinthe, his eyes bloodshot.</p>

<p>Costantino recoiled, trembling, but the doctor
turned to go. On the threshold he paused again
and shook his umbrella.</p>

<p>"You make me long to break your neck!" he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
cried. "Men such as you deserve precisely the
treatment they get! Well, take a purgative, anyhow,
stupid."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll do that," said Costantino, with a laugh,
but at the same time the doctor's words made a
deep impression on him. There were times, indeed,
when he felt utterly desperate. He said over and
over again that he meant to go away, but, as a fact,
he did not know where to go. Nor, on the other
hand, could he see what was to become of him should
he decide to remain on in the village. He said to
himself: "I have no home, and there is no one belonging
to me; for this one day every one rushes
to see me out of curiosity, but by to-morrow they will
all have forgotten my very existence. I am like
a bird that has lost its nest. What is there for
me to do?"</p>

<p>All the time, though, those words of the doctor's
kept ringing in his head. Yes, truly, that would
be something for him to do. Go there, fall suddenly
upon them like a bolt out of heaven, and utterly
destroy all those people who had destroyed his life!</p>

<p>"No, Costantino," resumed Uncle Isidoro, as
they sat at table, eating the neighbour's white bread
and sausage. "No; she is not happy. I have never
looked her full in the face <i>since</i>, and it gives me a
queer feeling to meet her, as though I were meeting
the devil! And yet, do you know, I can't help feeling
sorry for her. She has a little girl that they
tell me is like a young bean, it is so thin and puny.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
How could a child born in mortal sin be pretty? It
was baptised just like a bastard, the priest wouldn't
go back to the house, and the people were sneering
all along the street."</p>

<p>"Ah, do you remember my child?" asked Costantino,
cutting off a slice of fat, yellow bacon.
"<i>He</i> was not like a bean, not he! Ah, if he had
only lived!"</p>

<p>"It may be better so," said the fisherman, beginning
to moralise. "Life is full of suffering; better
to die innocent, to go&mdash;to fly&mdash;up there, above the
blue sky, to the paradise that lies beyond the clouds,
beyond the storms, beyond all the miseries of human
life. Drink something, Costantino; this wine is not
very good, but there is still some left.&mdash;Well, I remember
last year on Assumption Day, Giacobbe
Dejas asked me to take dinner with him. He was
afraid of me; he thought I knew, and he wanted
his sister and me to get married. Oh! if you could
just see that little woman you wouldn't laugh. She
went with the priest and me to Nuoro. May the
Lord desert me in the hour of death, if ever I saw
a more courageous woman in all my life! She
hardly seemed to touch the ground! Well, she's
gone all shrunken and shrivelled now, don't you
know&mdash;like a piece of fruit that dries up on the
tree before it is ripe. I go all the time to see her,
and just to amuse her I say: 'Well, little barley-grain!
Shall we two get married? She smiles and
I smile, but we feel more like crying! Who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
ever have imagined such a thing?&mdash;I mean, here
was Giacobbe Dejas, seemingly happy and contented;
he was getting rich, and he talked of being
married. And then&mdash;all of a sudden&mdash;pum!&mdash;down
he comes, like a rotten pear! Such is life!
Bachissia Era sold her daughter, thinking to improve
her condition, and now she is hungrier than
ever. Giovanna Era did what she did, imagining
that she was going to have a heaven upon earth,
and instead of that, she's like a frog with a stick
run through it!"</p>

<p>"But does he <i>beat</i> her?" asked Costantino
heavily.</p>

<p>"No, he doesn't do that; but there are worse
things than beating. She's treated just like a servant,
or, rather, like a slave. You know how they
used to treat their slaves in the old times? Well,
that's the way she's treated in that house."</p>

<p>"Well, let her burst! Here's to her damnation!"
cried Costantino, raising his glass to his lips. It
gave him a cruel pleasure to hear of Giovanna's
misery, such pleasure as a child will sometimes feel
at seeing an unpopular playmate receive a whipping.</p>

<p>Dinner over the two men went out and stretched
themselves at full length beneath the wild fig-tree.
It was a hot, breathless noontide; the air, smelling
of poppies and filled with grey haze, was like that
of a summer midday, and there were bees flying
about, sounding their little trombones. Costantino,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
completely worn out by this time, fell asleep almost
immediately. The fisherman, on the contrary, could
not close an eye. A green grasshopper was skipping
about among the blades of grass, giving its
sharp "tic, tic." Isidoro, stretching out one hand,
tried to catch it, his thoughts dwelling all the while
on Costantino. "I know why he wants to go away,"
he ruminated. "He still cares for her, poor boy;
and if he stays here he will just suffer the way San
Lorenzo did on his gridiron. There he lies, poor
fellow, like a sick child! Ah, what have they done
to him? Torn him to pieces&mdash;Ah-ha! I have you
now!" but just as he was about to pull the grasshopper
apart, it occurred to him that possibly it
too, like Costantino, had had its trials, and he let
it go.</p>

<p>A shadow fell across the foot of the path; Uncle
Isidoro, recognising Priest Elias, sprang to his feet,
went to meet him, and drew him into the hut, so as
not to awaken Costantino. The latter, however, was
a light sleeper, and, aroused presently by the sound
of their voices, he too got up. As he approached
the hut he realised that he was being talked about.</p>

<p>"It is far better that he should go," the priest
was saying in a serious tone. "Far, far better."</p>

<p>Costantino could not tell why, but at the sound
of these words his heart sank within him like lead.</p>

<p>However, he did not go.</p>

<p>The days followed one another and people soon
ceased to trouble the returned exile; before long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
he was able to go about the village as much as he
chose without being stared at, even by the gossips
and ragamuffins. With the savings laid up in prison
he purchased a stock of leather, soles, and thread,
but he never began to work. Every day he bought
a supply of meat and fruit and wine, eating and
drinking freely himself, and urging Isidoro to do
the same. He was in great dread lest the villagers
might think that he was living on the old man's
charity, and wanted to let them see that he had
money and was openhanded, not only with him,
but with every one else; so he would conduct parties
of his acquaintances to the tavern where he
would make them all tipsy and get so himself at
times, and then the tales he would relate of his
prison experiences were marvellous indeed to hear.</p>

<p>In this way his little store of money melted rapidly
away, and when Isidoro scolded him, all he
would say was: "Well, I have no children nor any
one else to consider, so let me alone." He was counting,
moreover, on the inheritance left by his murdered
uncle, which the other heirs had agreed to resign
without forcing him to have recourse to the
law. "Then," said he, "I shall take myself off. I
am going to give you a hundred scudi. Uncle Isidoro."</p>

<p>But poor old Isidoro did not want his scudi nor
anything else except to see him restored to the Costantino
of other days&mdash;good, industrious, and frank.
Frank he certainly was not at present, and when,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
occasionally, the fisherman surprised him with tears
in his eyes, his sore, old heart leaped for joy.</p>

<p>"What is it, child of grace?" he would ask.
But Costantino would merely laugh, even when the
tears were actually running down his cheeks. It
was heartrending.</p>

<p>Sometimes the two would go off together to fish
for leeches; that is, Isidoro would stand patiently
knee-deep in the yellow, stagnant water, while Costantino,
stretched on his back among the rushes,
would spin yarns about his former fellow-prisoners,
gazing off, meanwhile, towards the horizon with
an unaccountable feeling of homesickness.</p>

<p>Go away? go away? Did he not long to go
away? Did he not, up there, beneath that fateful
sky, in the deathly solitude of the uplands, under
the eternal surveillance of those colossal sphinxes,
feel as though an iron circle were pressing upon
him? Every object, from the blades of grass along
the roadside to the very mountain-peaks, reminded
him of the past. Each night he prowled around
Giovanna's house like some stealthy animal, and one
evening he saw her tall figure issue forth, and move
down in the direction of <i>their</i> cottage. This was
the first time that he had seen her, and he recognised
her instantly, notwithstanding that it was by
the fading light of a damp, overcast evening. His
heart beat violently, and each throb gave him an
added pang, a fresh memory, a new impulse of
despair. His instinct was to throw himself upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
her then and there, clasp her in a close embrace,&mdash;kill
her. Before long, however, he was no longer
satisfied to catch only furtive glances, secretly and in
the dark; he became possessed with the desire to
see her and to be seen of her in broad daylight;
but she never left the house, and he dared not go
by there in the daytime. On another evening,
a Saturday, he heard Brontu's laugh ring out from
the portico, and he fancied that <i>hers</i> mingled with
it. His eyes filled, and he had much the same sensation
of nausea as on that first morning of the
sea voyage when he woke up ill.</p>

<p>All this time he continued to feign the utmost
indifference, without quite knowing why he did so.
The Orlei people had, however, become almost hateful
to him, even Uncle Isidoro. Sometimes he
asked himself in wonder why he had ever come
back.</p>

<p>"I am going away," he said one day to the fisherman,
gazing across the interminable stretch of
uplands to the blue and crimson sky beyond, against
which the thickets of arbute seemed to float like
green clouds. "I have written to a friend of mine&mdash;Burrai&mdash;he
can do anything, you know; he could
have gotten me a pardon, even if I had really been
guilty."</p>

<p>"You have told me all that before; I am tired
of hearing it," said Isidoro. "All the same, I notice
that he has never even answered your letter."</p>

<p>"He is going to get me a position; yes, I really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
mean to go. But tell me why is it that the priest
is so anxious for it? Is he afraid that I will kill
Brontu Dejas?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is. He's afraid of just that."</p>

<p>"No, he's not; that's not it. I said to him:
'Priest Elias, you must know perfectly well that if
I had wanted to kill any one, I would have done it
right off.' And all he said was: 'Go away, go
away! It would be far better.' What do you think
about it, Uncle Fisherman; shall I go or not?"</p>

<p>"I don't think anything about it," answered the
other in a tone of strong disapproval. "What I
do think is that you are an idle dog. Why aren't
you at work, tell me that? It's because you do
nothing but think all the time of your good-for-nothing
Burrai, who, however, never gives you a
thought."</p>

<p>"Oh! he doesn't give me a thought?" said Costantino,
piqued. "Well, I'll just let you see whether
he does or not. Look here!"</p>

<p>He drew a letter from the inside pocket of his
coat, and proceeded to read it aloud. It was from
Burrai, written at Rome, where the ex-marshal had
opened a little shop for the sale of Sardinian wines.
Naturally, being himself, he had improved upon
the facts, and announced that he was the proprietor
of a large and flourishing establishment; he invited
Costantino to pay him a visit, and reproached him
for not having come at once to Rome, where, he
said, he could find him a position without difficulty.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>The fisherman's blue eyes grew round with innocent wonder.</p>

<p>"To think, only to think!" he exclaimed. "And
you never told me a word about it! What made
you hide the letter? How much does it cost to
go to Rome?"</p>

<p>"Oh! only about fifty lire."</p>

<p>"And have you got that much?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course I have!"</p>

<p>"Then go, go by all means!" exclaimed the old
man, stretching his arms out towards the horizon.</p>

<p>They were both silent for a moment. The fisherman,
bending his head, gazed at the pebbles lying
at his feet, while Costantino stared absently ahead
of him. Beyond the brook, the tall, yellow, meadow-grass
was bowing in the wind, and the long stems
of the golden oats rippled against the blue background
of the sky.</p>

<p>Uncle Isidoro made up his mind that the moment
had come to tell Costantino plainly why all his
friends wanted him to leave the village.</p>

<p>"Giovanna," he began quietly, "does not love
her husband; you and she might meet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She and I might meet? Well, and if we did,
what then?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; you might, that's all."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing!" cried Costantino, and his voice
rang out scornfully in the profound stillness; "nothing!
I tell you that I despise that low woman.
I don't want her."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't want her, and yet you hang about
her house all the time, like a fly about the honey-pot."</p>

<p>"Ah, you know about that?" said Costantino,
somewhat crestfallen. "It's not true, though,&mdash;well&mdash;yes;
perhaps it is. But suppose I do hang about
her house, what business is it of yours?"</p>

<p>"Oh! none at all, but&mdash;you had better go away."</p>

<p>"I am going. I suppose the truth is you are
getting tired of having me on your hands!"</p>

<p>"Costantino, Costantino!" exclaimed the old
man in a hurt voice.</p>

<p>Costantino pulled up a tuft of rushes, threw it
from him, and gazed again into the distance. His
face was working as it had done on the morning
of his return, after he had closed the door of Isidoro's
hut; his brain swam, once or twice he gulped
down the bitter saliva that rose in his throat; then
he spoke:</p>

<p>"Well, after all, why does the priest insist so on
my going? Am I not actually her husband? Suppose
even that she were to come back to me?
Wouldn't it be coming back to her own husband?"</p>

<p>"If she were to come back to you, my dear fellow,
it would be Brontu Dejas either killing you or having
you arrested."</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't be afraid; I don't want her.
She's a fallen woman, as far as I am concerned. I
shall go off somewhere, to a distance, and marry
some one else."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no! You would never do that," murmured
Isidoro appealingly. "You are too good a Christian."</p>

<p>"No; I would never do that," repeated Costantino
mechanically.</p>

<p>"Never in the world; you are far too good a
Christian." The old man said it again, but without
conviction. The experience of a long life was battling
with the tenets of his simple faith.</p>

<p>"If he does not do it," he sighed to himself, "it
will not be merely because he is a good Christian."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>




<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h3>


<p>The July evening fell softly, tranquilly, like
a bluish veil. Costantino, seated on the
stone bench outside the fisherman's hut, was thoughtfully
counting on his fingers.</p>

<p>Yes; it had been sixty-four days since his return.
Six-ty-four days! It seemed like yesterday, and&mdash;it
seemed like a century! The exile's fustian coat
had grown worn and shabby; his face, dark and
gloomy; and his heart&mdash;yes, his heart as well, had
worn away from day to day, from hour to hour.
Eaten into by misery, by rage and passion, it, too,
had turned black, like a thing on the verge of decay.</p>

<p>A habit of dissembling, a result of prison life,
had clung to him; so that now he found it impossible
to be really open with any one, much as he sometimes
longed to unburden his heart; while the constant
effort to conceal his feelings harassed him
and added to his general misery. A frozen void
seemed to surround him, like a great sea, calm, but
boundless, stretching away in all directions from a
shipwrecked mariner. For two months now he
had been swimming in this sea, and he was wearied
out; his forces were spent. Scan the horizon as he
would, his soul could espy no friendly shore across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
that bleak and desolate expanse; no prospect of an
end to the unequal struggle; the icy water and the
measureless void were slowly swallowing him up.</p>

<p>Every day he would talk of going away, but nothing
more. It was a pretence, like all else that he
did; in his heart he knew perfectly well that now he
would never go. Why should he? On this side
of the water, or on that, life would always be the
same. He cared for no one; he hated no one, and
he felt that he had become as base and self-centred
as his late comrades in prison. Even Uncle Isidoro,
who had meant so much to him at a distance,
now, in the close companionship of daily intercourse,
had become an object of indifference, at times almost
of dislike.</p>

<p>When the old man went off on his fishing expeditions,
or on the circuits which he made from time
to time through the country to dispose of his wares,
Costantino felt as though a weight had been lifted
from him; the semi-paternal oversight which the
other exercised over him having, in fact, come to
both frighten and irritate him.</p>

<p>On this particular evening the fisherman was
away, and Costantino was sensible of this feeling of
freedom from an irksome restraint. Now he could
do whatever came into his head, without any one
to preach, or that disagreeable sensation of being
watched, which, possibly as a result of the long years
spent in prison, the mere presence of the old man
was sufficient to excite. Moreover, he was expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>ing
a visitor. Although he professed, now, to despise
all women, and did, in fact, usually avoid them
as much as possible, he had allowed himself to be
drawn into relations with a strange creature&mdash;a
half-witted girl&mdash;who lived near Giovanna. She
had surprised him one night prowling about the
Dejas house and had persuaded him to go home
with her.</p>

<p>From this individual he got all the gossip of the
white house, and he took refuge with her whenever
he thought he had been seen crossing the common.
He was waiting for her now at Isidoro's hut, in
the owner's absence, but he looked down on her,
and her foolish talk jarred on him. Presently she
arrived, and Costantino told her to sit down out
there on the stone bench beside him.</p>

<p>"It's hot inside, and there are fleas, and spiders,
and&mdash;devils. Stay here in the fresh air," he said,
without looking at her.</p>

<p>"But we'll be seen," she objected, in a deep, rough
voice.</p>

<p>"All right; suppose we are! It makes no difference
to me, why should it to you?"</p>

<p>"But, as it happens, it does make a difference
to me."</p>

<p>"Why?" he said, raising his voice. "Men cannot
matter, since they are all sinners as well; and
as for God, he can see us just as well inside as
out."</p>

<p>"Oh, go away!" she said, but without any show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
of anger. "You've been drinking." Then she
turned away and went into the hut. Striking a
light, she looked into the cupboard where the food
was usually kept, and, as Costantino still did not
come, she returned to the door and called to him:
"If you don't come at once I shall go away; but
you had better be careful; I have something to tell
you."</p>

<p>He jumped up, and, going inside, took her in his
arms. The girl broke into a wild laugh.</p>

<p>"Ah-ha! you come quick enough now. That
brought my little shorn lamb, eh?"</p>

<p>She was tall and stout, with a small head and a
dark, diminutive face, red lips, and greenish eyes&mdash;not
ugly, exactly&mdash;but rather repellent. Though
she never drank anything herself, she gave an impression
of being always a little tipsy, and was very
prone to think that other people were so, in fact.
Still laughing, she went again to the cupboard.</p>

<p>"It's empty," she said. "Nothing there at all;
and, do you know, I am hungry!"</p>

<p>"If you'll wait a moment I'll go and buy something;
but first, you must tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned abruptly, laid one hand on his breast,
and with the other began to rain blows that were
anything but playful.</p>

<p>"Ah, you want to know&mdash;crocodile. You want
to know, do you? That's what brought you in, is
it? Go back&mdash;enjoy the air, poor, dear little lamb!
You want me to tell you? You think it is something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
about Giovanna Era, eh? And you came in for
that, and not to see me?"</p>

<p>"Let go," he said, seizing her hands. "You hit
hard; the devil take you! Yes, that's what I came
in for&mdash;well?"</p>

<p>"I shan't tell you a word, so there!"</p>

<p>"Now, Mattea," he said gently, "don't make
me angry; you are not ill-natured. See now, I am
going off to buy you whatever you want. What
shall it be? What would you like to have?"</p>

<p>He was like a child promising to be good if only
it can have what it wants. And, in fact, at that
moment he did want something; he wanted it badly,
and not a nice thing, either. What he wanted was
to be told that Brontu had beaten his wife, or that
she had met with an accident, or that overwhelming
disaster of one sort or another had engulfed the
house of Dejas, root and branch. It was, therefore,
somewhat disappointing when Mattea, closing
one eye, announced that some cattle had been stolen,
and that Aunt Martina, on hearing the news, had
rushed off like a crazy thing to ascertain the exact
extent of the loss. "She will be up at the folds all
night, and your wife is all alone&mdash;do you understand&mdash;alone?"</p>

<p>"Well, what difference does that make to me?"</p>

<p>"Stupid! You can go to see her.&mdash;You won't
go? Why, that's what I came expressly to tell you!
Of course you'll go; I want you to. I'm sorry for
you. After all, you are her husband."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm not. I'm not any one's husband," he said,
with a shrug. "I thought you would have something
very different to tell me. Now&mdash;what shall I
get you? Beans&mdash;milk&mdash;bacon&mdash;cheese?"</p>

<p>"If you're not any one's husband, then marry
me," she said, in a low, unsteady voice, like a person
who has been drinking.</p>

<p>Costantino coughed, and spat on the ground.</p>

<p>Instantly a gleam of intelligence shot into her
usually dull, expressionless eyes.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that?" she asked sharply.
"You think, perhaps, that she is better than I?"</p>

<p>He flushed, and then a heartsick feeling came
over him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "you are worse, or&mdash;better than
she."</p>

<p>"What do you say?"</p>

<p>"If you are not lying at this moment, and didn't
come here to lay a trap for me, with this story of
her being alone&mdash;well, then you are better than
she."</p>

<p>"Why should I lay a trap for you? I'm sorry
for you, that's all. I swear by the memory of my
dead, that if you go there this evening you'll run
no risk whatever."</p>

<p>"Who can believe you, woman, when you don't
respect even the dead?"</p>

<p>Mattea, angry and offended, started to leave the
hut; but he held her back.</p>

<p>"A low dog," she said scornfully. "I take pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
on you, and you speak to me like that! What have
you to reproach me with? What, I say?" She
threw her head back with a certain pride, knitting
her brows, and turning upon Costantino a look that
was altogether new. He stared back at her for a
moment, amazed that a woman of her class should
speak in that tone, should hold up her head, and
dare to look at him with such an expression. Then
he began to laugh.</p>

<p>"I'm off now," he said, "but I'll be back in a
moment. I'll get some wine too, even though you
don't drink it. Wait for me here&mdash;wait, I say," he
repeated roughly, as she followed him to the door.
"Don't bother me." She stood still, and he went
out, but before he had gone a dozen steps he heard
her deep voice calling him back.</p>

<p>Returning, he saw the tip of her nose through
the crack of the door, and one eye, regarding him
with its habitual look of dull stolidity.</p>

<p>"What do you want, squint-eyed goat?"</p>

<p>"If you are going to her, there is no use in
making me wait here."</p>

<p>"Go to the devil whom you came from!" exclaimed
Costantino. "I would as soon think of
going to her house as you would of going to church.
I say you are to wait!" and he made as if to tweak
her nose, but she quickly drew back and shut the
door.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Costantino returned, but his
strange guest had disappeared. Thinking that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
might be hiding somewhere outside, he looked for
her, calling in a low voice and telling her that he
had bread and meat and fruit, but in vain; she had
taken herself off.</p>

<p>An intense stillness reigned all about the hut.
Through the night, now completely fallen, came
only the sound of the fig-leaves rustling mysteriously,
as though an invisible hand were shaking a
piece of stiff silk. Nothing else could be heard, and
nothing could be seen, except the stars shining brilliantly
in the warm sky.</p>

<p>Costantino felt much aggrieved by Mattea's defection.
As lonely as an outcast dog, what on earth
was there for him to do throughout that interminable
evening? He was not sleepy, having, in fact,
taken a long nap in the afternoon, and he had nowhere
to go. He began to eat and drink, talking
aloud from time to time in a querulous voice.</p>

<p>"If she imagines that I am coming to see her, she's
green,"&mdash;silence&mdash;"as green as a rose in springtime.
She's crazy." Another silence. Then&mdash;"Coming
to see her! Not I; neither her nor the
other one. Mattea is sickening; she seems to be a
sort of animal, and that's all there is about it."</p>

<p>He swore, and then gave a light, purposeless
laugh, such as people give when they are alone. All
the while he kept swallowing great gulps of wine,
and each time that he emptied his glass he would
thrust out his lips and exclaim: "Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;ah!"
rubbing his chest up and down to express the deli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>cious
sensation caused by the wine as it flowed down
his throat. Soon he began to feel more cheerful.</p>

<p>"She may go to the devil&mdash;or to hell, if she
wants to!" he exclaimed, thinking of Mattea and
her sudden disappearance. But all the while he
knew perfectly well that he was forcing himself
to dwell despitefully upon her, in order to keep
from thinking of the other. At last he went out,
and, stretching himself upon the stone bench, allowed
his thoughts to take their own course.</p>

<p>"She is alone," he reflected. "Well, what do I
care? I loathe her and I wouldn't go there, not
if she were to give me a chest full of gold! What
should I do with gold, anyway?" He put the
question to himself in profound dejection, but immediately
began to hum a gay little song, having
got into a way of trying to fool himself as well as
other people:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"'Little heart, dear heart,<br /><br /></span>
<span>I await thee day by day,<br /><br /></span>
<span>But, when thou seest me,<br /><br /></span>
<span>Hovereth near the bird of prey.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For a time the sound of his own voice&mdash;low,
monotonous,&mdash;arrested his attention; then his
thoughts once more asserted themselves.</p>

<p>"If I were to go there&mdash;well, what would happen?
Sin, perhaps. But am I not her husband? I
have not the remotest idea of going there, though;
I should think not! Uncle Isidoro makes me laugh&mdash;old
idiot! 'Go away, go away,' [imitating Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Isidoro's voice], 'if you don't go away, something
dreadful is sure to happen! Brontu Dejas will kill
you, or have you arrested!' Well, if he does, what
then?"</p>

<p>He began to sing again, the sharp rustle of the
fig-leaves, almost like the clash of metal blades, accompanying
the subdued murmur of his voice:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"'When you see life<br /><br /></span>
<span>Bloom in January,<br /><br /></span>
<span>When you see a swineherd<br /><br /></span>
<span>Making cheese of pork&mdash;&mdash;'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He shifted his position and his heavy eyelids
closed, his head, supported on one hand, rolling
from side to side.</p>

<p>"Well, what then?" he repeated, then opened his
eyes, as though startled by the sound of his own
voice. They closed again presently, and he went
on talking to himself:</p>

<p>"No; I would never have her again for my wife.
For me she is just an abandoned woman. She
has been living with another man, and, as long as
she has gone to live with him, she might come back
and live with me, and then go and live with some
one else! She's no better than Mattea, and I spit
upon them both!"</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and spat on the ground. At
the moment he had a genuine scorn of Giovanna,
and yet, at the very same time, tender, distant memories
surged up in his breast. He remembered a
kiss he had once given her as she lay asleep, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
how she had opened her eyes with a startled look,
exclaiming: "Oh, I thought it was some one else!"
Well, what manner of foolishness was this for him
to be thinking of now? He was a simpleton, neither
more nor less than a simpleton! Moreover, how
could he know, supposing for a moment that he were
to go, whether Giovanna would receive him or drive
him away? The man's mind was neither trained
nor developed, yet, at that moment, he was reasoning
as a much more complex nature might have
done. He hoped that she would not receive him;
he knew that for himself there was nothing for it
but to go on living and suffering; yet he felt that,
should he go to her and be repulsed, at least a ray
of light would penetrate the cold, dreary void that
encircled him. But he wanted her, he longed for
her still. From the day he had lost her his whole
being had suffered like a crushed and twisted limb
that still goes on living. Yet, mingled with this
sense of longing there was a spiritual breath as
well, the instinct of the immortal soul which never
wholly dies out, even in the most degraded.</p>

<p>He dreamed of Giovanna an honest woman, lost
forever in this world, but restored to him in eternity.
Now, if she were to betray her second husband,
even for the sake of her first, she would not&mdash;could
not&mdash;be an honest woman! So thought
Costantino, and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, ten o'clock, and he had been
lying for half an hour or more on the stone bench,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
when a mournful strain broke in upon the stillness.
It was the blind man, singing and accompanying
himself upon his rude instrument. His voice, clear
enough, but sad and monotonous, vibrated through
the night air with a sobbing suggestion of homesickness
that was hardly human, as though it were
the wail of a lost soul, recalling the few hours of
happiness spent upon earth.</p>

<p>The music seemed to be a cry for light, happiness,
the joy of living, all those things whose existence the
blind youth half understood, but could never hope
to realise&mdash;which the dead have lost, and can never
hope to repossess. Costantino shivered and got up;
the voice and the accompaniment began to die away,
growing gradually fainter and fainter, and ceasing
at last altogether. He felt a great wave of agony
and tenderness surge up in his breast. In the darkness,
the silence, the unutterable loneliness that surrounded
him, he, too, felt an overmastering longing,
like the blind man's, for light; an agonising homesickness,
like the dead recalling their brief experience
of life. He turned and began to walk in the
direction of the village.</p>

<p>At first he seemed to be in a dream, although he
heard beneath his feet the rustle of the dead leaves
and stubble blown by the wind about Isidoro's hut.
He rubbed his eyelids and little violet-coloured electric
circles seemed to flash and swim in the air.
Soon though, his eyes becoming used to the darkness,
he discerned clearly the light line of the road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the black cottages, the great, empty void above,
where the stars hung like drops of gold, ready to
fall. He walked steadily on, knowing perfectly
whither he was bound, and never wavering for a
single instant. Here and there, on the thresholds
of cottages whose owners were too poor to indulge
in the luxury of a light, little groups of people sat,
enjoying the freshness of the night air.</p>

<p>Occasionally the high-pitched voice of a woman
would float across the road, recounting some piece
of gossip, or trifling incident of domestic life. In
a lonely angle Costantino espied a pair of lovers;
the man, hearing his footsteps approach, tried to
hide his companion, who quickly turned her face
to the wall. Costantino walked on, but presently
he stopped and half turned, thinking he would give
the two young people a fright by calling out: "I am
going to tell your father right away!" But the
fear of attracting attention, and being himself discovered,
deterred him, and he went on.</p>

<p>When he discerned the black mass of the almond-tree,
rearing itself from beside the path beyond Aunt
Bachissia's cottage, his heart gave a sudden bound,
and then stood still; it was so like a great head with
rough, shaggy locks, thrusting itself out, intently
watching for him to appear. He had fully determined
to pass the tree, cross the common, enter the
Dejas house, and speak to Giovanna; it all seemed
perfectly simple and plain, and he was prepared to
do it; yet he was frightened, more than frightened&mdash;terrified.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
A flexible, girlish voice floated out into
the night: "No matter how often you may say it,
it's not true!"</p>

<p>He looked all about him; no one was to be seen,
and he went on, his nervousness increasing with
every step. Crossing the common, he examined
Aunt Bachissia's cottage; then the white house; then
Mattea's hovel; from the last a faint light shone;
the two others were in total darkness. Again the
idea crossed his mind that Mattea might be playing
him a trick; or, perhaps, Aunt Bachissia was with
Giovanna, or the latter might already have gone
to bed, and would decline to open the door! Nevertheless,
he walked steadily on, and up on the portico.</p>

<p>Instantly the figure of Giovanna became apparent,
seated on the doorstep. At the same moment she
recognised him and leaped to her feet, rigid with
terror. His voice, low, agitated, at once reassured
her.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened. Are you alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>A second later they were in each other's arms.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a><br /><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>



<p>A year elapsed.</p>

<p>One night, when Brontu was away from
home, Aunt Martina heard, or thought she heard, a
low murmur of voices in Giovanna's room. Had
Brontu come back? the old woman wondered, and
if so, why? Could anything have happened at the
sheepfolds?</p>

<p>Tormented by the thought, she finally got up.
The door was open, and she listened a moment.
Yes, undoubtedly some one was talking in Giovanna's
room. Not wishing to strike a light, she
attempted to cross the room that separated her own
chamber from Giovanna's, in the dark. She made
a misstep, however, and, trying to recover herself,
overthrew a chair. "Holy Mary!" she muttered,
setting it right again. Then she groped her way
to the door, felt for the handle, and tried to open
it. It was locked.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" demanded Giovanna's
voice instantly.</p>

<p>"Has Brontu got back?"</p>

<p>"No; why?"</p>

<p>"I thought I heard some one talking. Why have
you got the door locked?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it locked? I must have done it without thinking,"
said Giovanna innocently. "I'll open it right
away; just wait a moment. I was talking to the
baby; she wouldn't go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Mariedda!" called the grandmother. But there
was no response.</p>

<p>"Is she asleep now?"</p>

<p>"She is just falling asleep."</p>

<p>In the pause that ensued a painful drama was
enacted in the breasts of the two women.</p>

<p>"I will get up now and open the door," said Giovanna
presently in a strained voice. But the old
woman made no reply. Motionless, a cold chill
creeping through her, she <i>felt</i> the horrible truth
flash into her mind like a sudden glare of blinding
light. Giovanna must have a lover, and that lover
could be none other than Costantino Ledda. In
that moment of searching illumination a thousand
little incidents to which she had paid no heed at
the time, a thousand little unconsidered trifles, rose
up to confront her, and she trembled from head to
foot, in a paroxysm of grief and rage. Yet, when
Giovanna repeated: "I will open the door right
away," she was able to control herself, and answer
quietly:</p>

<p>"It's not worth while; stay where you are."</p>

<p>Then she turned, and, crossing the room again
in the dark, said to herself with a sort of calm fury:
"Now is the time to show them that old Martina is
no fool!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Her first impulse was to hurry downstairs and
look out to see if any one had climbed from Giovanna's
window to the roof below, which, in turn,
gave on another and still lower roof. But she restrained
herself, reflecting very sensibly that if Giovanna
saw that she was suspected she would instantly
be on her guard. "No, no; this is a time
to dissemble, old Martina; to pretend, spy, listen,
watch&mdash;and then?" What was to happen afterwards?
The <i>afterwards</i> suggested such a multitude
of wretched possibilities that the old woman threw
herself on her bed in a torment of agonised conjecture.</p>

<p>What would Brontu do if he knew? Poor
Brontu! With all his violent temper he was such
a good fellow at bottom, and so tremendously in
love with Giovanna! But there it was; he was so
much in love with Giovanna that he would be perfectly
capable of committing some crime should he
suspect her constancy. Then, what would become
of him? thought Aunt Martina. "Ah, it will be
far better for him to know nothing of all this trouble.
I will implore Giovanna to be loyal, and not to betray
her poor husband. And then&mdash;suppose, after all,
I should be mistaken! Suppose she really was talking
to the baby! Eh, no, no! Some one else was
there, and it could have been no one but Costantino.
Oh, wretched creature! accursed beggar! Is this
your gratitude towards those who have fed and
clothed and nourished you? But never mind, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
will pay you back! We will drive you out of this
house with a whip, naked as when you came into
it!" And thus, torn by successive impulses of
hatred, pity, fury, and despair. Aunt Martina
dragged through the weary night.</p>

<p>One significant circumstance she did recall&mdash;that
Costantino was said to be on good terms with Aunt
Bachissia, Giovanna's mother. Some time previously
he had set to work in earnest; had rented
a little shop, and was making a good deal of money
by his trade of shoemaking. A repulsive thought
came into the old woman's head. What if Aunt
Bachissia knew and encouraged her daughter's intimacy
with her first husband! "The old harpy detests
us," said Brontu's mother to herself. "Perhaps
Costantino makes her presents!"</p>

<p>Daybreak found her still wide-eyed and sleepless.
Getting up, she went out to examine the wall
above which rose the roofs leading to Giovanna's
window. Not a trace was to be found of any one
having been on it. The dawn was exquisitely tranquil
and beautiful; the village was still asleep, and
the fields lay bathed in soft grey haze beneath a
silver sky. Aunt Martina drew a deep breath; she
felt as though she had awakened from a horrible
dream; the utter peace and serenity of the early
morning seemed to communicate itself to her distracted
spirit. Then, on a sudden, happening to
raise her eyes to Giovanna's window, she saw the
young woman watching her. Instantly the convic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>tion
flashed across her that she too had lain awake
the entire night; that she too was looking now to
see if any tell-tale traces remained to betray the
fact that she had had a visitor, and more than that,
that she now was fully aware of Aunt Martina's
suspicions. Across the space that divided them, the
two women exchanged a look of mutual fear and
hatred. War was declared!</p>

<p class="break">The battle opened in ominous calm, each side
marshalling its forces in silence and secrecy. Aunt
Martina's efforts were directed to allaying Giovanna's
suspicions in the hope that she might some
day surprise her and her lover together. Giovanna,
perfectly awake to her mother-in-law's tactics, pretended
not to notice anything, but at the same time
proceeded with great caution in her relations with
Costantino.</p>

<p>He had entirely altered his mode of life; he now
worked regularly, and was doing very well; but
underneath everything was a sense of unutterable
melancholy, which he was never able wholly to
throw off.</p>

<p>"I am doing everything I can to provoke Brontu
to break with me," said Giovanna one day. "I
want him to apply for a divorce, so as to be rid
of me; then I will go back to you, beloved, and
nothing shall ever part us again. I will be your
servant, your slave&mdash;and make you forget all your
past sorrows."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>But Costantino only smiled wearily. It was true
that he still loved Giovanna, but it was a very different
kind of love from that which she had formerly
inspired in him. Now, there was more of
passion, perhaps, but it did not go so deep, and he
knew, though he could not tell her so, that even
were she free to return to him as his wife, he could
never be happy again as in the old days. She was
not the woman to whom he had given his heart,
but another and a very different person. One who,
having been false to both husbands in succession,
was now, perhaps, deceiving them simultaneously.</p>

<p>Often Costantino was seized with an access of
rage against the entire human race, Giovanna included.
He would have liked to murder some one&mdash;Brontu,
or Aunt Bachissia, or even Giovanna, in
order to avenge himself for what he had been made
to suffer. And yet, all the time, he knew himself
to be quite incapable of doing anything brutal or
violent, and raged and fumed the more at his own
weakness. His heart seemed to have sunk into a
state of torpor, and to have lost the power to enjoy
acutely.</p>

<p>Uncle Isidoro was now constantly urging him to
marry again, much as such an act would be contrary
to his own principles.</p>

<p>"I have one wife already," Costantino would reply.
"What could I do with another? Have her
betray me too? All women are exactly alike."</p>

<p>Then Uncle Isidoro would sigh, and remain silent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
He was in constant dread lest some new tragedy
should befall. He was aware, partly from intuition
and partly because Costantino himself allowed him
to have an inkling of the truth, that the young man
was holding secret intercourse with his former wife,
and his daily fear was of some explosion. Thus,
he argued to himself that if Costantino could only
be induced to marry some gentle, affectionate young
woman, who would bear him children, he would
come in time to forget the other one, and find rest
and peace. To these suggestions, however, Costantino
only gave the same weary smile that had
now become habitual.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid that I will murder some one?"
he asked, divining the old man's nervous terrors.
"No, no; there is no need to feel alarmed now; matters
are going too much to my taste just at present
for me to do anything to disturb the current."</p>

<p>The current was, however, in a fair way to be
disturbed after that night on which Aunt Martina
made her discovery.</p>

<p>On the following day Costantino went, as his
frequent custom now was, to Aunt Bachissia's cottage.</p>

<p>He had no liking for the old woman who had
been chiefly instrumental in bringing about Giovanna's
divorce; there were even moments when the
thought of strangling his ex-mother-in-law got into
his blood, filling his veins with a sensation of almost
voluptuous joy. But he went there, neverthe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>less,
mainly because he took a dreary pleasure in
living over the past in that little cottage where he
had once been so happy. Moreover, he enjoyed
listening to Aunt Bachissia's never-ending abuse of
everything connected with the house of Dejas.</p>

<p>Did the old woman know of her daughter's renewed
relations with Costantino? Neither of them
had said a word to her on the subject; yet, like Isidoro,
she suspected how matters stood, though, unlike
him, she made no effort to interfere. Costantino
had made her a present of a pair of shoes,
and from time to time he performed other little
services for her. Had he asked her to allow him
to meet Giovanna in her house, it is quite possible
that she would have offered no objection; but up
to the present time he had neither told nor asked
her anything.</p>

<p>On this day, however, he arrived visibly anxious
and perturbed, and Aunt Bachissia, who was sitting
by the door spinning, laid down her spindle and
gave him a steady look out of her sharp little eyes.</p>

<p>Night was falling, and Costantino, who had
worked hard all day, was tired, sad, unhappy. The
soft brilliance of the summer night, the silence of
the little house, the peaceful solitude of the common,
the warm, sweet breath of the evening, all combined
to create a flood of homesickness for the past, and
an acute sense of present misery that was well-nigh
unbearable. He threw himself down on a stool and
rested his elbows on his knees and his forehead on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
his interlocked hands. For a few moments neither
of them spoke; the man was thinking of Malthineddu,
of his little dead child; he seemed to see
him then, playing before the door, and hot tears
trembled in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Aunt Bachissia suddenly,
"the old colt is going crazy?"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Costantino.</p>

<p>"Who? Why, the old miser, Martina Dejas.
She got up out of her bed last night, and went and
banged on my Giovanna's door. She said she heard
some one talking to her. Upon my soul, fancy such
a thing! She has gone entirely mad; she always
was half so."</p>

<p>"Ah!" was all that Costantino said.</p>

<p>"Listen, my soul," said Aunt Bachissia, lowering
her voice. "Giovanna tells me that the old colt
suspects&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" asked Costantino, raising his head
quickly.</p>

<p>"Suspects that you and Giovanna&mdash;you understand?
She has not said a word, the old maniac,
but Giovanna has guessed that she has some idea
in her head, and on that account&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand," said Costantino.</p>

<p>He did understand. Evidently Giovanna had
taken this method of warning him that they would
have to be prudent.</p>

<p>"And so, my soul," Aunt Bachissia went on,
"for the present it will be as well for you to stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
coming here&mdash;just so as not to arouse suspicions.
I will go every once in a while to see you&mdash;for a
chat, you know. Ah!" she gave a weary sigh,
"you&mdash;yes, you are a man! Look at you, standing
there now, as tall and handsome as a banner!
When I think of that little freak of nature&mdash;Brontu
Dejas&mdash;I declare, I wonder what on earth Giovanna
could have been thinking of to&mdash;forget you.
Ah, if she had only listened to me!"</p>

<p>Costantino, who had risen and was standing in
the doorway, crimsoned with anger when he heard
these outrageous lies being calmly offered for his
acceptance.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue," he began in a hoarse voice.
But Aunt Bachissia was not listening; she was looking
intently up at the white house; presently she
whispered: "Look, my soul, we are being watched
now. Giovanna is right. Do you see the old harpy
peering at us? Oh! I could tear out her eyes!"</p>

<p>Sure enough the figure of Aunt Martina could be
seen lurking in the shadow of the portico. For the
moment Costantino, who had never really borne
any especial ill-will towards Brontu's mother, felt
all the anger, and sorrow, and rebelliousness in his
nature concentrate into one bitter longing to do the
old woman some bodily harm. He would dearly
have liked to make a wild dash across the common,
fall upon her without warning, and tear her eyes
out, as Aunt Bachissia had said.</p>

<p>"Never mind, let her alone," said the latter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
"Giovanna has told me that she is doing everything
she can to make them ill-use her and drive
her out of the house. Then we will apply for another
divorce&mdash;you, my soul, all you have to do
is to be careful and&mdash;wait."</p>

<p>"What have I to wait for?" he asked roughly.
"Nothing can happen now that <i>I</i> want."</p>

<p>She said something more, but he was not listening.
Standing erect and motionless on the threshold
of the door that had once been <i>his</i> door, he stared
across at the portico of the Dejas house, feeling
even more desolate and forlorn than usual. So,
then, his one remaining consolation, that of holding
intercourse with Giovanna, was about to be torn
from him, and by the same people who had stolen
from him everything else that made life pleasant;
moreover they might deprive him even of life itself
should he continue his relations with her who really
was his own wife!</p>

<p>Ah, Dejas! accursed race! Yes, now the old
mother as well was included in his hatred of that
house, and the longing to cross the common, fling
himself on the portico, and make the still summer
evening resound with her shrill screams of agony, at
last overmastered him. With a sudden movement,
right in the middle of one of Aunt Bachissia's sentences,
he stepped out into the twilight, and with
rapid strides began to cross the common. When he
had gone about half-way, he stopped, stood motionless
for a moment, and then, altering his direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
walked away. Aunt Bachissia watched his figure as
it was slowly swallowed up by the shadows; and
the silence and languor of the dusk deepened into
night.</p>

<p>After that evening Costantino visited her cottage
no more.</p>


<p class="break">One day, towards the end of October, Uncle Isidoro
Pane had an unexpected visitor. The old fisherman,
seated before his fireplace, was getting supper
ready for himself and Costantino, who still made
his home with him. Outside, the air felt almost
cold, the wind was rising, and long, violet-coloured
clouds were flying across the clear, greenish, western
sky. Uncle Isidoro was thinking sadly of that
evening when, amid the chanting of the women,
they had interred Giacobbe Dejas in the dungheap.
The earthen pot bubbled on the fire, and from without
came the melancholy rustling of the fig-tree and
the bushes, shaken by the wind. All at once a low
knock came on the door.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" asked Uncle Isidoro.</p>

<p>"<i>Ave Maria!</i>" The salutation came from Aunt
Martina Dejas, who now, after satisfying herself
that the old man was entirely alone, entered and
cautiously closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Martina! <i lang="it">razia plena!</i>" responded the
fisherman, astonished to see who his visitor was.</p>

<p>Her head and shoulders were completely enveloped
in a petticoat worn in lieu of a shawl; her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
features were paler and more gaunt even than
ordinary, and to Isidoro she seemed to have aged
greatly.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Martina Dejas," said he politely, offering
her a stool. "What good wind blows you
here?"</p>

<p>"It's an ill wind," she replied. Then, looking all
around her, she said: "I want to talk to you privately;
can any one hear us? Where is <i>he</i>?"</p>

<p>"Still at the shop; he does not get back till
later."</p>

<p>"Listen," said the old woman, seating herself;
"you can probably guess what it is that brings
me here?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot guess, Martina Dejas," declared
the other, though all the time he knew very well.
"But why didn't you send for me? I would have
gone to your house."</p>

<p>"At my house there is some one who has the
ears of a hare; she can hear through a stone wall.
Now, listen&mdash;I don't suppose I have to make you
promise not to tell any one? You wouldn't betray
my confidence, would you?"</p>

<p>"I will not betray you."</p>

<p>"You are a man of the Lord, Isidoro Pane; a
very dreadful thing has happened; will you help
me to set it right?"</p>

<p>"If I can," he said, spreading out his arms and
hands. "Tell me about it!"</p>

<p>The old woman sighed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell you about it! Yes," she said, "that is
what I am going to do, Isidoro; but what I have to
say burns my lips, and you are the only human
being I would breathe it to. A terrible misfortune
has overtaken my house. Do you see how old I
have grown? For months I have not been able to
close my eyes. Giovanna, my daughter-in-law, has
a lover&mdash;Costantino Ledda. You don't seem surprised!"
she added quickly, seeing that the other
remained unmoved. "You knew it already! Some
one has known about it! Perhaps there are others
too&mdash;perhaps every one knows the disgrace of my
house!"</p>

<p>"Easy, easy; don't be frightened. I did not
know it, and I don't think any one else does. It
may not be true, either, but if it were, and people
knew about it&mdash;no one would be surprised."</p>

<p>"No one would be surprised!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, Martina Dejas; no one at all.
Every one knows perfectly well&mdash;pardon me if I
speak frankly&mdash;that Giovanna married your son
entirely from motives of self-interest. Now Costantino
has come back; <i>they</i> were in love with one
another <i>before</i>, and now they are in love with one
another <i>after</i>; it is perfectly natural."</p>

<p>"It is perfectly natural! How can you say such
things, Isidoro Pane? Is it perfectly natural for
a woman to be unfaithful? For a beggar taken in
out of the streets to betray her benefactors? Is it
perfectly natural that my son, Brontu Dejas, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
had the courage to do what not another soul would
have dreamed of doing&mdash;is it natural that he should
be deceived?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is all natural."</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed Aunt Martina, getting up, her
eyes flashing with anger, "then it was quite useless
for me to come here!"</p>

<p>"Easy, easy!" said the old man again. "Just sit
down, Martina, and tell me quietly what brought
you. Let us put all these questions aside&mdash;they
are of no use now, anyhow&mdash;and discuss the situation
as it is. I think I can guess what it is you
want me to do; you want me to use my influence
with Costantino to get him to leave your family in
peace&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The old woman sat down again, and opened her
heart. Yes, that was what she wanted, that Isidoro
should do all he could to induce Costantino
to give Giovanna up.</p>

<p>"This misery will kill me," she said in conclusion,
her voice trembling; "but at least my Brontu
will have been spared. Ah, if he should ever find
out about it, he is lost! He is sure to kill some
one, either Giovanna or Costantino. I am continually
haunted by the most horrible presentiments; I
keep seeing a smear of blood before my eyes. You
will see, Isidoro; you will see! If we don't find
some way to stop this shameful thing, some horrible
tragedy will occur&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>As she talked, Aunt Martina had been growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
steadily paler, until she was now quite livid; her
lips trembled, and her eyes gleamed partly with
anger, partly with unshed tears.</p>

<p>"You alarm me, and you make me feel very
sorry for you as well," said Uncle Isidoro gravely.
"But see here, whose fault is it all? I remember&mdash;this
visit of yours brings it all back to me&mdash;another
visit I once had; it was from Giacobbe Dejas,
poor soul. Well, he sat there, just where you
are sitting now, and he said almost the same words:
'We must find some way to stop this thing; if we
don't, some terrible misfortune will surely happen!'
And so we did; we tried our best to stop that shameful
thing, but without avail. You and your son,
and all the rest of you, were determined to bring
about your own ruin. You fell into mortal sin;
you broke the laws of God, and now your punishment
has come!"</p>

<p>"We! only we!" exclaimed the old woman
haughtily. "No; the fault belongs to them as well.
To Bachissia Era, for her avarice and wickedness
in throwing her daughter at Brontu; and to Giovanna,
for abandoning her first husband when she
loved him, and marrying another out of self-interest!
The blame belongs equally to all, or, rather, it does
not; it is <i>theirs</i> alone, for we did nothing but what
was good. It is theirs, theirs, and I hate every one
of them&mdash;vile, low-born beggars&mdash;traitors. And
I can tell you, if Costantino does not give this thing
up, he'll bitterly regret it. Beg, implore, adjure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
him! Tell him not to bring ruin on a respectable
house, and then,&mdash;if he will not listen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, Martina," begged the fisherman, seeing
that she was working herself into a fury. "Don't
talk foolishness. But tell me, are you really certain
that Giovanna and Costantino are meeting each
other?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely certain. For three months now,
as I told you, I have hardly closed my eyes. One
night I heard some one talking to Giovanna. She
saw right away that I had noticed something, and
for a while she was on her guard. But now&mdash;now
she has thrown aside all prudence. The other
day they met at Bachissia Era's cottage; I saw
them plainly; and not only that, I heard them;
I listened at the door. Then, last night he was with
her again; do you understand? actually in my house,
beneath my roof! And I&mdash;I was trembling so
with rage I hardly knew what I was about; but
I waited for him below; I was going to speak to
him, and then I was going to stab him&mdash;kill him, if
I could&mdash;I had a knife ready in my hand. But do
you know, I could not stir a limb! I could not
even open my lips when he crept down as stealthily
as a thief, first on to the roof, and then the ground,
and away! Ah, I am nothing but a poor old woman;
I can't do a thing. I was just frightened, and I
hid. Giovanna knows that I care more for Brontu
than for anything else in the world, and that I
would sacrifice everything to spare him, even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
honour of our name. And so the ungrateful creature
is taking advantage of the tenderest feeling
that I have. She is counting on my being afraid
to tell him for fear that he will commit murder,
and so be ruined forever, and that is why she dares
to carry it on. But I&mdash;I&mdash;Isidoro, I will be capable
of doing almost anything if Costantino does not
break this off. Tell him so."</p>

<p>"But why don't you speak to Giovanna?" asked
the fisherman.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;well, I'm afraid of her. She follows
me about and watches me all the time like a tigress
ready to spring. She hates me, just as I hate her
at times; and at the very first word she would fly
at me and choke me to death. I don't dare to open
my mouth. Oh, it is all so horrible! You don't
know what days I pass! Death would be far less
bitter than the life I am leading."</p>

<p>As she spoke these words, Aunt Martina buried
her face in her hands and began to sob.</p>

<p>A feeling of intense pity rose in the old fisherman's
heart. In the days of his most grinding poverty
he had never been reduced to tears, and to
think of the rich, proud Martina Dejas being actually
more wretched than an old pauper like himself!</p>

<p>"I will do my very best," he said. "Now go,
and try not to worry. You had better get off at
once, though; it is time for <i>him</i> to be coming back."
She got up, wrapped the petticoat carefully around
her head and shoulders, and when Isidoro had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
looked out to make sure that no one was about who
might recognise her, walked slowly away.</p>

<p>The air was sharp; the wind was blowing in gusts,
tearing the first dead leaves from the trees. Aunt
Martina, struggling against it, felt more anxious
and depressed even than when she came. It seemed
as though that chill, autumn wind that shook and
lashed and tore her, were tearing and lashing her
spirit as well. The presentiments of evil that she
had spoken of as haunting her, were stronger than
ever. Passing a certain wretched little hovel, more
forlorn and poverty-stricken than any of the others,
she shot a keen glance at it, and then quickly lowered
her eyes, as though in dread lest some invisible
being should read the dark thought of her soul. The
owner of this hovel, a poor peasant, had come to
her some time before, and had asked her to lend him
some money. "Lend it to you!" she had exclaimed
derisively. "And how do you propose to repay
it?" "If I can't pay you back in money," the man
had replied, "there may be some other way of showing
my gratitude. You could require any service
at all of me."</p>

<p>She understood what he meant. He was ready
to undertake anything, even the commission of a
crime, in order to get the money he needed. But
she had not wanted anything, and so had sent him
off. Now, passing the forlorn little house, rapidly
falling into ruins, through the darkness and wind,
and melancholy of the night, she saw again before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
her the gaunt, resolute figure of this man; his hollow,
sunken eyes; his lips, white from hunger; his
dark, bony hands, ready for any act by which he
might hope to snatch a little ease and comfort out
of life; and the horrible schemes of vengeance that
were tearing at her selfish old heart began to take
a fearful and well-defined shape.</p>

<p>Thus she passed on. A dark, forbidding form,
enveloped in her black <i>tunic</i>, swept by the wind
past that wretched hovel like a shadowy portent of
evil.</p>

<p class="break">That same evening Uncle Isidoro reasoned with
Costantino at length, urging him by every argument
at his command to avert what otherwise must inevitably
result in a catastrophe for himself, for Giovanna,
and for every one concerned.</p>

<p>Costantino regarded the old man steadily with
his usual melancholy smile. "What," he demanded,
"could happen? You admit yourself that the old
harpy will never talk to her son. And&mdash;isn't she
my wife, Giovanna? Haven't I a perfect right to
be with her whenever I choose?"</p>

<p>"Ah, child of the Lord," sighed Uncle Isidoro,
clasping his hands and shaking his head, "you will
be made to suffer for it in some way; you had better
look out: Martina Dejas is capable of anything
where her son is concerned."</p>

<p>A look of hatred came into Costantino's eyes.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said; "my heart is like a vessel full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
of deadly poison; a single drop more and it will
overflow. Let them look out who have brought all
this on themselves." Then he got up and went out
into the night. For hours he wandered aimlessly
about, like one who had lost his way, in the wind-swept
solitude. Then, about midnight, he found
himself, almost without knowing how he got there,
as on that first evening, beneath Giovanna's window.
He climbed on the shed and tapped.</p>

<p>Aunt Martina, lying wakeful and alert, heard
everything; heard Costantino approach, heard his
knock, heard Giovanna open to him; and then she
knew it was hopeless. Without doubt Isidoro had
faithfully reported his conversation with her, and
this was Costantino's reply: he had come directly
and defiantly to Giovanna. "No doubt," thought
the old woman bitterly, "he argues that since old
Martina lacks the courage to make her son unhappy
by telling him the truth, he may as well profit by
her weakness. Yes; no doubt that is what he thinks.
But, he has forgotten to take account of what the
poor old mother may be stirred up to do in order
to protect her boy! Now, Costantino Ledda, it is
between us two!"</p>

<p>One night as Costantino slid down from the shed
beneath Giovanna's window, he felt something cold
and sharp enter his side; in the darkness he made
out the figure of a man, his face covered with a
black cloth. He threw himself upon him, and after
a brief struggle, breathless, silent, determined, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
succeeded in throwing him down and disarming
him. Then he let him go without so much as attempting
to identify him. What did it signify who
the assassin was? Behind that black mask he knew
only too well that Aunt Martina's gaunt features
looked out, and that it was her hand that had directed
the murderous stroke.</p>

<p>He made his way back to Isidoro's hut, and, the
fisherman being absent on one of his journeys,
dressed the wound himself, hiding away like a
stricken animal, and concealing what had happened
from every one. He did not even undress, but for
three days and nights lay stretched on his pallet,
a prey to the bitterest reflections.</p>

<p>The weather had become cold; outside, the wind
whistled among the dry hedges, and, forcing its
way into the hut, made the long threads of cobweb
swing back and forth, and brought down clouds of
dust from the roof. Through the window Costantino
could see processions of pale blue clouds scudding
across the cold, bright background of the sky;
and he said to himself that he wanted to die.</p>

<p>Death, death, what else remained for him? The
world&mdash;his world&mdash;was now only a cold and empty
void.</p>

<p>His feeling for Giovanna could never be what it
once had been; he had, indeed, resumed his relations
with her, but she could never mean the same thing
to him again after having deserted him in his hour
of need. The very pleasure which he felt in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
clandestine intercourse was due in part to his hatred
of the Dejases. The Dejases! The mere thought
of the joy which his death would afford them, even
now, aroused him and put new life into his veins!</p>

<p>"They have stolen everything else of mine," he
thought, "and now they want to take my life as
well. But they shan't have it; I will kill one of them
first." He recalled a trial at which he had once been
present, where the accused had proved that he had
been attacked, and had struck back in order to defend
himself; the jury had acquitted him. "Well,
they will acquit me; I shall be striking in self-defence.
And if they don't acquit me&mdash;&mdash;!" There
arose before him the faces of his fellow-convicts.
The <i>King of Spades</i> smiled at him lugubriously, and
behind him he could see the gloomy walls of the
prison courtyard. At least, though, <i>they</i> had been
friendly; they might have been murderers, but they
had never tried to assassinate him.</p>

<p>On the third day of his seclusion in Uncle Isidore's
hut a storm came up. Nothing could exceed
the comfortless desolation of the poor little
abode. The black clouds travelling overhead seemed
to break directly against the small, bare window;
presently some big drops fell from the roof; one
leak in especial, directly over the black, cold fireplace
was so persistent that at last, seeing that the
water was forming into a thin stream, the young
man reached out and shoved Uncle Isidoro's earthenware
saucepan beneath it. Drip, drip, drip, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
sound was like the monotonous and melancholy ticking
of a clock. Night descended, if anything colder
and more dreary than before; the rain came down
steadily, and the drops fell into the saucepan with
the regularity of a machine. Costantino did not
move; he had neither wood wherewith to build a
fire, nor any more food, and it did not occur to
him to get up, to bestir himself, to go out, to live.
Perhaps Uncle Isidoro was stalled in some neighbouring
village by the storm, and would not get
back.</p>

<p>During the night fever set in, and Costantino
was racked by hideous dreams, painful memories
of the past, tempests of anger, mingled with physical
suffering. How long he lay in this condition he
could never remember, only he recollected hearing
the steady drip, drip of the water as it fell into the
saucepan, the beating of the rain on the roof, and
the long sob of the wind as it swept about the deserted
house. In the intervals of the fever, when
he would arouse from the lethargy that weighed him
down, he was conscious of sharp, shooting pains
through all his limbs, similar to those he had felt
in prison on awaking after a feverish night; and
also of a savage, animal desire to do some harm,
to fling himself on some one or some thing, and
bite, and tear, and destroy. Another day and night
went by. The rain was falling more heavily than
ever, and that steady, inexorable drip, drip had
at last filled and overflowed the saucepan. Between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
cold and starvation Costantino had almost come to
the end of his forces. Once he was visited by a
horrid illusion. He thought that a mad dog had
thrown him down and bitten him in the stomach.
He awoke shaking, and could not throw the idea
off; perhaps he had been bitten by a mad dog, and
this was hydrophobia! Towards evening the storm
died down, though the rain did not cease entirely.
Then, suddenly, he felt that he was dying; he had
no sense of rebellion now; all that was over; he
seemed to have lost even the power to care. To die,
to die&mdash;Why should he want to go on living?
Everything both within him and about him was
black and void. Through all his fever-ridden dreams
one idea had remained persistently by him&mdash;that
he was about to commit a crime. Now it was Aunt
Martina whom he was on the point of stabbing;
then some one else; but in the intervals of consciousness
he realised that should he live, should he once
more find himself burdened with the dolorous gift
of existence, while he would not even attempt to
resist the secret force that was urging him on, it
would matter little against whom his fury expended
itself; it might be Aunt Martina, or Brontu, or some
one else. But then&mdash;then&mdash;deep down in his soul
he could never rid himself of a sense of terror of
<i>what would happen afterwards</i>. Yes; he wanted
to die, so as to suffer no more and to be saved from
becoming a murderer.</p>

<p>At last the rain was ceasing; it still fell steadily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
but more, now, like a gentle shower, while the wind
had died down completely. It was cold, though,
and the damp, chill atmosphere hung over the cabin
like a heavy wet cloth. So unutterably dreary were
the weather and the surroundings that Costantino,
recalling the periods of his most acute misery, could
never remember being so utterly and hopelessly
wretched as now. Not even on the day of the sentence,
not even on the day when they had told him
of the divorce, nor on that other day of his return:
for on every one of those occasions, desperate as
the outlook had been, there always remained the
hope of better things in the life to come. Then his
conscience had been pure; but now, should he go
on living, he believed that he would surely forfeit
all hope in the life to come. At times, goaded by
this horror, he would cry aloud, imploring death to
come and save him, as a terrified child cries for its
mother.</p>

<p>Thus the hours wore on; he had dropped into
a feverish sleep, but awoke suddenly, trembling with
terror at he could not tell what. The rain was over
at last, but in the profound stillness that enwrapped
him, Costantino fancied that he still heard it beating
on the roof, and the drip, drip from the leak
over the fireplace; only now the sounds seemed to
come from far, far away, from a world that was
already remote. He thought that he was already
dead, or lingering on the extremest confines of life,
in a place of shadows, of silence, of mystery. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
would he find there&mdash;just beyond? The light of
eternity, or&mdash;the darkness of eternity? He was
afraid to open his eyes; he tried to cry out, but
could not utter a sound. Then&mdash;a knock came on
the door. The sound dragged him back from that
vague tide on which he was floating; he opened
his eyes without moving, conscious both of relief
and regret at finding himself still alive.</p>

<p>The knocking was repeated louder than before.
Who could it be? Not Uncle Isidoro; he would
have called out.</p>

<p>Costantino neither stirred nor spoke. Possibly
he had not the strength to get up, but in any case
he had no wish to. Why must they come to disturb
him? dragging him back from those mysterious
shores on which he had almost set foot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the knocking continued still more vigorously,
but after a little it ceased, and everything
became perfectly still. A short time elapsed; then
some one again approached the hut; presently the
end of a stout stick was thrust under the door, serving
as a lever; the frail barrier, secured only by a
metal hasp, quickly yielded, and the figure of a
woman, with a skirt thrown over her head and
shoulders, appeared for a moment in the opening;
stepping inside, she turned and replaced the rickety
door before Costantino was able to recognise
her. There was a moment of breathless silence,
during which he could hear his visitor groping her
way about, in the pitchy darkness, on the other side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of the hut; then she spoke, and he recognised the
voice of Aunt Bachissia.</p>

<p>"Costantino! Are you there? Where are you?
Are you dead or alive? Why don't you answer?
Some one said you had not been seen for three
days, and that Isidoro Pane was away. I came once
before and knocked and knocked, but you wouldn't
answer. What's the matter? are you sick?"</p>

<p>Still he made no reply, burying his face like a
sulky child.</p>

<p>"My soul!" moaned the woman, "he must be
ill as well."</p>

<p><i>As well!</i> Then some one else was ill! Who, he
wondered. Perhaps Giovanna. He listened intently,
still keeping his face covered.</p>

<p>"He has no fire and no light!" she muttered.
"What does it all mean? Wait, I'll strike a light.
Where are my matches?"</p>

<p>The pale, blue flame of a sulphur match shot
up for a moment, and then suddenly died away.</p>

<p>Costantino could see nothing, but he heard Aunt
Bachissia stumbling her way towards him, moaning:
"Costantino, Costantino!"</p>

<p>A wave of anger swept over him; he tried to
cry out, to rise and fling himself upon her, choke
her&mdash;but he was powerless. A cold sweat broke
out all over him, and he knew that if he attempted
so much as to speak, he would burst into tears.
How hatefully weak he was!</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia struck another match, and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
searching for a light of some sort, but all she could
find was a rude iron lamp hanging on a nail, with
neither wick nor oil. Then she groped her way
to the fireplace, and, stooping down, held out her
hand with the lighted match between her fingers.
There were the saucepan full of water, the heap of
wet ashes, the soaked hearthstone, and beyond, half
in the circle of light, the figure of Costantino extended
motionless on the pallet. The match flared
up and then went out, and all became again perfectly
dark and silent.</p>

<p>For a moment Aunt Bachissia did not stir; she
hardly seemed to breathe; then a long, choking sob
broke from her.</p>

<p>Of what had she been thinking in that moment of
silence and darkness? Did that vision of Costantino
lying apparently dead before her awaken a
sudden, agonising sense of what she had done; of
her iniquitous responsibility in the ruin that had
been wrought in Giovanna's and Costantino's lives,
and in the lives of every one concerned in the melancholy
drama? Throwing herself on the floor beside
the pallet, she passed her hands tremblingly over
his body and face, sobbing in the darkness and silence:
"Costantino, Costantino! are you alive?
Answer me&mdash;&mdash;Yes," she murmured presently,
"he is alive, but ill, ill&mdash;you are ill, aren't you?"
she went on coaxingly. "Is it a wound? Ah, God!
If you only knew what terrible things have happened!
Giovanna sent me; she was frightened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
you know; she thought you might have been hurt,
that some one might have been lying in wait for
you; she's more dead than alive herself&mdash;Costantino&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>At last Costantino gave a moan; something hard
in his breast seemed to melt; he was moved&mdash;affected.
Then he was not forgotten, after all; Giovanna
had been anxious; she had sent to find out
about him; she was frightened, unhappy. Then, in
his changed mood, Aunt Bachissia's words of a
moment before came back to him with fresh meaning.
"He is ill <i>as well</i>," she had said. Who was
this other person who was ill? Again he thought
of Giovanna, and his heart sank.</p>

<p>"Is it a wound?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Costantino.</p>

<p>"Who did it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; some one hired by Aunt Martina
Dejas."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Aunt Bachissia, her voice thick with
anger; then, in a changed tone, she said: "The
saying goes that God does not pay on Saturday&mdash;well,&mdash;Brontu
Dejas is dying&mdash;poor wretch!"</p>

<p>Costantino felt as though an electric shock had
gone through him; he started to his feet, swayed,
and fell back on his knees. In the darkness his
hands encountered those of Aunt Bachissia, and she
felt that they were scorching hot and trembling.</p>

<p>"Costantino! my soul!" she cried, alarmed lest
in his weak and exhausted condition the shock of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
her news had been too great for him. "Costantino,
what is it? You are shaking all over like a
little kid! Yes; Brontu is very ill. He came back
yesterday; it was a holiday, you know, and he came
home so drunk that he was like something crazy.
It seems that he has been drinking all the time lately,
even up at the sheepfolds. So then yesterday when
he came in he was horribly drunk, and he began
quarrelling with his mother and Giovanna, and
tried to beat them; they were so frightened that they
ran up and locked themselves in their rooms.
Brontu stayed down in the kitchen, and he must
have stretched himself out alongside the fire. After
some time they heard him crying out, but they
thought it was just some drunken foolishness, and
did not go down to see what it was. After a
while, though, when he had become quiet, Aunt Martina
went and found him lying there unconscious
and frightfully burned. He had evidently fallen
asleep and had put his legs right over the fire,<a name="Anchor-10" id="Anchor-10"></a><a href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a>
and then his clothing caught. There was an empty
brandy bottle lying beside him. He hasn't come to
since, and the doctor says he can't live through the
night. Poor Brontu; he wasn't bad; he was weak,
but not really bad&mdash;Costantino! Costantino!&mdash;what
on earth is it? What are you doing?"
For in the darkness Aunt Bachissia, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
told her story with moans and sighs of sympathy,
partly for Costantino, partly for Brontu, heard
what she at first took to be a burst of insane laughter.
The young man's hands became rigid, his limbs
contracted, and for one wild moment she thought
he had lost his reason. Then the truth broke upon
her; he was crying, weeping bitterly, half from
weakness and reaction, but half, too, from horror
and sympathy at the awful ending of a man whom,
but a short while before, he had thought that he
hated so much that he was in danger of killing
him.</p>


<p class="break">That same night Brontu died, and some time
later Giovanna and Costantino were reunited. Old
Aunt Martina, absorbed in her grief and completely
shattered by it, like an oak-tree that has been struck
by lightning, offered no objection, but neither did
she forgive the young people, and she demanded
that the little Mariedda should be left under her
care. Thus the two, the old woman and the child,
lived on in the white house, while Giovanna and
Costantino returned to the little grey cottage.
There, after a time, another child was born to
them&mdash;Malthineddu.</p>


<p class="break">It is a soft spring day. Overhead the sky is a
tender blue, and all around the village the fields of
grain sway like the waves of a green, encircling
sea. Aunt Martina sits on the portico, spinning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
and praying silently; a white, tragic figure, spiritualised
by sorrow.</p>

<p>Aunt Bachissia sits spinning likewise, before the
door of the cottage. Giovanna is sewing, and hard
by Costantino works at his bench. No one speaks,
but the thoughts of all are turned on the past.</p>

<p>In the middle of the common Mariedda and Malthineddu
are playing together with gurgles and
shouts of joyous laughter, as happy and unconcerned
as the birds on the neighbouring hedges.</p>

<p>Hither and thither they go, trotting from Aunt
Martina to Costantino, from Aunt Bachissia to Giovanna,
from Giovanna to Aunt Martina. And each
in turn, even the desolate, heartbroken old grandmother,
looks up to receive them with a smile of
tender indulgence. They are the invisible woof of
peace and mutual forgiveness.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
