<h4><a name="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE" id="TRANSLATORS_PREFACE">TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE</a></h4>


<p>Henri Louis Bergson was born in Paris, October
18, 1859. He entered the École normale in
1878, and was admitted agrégé de philosophie
in 1881 and docteur ès lettres in 1889. After
holding professorships in various provincial and
Parisian lycées, he became maître de conférences
at the École normale supérieure in 1897, and
since 1900 has been professor at the Collège de
France. In 1901 he became a member of the
Institute on his election to the Académie des
Sciences morales et politiques.</p>

<p>A full list of Professor Bergson's works is given
in the appended bibliography. In making the
following translation of his <i>Essai sur les données
immédiates de la conscience</i> I have had the great
advantage of his co-operation at every stage,
and the aid which he has given has been most
generous and untiring. The book itself was
worked out and written during the years 1883
to 1887 and was originally published in 1889.
The foot-notes in the French edition contain a
certain number of references to French translations
of English works. In the present translation
I am responsible for citing these references
from the original English. This will account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
for the fact that editions are sometimes referred
to which have appeared subsequently to 1889.
I have also added fairly extensive marginal
summaries and a full index.</p>

<p>In France the <i>Essai</i> is already in its seventh
edition. Indeed, one of the most striking facts
about Professor Bergson's works is the extent
to which they have appealed not only to the
professional philosophers, but also to the ordinary
cultivated public. The method which he pursues
is not the conceptual and abstract method which
has been the dominant tradition in philosophy.
For him reality is not to be reached by any
elaborate construction of thought: it is given
in immediate experience as a flux, a continuous
process of becoming, to be grasped by intuition,
by sympathetic insight. Concepts break up the
continuous flow of reality into parts external to
one another, they further the interests of language
and social life and are useful primarily for practical
purposes. But they give us nothing of the
life and movement of reality; rather, by substituting
for this an artificial reconstruction, a
patchwork of dead fragments, they lead to the
difficulties which have always beset the intellectualist
philosophy, and which on its premises
are insoluble. Instead of attempting a solution
in the intellectualist sense, Professor Bergson
calls upon his readers to put these broken fragments
of reality behind them, to immerse themselves
in the living stream of things and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
find their difficulties swept away in its resistless
flow.</p>

<p>In the present volume Professor Bergson first
deals with the intensity of conscious states. He
shows that quantitative differences are applicable
only to magnitudes, that is, in the last resort,
to space, and that intensity in itself is purely
qualitative. Passing then from the consideration
of separate conscious states to their multiplicity,
he finds that there are two forms of multiplicity:
quantitative or discrete multiplicity involves the
intuition of space, but the multiplicity of conscious
states is wholly qualitative. This unfolding
multiplicity constitutes duration, which is a
succession without distinction, an interpenetration
of elements so heterogeneous that former states
can never recur. The idea of a homogeneous
and measurable time is shown to be an artificial
concept, formed by the intrusion of the idea of
space into the realm of pure duration. Indeed,
the whole of Professor Bergson's philosophy
centres round his conception of <i>real concrete
duration</i> and the specific <i>feeling</i> of duration which
our consciousness has when it does away with
convention and habit and gets back to its natural
attitude. At the root of most errors in philosophy
he finds a confusion between this <i>concrete duration</i>
and the <i>abstract time</i> which mathematics, physics,
and even language and common sense, substitute
for it. Applying these results to the problem
of free will, he shows that the difficulties arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
from taking up one's stand <i>after</i> the act has been
performed, and applying the conceptual method
to it. From the point of view of the living,
developing self these difficulties are shown to be
illusory, and freedom, though not definable in
abstract or conceptual terms, is declared to be
one of the clearest facts established by observation.</p>

<p>It is no doubt misleading to attempt to sum
up a system of philosophy in a sentence, but
perhaps some part of the spirit of Professor Bergson's
philosophy may be gathered from the motto
which, with his permission, I have prefixed to
this translation:&mdash;"If a man were to inquire
of Nature the reason of her creative activity,
and if she were willing to give ear and answer,
she would say&mdash;'Ask me not, but understand
in silence, even as I am silent and am not wont
to speak.'"</p>

<h4><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR'S PREFACE</a></h4>


<p>We necessarily express ourselves by means of
words and we usually think in terms of space.
That is to say, language requires us to establish
between our ideas the same sharp and precise
distinctions, the same discontinuity, as between
material objects. This assimilation of thought to
things is useful in practical life and necessary in
most of the sciences. But it may be asked whether
the insurmountable difficulties presented by certain
philosophical problems do not arise from our
placing side by side in space phenomena which
do not occupy space, and whether, by merely
getting rid of the clumsy symbols round which
we are fighting, we might not bring the fight to
an end. When an illegitimate translation of the
unextended into the extended, of quality into
quantity, has introduced contradiction into the
very heart of the question, contradiction must,
of course, recur in the answer.</p>

<p>The problem which I have chosen is one which
is common to metaphysics and psychology, the
problem of free will. What I attempt to prove
is that all discussion between the determinists
and their opponents implies a previous confusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
of duration with extensity, of succession with
simultaneity, of quality with quantity: this
confusion once dispelled, we may perhaps witness
the disappearance of the objections raised against
free will, of the definitions given of it, and, in a
certain sense, of the problem of free will itself.
To prove this is the object of the third part of
the present volume: the first two chapters,
which treat of the conceptions of intensity and
duration, have been written as an introduction
to the third.</p>

<h4>THE INTENSITY OF PSYCHIC STATES</h4>

<div class="sidenote">Can there be quantitative differences in conscious states?</div>

<p>It is usually admitted that states of consciousness,
sensations, feelings, passions, efforts, are capable
of growth and diminution; we are
even told that a sensation can be said
to be twice, thrice, four times as intense
as another sensation of the same kind.
This latter thesis, which is maintained by psychophysicists,
we shall examine later; but even the
opponents of psychophysics do not see any harm
in speaking of one sensation as being more intense
than another, of one effort as being greater than
another, and in thus setting up differences of
quantity between purely internal states. Common
sense, moreover, has not the slightest hesitation
in giving its verdict on this point; people
say they are more or less warm, or more or less
sad, and this distinction of more and less, even
when it is carried over to the region of subjective
facts and unextended objects, surprises nobody.
But this involves a very obscure point and a
much more important problem than is usually
supposed.</p>

<p>When we assert that one number is greater than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
another number or one body greater than another
body, we know very well what we mean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Such differences applicable to
magnitudes but not to intensities.</div>

<p>For in both cases we allude to unequal
spaces, as shall be shown in detail a
little further on, and we call that space
the greater which contains the other. But how
can a more intense sensation contain one of less
intensity? Shall we say that the first implies the
second, that we reach the sensation of higher
intensity only on condition of having first passed
through the less intense stages of the same sensation,
and that in a certain sense we are concerned,
here also, with the relation of container to contained?
This conception of intensive magnitude
seems, indeed, to be that of common sense, but we
cannot advance it as a philosophical explanation
without becoming involved in a vicious circle.
For it is beyond doubt that, in the natural series of
numbers, the later number exceeds the earlier,
but the very possibility of arranging the numbers
in ascending order arises from their having to
each other relations of container and contained,
so that we feel ourselves able to explain precisely
in what sense one is greater than the other. The
question, then, is how we succeed in forming a
series of this kind with intensities, which cannot
be superposed on each other, and by what sign
we recognize that the members of this series increase,
for example, instead of diminishing: but
this always comes back to the inquiry, why an
intensity can be assimilated to a magnitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Alleged distinction between two kinds of
quantity: extensive and intensive magnitude.</div>

<p>It is only to evade the difficulty to distinguish,
as is usually done, between two species of quantity,
the first extensive and measurable, the
second intensive and not admitting of
measure, but of which it can nevertheless
be said that it is greater or less than
another intensity. For it is recognized
thereby that there is something common to these
two forms of magnitude, since they are both
termed magnitudes and declared to be equally
capable of increase and diminution. But, from
the point of view of magnitude, what can there
be in common between the extensive and the
intensive, the extended and the unextended?
If, in the first case, we call that which contains
the other the greater quantity, why go on speaking
of quantity and magnitude when there is
no longer a container or a contained? If a
quantity can increase and diminish, if we
perceive in it, so to speak, the <i>less</i> inside
the <i>more,</i> is not such a quantity on this very
account divisible, and thereby extended? Is
it not then a contradiction to speak of an inextensive
quantity? But yet common sense agrees
with the philosophers in setting up a pure intensity
as a magnitude, just as if it were something
extended. And not only do we use the same word,
but whether we think of a greater intensity or a
greater extensity, we experience in both cases
an analogous impression; the terms "greater"
and "less" call up in both cases the same idea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
If we now ask ourselves in what does this idea
consist, our consciousness still offers us the image
of a container and a contained. We picture to
ourselves, for example, a greater intensity of effort
as a greater length of thread rolled up, or as a
spring which, in unwinding, will occupy a greater
space. In the idea of intensity, and even in the
word which expresses it, we shall find the image
of a present contraction and consequently a future
expansion, the image of something virtually
extended, and, if we may say so, of a compressed
space. We are thus led to believe that we
translate the intensive into the extensive, and
that we compare two intensities, or at least
express the comparison, by the confused intuition
of a relation between two extensities. But it is
just the nature of this operation which it is difficult
to determine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to distinguish intensities
by objective causes. But we judge of intensity
without knowing magnitude or nature of the cause.</div>

<p>The solution which occurs immediately to the
mind, once it has entered upon this path, consists
in defining the intensity of a sensation,
or of any state whatever of the ego, by
the number and magnitude of the objective,
and therefore measurable, causes
which have given rise to it. Doubtless,
a more intense sensation of light is the
one which has been obtained, or is
obtainable, by means of a larger number of luminous
sources, provided they be at the same distance
and identical with one another. But, in
the immense majority of cases, we decide about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the intensity of the effect without even knowing
the nature of the cause, much less its magnitude:
indeed, it is the very intensity of the effect which
often leads us to venture an hypothesis as to the
number and nature of the causes, and thus to
revise the judgment of our senses, which at first
represented them as insignificant. And it is no use
arguing that we are then comparing the actual
state of the ego with some previous state in which
the cause was perceived in its entirety at the same
time as its effect was experienced. No doubt
this is our procedure in a fairly large number of
cases; but we cannot then explain the differences
of intensity which we recognize between deep-seated
psychic phenomena, the cause of which is
within us and not outside. On the other hand,
we are never so bold in judging the intensity of a
psychic state as when the subjective aspect of
the phenomenon is the only one to strike us, or
when the external cause to which we refer it does
not easily admit of measurement. Thus it seems
evident that we experience a more intense pain
at the pulling out of a tooth than of a hair; the
artist knows without the possibility of doubt that
the picture of a master affords him more intense
pleasure than the signboard of a shop; and there
is not the slightest need ever to have heard of
forces of cohesion to assert that we expend less
effort in bending a steel blade than a bar of iron.
Thus the comparison of two intensities is usually
made without the least appreciation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
number of causes, their mode of action or their
extent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to distinguish intensities by
atomic movements. But it is the sensation which
is given in consciousness, and not the movement.</div>

<p>There is still room, it is true, for an hypothesis
of the same nature, but more subtle. We know
that mechanical, and especially kinetic,
theories aim at explaining the visible
and sensible properties of bodies by
<i>well</i> defined movements of their ultimate
parts, and many of us foresee the
time when the intensive differences of
qualities, that is to say, of our sensations,
will be reduced to extensive differences
between the changes taking place behind them.
May it not be maintained that, without knowing
these theories, we have a vague surmise of them,
that behind the more intense sound we guess the
presence of ampler vibrations which are propagated
in the disturbed medium, and that it is
with a reference to this mathematical relation,
precise in itself though confusedly perceived, that
we assert the higher intensity of a particular
sound? Without even going so far, could it not
be laid down that every state of consciousness
corresponds to a certain disturbance of the molecules
and atoms of the cerebral substance, and
that the intensity of a sensation measures the
amplitude, the complication or the extent of these
molecular movements? This last hypothesis is
at least as probable as the other, but it no more
solves the problem. For, quite possibly, the intensity
of a sensation bears witness to a more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
less considerable work accomplished in our organism;
but it is the sensation which is given to
us in consciousness, and not this mechanical work.
Indeed, it is by the intensity of the sensation
that we judge of the greater or less amount of
work accomplished: intensity then remains, at
least apparently, a property of sensation. And
still the same question recurs: why do we say
of a higher intensity that it is greater? Why
do we think of a greater quantity or a greater
space?</p>


<div class="sidenote" style="margin-top: 2em;">[Sidenote: Different kinds of intensities. (1)
deep-seated psychic statese (2)muscular effort.
Intensity is more easily definable in the former case.</div>

<p class="p2">Perhaps the difficulty of the problem lies chiefly
in the fact that we call by the same name, and
picture to ourselves in the same way,
intensities which are very different in
nature, e.g. the intensity of a feeling
and that of a sensation or an effort.</p>

<p>The effort is accompanied by a muscular
sensation, and the sensations themselves
are connected with certain physical conditions
which probably count for something in
the estimate of their intensity: we have here to
do with phenomena which take place on the surface
of consciousness, and which are always connected,
as we shall see further on, with the perception
of a movement or of an external object. But
certain states of the soul seem to us, rightly or
wrongly, to be self-sufficient, such as deep joy or
sorrow, a reflective passion or an aesthetic emotion.
Pure intensity ought to be more easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
definable in these simple cases, where no extensive
element seems to be involved. We shall see, in
fact, that it is reducible here to a certain quality
or shade which spreads over a more or less considerable
mass of psychic states, or, if the expression
be preferred, to the larger or smaller number
of simple states which make up the fundamental
emotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Take, for example, the progress of a desire.</div>

<p>For example, an obscure desire gradually becomes
a deep passion. Now, you will see that
thee feeble intensity of this desire consisted
at first in its appearing to be
isolated and, as it were, foreign to the
remainder of your inner life. But little by little
it permeates a larger number of psychic elements,
tingeing them, so to speak, with its own colour:
and lo! your outlook on the whole of your
surroundings seems now to have changed radically.
How do you become aware of a deep
passion, once it has taken hold of you, if
not by perceiving that the same objects no
longer impress you in the same manner? All
your sensations and all your ideas seem to brighten
up: it is like childhood back again. We experience
something of the kind in certain dreams, in
which we do not imagine anything out of the
ordinary, and yet through which there resounds
an indescribable note of originality. The fact is
that, the further we penetrate into the depths
of consciousness, the less right we have to treat
psychic phenomena as things which are set side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
by side. When it is said that an object occupies
a large space in the soul or even that it fills it
entirely, we ought to understand by this simply
that its image has altered the shade of a thousand
perceptions or memories, and that in this sense
it pervades them, although it does not itself come
into view. But this wholly dynamic way of
looking at things is repugnant to the reflective
consciousness, because the latter delights in clean
cut distinctions, which are easily expressed in
words, and in things with well-defined outlines,
like those which are perceived in space. It will
assume then that, everything else remaining
identical, such and such a desire has gone up a
scale of magnitudes, as though it were permissible
still to speak of magnitude where there is neither
multiplicity nor space! But just as consciousness
(as will be shown later on) concentrates on a given
point of the organism the increasing number of
muscular contractions which take place on the
surface of the body, thus converting them into
one single feeling of effort, of growing intensity,
so it will hypostatize under the form of a growing
desire the gradual alterations which take place
in the confused heap of co-existing psychic states.
But that is a change of quality rather than of
magnitude.</p>

<p>What makes hope such an intense pleasure
is the fact that the future, which we dispose of to
our liking, appears to us at the same time under
a multitude of forms, equally attractive and equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
possible. Even if the most coveted of these becomes
realized, it will be necessary to give up the
others, and we shall have lost a great deal. The
idea of the future, pregnant with an infinity of
possibilities, is thus more fruitful than the future
itself, and this is why we find more charm in hope
than in possession, in dreams than in reality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The emotions of joy and sorrow. Their
successive stages correspond to qualitative changes
in the whole of our psychic states.</div>

<p>Let us try to discover the nature of an increasing
intensity of joy or sorrow in the exceptional
cases where no physical symptom intervenes.
Neither inner joy nor passion
is an isolated inner state which at first
occupies a corner of the soul and gradually
spreads. At its lowest level it is
very like a turning of our states of consciousness
towards the future. Then, as if their
weight were diminished by this attraction, our ideas
and sensations succeed one another with greater
rapidity; our movements no longer cost us
the same effort. Finally, in cases of extreme
joy, our perceptions and memories become tinged
with an indefinable quality, as with a kind of heat
or light, so novel that now and then, as we stare
at our own self, we wonder how it can really exist.
Thus there are several characteristic forms of
purely inward joy, all of which are successive
stages corresponding to qualitative alterations
in the whole of our psychic states. But the number
of states which are concerned with each of
these alterations is more or less considerable, and,
without explicitly counting them, we know very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
well whether, for example, our joy pervades all
the impressions which we receive in the course of
the day or whether any escape from its influence.
We thus set up points of division in the interval
which separates two successive forms of joy, and
this gradual transition from one to the other makes
them appear in their turn as different intensities
of one and the same feeling, which is thus supposed
to change in magnitude. It could be easily
shown that the different degrees of sorrow also
correspond to qualitative changes. Sorrow begins
by being nothing more than a facing towards the
past, an impoverishment of our sensations and
ideas, as if each of them were now contained
entirely in the little which it gives out, as if the
future were in some way stopped up. And it
ends with an impression of crushing failure, the
effect of which is that we aspire to nothingness,
while every new misfortune, by making us understand
better the uselessness of the struggle,
causes us a bitter pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The aesthetic feelings. Their increasing
intensities are really different feelings.</div>

<p>The aesthetic feelings offer us a still more
striking example of this progressive stepping in
of new elements, which can be detected
in the fundamental emotion and which
seem to increase its magnitude, although
in reality they do nothing more than
alter its nature. Let us consider the simplest
of them, the feeling of grace. At first it is only
the perception of a certain ease, a certain facility
in the outward movements. And as those movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
are easy which prepare the way for others,
we are led to find a superior ease in the movements
which can be foreseen, in the present attitudes
in which future attitudes are pointed out and, as
it were, prefigured. If jerky movements are
wanting in grace, the reason is that each of them
is self-sufficient and does not announce those
which are to follow. If curves are more graceful
than broken lines, the reason is that, while a curved
line changes its direction at every moment, every
new direction is indicated in the preceding one.
Thus the perception of ease in motion passes over
into the pleasure of mastering the flow of time
and of holding the future in the present. A third
element comes in when the graceful movements
submit to a rhythm and are accompanied by music.
For the rhythm and measure, by allowing us to foresee
to a still greater extent the movements of the
dancer, make us believe that we now control them.
As we guess almost the exact attitude which
the dancer is going to take, he seems to obey us
when he really takes it: the regularity of the
rhythm establishes a kind of communication between
him and us, and the periodic returns of the
measure are like so many invisible threads by
means of which we set in motion this imaginary
puppet. Indeed, if it stops for an instant, our
hand in its impatience cannot refrain from making
a movement, as though to push it, as though to
replace it in the midst of this movement, the
rhythm of which has taken complete possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
of our thought and will. Thus a kind of physical
sympathy enters into the feeling of grace. Now,
in analysing the charm of this sympathy, you will
find that it pleases you through its affinity with
moral sympathy, the idea of which it subtly suggests.
This last element, in which the others are
merged after having in a measure ushered it in,
explains the irresistible attractiveness of grace.
We could hardly make out why it affords us such
pleasure if it were nothing but a saving of effort,
as Spencer maintains.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But the truth is that
in anything which we call very graceful we imagine
ourselves able to detect, besides the lightness
which is a sign of mobility, some suggestion of a
possible movement towards ourselves, of a virtual
and even nascent sympathy. It is this mobile
sympathy, always ready to offer itself, which is
just the essence of higher grace. Thus the increasing
intensities of aesthetic feeling are here
resolved into as many different feelings, each one
of which, already heralded by its predecessor,
becomes perceptible in it and then completely
eclipses it. It is this qualitative progress which
we interpret as a change of magnitude, because
we like simple thoughts and because our language
is ill-suited to render the subtleties of psychological
analysis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The feeling of beauty: art puts to sleep
our active and resistant powers and makes us responsive
to suggestion.</div>

<p>To understand how the feeling of the beautiful
itself admits of degrees, we should have to submit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
it to a minute analysis. Perhaps the difficulty
which we experience in defining: it is
largely owing to the fact that we look
upon the beauties of nature as anterior
to those of art: the processes
of art are thus supposed to be nothing
more than means by which the artist expresses
the beautiful, and the essence of the beautiful
remains unexplained. But we might ask ourselves
whether nature is beautiful otherwise than
through meeting by chance certain processes of
our art, and whether, in a certain sense, art is not
prior to nature. Without even going so far, it
seems more in conformity with the rules of a sound
method to study the beautiful first in the works
in which it has been produced by a conscious effort,
and then to pass on by imperceptible steps from
art to nature, which may be looked upon as an
artist in its own way. By placing ourselves at this
point of view, we shall perceive that the object of
art is to put to sleep the active or rather resistant
powers of our personality, and thus to bring us
into a state of perfect responsiveness, in which
we realize the idea that is suggested to us and sympathize
with the feeling that is expressed. In the
processes of art we shall find, in a weakened form, a
refined and in some measure spiritualized version
of the processes commonly used to induce the state
of hypnosis. Thus, in music, the rhythm and
measure suspend the normal flow of our sensations
and ideas by causing our attention to swing to and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
fro between fixed points, and they take hold of us
with such force that even the faintest imitation
of a groan will suffice to fill us with the utmost
sadness. If musical sounds affect us more powerfully
than the sounds of nature, the reason is that
nature confines itself to <i>expressing</i> feelings, whereas
music <i>suggests</i> them to us. Whence indeed
comes the charm of poetry? The poet is he with
whom feelings develop into images, and the images
themselves into words which translate them while
obeying the laws of rhythm. In seeing these
images pass before our eyes we in our turn experience
the feeling which was, so to speak, their
emotional equivalent: but we should never realize
these images so strongly without the regular movements
of the rhythm by which our soul is lulled
into self-forgetfulness, and, as in a dream, thinks
and sees with the poet. The plastic arts obtain
an effect of the same kind by the fixity which
they suddenly impose upon life, and which a
physical contagion carries over to the attention of
the spectator. While the works of ancient sculpture
express faint emotions which play upon them
like a passing breath, the pale immobility of the
stone causes the feeling expressed or the movement
just begun to appear as if they were fixed for
ever, absorbing our thought and our will in their
own eternity. We find in architecture, in the
very midst of this startling immobility, certain
effects analogous to those of rhythm. The symmetry
of form, the indefinite repetition of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
architectural motive, causes our faculty of perception
to oscillate between the same and the same
again, and gets rid of those customary incessant
changes which in ordinary life bring us back without
ceasing to the consciousness of our personality:
even the faint suggestion of an idea will then be
enough to make the idea fill the whole of our mind.
Thus art aims at impressing feelings on us rather
than expressing them; it suggests them to us, and
willingly dispenses with the imitation of nature
when it finds some more efficacious means. Nature,
like art, proceeds by suggestion, but does not command
the resources of rhythm. It supplies the
deficiency by the long comradeship, based on
influences received in common by nature and by
ourselves, of which the effect is that the slightest
indication by nature of a feeling arouses sympathy
in our minds, just as a mere gesture on the
part of the hypnotist is enough to force the
intended suggestion upon a subject accustomed
to his control. And this sympathy is
shown in particular when nature displays to us
beings of <i>normal</i> proportions, so that our attention
is distributed equally over all the parts of the
figure without being fixed on any one of them:
our perceptive faculty then finds itself lulled and
soothed by this harmony, and nothing hinders
any longer the free play of sympathy, which is
ever ready to come forward as soon as the obstacle
in its path is removed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stages in the aesthetic emotion.</div>

<p>It follows from this analysis that the feeling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the beautiful is no specific feeling, but that every
feeling experienced by us will assume
an aesthetic character, provided that it
has been <i>suggested,</i> and not <i>caused.</i> It
will now be understood why the aesthetic emotion
seems to us to admit of degrees of intensity, and
also of degrees of elevation. Sometimes the feeling
which is suggested scarcely makes a break in
the compact texture of psychic phenomena of
which our history consists; sometimes it draws
our attention from them, but not so that they
become lost to sight; sometimes, finally, it puts
itself in their place, engrosses us and completely
monopolizes our soul. There are thus distinct
phases in the progress of an aesthetic feeling,
as in the state of hypnosis; and these phases
correspond less to variations of degree than to
differences of state or of nature. But the merit
of a work of art is not measured so much by the
power with which the suggested feeling takes hold
of us as by the richness of this feeling itself: in
other words, besides degrees of intensity we
instinctively distinguish degrees of depth or elevation.
If this last concept be analysed, it will be
seen that the feelings and thoughts which the artist
suggests to us express and sum up a more or less
considerable part of his history. If the art which
gives only sensations is an inferior art, the reason
is that analysis often fails to discover in a sensation
anything beyond the sensation itself. But
the greater number of emotions are instinct with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
thousand sensations, feelings or ideas which pervade
them: each one is then a state unique of its kind
and indefinable, and it seems that we should have
to re-live the life of the subject who experiences it
if we wished to grasp it in its original complexity.
Yet the artist aims at giving us a share in this
emotion, so rich, so personal, so novel, and at
enabling us to experience what he cannot make us
understand. This he will bring about by choosing,
among the outward signs of his emotions,
those which our body is likely to imitate mechanically,
though slightly, as soon as it perceives them,
so as to transport us all at once into the indefinable
psychological state which called them forth.
Thus will be broken down the barrier interposed
by time and space between his consciousness and
ours: and the richer in ideas and the more pregnant
with sensations and emotions is the feeling
within whose limits the artist has brought us, the
deeper and the higher shall we find the beauty thus
expressed. The successive intensities of the aesthetic
feeling thus correspond to changes of state
occurring in us, and the degrees of depth to the
larger or smaller number of elementary psychic
phenomena which we dimly discern in the fundamental
emotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The moral feelings. Pity. Its increasing
intensity is a qualitative progress.</div>

<p>The moral feelings might be studied in the same
way. Let us take pity as an example.
It consists in the first place in putting
oneself mentally in the place of others, in
suffering their pain. But if it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
nothing more, as some have maintained, it would
inspire us with the idea of avoiding the wretched
rather than helping them, for pain is naturally
abhorrent to us. This feeling of horror may indeed
be at the root of pity; but a new element soon
comes in, the need of helping our fellow-men and of
alleviating their suffering. Shall we say with La
Rochefoucauld that this so-called sympathy is a
calculation, "a shrewd insurance against evils to
come"? Perhaps a dread of some future evil
to ourselves does hold a place in our compassion
for other people's evil. These however are but
lower forms of pity. True pity consists not so
much in fearing suffering as in desiring it. The
desire is a faint one and we should hardly wish to
see it realized; yet we form it in spite of ourselves,
as if Nature were committing some great injustice
and it were necessary to get rid of all suspicion
of complicity with her. The essence of pity is thus
a need for self-abasement, an aspiration downwards.
This painful aspiration nevertheless has a
charm about it, because it raises us in our own
estimation and makes us feel superior to those
sensuous goods from which our thought is temporarily
detached. The increasing intensity of
pity thus consists in a qualitative progress, in a
transition from repugnance to fear, from fear
to sympathy, and from sympathy itself to humility.</p>


<div class="sidenote" style="margin-top: 2em;">Conscious states connected with external
causes or involving psychical symptoms.</div>

<p class="p2">We do not propose to carry this analysis any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
further. The psychic states whose intensity we have
just defined are deep-seated states which
do not seem to have any close relation to
their external cause or to involve the perception of
muscular contraction. But such
states are rare. There is hardly any passion
or desire, any joy or sorrow, which is not accompanied
by physical symptoms; and, where these
symptoms occur, they probably count for something
in the estimate of intensities. As for the
sensations properly so called, they are manifestly
connected with their external cause, and though
the intensity of the sensation cannot be defined
by the magnitude of its cause, there undoubtedly
exists some relation between these two terms.
In some of its manifestations consciousness even
appears to spread outwards, as if intensity were
being developed into extensity, e.g. in the case of
muscular effort. Let us face this last phenomenon
at once: we shall thus be transported at a bound
to the opposite extremity of the series of psychic
phenomena.</p>


<div class="sidenote" style="margin-top: 2em;">Muscular effort seems at first sight
to be quantitative.</div>

<p class="p2">If there is a phenomenon which seems to be
presented immediately to consciousness under the
form of quantity or at least of magnitude,
it is undoubtedly muscular effort.
We picture to our minds a psychic force
imprisoned in the soul like the winds in the cave
of Aeolus, and only waiting for an opportunity to
burst forth: our will is supposed to watch over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
this force and from time to time to open a passage
for it, regulating the outflow by the effect which
it is desired to produce. If we consider the matter
carefully, we shall see that this somewhat crude
conception of effort plays a large part in our belief
in intensive magnitudes. Muscular force, whose
sphere of action is space and which manifests itself
in phenomena admitting of measure, seems to us
to have existed previous to its manifestations, but
in smaller volume, and, so to speak, in a compressed
state: hence we do not hesitate to reduce this
volume more and more, and finally we believe that
we can understand how a purely psychic state,
which does not occupy space, can nevertheless
possess magnitude. Science, too, tends to strengthen
the illusion of common sense with regard to
this point. Bain, for example, declares that "the
sensibility accompanying muscular movement
coincides with the <i>outgoing</i> stream of nervous
energy:"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> it is thus just the emission of nervous
force which consciousness perceives. Wundt
also speaks of a sensation, central in its origin,
accompanying the voluntary innervation of the
muscles, and quotes the example of the paralytic
"who has a very distinct sensation of the force
which he employs in the effort to raise his leg,
although it remains motionless."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
authorities adhere to this opinion, which would
be the unanimous view of positive science were it
not that several years ago Professor William James
drew the attention of physiologists to certain
phenomena which had been but little remarked,
although they were very remarkable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The feeling of effort. We are conscious
not of an expenditure of force but of the resulting
muscular movement.</div>

<p>When a paralytic strives to raise his useless
limb, he certainly does not execute this movement,
but, with or without his will,
he executes another. Some movement
is carried out somewhere: otherwise
there is no sensation of effort.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Vulpian
had already called attention to the
fact that if a man affected with hemiplegia
is told to clench his paralysed fist, he
unconsciously carries out this action with the
fist which is not affected. Ferrier described a
still more curious phenomenon.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Stretch out
your arm while slightly bending your forefinger,
as if you were going to press the trigger of a
pistol; without moving the finger, without
contracting any muscle of the hand, without
producing any apparent movement, you will yet
be able to feel that you are expending energy.
On a closer examination, however, you will
perceive that this sensation of effort coincides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
with the fixation of the muscles of your chest,
that you keep your glottis closed and actively
contract your respiratory muscles. As soon as
respiration resumes its normal course the consciousness
of effort vanishes, unless you really
move your finger. These facts already seemed
to show that we are conscious, not of an expenditure
of force, but of the movement of the muscles
which results from it. The new feature in Professor
James's investigation is that he has verified
the hypothesis in the case of examples which
seemed to contradict it absolutely. Thus when
the external rectus muscle of the right eye is
paralysed, the patient tries in vain to turn his
eye towards the right; yet objects seem to him
to recede towards the right, and since the act of
volition has produced no effect, it follows, said
Helmholtz,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that he is conscious of the effort of
volition. But, replies Professor James, no account
has been taken of what goes on in the other eye.
This remains covered during the experiments;
nevertheless it moves and there is not much trouble
in proving that it does. It is the movement of
the left eye, perceived by consciousness, which
produces the sensation of effort together with the
impression that the objects perceived by the right
eye are moving. These and similar observations
lead Professor James to assert that the feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of effort is centripetal and not centrifugal. We
are not conscious of a force which we are supposed
to launch upon our organism: our feeling of
muscular energy at work "is a complex afferent
sensation, which comes from contracted muscles,
stretched ligaments, compressed joints, an immobilized
chest, a closed glottis, a knit brow, clenched
jaws," in a word, from all the points of the periphery
where the effort causes an alteration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intensity of feeling of effort proportional
to extent of our body affected.</div>

<p>It is not for us to take a side in the dispute.
After all, the question with which we have to
deal is nοt whether the feeling of effort
comes from the centre or the periphery,
but in what does our perception of its
intensity exactly consist? Now, it is
sufficient to observe oneself attentively to reach
a conclusion on this point which Professor James
has not formulated, but which seems to us quite
in accord with the spirit of his teaching. We
maintain that the more a given effort seems to us
to increase, the greater is the number of muscles
which contract in sympathy with it, and that the
apparent consciousness of a greater intensity of
effort at a given point of the organism is reducible,
in reality, to the perception of a larger surface of
the body being affected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our consciousness of an increase of
muscular effort consists in the perception of (1)
a greater number of peripheral sensations (2) a
qualitative change in some of them.</div>

<p>Try, for example, to clench the fist with increasing
force. You will have the impression of a
sensation of effort entirely localized in your
hand and running up a scale of magnitudes.
In reality, what you experience in your hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
remains the same, but the sensation which was
at first localized there has affected
your arm and ascended to the shoulder;
finally, the other arm stiffens, both legs
do the same, the respiration is checked;
it is the whole body which is at work.
But you fail to notice distinctly all these
concomitant movements unless you are
warned of them: till then you thought
you were dealing with a single state of consciousness
which changed in magnitude. When you press
your lips more and more tightly against one another,
you believe that you are experiencing in your lips
one and the same sensation which is continually
increasing in strength: here again further reflection
will show you that this sensation remains
identical, but that certain muscles of the face and
the head and then of all the rest of the body have
taken part in the operation. You felt this gradual
encroachment, this increase of the surface affected,
which is in truth a change of quantity; but, as
your attention was concentrated on your closed
lips, you localized the increase there and you
made the psychic force there expended into a
magnitude, although it possessed no extensity.
Examine carefully somebody who is lifting heavier
and heavier weights: the muscular contraction
gradually spreads over his whole body. As for
the special sensation which he experiences in the
arm which is at work, it remains constant for a
very long time and hardly changes except in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
quality, the weight becoming at a certain moment
fatigue, and the fatigue pain. Yet the subject
will imagine that he is conscious of a continual
increase in the psychic force flowing
into his arm. He will not recognize his mistake
unless he is warned of it, so inclined is he to measure
a given psychic state by the conscious movements
which accompany it! From these facts and from
many others of the same kind we believe we can
deduce the following conclusion: our consciousness
of an increase of muscular effort is reducible
to the twofold perception of a greater number
of peripheral sensations, and of a qualitative
change occurring in some of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The same definition of intensity applies
to superficial efforts, deep-seated feelings and
states intermediate between the two.</div>

<p>We are thus led to define the intensity of a
superficial effort in the same way as that of a
cases there is a qualitative progress and
an increasing complexity, indistinctly
perceived. But consciousness, accustomed
to think in terms of space and to
translate its thoughts into words, will
denote the feeling by a single word and will
localize the effort at the exact point where it
yields a useful result: it will then become aware
of an effort which is always of the same nature
and increases at the spot assigned to it, and a
feeling which, retaining the same name, grows
without changing its nature. Now, the same
illusion of consciousness is likely to be met with
again in the case of the states which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
intermediate between superficial efforts and deep-seated
feelings. A large number of psychic states
are accompanied, in fact, by muscular contractions
and peripheral sensations. Sometimes these superficial
elements are co-ordinated by a purely speculative
idea, sometimes by an idea of a practical
order. In the first case there is intellectual effort
or attention; in the second we have the emotions
which may be called violent or acute: anger, terror,
and certain varieties of joy, sorrow, passion and
desire. Let us show briefly that the same definition
of intensity applies to these intermediate
states.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The intermediate states. Attention and its
relation to muscular contraction.</div>

<p>Attention is not a purely physiological phenomenon,
but we cannot deny that it is accompanied
by movements. These movements are
neither the cause nor the result of the
phenomenon; they are part of it, they
express it in terms of space, as Ribot
has so remarkably proved.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Fechner had already
reduced the effort of attention in a sense-organ to
the muscular feeling "produced by putting in
motion, by a sort of reflex action, the muscles
which are correlated with the different sense
organs." He had noticed the very distinct sensation
of tension and contraction of the scalp, the
pressure from without inwards over the whole
skull, which we experience when we make a great
effort to recall something. Ribot has studied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
more closely the movements which are characteristic
of voluntary attention. "Attention contracts
the frontal muscle: this muscle ...
draws the eyebrow towards itself, raises it and
causes transverse wrinkles on the forehead....
In extreme cases the mouth is opened wide. With
children and with many adults eager attention gives
rise to a protrusion of the lips, a kind of pout."
Certainly, a purely psychic factor will always
enter into voluntary attention, even if it be
nothing more than the exclusion by the will of all
ideas foreign to the one with which the subject
wishes to occupy himself. But, once this exclusion
is made, we believe that we are still conscious of a
growing tension of soul, of an immaterial effort
which increases. Analyse this impression and
you will find nothing but the feeling of a muscular
contraction which spreads over a wider surface or
changes its nature, so that the tension becomes
pressure, fatigue and pain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The intensity of violent emotions as
muscular tension.</div>

<p>Now, we do not see any essential difference
between the effort of attention and what may be
The intensity called the effort of psychic tension:
acute desire, uncontrolled anger, passionate
love, violent hatred. Each of these
states may be reduced, we believe, to a system of
muscular contractions co-ordinated by an idea; but
in the case of attention, it is the more or less reflective
idea of knowing; in the case of emotion, the
unreflective idea of acting. The intensity of these
violent emotions is thus likely to be nothing but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the muscular tension which accompanies them.
Darwin has given a remarkable description of the
physiological symptoms of rage. "The action of
the heart is much accelerated.... The face reddens
or may turn deadly pale. The respiration is
laboured, the chest heaves, and the dilated nostrils
quiver. The whole body often trembles. The
voice is affected. The teeth are clenched or ground
together and the muscular system is commonly
stimulated to violent, almost frantic action. The
gestures ... represent more or less plainly the
act of striking or fighting with an enemy."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> We
shall not go so far as to maintain, with Professor
James,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> that the emotion of rage is reducible to the
sum of these organic sensations: there will always
be an irreducible psychic element in anger, if this
be only the idea of striking or fighting, of which
Darwin speaks, and which gives a common direction
to so many diverse movements. But, though this
idea determines the direction of the emotional state
and the accompanying movements, the growing intensity
of the state itself is, we believe, nothing but
the deeper and deeper disturbance of the organism,
a disturbance which consciousness has no difficulty
in measuring by the number and extent of the
bodily surfaces concerned. It will be useless to
assert that there is a restrained rage which is all
the more intense. The reason is that, where
emotion has free play, consciousness does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
dwell on the details of the accompanying movements,
but it does dwell upon them and is concentrated
upon them when its object is to conceal them.
Eliminate, in short, all trace of organic disturbance,
all tendency towards muscular contraction, and
all that will be left of anger will be the idea, or, if
you still insist on making it an emotion, you will
be unable to assign it any intensity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intensity and reflex movements. No essential
difference between intensity of deep-seated feelings
and that of violent emotions.</div>

<p>"Fear, when strong," says Herbert Spencer,
"expresses itself in cries, in efforts to escape, in
palpitations, in tremblings."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> We go
further, and maintain that these movements
form part of the terror itself: by
their means the terror becomes an
emotion capable of passing through
different degrees of intensity. Suppress
them entirely, and the more or less
intense state of terror will be succeeded by an
idea of terror, the wholly intellectual representation
of a danger which it concerns us to avoid. There
are also high degrees of joy and sorrow, of desire,
aversion and even shame, the height of which will
be found to be nothing but the reflex movements
begun by the organism and perceived by consciousness.
"When lovers meet," says Darwin, "we
know that their hearts beat quickly, their breathing
is hurried and their faces flushed."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Aversion
is marked by movements of repugnance which we
repeat without noticing when we think of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
object of our dislike. We blush and involuntarily
clench the fingers when we feel shame, even if it be
retrospective. The acuteness of these emotions
is estimated by the number and nature of the
peripheral sensations which accompany them.
Little by little, and in proportion as the emotional
state loses its violence and gains in depth, the
peripheral sensations will give place to inner
states; it will be no longer our outward movements
but our ideas, our memories, our states of
consciousness of every description, which will
turn in larger or smaller numbers in a definite
direction. There is, then, no essential difference
from the point of view of intensity between the
deep-seated feelings, of which we spoke at the
beginning, and the acute or violent emotions
which we have just passed in review. To say that
love, hatred, desire, increase in violence is to
assert that they are projected outwards, that they
radiate to the surface, that peripheral sensations
are substituted for inner states: but superficial
or deep-seated, violent or reflective, the
intensity of these feelings always consists in the
multiplicity of simple states which consciousness
dimly discerns in them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Magnitude of sensations. Affective and
representative sensations.</div>

<p>We have hitherto confined ourselves to feelings
and efforts, complex states the intensity of which
does not absolutely depend on an external
cause. But sensations seem to us
simple states: in what will their magnitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
consist? The intensity of sensations varies with
the external cause of which they are said to be
the conscious equivalent: how shall we explain the
presence of quantity in an effect which is inextensive,
and in this case indivisible? To answer this
question, we must first distinguish between the
so-called affective and the representative sensations.
There is no doubt that we pass gradually
from the one to the other and that some affective
element enters into the majority of our simple
representations. But nothing prevents us from
isolating this element and inquiring separately,
in what does the intensity of an affective sensation,
a pleasure or a pain, consist?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Affective sensations and organic disturbance.</div>

<p>Perhaps the difficulty of the latter problem is principally
due to the fact that we are unwilling to see
in the affective state anything but the
conscious expression of an organic disturbance,
the inward echo of an outward cause.
We notice that a more intense sensation generally
corresponds to a greater nervous disturbance;
but inasmuch as these disturbances are unconscious
as movements, since they come before consciousness
in the guise of a sensation which has
no resemblance at all to motion, we do not see
how they could transmit to the sensation anything
of their own magnitude. For there is nothing
in common, we repeat, between superposable
magnitudes such as, for example, vibration-amplitudes,
and sensations which do not occupy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
space. If the more intense sensation seems to
us to contain the less intense, if it assumes for
us, like the physical impression itself, the form of a
magnitude, the reason probably is that it retains
something of the physical impression to which it
corresponds. And it will retain nothing of it if it
is merely the conscious translation of a movement
of molecules; for, just because this movement is
translated into the sensation of pleasure or pain,
it remains unconscious as molecular movement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pleasure and pain as signs of the future
reaction rather than psychic translations of the
past stimulus.</div>

<p>But it might be asked whether pleasure and
pain, instead of expressing only what has just
occurred, or what is actually occurring,
in the organism, as is usually believed,
could not also point out what is going to,
or what is tending to take place. It
seems indeed somewhat improbable that
nature, so profoundly utilitarian, should have here
assigned to consciousness the merely scientific task
of informing us about the past or the present,
which no longer depend upon us. It must be
noticed in addition that we rise by imperceptible
stages from automatic to free movements, and
that the latter differ from the former principally
in introducing an affective sensation between the
external action which occasions them and the
volitional reaction which ensues. Indeed, all our
actions might have been automatic, and we can
surmise that there are many organized beings in
whose case an external stimulus causes a definite
reaction without calling up consciousness as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
intermediate agent. If pleasure and pain make
their appearance in certain privileged beings, it is
probably to call forth a resistance to the automatic
reaction which would have taken place: either
sensation has nothing to do, or it is nascent freedom.
But how would it enable us to resist the
reaction which is in preparation if it did not
acquaint us with the nature of the latter by some
definite sign? And what can this sign be except
the sketching, and, as it were, the prefiguring of
the future automatic movements in the very
midst of the sensation which is being experienced?
The affective state must then correspond not merely
to the physical disturbances, movements or phenomena
which have taken place, but also, and
especially, to those which are in preparation, those
which are getting ready to be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intensity of affective sensations would
then be our consciousness of the involuntary movements
tending to follow the stimulus.</div>

<p>It is certainly not obvious at first sight how this
hypothesis simplifies the problem. For we are
trying to find what there can be in
common, from the point of view of magnitude,
between a physical phenomenon
and a state of consciousness, and we
seem to have merely turned the difficulty
round by making the present state of
consciousness a sign of the future reaction, rather
than a psychic translation of the past stimulus.
But the difference between the two hypotheses is
considerable. For the molecular disturbances
which were mentioned just now are necessarily
unconscious, since no trace of the movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
themselves can be actually perceived in the
sensation which translates them. But the automatic
movements which tend to follow the stimulus
as its natural outcome are likely to be conscious
as movements: or else the sensation itself, whose
function is to invite us to choose between this
automatic reaction and other possible movements,
would be of no avail. The intensity of affective
sensations might thus be nothing more than our
consciousness of the involuntary movements which
are being begun and outlined, so to speak, within
these states, and which would have gone on in
their own way if nature had made us automata
instead of conscious beings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intensity of a pain estimated by extent
of organism affected.</div>

<p>If such be the case, we shall not compare a pain
of increasing intensity to a note which grows
louder and louder, but rather to a
symphony, in which an increasing number
of instruments make themselves
heard. Within the characteristic sensation,
which gives the tone to all the others,
consciousness distinguishes a larger or smaller
number of sensations arising at different points
of the periphery, muscular contractions, organic
movements of every kind: the choir of these
elementary psychic states voices the new demands
of the organism, when confronted by a new situation.
In other words, we estimate the intensity
of a pain by the larger or smaller part of the
organism which takes interest in it. Richet<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
has observed that the slighter the pain, the more
precisely is it referred to a particular spot; if it
becomes more intense, it is referred to the whole
of the member affected. And he concludes by
saying that "the pain spreads in proportion as
it is more intense."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> We should rather reverse
the sentence, and define the intensity of the pain
by the very number and extent of the parts of
the body which sympathize with it and react,
and whose reactions are perceived by consciousness.
To convince ourselves of this, it will be
enough to read the remarkable description of
disgust given by the same author: "If the stimulus
is slight there may be neither nausea nor
vomiting.... If the stimulus is stronger, instead
of being confined to the pneumo-gastric
nerve, it spreads and affects almost the whole
organic system. The face turns pale, the smooth
muscles of the skin contract, the skin is covered
with a cold perspiration, the heart stops beating:
in a word there is a general organic disturbance
following the stimulation of the medulla oblongata,
and this disturbance is the supreme expression
of disgust."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But is it nothing more than
its expression? In what will the general sensation
of disgust consist, if not in the sum of these
elementary sensations? And what can we understand
here by increasing intensity, if it is not
the constantly increasing number of sensations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
which join in with the sensations already experienced?
Darwin has drawn a striking picture
of the reactions following a pain which becomes
more and more acute. "Great pain urges all
animals ... to make the most violent and
diversified efforts to escape from the cause of
suffering.... With men the mouth may
be closely compressed, or more commonly the
lips are retracted with the teeth clenched or
ground together.... The eyes stare wildly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">... or the brows are heavily contracted.</span><br />
Perspiration bathes the body.... The circulation
and respiration are much affected."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
Now, is it not by this very contraction of the
muscles affected that we measure the intensity
of a pain? Analyse your idea of any suffering
which you call extreme: do you not mean that
it is unbearable, that is to say, that it urges the
organism to a thousand different actions in order
to escape from it? I can picture to myself a
nerve transmitting a pain which is independent
of all automatic reaction; and I can equally
understand that stronger or weaker stimulations
influence this nerve differently. But I do not
see how these differences of sensation would
be interpreted by our consciousness as differences
of quantity unless we connected them with the
reactions which usually accompany them, and
which are more or less extended and more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
less important. Without these subsequent reactions,
the intensity of the pain would be a
quality, and not a magnitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pleasures compared by bodily inclination.</div>

<p>We have hardly any other means of comparing
several pleasures with one another. What do
we mean by a greater pleasure except a
pleasure that is preferred? And what
can our preference be, except a certain
disposition of our organs, the effect of which
is that, when two pleasures are offered simultaneously
to our mind, our body inclines towards one
of them? Analyse this inclination itself and
you will find a great many little movements which
begin and become perceptible in the organs concerned,
and even in the rest of the body, as if the
organism were coming forth to meet the pleasure
as soon as it is pictured. When we define inclination
as a movement, we are not using a metaphor.
When confronted by several pleasures pictured
by our mind, our body turns towards one of them
spontaneously, as though by a reflex action.
It rests with us to check it, but the attraction
of the pleasure is nothing but this movement
that is begun, and the very keenness of the pleasure,
while we enjoy it, is merely the inertia
of the organism, which is immersed in it and
rejects every other sensation. Without this <i>vis
inertiae</i> of which we become conscious by the
very resistance which we offer to anything that
might distract us, pleasure would be a state,
but no longer a magnitude. In the moral as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the physical world, attraction serves to define
movement rather than to produce it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The intensity of representative
sensations. Many also affective and intensity is
measured by reaction called forth. In others a new
element enters.</div>

<p>We have studied the affective sensations separately,
but we must now notice that many representative
sensations possess an affective
character, and thus call forth a reaction
on our part which we take into account
in estimating their intensity. A considerable
increase of light is represented
for us by a characteristic sensation
which is not yet pain, but which is analogous
to dazzling. In proportion as the amplitude
of sound-vibrations increases, our head and
then our body seem to us to vibrate or to receive
a shock. Certain representative sensations,
those of taste, smell and temperature, have a
fixed character of pleasantness or unpleasantness.
Between flavours which are more or less bitter
you will hardly distinguish anything but differences
of quality; they are like different shades
of one and the same colour. But these differences
of quality are at once interpreted as differences
of quantity, because of their affective character
and the more or less pronounced movements
of reaction, pleasure or repugnance, which they
suggest to us. Besides, even when the sensation
remains purely representative, its external cause
cannot exceed a certain degree of strength or
weakness without inciting us to movements which
enable us to measure it. Sometimes indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
we have to make an effort to perceive this sensation,
as if it were trying to escape notice; sometimes
on the other hand it obsesses us, forces
itself upon us and engrosses us to such an extent
that we make every effort to escape from it and
to remain ourselves. In the former case the
sensation is said to be of slight intensity, and in
the latter case very intense. Thus, in order to
perceive a distant sound, to distinguish what
we call a faint smell or a dim light, we strain all
our faculties, we "pay attention." And it is
just because the smell and the light thus require
to be reinforced by our efforts that they seem
to us feeble. And, inversely, we recognize a
sensation of extreme intensity by the irresistible
reflex movements to which it incites us, or by
the powerlessness with which it affects us. When
a cannon is fired off close to our ears or a dazzling
light suddenly flares up, we lose for an instant
the consciousness of our personality; this state
may even last some time in the case of a very
nervous subject. It must be added that, even
within the range of the so-called medium intensities,
when we are dealing on even terms with a
representative sensation, we often estimate its
importance by comparing it with another which
it drives away, or by taking account of the persistence
with which it returns. Thus the ticking
of a watch seems louder at night because it easily
monopolizes a consciousness almost empty of
sensations and ideas. Foreigners talking to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
another in a language which we do not understand
seem to us to speak very loudly, because
their words no longer call up any ideas in our
mind, and thus break in upon a kind of intellectual
silence and monopolize our attention like the
ticking of a watch at night. With these so-called
medium sensations, however, we approach a
series of psychic states, the intensity of which
is likely to possess a new meaning. For, in
most cases, the organism hardly reacts at all, at
least in a way that can be perceived; and yet
we still make a magnitude out of the pitch of
a sound, the intensity of a light, the saturation
of a colour. Doubtless, a closer observation of
what takes place in the whole of the organism
when we hear such and such a note or perceive
such and such a colour has more than one surprise
in store for us. Has not C. Féré shown
that every sensation is accompanied by an increase
in muscular force which can be measured
by the dynamometer?<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But of an increase of this
kind there is hardly any consciousness at all,
and if we reflect on the precision with which we
distinguish sounds and colours, nay, even weights
and temperatures, we shall easily guess that
some new element must come into play in our
estimate of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The purely representative sensations
are measured by external causes.</div>

<p>Now, the nature of this element is easy to determine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
For, in proportion as a sensation loses
its affective character and becomes
representative, the reactions which it
called forth on our part tend to disappear,
but at the same time we perceive
the external object which is its cause, or
if we do not now perceive it, we have perceived
it, and we think of it. Now, this cause is extensive
and therefore measurable: a constant
experience, which began with the first glimmerings
of consciousness and which continues
throughout the whole of our life, shows us a
definite shade of sensation corresponding to a
definite amount of stimulation. We thus associate
the idea of a certain quantity of cause with a
certain quality of effect; and finally, as happens
in the case of every acquired perception, we transfer
the idea into the sensation, the quantity of
the cause into the quality of the effect. At this
very moment the intensity, which was nothing
but a certain shade or quality of the sensation,
becomes a magnitude. We shall easily understand
this process if, for example, we hold a pin in our
right hand and prick our left hand more and
more deeply. At first we shall feel as it were a
tickling, then a touch which is succeeded by a
prick, then a pain localized at a point, and finally
the spreading of this pain over the surrounding
zone. And the more we reflect on it, the more
clearly shall we see that we are here dealing
with so many qualitatively distinct sensations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
so many varieties of a single species. But yet
we spoke at first of one and the same sensation
which spread further and further, of one prick
which increased in intensity. The reason is that,
without noticing it, we localized in the sensation
of the left hand, which is pricked, the progressive
effort of the right hand, which pricks. We thus
introduced the cause into the effect, and unconsciously
interpreted quality as quantity, intensity
as magnitude. Now, it is easy to see that
the intensity of every representative sensation
ought to be understood in the same way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sensations of sound. Intensity
measured by effort necessary to produce a
similar sound.</div>

<p>The sensations of sound display well marked
degrees of intensity. We have already spoken
of the necessity of taking into account
the affective character of these sensations,
the shock received by the whole
of the organism. We have shown that
a very intense sound is one which engrosses
our attention, which supplants all the
others. But take away the shock, the well-marked
vibration, which you sometimes feel
in your head or even throughout your body:
take away the clash which takes place between
sounds heard simultaneously: what will be left
except an indefinable quality of the sound which
is heard? But this quality is immediately interpreted
as quantity because you have obtained
it yourself a thousand times, e.g. by striking
some object and thus expending a definite quantity
of effort. You know, too, how far you would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
have to raise your voice to produce a similar
sound, and the idea of this effort immediately
comes into your mind when you transform the
intensity of the sound into a magnitude. Wundt<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
has drawn attention to the quite special connexions
of vocal and auditory nervous filaments
which are met with in the human brain. And has
it not been said that to hear is to speak to oneself?
Some neuropaths cannot be present at
a conversation without moving their lips; this
is only an exaggeration of what takes place in
the case of every one of us. How will the expressive
or rather suggestive power of music be
explained, if not by admitting that we repeat
to ourselves the sounds heard, so as to carry
ourselves back into the psychic state out of which
they emerged, an original state, which nothing
will express, but which something may suggest,
viz., the very motion and attitude which the
sound imparts to our body?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intensity and pitch. The part played
by muscular effort.</div>

<p>Thus, when we speak of the intensity of a
sound of medium force as a magnitude, we allude
principally to the greater or less effort
which we should have ourselves to
expend in order to summon, by our
own effort, the same auditory sensation.</p>

<p>Now, besides the intensity, we distinguish another
characteristic property of the sound, its pitch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Are the differences in pitch, such as our ear
perceives, quantitative differences? I grant that
a sharper sound calls up the picture of a higher
position in space. But does it follow from
this that the notes of the scale, as auditory
sensations, differ otherwise than in quality?
Forget what you have learnt from physics, examine
carefully your idea of a higher or lower note,
and see whether you do not think simply of the
greater or less effort which the tensor muscle
of your vocal chords has to make in order to
produce the note? As the effort by which your
voice passes from one note to another is discontinuous,
you picture to yourself these successive
notes as points in space, to be reached by a series
of sudden jumps, in each of which you cross an
empty separating interval: this is why you
establish intervals between the notes of the scale.
Now, why is the line along which we dispose
them vertical rather than horizontal, and why
do we say that the sound ascends in some cases
and descends in others? It must be remembered
that the high notes seem to us to produce some
sort of resonance in the head and the deep notes
in the thorax: this perception, whether real or
illusory, has undoubtedly had some effect in
making us reckon the intervals vertically. But
we must also notice that the greater the tension
of the vocal chords in the chest voice, the greater
is the surface of the body affected, if the singer
is inexperienced; this is just the reason why the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
effort is felt by him as more intense. And as
he breathes out the air upwards, he will attribute
the same direction to the sound produced by the
current of air; hence the sympathy of a larger
part of the body with the vocal muscles will be
represented by a movement upwards. We shall
thus say that the note is higher because the body
makes an effort as though to reach an object which
is more elevated in space. In this way it became
customary to assign a certain height to each note
of the scale, and as soon as the physicist was able
to define it by the number of vibrations in a given
time to which it corresponds, we no longer hesitated
to declare that our ear perceived differences
of quantity directly. But the sound would
remain a pure quality if we did not bring in the
muscular effort which produces it or the vibrations
which explain it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sensations of heat and cold. These
soon become affective and are measured by reactions
called forth.</div>

<p>The experiments of Blix, Goldscheider and
Donaldson<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> have shown that the points on the
surface of the body which feel cold are
not the same as those which feel heat.
Physiology is thus disposed to set up a
distinction of nature, and not merely of
degree, between the sensations of heat
and cold. But psychological observation goes
further, for close attention can easily discover
specific differences between the different sensations
of heat, as also between the sensations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
cold. A more intense heat is really another kind of
heat. We call it more intense because we have
experienced this same change a thousand times
when we approached nearer and nearer a source of
heat, or when a growing surface of our body was
affected by it. Besides, the sensations of heat
and cold very quickly become affective and incite
us to more or less marked reactions by which we
measure their external cause: hence, we are
inclined to set up similar quantitative differences
among the sensations which correspond to lower
intensities of the cause. But I shall not insist
any further; every one must question himself
carefully on this point, after making a clean sweep
of everything which his past experience has taught
him about the cause of his sensations and coming
face to face with the sensations themselves. The
result of this examination is likely to be as follows:
it will be perceived that the magnitude of a representative
sensation depends on the cause having
been put into the effect, while the intensity of the
affective element depends on the more or less
important reactions which prolong the external
stimulations and find their way into the sensation
itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sensation of pressure and weight
measured by extent of organism affected.</div>

<p>The same thing will be experienced in the case
of pressure and even weight. When you say
that a pressure on your hand becomes
stronger, see whether you
do not mean that there first was a
contact, then a pressure, afterwards a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
pain, and that this pain itself, after having gone
through a series of qualitative changes, has spread
further and further over the surrounding region.
Look again and see whether you do not bring in
the more and more intense, i.e. more and more
extended, effort of resistance which you oppose to
the external pressure. When the psychophysicist
lifts a heavier weight, he experiences, he
says, an increase of sensation. Examine whether
this increase of sensation ought not rather to be
called a sensation of increase. The whole question
is centred in this, for in the first case the sensation
would be a quantity like its external cause, whilst
in the second it would be a quality which had
become representative of the magnitude of its
cause. The distinction between the heavy and
the light may seem to be as old-fashioned and as
childish as that between the hot and the cold.
But the very childishness of this distinction makes
it a psychological reality. And not only do the
heavy and the light impress our consciousness as
generically different, but the various degrees of
lightness and heaviness are so many species of
these two genera. It must be added that the
difference of quality is here translated spontaneously
into a difference of quantity, because of the
more or less extended effort which our body makes
in order to lift a given weight. Of this you will
soon become aware if you are asked to lift a basket
which, you are told, is full of scrap-iron, whilst
in fact there is nothing in it. You will think you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
are losing your balance when you catch hold of
it, as though distant muscles had interested themselves
beforehand in the operation and experienced
a sudden disappointment. It is chiefly
by the number and nature of these sympathetic
efforts, which take place at different points of the
organism, that you measure the sensation of
weight at a given point; and this sensation would
be nothing more than a quality if you did not thus
introduce into it the idea of a magnitude. What
strengthens the illusion on this point is that we
have become accustomed to believe in the immediate
perception of a homogeneous movement in a
homogeneous space. When I lift a light weight
with my arm, all the rest of my body remaining
motionless, I experience a series of muscular sensations
each of which has its "local sign," its peculiar
shade: it is this series which my consciousness
interprets as a continuous movement in space.
If I afterwards lift a heavier weight to the same
height with the same speed, I pass through a new
series of muscular sensations, each of which differs
from the corresponding term of the preceding
series. Of this I could easily convince myself
by examining them closely. But as I interpret
this new series also as a continuous movement,
and as this movement has the same direction, the
same duration and the same velocity as the preceding,
my consciousness feels itself bound to
localize the difference between the second series
of sensations and the first elsewhere than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
movement itself. It thus materializes this difference
at the extremity of the arm which moves;
it persuades itself that the sensation of movement
has been identical in both cases, while the sensation
of weight differed in magnitude. But movement
and weight are but distinctions of the reflective
consciousness: what is present to consciousness
immediately is the sensation of, so to speak,
a heavy movement, and this sensation itself can
be resolved by analysis into a series of muscular
sensations, each of which represents by its shade
its place of origin and by its colour the magnitude
of the weight lifted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The sensation of light. Qualitative
changes of colour interpreted as quantitative
changes in intensity of luminous source.</div>

<p>Shall we call the intensity of light a quantity, or
shall we treat it as a quality? It has not perhaps
been sufficiently noticed what a large
number of different factors co-operate in
daily life in giving us information about
the nature of the luminous source. We
know from long experience that, when we
have a difficulty in distinguishing the
outlines and details of objects, the light
is at a distance or on the point of going out.
Experience has taught us that the affective sensation
or nascent dazzling that we experience in certain
cases must be attributed to a higher intensity
of the cause. Any increase or diminution in the
number of luminous sources alters the way in
which the sharp lines of bodies stand out and also
the shadows which they project. Still more
important are the changes of hue which coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
surfaces, and even the pure colours of the spectrum,
undergo under the influence of a brighter
or dimmer light. As the luminous source is
brought nearer, violet takes a bluish tinge, green
tends to become a whitish yellow, and red a brilliant
yellow. Inversely, when the light is moved
away, ultramarine passes into violet and yellow
into green; finally, red, green and violet tend to become
a whitish yellow. Physicists have remarked
these changes of hue for some time;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> but what
is still more remarkable is that the majority of men
do not perceive them, unless they pay attention to
them or are warned of them. Having made up
our mind, once for all, to interpret changes of
quality as changes of quantity, we begin by asserting
that every object has its own peculiar colour,
definite and invariable. And when the hue of
objects tends to become yellow or blue, instead of
saying that we see their colour change under the
influence of an increase or diminution of light, we
assert that the colour remains the same but that
our sensation of luminous intensity increases or
diminishes. We thus substitute once more, for
the qualitative impression received by our consciousness,
the quantitative interpretation given
by our understanding. Helmholtz has described
a case of interpretation of the same kind, but still
more complicated: "If we form white with two
colours of the spectrum, and if we increase or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
diminish the intensities of the two coloured lights
in the same ratio, so that the proportions of the
combination remain the same, the resultant
colour remains the same although the relative
intensity of the sensations undergoes a marked
change.... This depends on the fact that the
light of the sun, which we consider as the normal
white light during the day, itself undergoes similar
modifications of shade when the luminous intensity
varies."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Does experiment prove that we can measure
directly our sensations of light?</div>

<p>But yet, if we often judge of variations in the
luminous source by the relative changes of hue of
the objects which surround us, this is no
longer the case in simple instances where
a single object, e.g. a white surface,
passes successively through different degrees
of luminosity. We are bound to
insist particularly on this last point. For the
physicist speaks of degrees of luminous intensity
as of real quantities: and, in fact, he measures
them by the photometer. The psychophysicist
goes still further: he maintains that our eye
itself estimates the intensities of light. Experiments
have been attempted, at first by Delbœuf,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
and afterwards by Lehmann and Neiglick,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the view of constructing a psychophysical formula
from the direct measurement of our luminous
sensations. Of these experiments we shall not
dispute the result, nor shall we deny the value
of photometric processes; but we must see how
we have to interpret them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Photometric experiments. We perceive
different shades and afterwards interpret them
as decreasing intensities of white light.</div>

<p>Look closely at a sheet of paper lighted e.g. by
four candles, and put out in succession one, two,
Photometric three of them. You say that the surface
remains white and that its brightness
diminishes. But you are aware that
one candle has just been put out; or, if
you do not know it, you have often
observed a similar change in the appearance
of a white surface when the illumination was
diminished. Put aside what you remember of
your past experiences and what you are accustomed
to say of the present ones; you will find
that what you really perceive is not a diminished
illumination of the white surface, it is a <i>layer of
shadow</i> passing over this surface at the moment
the candle is extinguished. This shadow is a
reality to your consciousness, like the light itself.
If you call the first surface in all its brilliancy
white, you will have to give another name to what
you now see, for it is a different thing: it is, if
we may say so, a new shade of white. We have
grown accustomed, through the combined influence
of our past experience and of physical theories,
to regard black as the absence, or at least as the
minimum, of luminous sensation, and the successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
shades of grey as decreasing intensities of
white light. But, in point of fact, black has just
as much reality for our consciousness as white, and
the decreasing intensities of white light illuminating
a given surface would appear to an unprejudiced
consciousness as so many different shades,
not unlike the various colours of the spectrum.
This is the reason why the change in the sensation
is not continuous, as it is in the external cause,
and why the light can increase or decrease for a
certain period without producing any apparent
change in the illumination of our white surface:
the illumination will not appear to change until the
increase or decrease of the external light is sufficient
to produce a new quality. The variations in
brightness of a given colour&mdash;the affective sensations
of which we have spoken above being left
aside&mdash;would thus be nothing but qualitative
changes, were it not our custom to transfer the
cause to the effect and to replace our immediate
impressions by what we learn from experience and
science. The same thing might be said of degrees
of saturation. Indeed, if the different intensities
of a colour correspond to so many different
shades existing between this colour and black, the
degrees of saturation are like shades intermediate
between this same colour and pure white. Every
colour, we might say, can be regarded under two
aspects, from the point of view of black and from
the point of view of white. And black is then to
intensity what white is to saturation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">In photometric experiments the physicist
compares, not sensations, but physical effects.</div>

<p>The meaning of the photometric experiments
will now be understood. A candle placed at a
certain distance from a sheet of paper
illuminates it in a certain way: you
double the distance and find that four
candles are required to produce the same
effects, sensation. From this you conclude that
if you had doubled the distance without increasing
the intensity of the luminous source, the resultant
illumination would have been only one-fourth
as bright. But it is quite obvious that you are
here dealing with the physical and not the psychological
effect. For it cannot be said that you
have compared two sensations with one another:
you have made use of a single sensation in order
to compare two different luminous sources with
each other, the second four times as strong as the
first but twice as far off. In a word, the physicist
never brings in sensations which are twice or three
times as great as others, but only identical sensations,
destined to serve as intermediaries between
two physical quantities which can then be equated
with one another. The sensation of light here
plays the part of the auxiliary unknown quantity
which the mathematician introduces into his calculations,
and which is not intended to appear in
the final result.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The psychophysicist claims to compare
and measure sensations. Delbœuf's experiments.</div>

<p>But the object of the psychophysicist is entirely
different: it is the sensation of light itself which
he studies, and claims to measure. Sometimes
he will proceed to integrate infinitely small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
differences, after the method of Fechner; sometimes
he will compare one sensation
directly with another. The latter
method, due to Plateau and Delbœuf,
differs far less than has hitherto been
believed from Fechner's: but, as it bears
more especially on the luminous sensations, we shall
deal with it first. Delbœuf places an observer
in front of three concentric rings which vary in
brightness. By an ingenious arrangement he can
cause each of these rings to pass through all the
shades intermediate between white and black.
Let us suppose that two hues of grey are simultaneously
produced on two of the rings and kept
unchanged; let us call them A and B. Delbœuf
alters the brightness, C, of the third ring, and asks
the observer to tell him whether, at a certain
moment, the grey, B, appears to him equally distant
from the other two. A moment comes, in
fact, when the observer states that the contrast
A Β is equal to the contrast Β C, so that, according
to Delbœuf, a scale of luminous intensities could
be constructed on which we might pass from each
sensation to the following one by equal sensible
contrasts: our sensations would thus be measured
by one another. I shall not follow Delbœuf
into the conclusions which he has drawn from
these remarkable experiments: the essential question,
the only question, as it seems to me, is whether
a contrast A B, formed of the elements A and B, is
really equal to a contrast Β C, which is differently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
composed. As soon as it is proved that two sensations
can be equal without being identical, psychophysics
will be established. But it is this
equality which seems to me open to question: it
is easy to explain, in fact, how a sensation of
luminous intensity can be said to be at an equal
distance from two others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In what cases differences of colour
might be interpreted as differences of magnitude.</div>

<p>Let us assume for a moment that from our birth
onwards the growing intensity of a luminous source
had always called up in our consciousness,
one after the other, the different
colours of the spectrum. There is no
doubt that these colours would then
appear to us as so many notes of a gamut, as
higher or lower degrees in a scale, in a word, as
magnitudes. Moreover it would be easy for us to
assign each of them its place in the series. For
although the extensive cause varies continuously,
the changes in the sensation of colour are discontinuous,
passing from one shade to another shade.
However numerous, then, may be the shades intermediate
between the two colours, A and B, it
will always be possible to count them in thought,
at least roughly, and ascertain whether this number
is almost equal to that of the shades which
separate Β from another colour C. In the latter
case it will be said that Β is equally distant from
A and C, that the contrast is the same on one
side as on the other. But this will always be
merely a convenient interpretation: for although
the number of intermediate shades may be equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
on both sides, although we may pass from one to
the other by sudden leaps, we do not know
whether these leaps are magnitudes, still less
whether they are <i>equal</i> magnitudes: above all it
would be necessary to show that the intermediaries
which have helped us throughout our
measurement could be found again inside the
object which we have measured. If not, it is
only by a metaphor that a sensation can be said
to be an equal distance from two others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This is just the case with differences
of intensity in sensations of light. Delbœuf's
underlying postulate.</div>

<p>Now, if the views which we have before enumerated
with regard to luminous intensities are
accepted, it will be recognized that the
different hues of grey which Delbœuf
displays to us are strictly analogous,
for our consciousness, to colours, and
that if we declare that a grey tint is
equidistant from two other grey tints, it is in
the same sense in which it might be said that
orange, for example, is at an equal distance from
green and red. But there is this difference, that
in all our past experience the succession of grey
tints has been produced in connexion with a
progressive increase or decrease in illumination.
Hence we do for the differences of brightness what
we do not think of doing for the differences of
colour: we promote the changes of quality into
variations of magnitude. Indeed, there is no
difficulty here about the measuring, because the
successive shades of grey produced by a continuous
decrease of illumination are discontinuous, as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
qualities, and because we can count approximately
the principal intermediate shades which separate
any two kinds of grey. The contrast A Β will
thus be declared equal to the contrast Β C when
our imagination, aided by our memory, inserts
between A and Β the same number of intermediate
shades as between Β and C. It is needless to say
that this will necessarily be a very rough estimate.
We may anticipate that it will vary considerably
with different persons. Above all it is to be expected
that the person will show more hesitation
and that the estimates of different persons will
differ more widely in proportion as the difference
in brightness between the rings A and Β is increased,
for a more and more laborious effort will be required
to estimate the number of intermediate hues.
This is exactly what happens, as we shall easily
perceive by glancing at the two tables drawn up
by Delbœuf.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In proportion as he increases the
difference in brightness between the exterior
ring and the middle ring, the difference between
the numbers on which one and the same observer
or different observers successively fix increases
almost continuously from 3 degrees to 94, from
5 to 73, from 10 to 25, from 7 to 40. But let
us leave these divergences on one side: let
us assume that the observers are always consistent
and always agree with one another; will it
then be established that the contrasts A Β and
Β C are equal? It would first be necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
prove that two successive elementary contrasts
are equal quantities, whilst, in fact, we only know
that they are successive. It would then be necessary
to prove that inside a given tint of grey we
perceive the less intense shades which our imagination
has run through in order to estimate the
objective intensity of the source of light. In a
word, Delbœuf's psychophysics assumes a theoretical
postulate of the greatest importance,
which is disguised under the cloak of an experimental
result, and which we should formulate as
follows: "When the objective quantity of light
is continuously increased, the differences between
the hues of grey successively obtained, each of
which represents the smallest perceptible increase
of physical stimulation, are quantities equal to one
another. And besides, any one of the sensations
obtained can be equated with the sum of the
differences which separate from one another all
previous sensations, going from zero upwards."
Now, this is just the postulate of Fechner's psychophysics,
which we are going to examine.</p>


<div class="sidenote" style="margin-top: 2em;">Fechner's psychophysics. Weber's Law.]</div>

<p class="p2">Fechner took as his starting-point a law
discovered by Weber, according to which, given
a certain stimulus which calls forth
a certain sensation, the amount by
which the stimulus must be increased
for consciousness to become aware of any change
bears a fixed relation to the original stimulus.
Thus, if we denote by Ε the stimulus which
corresponds to the sensation S, and by ΔΕ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the amount by which the original stimulus must
be increased in order that a sensation of difference
may be produced, we shall have ΔΕ/E = const.
This formula has been much modified by the
disciples of Fechner, and we prefer to take no
part in the discussion; it is for experiment to
decide between the relation established by Weber
and its substitutes. Nor shall we raise any
difficulty about granting the probable existence
of a law of this nature. It is here really a question
not of measuring a sensation but only of determining
the exact moment at which an increase
of stimulus produces a change in it. Now, if a
definite amount of stimulus produces a definite
shade of sensation, it is obvious that the minimum
amount of stimulus required to produce a change
in this shade is also definite; and since it is not
constant, it must be a function of the original
stimulus. But how are we to pass from a relation
between the stimulus and its minimum
increase to an equation which connects the "amount
of sensation" with the corresponding stimulus?
The whole of psychophysics is involved in this
transition, which is therefore worthy of our closest
consideration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The underlying assumptions and the process
by which Fechner's Law is reached.</div>

<p>We shall distinguish several different artifices
in the process of transition from Weber's
experiments, or from any other
series of similar observations, to a psychophysical
law like Fechner's. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
first of all agreed to consider our consciousness
of an increase of stimulus as an increase of the
sensation S: this is therefore called S. It is then
asserted that all the sensations ΔS, which correspond
to the smallest perceptible increase of stimulus,
are equal to one another. They are therefore
treated as quantities, and while, on the one hand,
these quantities are supposed to be always equal,
and, on the other, experiment has given a certain
relation ΔΕ = ⨍(E) between the stimulus Ε
and its minimum increase, the constancy of ΔS
is expressed by writing ΔS = C ΔE/⨍(E), C being a
constant quantity. Finally it is agreed to replace
the very small differences ΔS and ΔΕ by the
infinitely small differences <i>d</i>S and <i>d</i>E, whence
an equation which is, this time, a differential
one: <i>d</i>S = C <i>d</i>E/⨍(E). We shall now simply have to integrate
on both sides to obtain the desired relation<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>:
S=C ⨍<sup style="font-size: 0.6em;">E</sup><sub>o</sub> <i>d</i>E/⨍(E). And the transition will thus be
made from a proved law, which only concerned
the <i>occurrence</i> of a sensation, to an unprovable
law which gives its <i>measure.</i></p>

<p>Without entering upon any thorough discussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of this ingenious operation, let us show in a few
words how Fechner has grasped the real difficulty
of the problem, how he has tried to overcome it,
and where, as it seems to us, the flaw in his reasoning
lies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Can two sensations be equal without
being identical?</div>

<p>Fechner realized that measurement could not be
introduced into psychology without first defining
what is meant by the equality and
addition of two simple states, e.g. two
sensations. But, unless they are identical,
we do not at first see how two
sensations can be equal. Undoubtedly in the
physical world equality is not synonymous with
identity. But the reason is that every phenomenon,
every object, is there presented under two aspects,
the one qualitative and the other extensive:
nothing prevents us from putting the first one
aside, and then there remains nothing but terms
which can be directly or indirectly superposed on
one another and consequently seen to be identical.
Now, this qualitative element, which we begin by
eliminating from external objects in order to
measure them, is the very thing which psychophysics
retains and claims to measure. And it is
no use trying to measure this quality Q by some
physical quantity Q' which lies beneath it: for
it would be necessary to have previously shown
that Q is a function of Q', and this would not be
possible unless the quality Q had first been measured
with some fraction of itself. Thus nothing prevents
us from measuring the sensation of heat by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the degree of temperature; but this is only a
convention, and the whole point of psychophysics
lies in rejecting this convention and seeking how
the sensation of heat varies when you change the
temperature. In a word, it seems, on the one hand,
that two different sensations cannot be said to
be equal unless some identical residuum remains
after the elimination of their qualitative difference;
but, on the other hand, this qualitative difference
being all that we perceive, it does not appear
what could remain once it was eliminated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fechner's method of <i>minimum</i> differences.</div>

<p>The novel feature in Fechner's treatment is
that he did not consider this difficulty insurmountable.
Taking advantage of the
fact that sensation varies by sudden
jumps while the stimulus increases continuously,
he did not hesitate to call these differences
of sensation by the same name: they are
all, he says, <i>minimum</i> differences, since each corresponds
to the smallest perceptible increase in
the external stimulus. Therefore you can set
aside the specific shade or quality of these successive
differences; a common residuum will
remain in virtue of which they will be seen to be
in a manner identical: they all have the common
character of being <i>minima.</i> Such will be the definition
of equality which we were seeking. Now, the
definition of addition will follow naturally. For if
we treat as a quantity the difference perceived by
consciousness between two sensations which succeed
one another in the course of a continuous increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of stimulus, if we call the first sensation S, and the
second S + ΔS, we shall have to consider every
sensation S as a sum, obtained by the addition
of the minimum differences through which we
pass before reaching it. The only remaining
step will then be to utilize this twofold definition
in order to establish, first of all, a relation between
the differences ΔS and ΔΕ, and then, through
the substitution of the differentials, between the
two variables. True, the mathematicians may
here lodge a protest against the substitution of
differential for difference; the psychologists may
ask, too, whether the quantity ΔS, instead of
being constant, does not vary as the sensation
S itself;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> finally, taking the psychophysical law
for granted, we may all debate about its real
meaning. But, by the mere fact that ΔS is regarded
as a quantity and S as a sum, the fundamental
postulate of the whole process is accepted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Break-down of the assumption that the
sensation is a sum, and the minimum differences
quantities.</div>

<p>Now it is just this postulate which seems to
us open to question, even if it can be understood.
Assume that I experience a sensation
S, and that, increasing the stimulus
continuously, I perceive this increase
after a certain time. I am now notified
of the increase of the cause: but why
should I call this notification an arithmetical
difference? No doubt the notification consists
in the fact that the original state S has changed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
it has become S'; but the transition from S to S'
could only be called an arithmetical difference
if I were conscious, so to speak, of an interval
between S and S', and if my sensation were felt
to rise from S to S' by the addition of something.
By giving this transition a name, by calling it ΔS,
you make it first a reality and then a quantity.
Now, not only are you unable to explain in what
sense this transition is a quantity, but reflection
will show you that it is not even a reality; the
only realities are the states S and S' through which
I pass. No doubt, if S and S' were numbers,
I could assert the reality of the difference S'&mdash;S
even though S and S' alone were given; the
reason is that the number S'&mdash;S, which is a certain
sum of units, will then represent just the successive
moments of the addition by which we pass from
S to S'. But if S and S' are simple states, in
what will the <i>interval</i> which separates them consist?
And what, then, can the transition from
the first state to the second be, if not a mere act
of your thought, which, arbitrarily and for the
sake of the argument, assimilates a succession of
two states to a differentiation of two magnitudes?</p>

<div class="sidenote">We can speak of "arithmetical difference"
only in a conventional sense.</div>

<p>Either you keep to what consciousness presents
to you or you have recourse to a conventional
mode of representation. In the first
case you will find a difference between
S and S' like that between the shades
sense. Of rainbow, and not at all an interval
of magnitude. In the second case you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
introduce the symbol ΔS if you like, but it is only
in a conventional sense that you will speak here
of an arithmetical difference, and in a conventional
sense, also, that you will assimilate a sensation
to a sum. The most acute of Fechner's critics,
Jules Tannery, has made the latter point perfectly
clear. "It will be said, for example, that
a sensation of 50 degrees is expressed by the number
of differential sensations which would succeed
one another from the point where sensation is
absent up to the sensation of 50 degrees.... I
do not see that this is anything but a definition,
which is as legitimate as it is arbitrary."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Delbœuf's results seem more plausible
but, in the end, all psychophysics revolves in a
vicious circle.</div>

<p>We do not believe, in spite of all that has been
said, that the method of mean gradations has
set psychophysics on a new path. The
novel feature in Delbœuf's investigation
was that he chose a particular
case, in which consciousness seemed to
decide in Fechner's favour, and in which
common sense itself played the part of the psychophysicist.
He inquired whether certain sensations
did not appear to us immediately as equal
although different, and whether it would not be
possible to draw up, by their help, a table of
sensations which were double, triple or quadruple
those which preceded them. The mistake which
Fechner made, as we have just seen, was that
he believed in an interval between two successive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
sensations S and S', when there is simply a <i>passing</i>
from one to the other and not a <i>difference</i> in
the arithmetical sense of the word. But if the
two terms between which the passing takes place
could be given simultaneously, there would then
be a contrast besides the transition; and although
the contrast is not yet an arithmetical
difference, it resembles it in a certain respect;
for the two terms which are compared stand here
side by side as in a case of subtraction of two
numbers. Suppose now that these sensations
belong to the same <i>genus</i> and that in our past
experience we have constantly been present at
their march past, so to speak, while the physical
stimulus increased continuously: it is extremely
probable that we shall thrust the cause into the
effect, and that the idea of contrast will thus
melt into that of arithmetical difference. As
we shall have noticed, moreover, that the sensation
changed abruptly while the stimulus rose
continuously, we shall no doubt estimate the distance
between two given sensations by a rough
guess at the number of these sudden jumps,
or at least of the intermediate sensations which
usually serve us as landmarks. To sum up, the
contrast will appear to us as a difference, the
stimulus as a quantity, the sudden jump as an
element of equality: combining these three factors,
we shall reach the idea of equal quantitative
differences. Now, these conditions are nowhere
so well realized as when surfaces of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
colour, more or less illuminated, are simultaneously
presented to us. Not only is there here a contrast
between similar sensations, but these sensations
correspond to a cause whose influence
has always been felt by us to be closely connected
with its distance; and, as this distance can vary
continuously, we cannot have escaped noticing
in our past experience a vast number of shades
of sensation which succeeded one another along
with the continuous increase in the cause. We
are therefore able to say that the contrast between
one shade of grey and another, for example, seems
to us almost equal to the contrast between the
latter and a third one; and if we define two equal
sensations by saying that they are sensations
which a more or less confused process of reasoning
interprets as such, we shall in fact reach a law
like that proposed by Delbœuf. But it must
not be forgotten that consciousness has here
passed through the same intermediate steps as
the psychophysicist, and that its judgment is
worth here just what psychophysics is worth;
it is a symbolical interpretation of quality as
quantity, a more or less rough estimate of the
number of sensations which can come in between
two given sensations. The difference is thus
not as great as is believed between the method of
least noticeable differences and that of mean
gradations, between the psychophysics of Fechner
and that of Delbœuf. The first led to a conventional
measurement of sensation; the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
appeals to common sense in the particular cases
where common sense adopts a similar convention.
In a word, all psychophysics is condemned by
its origin to revolve in a vicious circle, for the
theoretical postulate on which it rests condemns
it to experimental verification, and it cannot
be experimentally verified unless its postulate
is first granted. The fact is that there is no
point of contact between the unextended and
the extended, between quality and quantity.
We can interpret the one by the other, set up
the one as the equivalent of the other; but sooner
or later, at the beginning or at the end, we shall
have to recognize the conventional character of
this assimilation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Psychophysics merely pushes to its extreme
consequences the fundamental but natural mistake of
regarding sensations as magnitudes.</div>

<p>In truth, psychophysics merely formulates with
precision and pushes to its extreme consequences
a conception familiar to common sense.
As speech dominates over thought,
as external objects, which are common
to us all, are more important to us
than the subjective states through
which each of us passes, we have everything
to gain by objectifying these states, by
introducing into them, to the largest possible
extent, the representation of their external cause.
And the more our knowledge increases, the more
we perceive the extensive behind the intensive,
quantity behind quality, the more also we tend
to thrust the former into the latter, and to
treat our sensations as magnitudes. Physics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
whose particular function it is to calculate the
external cause of our internal states, takes the
least possible interest in these states themselves:
constantly and deliberately it confuses them with
their cause. It thus encourages and even exaggerates
the mistake which common sense makes
on the point. The moment was inevitably bound
to come at which science, familiarized with this
confusion between quality and quantity, between
sensation and stimulus, should seek to measure
the one as it measures the other: such was the
object of psychophysics. In this bold attempt
Fechner was encouraged by his adversaries themselves,
by the philosophers who speak of intensive
magnitudes while declaring that psychic states cannot
be submitted to measurement. For if we grant
that one sensation can be stronger than another,
and that this inequality is inherent in the sensations
themselves, independently of all association
of ideas, of all more or less conscious consideration
of number and space, it is natural to ask by how
much the first sensation exceeds the second,
and to set up a quantitative relation between
their intensities. Nor is it any use to reply,
as the opponents of psychophysics sometimes do,
that all measurement implies superposition, and
that there is no occasion to seek for a numerical
relation between intensities, which are not superposable
objects. For it will then be necessary
to explain why one sensation is said to be more
intense than another, and how the conceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of greater and smaller can be applied to things
which, it has just been acknowledged, do not
admit among themselves of the relations of container
to contained. If, in order to cut short
any question of this kind, we distinguish two
kinds of quantity, the one intensive, which admits
only of a "more or less," the other extensive,
which lends itself to measurement, we are not far
from siding with Fechner and the psychophysicists.
For, as soon as a thing is acknowledged to be
capable of increase and decrease, it seems natural
to ask by how much it decreases or by how much
it increases. And, because a measurement of
this kind does not appear to be possible directly,
it does not follow that science cannot successfully
accomplish it by some indirect process, either by
an integration of infinitely small elements, as
Fechner proposes, or by any other roundabout
way. Either, then, sensation is pure quality, or,
if it is a magnitude, we ought to try to measure it.</p>


<div class="sidenote" style="margin-top: 2em;">Thus intensity judged (1) in representative
states by an estimate of the magnitude of the cause (2)
in affective states by multiplicity of psychic phenomena
involved.</div>

<p class="p2">To sum up what precedes, we have found the
notion of intensity to present itself under a double
aspect, according as we study the states
of consciousness which represent an
external cause, or those which are self-sufficient.
In the former case the perception
of intensity consists in a certain
estimate of the magnitude of the cause
means of a certain quality in the
effect: it is, as the Scottish philosophers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
would have said, an acquired perception.
In the second case, we give the name of intensity
to the larger or smaller number of simple psychic
phenomena which we conjecture to be involved
in the fundamental state: it is no longer an
<i>acquired</i> perception, but a <i>confused</i> perception.
In fact, these two meanings of the word usually
intermingle, because the simpler phenomena involved
in an emotion or an effort are generally
representative, and because the majority of representative
states, being at the same time affective,
themselves include a multiplicity of elementary
psychic phenomena. The idea of intensity
is thus situated at the junction of two streams,
one of which brings us the idea of extensive magnitude
from without, while the other brings us
from within, in fact from the very depths of
consciousness, the image of an inner multiplicity.
Now, the point is to determine in what the latter
image consists, whether it is the same as that of
number, or whether it is quite different from it.
In the following chapter we shall no longer consider
states of consciousness in isolation from
one another, but in their concrete multiplicity,
in so far as they unfold themselves in pure duration.
And, in the same way as we have asked what
would be the intensity of a representative sensation
if we did not introduce into it the idea of
its cause, we shall now have to inquire what the
multiplicity of our inner states becomes, what
form duration assumes, when the space in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
it unfolds is eliminated. This second question
is even more important than the first. For, if
the confusion of quality with quantity were
confined to each of the phenomena of consciousness
taken separately, it would give rise to obscurities,
as we have just seen, rather than to problems.
But by invading the series of our psychic states,
by introducing space into our perception of duration,
it corrupts at its very source our feeling
of outer and inner change, of movement, and
of freedom. Hence the paradoxes of the Eleatics,
hence the problem of free will. We shall insist
rather on the second point; but instead of seeking
to solve the question, we shall show the mistake
of those who ask it.</p>

<h4>THE MULTIPLICITY OF CONSCIOUS STATES<a name="FNanchor_1_27" id="FNanchor_1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_27" class="fnanchor" style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.8em;">[1]</a></h4>


<h5>THE IDEA OF DURATION</h5>


<div class="sidenote">What is number?</div>

<p>Number maybe defined in general as a collection
of units, or, speaking more exactly, as the synthesis
of the one and the many. Every number
is one, since it is brought before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
mind by a simple intuition and is given a name;
but the unity which attaches to it is that of a sum,
it covers a multiplicity of parts which can be considered
separately. Without attempting for the
present any thorough examination of these conceptions
of unity and multiplicity, let us inquire
whether the idea of number does not imply the
representation of something else as well.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The units which make up a number must be identical.</div>

<p>It is not enough to say that number is a collection
of units; we must add that these units are
identical with one another, or at least
that they are assumed to be identical
when they are counted. No doubt we
can count the sheep in a flock and say
that there are fifty, although they are all different
from one another and are easily recognized by the
shepherd: but the reason is that we agree in that
case to neglect their individual differences and to
take into account only what they have in common.
On the other hand, as soon as we fix our attention
on the particular features of objects or individuals,
we can of course make an enumeration of them,
but not a total. We place ourselves at these two
very different points of view when we count the
soldiers in a battalion and when we call the roll.
Hence we may conclude that the idea of number
implies the simple intuition of a multiplicity of
parts or units, which are absolutely alike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">But they must also be distinct.</div>

<p>And yet they must be somehow distinct from
one another, since otherwise they would merge
into a single unit. Let us assume that
all the sheep in the flock are identical;
they differ at least by the position which
they occupy in space, otherwise they would not
form a flock. But now let us even set aside the
fifty sheep themselves and retain only the idea
of them. Either we include them all in the same
image, and it follows as a necessary consequence
that we place them side by side in an ideal space,
or else we repeat fifty times in succession the
image of a single one, and in that case it does
seem, indeed, that the series lies in duration
rather than in space. But we shall soon find out
that it cannot be so. For if we picture to ourselves
each of the sheep in the flock in succession and
separately, we shall never have to do with more
than a single sheep. In order that the number
should go on increasing in proportion as we
advance, we must retain the successive images
and set them alongside each of the new units
which we picture to ourselves: now, it is in space
that such a juxtaposition takes place and not in
pure duration. In fact, it will be easily granted
that counting material objects means thinking all
these objects together, thereby leaving them in
space. But does this intuition of space accompany
every idea of number, even of an abstract
number?</p>

<div class="sidenote">We can not form an image or idea of number
without the accompanying intuition of space.</div>

<p>Any one can answer this question by reviewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the various forms which the idea of number has
assumed for him since his childhood.
It will be seen that we began by imagining
e.g. a row of balls, that these balls
afterwards became points, and, finally,
this image itself disappeared, leaving
behind it, as we say, nothing but <i>abstract</i> number.
But at this very moment we ceased to have an
image or even an idea of it; we kept only the
symbol which is necessary for reckoning and
which is the conventional way of <i>expressing</i> number.
For we can confidently assert that 12 is
half of 24 without thinking either the number 12
or the number 24: indeed, as far as quick calculation
is concerned, we have everything to gain
by not doing so. But as soon as we wish to picture
<i>number</i> to ourselves, and not merely figures or
words, we are compelled to have recourse to an
extended image. What leads to misunderstanding
on this point seems to be the habit we have fallen
into of counting in time rather than in space. In
order to imagine the number 50, for example,
we repeat all the numbers starting from unity,
and when we have arrived at the fiftieth, we
believe we have built up the number in duration
and in duration only. And there is no doubt that
in this way we have counted moments of duration
rather than points in space; but the question is
whether we have not counted the moments of
duration by means of points in space. It is certainly
possible to perceive in time, and in time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
only, a succession which is nothing but a succession,
but not an addition, i.e. a succession which
culminates in a sum. For though we reach a
sum by taking into account a succession of different
terms, yet it is necessary that each of these terms
should remain when we pass to the following,
and should wait, so to speak, to be added to the
others: how could it wait, if it were nothing but
an instant of duration? And where could it wait
if we did not localize it in space? We involuntarily
fix at a point in space each of the moments
which we count, and it is only on this condition
that the abstract units come to form a sum. No
doubt it is possible, as we shall show later, to conceive
the successive moments of time independently
of space; but when we add to the present moment
those which have preceded it, as is the case when
we are adding up units, we are not dealing with
these moments themselves, since they have vanished
for ever, but with the lasting traces which
they seem to have left in space on their passage
through it. It is true that we generally dispense
with this mental image, and that, after having
used it for the first two or three numbers, it is
enough to know that it would serve just as well
for the mental picturing of the others, if we needed
it. But every clear idea of number implies a
visual image in space; and the direct study of the
units which go to form a discrete multiplicity will
lead us to the same conclusion on this point as the
examination of number itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">All unity is the unity of a simple act
of the mind. Unity divisible only because regarded
as extended in space.</div>

<p>Every number is a collection of units, as we have
said, and on the other hand every number is itself
a unit, in so far as it is a synthesis of
the units which compose it. But is the
word unit taken in the same sense in
both cases? When we assert that number
is a unit, we understand by this
that we master the whole of it by a
simple and indivisible intuition of the mind; this
unity thus includes a multiplicity, since it is the
unity of a whole. But when we speak of the units
which go to form number, we no longer think of
these units as sums, but as pure, simple, irreducible
units, intended to yield the natural series of numbers
by an indefinitely continued process of accumulation.
It seems, then, that there are two
kinds of units, the one ultimate, out of which a
number is formed by a process of addition, and
the other provisional, the number so formed,
which is multiple in itself, and owes its unity to
the simplicity of the act by which the mind perceives
it. And there is no doubt that, when we
picture the units which make up number, we believe
that we are thinking of indivisible components:
this belief has a great deal to do with
the idea that it is possible to conceive number
independently of space. Nevertheless, by looking
more closely into the matter, we shall see that all
unity is the unity of a simple act of the mind, and
that, as this is an act of unification, there must be
some multiplicity for it to unify. No doubt, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the moment at which I think each of these units
separately, I look upon it as indivisible, since I
am determined to think of its unity alone. But
as soon as I put it aside in order to pass to the
next, I objectify it, and by that very deed I make
it a thing, that is to say, a multiplicity. To convince
oneself of this, it is enough to notice that
the units by means of which arithmetic forms
numbers are <i>provisional</i> units, which can be subdivided
without limit, and that each of them is
the sum of fractional quantities as small and as
numerous as we like to imagine. How could we
divide the unit, if it were here that ultimate unity
which characterizes a simple act of the mind?
How could we split it up into fractions whilst
affirming its unity, if we did not regard it implicitly
as an extended object, one in intuition but multiple
in space? You will never get out of an idea
which you have formed anything which you
have not put into it; and if the unity by means of
which you make up your number is the unity of
an act and not of an object, no effort of analysis
will bring out of it anything but unity pure and
simple. No doubt, when you equate the number
3 to the sum of 1 + 1 + 1, nothing prevents you
from regarding the units which compose it as
indivisible: but the reason is that you do not
choose to make use of the multiplicity which is
enclosed within each of these units. Indeed, it
is probable that the number 3 first assumes to
our mind this simpler shape, because we think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
rather of the way in which we have obtained it
than of the use which we might make of it. But we
soon perceive that, while all multiplication implies
the possibility of treating any number whatever
as a provisional unit which can be added to itself,
inversely the units in their turn are true numbers
which are as big as we like, but are regarded as
provisionally indivisible for the purpose of compounding
them with one another. Now, the very
admission that it is possible to divide the unit
into as many parts as we like, shows that we regard
it as extended.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Number in process of formation
is discontinuous, but, when formed, is invested
with the continuity of space.</div>

<p>For we must understand what is meant by the
of number. It cannot be denied
that the formation or construction of
a number implies discontinuity. In
other words, as we remarked above,
each of the units with which we form
the number 3 seems to be indivisible
<i>while</i> we are dealing with it, and we
pass abruptly from one to the other. Again, if
we form the same number with halves, with
quarters, with any units whatever, these units,
in so far as they serve to form the said number,
will still constitute elements which are provisionally
indivisible, and it is always by jerks, by sudden
jumps, so to speak, that we advance from one to
the other. And the reason is that, in order to get
a number, we are compelled to fix our attention
successively on each of the units of which it is compounded.
The indivisibility of the act by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
we conceive any one of them is then represented
under the form of a mathematical point which is
separated from the following point by an interval of
space. But, while a series of mathematical points
arranged in empty space expresses fairly well the
process by which we form the idea of number,
these mathematical points have a tendency to
develop into lines in proportion as our attention
is diverted from them, as if they were trying to
reunite with one another. And when we look at
number in its finished state, this union is an accomplished
fact: the points have become lines, the
divisions have been blotted out, the whole displays
all the characteristics of continuity. This is why
number, although we have formed it according
to a definite law, can be split up on any system
we please. In a word, we must distinguish between
the unity which we think of and the unity
which we set up as an object after having thought
of it, as also between number in process of formation
and number once formed. The unit is irreducible
while we are thinking it and number is
discontinuous while we are building it up: but,
as soon as we consider number in its finished state,
we objectify it, and it then appears to be divisible
to an unlimited extent. In fact, we apply the
term <i>subjective</i> to what seems to be completely
and adequately known, and the term <i>objective</i>
to what is known in such a way that a constantly
increasing number of new impressions could be
substituted for the idea which we actually have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of it. Thus, a complex feeling will contain a
fairly large number of simple elements; but, as
long as these elements do not stand out with perfect
clearness, we cannot say that they were completely
realized, and, as soon as consciousness has
a distinct perception of them, the psychic state
which results from their synthesis will have changed
for this very reason. But there is no change in
the general appearance of a body, however it is
analysed by thought, because these different
analyses, and an infinity of others, are already
visible in the mental image which we form of
the body, though they are not realized: this actual
and not merely virtual perception of subdivisions
in what is undivided is just what we call objectivity.
It then becomes easy to determine the exact part
played by the subjective and the objective in the
idea of number. What properly belongs to the
mind is the indivisible process by which it concentrates
attention successively on the different
parts of a given space; but the parts which have
thus been isolated remain in order to join with the
others, and, once the addition is made, they may
be broken up in any way whatever. They are
therefore parts of space, and space is, accordingly,
the material with which the mind builds up number,
the medium in which the mind places it.</p>

<p>Properly speaking, it is arithmetic which teaches
us to split up without limit the units of which
number consists. Common sense is very much
inclined to build up number with indivisibles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">It follows that number is actually
<i>thought of</i> as a juxtaposition in space.</div>

<p>And this is easily understood, since the provisional
simplicity of the component units
is just what they owe to the mind, and
the latter pays more attention to its
own acts than to the material on which it
works. Science confines itself, here, to drawing
our attention to this material: if we did not
already localize number in space, science would
certainly not succeed in making us transfer it
thither. From the beginning, therefore, we must
have thought of number as of a juxtaposition in
space. This is the conclusion which we reached
at first, basing ourselves on the fact that all addition
implies a multiplicity of parts simultaneously
perceived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two kinds of multiplicity: (1) material
objects, counted in space; (2) conscious states, not
countable unless symbolically represented in space.</div>

<p>Now, if this conception of number is granted,
it will be seen that everything is not counted in
the same way, and that there are two
very different kinds of multiplicity.
When we speak of material objects, we
refer to the possibility of seeing and
touching them; we localize them in
space. In that case, no effort of the
inventive faculty or of symbolical representation
is necessary in order to count
them; we have only to think them, at first separately,
and then simultaneously, within the very
medium in which they come under our observation.
The case is no longer the same when we consider
purely affective psychic states, or even mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
images other than those built up by means of
sight and touch. Here, the terms being no longer
given in space, it seems, <i>a priori,</i> that we can
hardly count them except by some process of
symbolical representation. In fact, we are well
aware of a representation of this kind when
we are dealing with sensations the cause of
which is obviously situated in space. Thus, when
we hear a noise of steps in the street, we have
a confused vision of somebody walking along:
each of the successive sounds is then localized at
a point in space where the passer-by might tread:
we count our sensations in the very space in which
their tangible causes are ranged. Perhaps some
people count the successive strokes of a distant
bell in a similar way, their imagination pictures
the bell coming and going; this spatial sort of
image is sufficient for the first two units, and the
others follow naturally. But most people's minds
do not proceed in this way. They range the successive
sounds in an ideal space and then fancy
that they are counting them in pure duration.
Yet we must be clear on this point. The sounds
of the bell certainly reach me one after the other;
but one of two alternatives must be true. Either
I retain each of these successive sensations in order
to combine it with the others and form a group
which reminds me of an air or rhythm which I
know: in that case I do not <i>count</i> the sounds, I
limit myself to gathering, so to speak, the qualitative
impression produced by the whole series. Or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
else I intend explicitly to count them, and then I
shall have to separate them, and this separation
must take place within some homogeneous medium
in which the sounds, stripped of their qualities,
and in a manner emptied, leave traces of their
presence which are absolutely alike. The question
now is, whether this medium is time or space.
But a moment of time, we repeat, cannot persist
in order to be added to others. If the sounds are
separated, they must leave empty intervals bet ween
them. If we count them, the intervals must
remain though the sounds disappear: how could
these intervals remain, if they were pure duration
and not space? It is in space, therefore, that the
operation takes place. It becomes, indeed, more
and more difficult as we penetrate further into the
depths of consciousness. Here we find ourselves
confronted by a confused multiplicity of sensations
and feelings which analysis alone can distinguish.
Their number is identical with the
number of the moments which we take up when
we count them; but these moments, as they
can be added to one another, are again points
in space. Our final conclusion, therefore, is that
there are two kinds of multiplicity: that of
material objects, to which the conception of number
is immediately applicable; and the multiplicity
of states of consciousness, which cannot be regarded
as numerical without the help of some
symbolical representation, in which a necessary
element is <i>space.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The impenetrability of matter is not
a physical but a logical necessity.</div>

<p>As a matter of fact, each of us makes a distinction
between these two kinds of multiplicity
whenever he speaks of the impenetrability
of matter. We sometimes set up
impenetrability as a fundamental property
of bodies, known in the same way
and put on the same level as e.g. weight or resistance.
But a purely negative property of this kind
cannot be revealed by our senses; indeed, certain
experiments in mixing and combining things
might lead us to call it in question if our minds
were not already made up on the point. Try to
picture one body penetrating another: you will
at once assume that there are empty spaces in the
one which will be occupied by the particles of the
other; these particles in their turn cannot penetrate
one another unless one of them divides in
order to fill up the interstices of the other; and our
thought will prolong this operation indefinitely in
preference to picturing two bodies in the same
place. Now, if impenetrability were really a
quality of matter which was known by the senses,
it is not at all clear why we should experience more
difficulty in conceiving two bodies merging into
one another than a surface devoid of resistance or
a weightless fluid. In reality, it is not a physical
but a logical necessity which attaches to the
proposition: "Two bodies cannot occupy the
same place at the same time." The contrary
assertion involves an absurdity which no conceivable
experience could succeed in dispelling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>In a word, it implies a contradiction. But does
not this amount to recognizing that the very
idea of the number 2, or, more generally, of any
number whatever, involves the idea of juxtaposition
in space? If impenetrability is generally
regarded as a quality of matter, the reason is that
the idea of number is thought to be independent
of the idea of space. We thus believe that we are
adding something to the idea of two or more
objects by saying that they cannot occupy the
same place: as if the idea of the number 2, even
the abstract number, were not already, as we have
shown, that of two different positions in space!
Hence to assert the impenetrability of matter is
simply to recognize the interconnexion between
the notions of number and space, it is to state a
property of number rather than of matter.&mdash;Yet,
it will be said, do we not count feelings, sensations,
ideas, all of which permeate one another, and each
of which, for its part, takes up the whole of the
soul?&mdash;Yes, undoubtedly; but, just because they
permeate one another, we cannot count them unless
we represent them by homogeneous units which
occupy separate positions in space and consequently
no longer permeate one another. Impenetrability
thus makes its appearance at the
same time as number; and when we attribute this
quality to matter in order to distinguish it from
everything which is not matter, we simply state
under another form the distinction established
above between extended objects, to which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
conception of number is immediately applicable,
and states of consciousness, which have first of
all to be represented symbolically in space.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Homogeneous time as the medium in which
conscious states form discrete series. This time
is nothing but space, and pure duration is something
different.</div>

<p>It is advisable to dwell on the last point. If,
in order to count states of consciousness, we have
to represent them symbolically in space,
is it not likely that this symbolical representation
will alter the normal conditions
of inner perception? Let us
recall what we said a short time ago
about the intensity of certain psychic
states. Representative sensation, looked
at in itself, is pure quality; but, seen through the
medium of extensity, this quality becomes in a
certain sense quantity, and is called intensity. In
the same way, our projection of our psychic states
into space in order to form a discrete multiplicity
is likely to influence these states themselves and
to give them in reflective consciousness a new
form, which immediate perception did not attribute
to them. Now, let us notice that when
we speak of <i>time,</i> we generally think of a homogeneous
medium in which our conscious states are
ranged alongside one another as in space, so as
to form a discrete multiplicity. Would not time,
thus understood, be to the multiplicity of our
psychic states what intensity is to certain of them,
&mdash;a sign, a symbol, absolutely distinct from true
duration? Let us ask consciousness to isolate
itself from the external world, and, by a vigorous
effort of abstraction, to become itself again. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
shall then put this question to it: does the multiplicity
of our conscious states bear the slightest
resemblance to the multiplicity of the units of a
number? Has true duration anything to do
with space? Certainly, our analysis of the idea
of number could not but make us doubt this
analogy, to say no more. For if time, as the
reflective consciousness represents it, is a medium
in which our conscious states form a discrete series
so as to admit of being counted, and if on the other
hand our conception of number ends in spreading
out in space everything which can be directly
counted, it is to be presumed that time, understood
in the sense of a medium in which we make
distinctions and count, is nothing but space. That
which goes to confirm this opinion is that we are
compelled to borrow from space the images by
which we describe what the reflective consciousness
feels about time and even about succession; it
follows that pure duration must be something
different. Such are the questions which we have
been led to ask by the very analysis of the notion
of discrete multiplicity. But we cannot throw any
light upon them except by a direct study of the
ideas of space and time in their mutual relations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Does space exist independently of its
contents, as Kant held?</div>

<p>We shall not lay too much stress on the question
of the absolute reality of space: perhaps we might
as well ask whether space is or is not in
space. In short, our senses perceive
the qualities of bodies and space along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
with them: the great difficulty seems to
have been to discover whether extensity is an
aspect of these physical qualities&mdash;a quality of
quality&mdash;or whether these qualities are essentially
unextended, space coming in as a later addition,
but being self-sufficient and existing without
them. On the first hypothesis, space would be
reduced to an abstraction, or, speaking more
correctly, an extract; it would express the common
element possessed by certain sensations called
representative. In the second case, space would
be a reality as solid as the sensations themselves,
although of a different order. We owe the exact
formulation of this latter conception to Kant:
the theory which he works out in the Transcendental
Aesthetic consists in endowing space
with an existence independent of its content, in
laying down as <i>de jure</i> separable what each of
us separates <i>de facto,</i> and in refusing to regard
extensity as an abstraction like the others. In
this respect the Kantian conception of space differs
less than is usually imagined from the popular belief.
Far from shaking our faith in the reality of
space, Kant has shown what it actually means
and has even justified it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The empiricists really agree with Kant
for extensity can not result from synthesis of
unextended sensations without an act of the mind.</div>

<p>Moreover, the solution given by Kant does not
seem to have been seriously disputed since his
time: indeed, it has forced itself, sometimes
without their knowledge, on the majority of
those who have approached the problem anew,
whether nativists or empiricists. Psychologists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
agree in assigning a Kantian origin to the nativistic
explanation of Johann Müller;
but Lotze's hypothesis of local signs,
Bain's theory, and the more comprehensive
explanation suggested by Wundt,
may seem at first quite independent
of the Transcendental Aesthetic. The
authors of these theories seem indeed to
have put aside the problem of the nature of space, in
order to investigate simply by what process our
sensations come to be situated in space and to be
set, so to speak, alongside one another: but this
very question shows that they regard sensations
as inextensive and make a radical distinction, just
as Kant did, between the matter of representation
and its form. The conclusion to be drawn from
the theories of Lotze and Bain, and from Wundt's
attempt to reconcile them, is that the sensations
by means of which we come to form the notion of
space are themselves unextended and simply
qualitative: extensity is supposed to result from
their synthesis, as water from the combination of
two gases. The empirical or genetic explanations
have thus taken up the problem of space at the
very point where Kant left it: Kant separated
space from its contents: the empiricists ask how
these contents, which are taken out of space by
our thought, manage to get back again. It is true
that they have apparently disregarded the activity
of the mind, and that they are obviously inclined
to regard the extensive form under which we represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
things as produced by a kind of alliance of the
sensations with one another: space, without being
extracted from the sensations, is supposed to
result from their co-existence. But how can we
explain such an origination without the active
intervention of the mind? The extensive differs
by hypothesis from the inextensive: and even if
we assume that extension is nothing but a relation
between inextensive terms, this relation must still
be established by a mind capable of thus associating
several terms. It is no use quoting the
example of chemical combinations, in which the
whole seems to assume, of its own accord, a form
and qualities which did not belong to any of the
elementary atoms. This form and these qualities
owe their origin just to the fact that we gather up
the multiplicity of atoms in a single perception:
get rid of the mind which carries out this synthesis
and you will at once do away with the qualities,
that is to say, the aspect under which the synthesis
of elementary parts is presented to our consciousness.
Thus inextensive sensations will remain
what they are, viz., inextensive sensations, if
nothing be added to them. For their co-existence
to give rise to space, there must be an act of the
mind which takes them in all at the same time and
sets them in juxtaposition: this unique act is
very like what Kant calls an <i>a priori</i> form of
sensibility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This act consists in the intuition of
an empty homogeneous medium: perhaps peculiar to
man and not shared by animals.</div>

<p>If we now seek to characterize this act, we see
that it consists essentially in the intuition, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
rather the conception, of an empty homogeneous
medium. For it is scarcely
possible to give any other definition of
space: space is what enables us to distinguish
a number of identical and
simultaneous sensations from one another;
it is thus a principle of differentiation
other than that of qualitative differentiation,
and consequently it is a reality with no quality.
Someone may say, with the believers in the theory of
local signs, that simultaneous sensations are never
identical, and that, in consequence of the diversity
of the organic elements which they affect, there
are no two points of a homogeneous surface which
make the same impression on the sight or the
touch. We are quite ready to grant it, for if these
two points affected us in the same way, there would
be no reason for placing one of them on the right
rather than on the left. But, just because we afterwards
interpret this difference of quality in the sense
of a difference of situation, it follows that we must
have a clear idea of a homogeneous medium, i.e.
of a simultaneity of terms which, although identical
in quality, are yet distinct from one another. The
more you insist on the difference between the
impressions made on our retina by two points
of a homogeneous surface, the more do you
thereby make room for the activity of the mind,
which perceives under the form of extensive
homogeneity what is given it as qualitative
heterogeneity. No doubt, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
representation of a homogeneous space grows out of
an effort of the mind, there must be within
the qualities themselves which differentiate two
sensations some reason why they occupy this
or that definite position in space. We must
thus distinguish between the perception of
extensity and the conception of space: they
are no doubt implied in one another, but, the
higher we rise in the scale of intelligent beings,
the more clearly do we meet with the independent
idea of a homogeneous space. It is therefore
doubtful whether animals perceive the external
world quite as we do, and especially whether they
represent externality in the same way as ourselves.
Naturalists have pointed out, as a remarkable
fact, the surprising ease with which many vertebrates,
and even some insects, manage to find their
way through space. Animals have been seen to
return almost in a straight line to their old home,
pursuing a path which was hitherto unknown to
them over a distance which may amount to several
hundreds of miles. Attempts have been made to
explain this feeling of direction by sight or smell,
and, more recently, by the perception of magnetic
currents which would enable the animal to take
its bearings like a living compass. This amounts
to saying that space is not so homogeneous for the
animal as for us, and that determinations of space,
or directions, do not assume for it a purely geometrical
form. Each of these directions might appear
to it with its own shade, its peculiar quality. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
shall understand how a perception of this kind is
possible if we remember that we ourselves distinguish
our right from our left by a natural feeling,
and that these two parts of our own extensity do
then appear to us as if they bore a different <i>quality;</i>
in fact, this is the very reason why we cannot give
a proper definition of right and left. In truth,
qualitative differences exist everywhere in nature,
and I do not see why two concrete directions should
not be as marked in immediate perception as two
colours. But the conception of an empty homogeneous
medium is something far more extraordinary,
being a kind of reaction against that heterogeneity
which is the very ground of our experience.
Therefore, instead of saying that animals have a
special sense of direction, we may as well say that
men have a special faculty of perceiving or conceiving
a space without quality. This faculty is
not the faculty of abstraction: indeed, if we notice
that abstraction assumes clean-cut distinctions
and a kind of externality of the concepts or their
symbols with regard to one another, we shall find
that the faculty of abstraction already implies the
intuition of a homogeneous medium. What we
must say is that we have to do with two
different kinds of reality, the one heterogeneous,
that of sensible qualities, the other homogeneous,
namely space. This latter, clearly conceived
by the human intellect, enables us to use
clean-cut distinctions, to count, to abstract, and
perhaps also to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Time, in so far as it is a homogenious
medium, and not concrete duration, is reducible to
space.</div>

<p>Now, if space is to be defined as the homogeneous,
it seems that inversely every homogeneous
and unbounded medium will be space.
For, homogeneity here consisting in the
absence of every quality, it is hard to
see how two forms of the homogeneous
could be distinguished from one another.
Nevertheless it is generally agreed to regard time
as an unbounded medium, different from space
but homogeneous like the latter: the homogeneous
is thus supposed to take two forms, according
as its contents co-exist or follow one another. It
is true that, when we make time a homogeneous
medium in which conscious states unfold themselves,
we take it to be given all at once, which
amounts to saying that we abstract it from duration.
This simple consideration ought to warn us
that we are thus unwittingly falling back upon
space, and really giving up time. Moreover, we
can understand that material objects, being exterior
to one another and to ourselves, derive both
exteriorities from the homogeneity of a medium
which inserts intervals between them and sets off
their outlines: but states of consciousness, even
when successive, permeate one another, and in the
simplest of them the whole soul can be reflected.
We may therefore surmise that time, conceived
under the form of a homogeneous medium, is
some spurious concept, due to the trespassing of
the idea of space upon the field of pure consciousness.
At any rate we cannot finally admit two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
forms of the homogeneous, time and space, without
first seeking whether one of them cannot be reduced
to the other. Now, externality is the distinguishing
mark of things which occupy space,
while states of consciousness are not essentially
external to one another, and become so only by
being spread out in time, regarded as a homogeneous
medium. If, then, one of these two supposed
forms of the homogeneous, namely time and space,
is derived from the other, we can surmise <i>a priori</i>
that the idea of space is the fundamental datum.
But, misled by the apparent simplicity of the idea
of time, the philosophers who have tried to reduce
one of these ideas to the other have thought that
they could make extensity out of duration. While
showing how they have been misled, we shall see
that time, conceived under the form of an unbounded
and homogeneous medium, is nothing but
the ghost of space haunting the reflective consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mistake of the attempt to derive relations
of extensity from those of succession. The conception
of pure "duration."</div>

<p>The English school tries, in fact, to reduce
relations of extensity to more or less complex
relations of succession in time. When,
with our eyes shut, we run our hands
along a surface, the rubbing of our
fingers against the surface, and especially
the varied play of our joints, provide
a series of sensations, which differ only
by their <i>qualities</i> and which exhibit a certain order
in time. Moreover, experience teaches us that
this series can be reversed, that we can, by an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
effort of a different kind (or, as we shall call it
later, <i>in an opposite direction),</i> obtain the same
sensations over again in an inverse order: relations
of position in space might then be defined as
reversible relations of succession in time. But
such a definition involves a vicious circle, or at
least a very superficial idea of time. There are,
indeed, as we shall show a little later, two possible
conceptions of time, the one free from all alloy,
the other surreptitiously bringing in the idea of
space. Pure duration is the form which the succession
of our conscious states assumes when our
ego lets itself <i>live,</i> when it refrains from separating
its present state from its former states. For
this purpose it need not be entirely absorbed in the
passing sensation or idea; for then, on the contrary,
it would no longer <i>endure.</i> Nor need
it forget its former states: it is enough that,
in recalling these states, it does not set them
alongside its actual state as one point alongside
another, but forms both the past and the
present states into an organic whole, as happens
when we recall the notes of a tune, melting,
so to speak, into one another. Might it not
be said that, even if these notes succeed one
another, yet we perceive them in one another, and
that their totality may be compared to a living
being whose parts, although distinct, permeate
one another just because they are so closely connected?
The proof is that, if we interrupt the
rhythm by dwelling longer than is right on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
note of the tune, it is not its exaggerated length,
as length, which will warn us of our mistake, but
the qualitative change thereby caused in the
whole of the musical phrase. We can thus conceive
of succession without distinction, and think
of it as a mutual penetration, an interconnexion
and organization of elements, each one of which
represents the whole, and cannot be distinguished
or isolated from it except by abstract thought.
Such is the account of duration which would be
given by a being who was ever the same and ever
changing, and who had no idea of space. But,
familiar with the latter idea and indeed beset by
it, we introduce it unwittingly into our feeling of
pure succession; we set our states of consciousness
side by side in such a way as to perceive them
simultaneously, no longer in one another, but
alongside one another; in a word, we project
time into space, we express duration in terms of
extensity, and succession thus takes the form of a
continuous line or a chain, the parts of which touch
without penetrating one another. Note that the
mental image thus shaped implies the perception,
no longer successive, but simultaneous, of a <i>before</i>
and <i>after,</i> and that it would be a contradiction to
suppose a succession which was only a succession,
and which nevertheless was contained in one and
the same instant. Now, when we speak of an
<i>order</i> of succession in duration, and of the reversibility
of this order, is the succession we are dealing
with pure succession, such as we have just defined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
it, without any admixture of extensity, or is it
succession developing in space, in such a way that
we can take in at once a number of elements which
are both distinct and set side by side? There is no
doubt about the answer: we could not introduce
<i>order</i> among terms without first distinguishing
them and then comparing the places which they
occupy; hence we must perceive them as multiple,
simultaneous and distinct; in a word, we set them
side by side, and if we introduce an order in what
is successive, the reason is that succession is converted
into simultaneity and is projected into
space. In short, when the movement of my
finger along a surface or a line provides me with
a series of sensations of different qualities, one
of two things happens: either I picture these
sensations to myself as in duration only, and in
that case they succeed one another in such a way
that I cannot at a given moment perceive a number
of them as simultaneous and yet distinct; or else
I make out an order of succession, but in that case
I display the faculty not only of perceiving a succession
of elements, but also of setting them out in
line after having distinguished them: in a word,
I already possess the idea of space. Hence the
idea of a reversible series in duration, or even
simply of a certain <i>order</i> of succession in time, itself
implies the representation of space, and cannot
be used to define it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Succession cannot be symbolized as a line
without introducing the idea of space of three dimensions.</div>

<p>To give this argument a stricter form, let us
imagine a straight line of unlimited length, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
on this line a material point A, which moves.
If this point were conscious of itself, it
would feel itself change, since it moves:
it would perceive a succession; but
would this succession assume for it the
form of a line? No doubt it would, if
it could rise, so to speak, above the line which it
traverses, and perceive simultaneously several
points of it in juxtaposition: but by doing so it
would form the idea of space, and it is in space and
not in pure duration that it would see displayed
the changes which it undergoes. We here put
our finger on the mistake of those who regard pure
duration as something similar to space, but of a
simpler nature. They are fond of setting psychic
states side by side, of forming a chain or a
line of them, and do not imagine that they are
introducing into this operation the idea of space
properly so called, the idea of space in its totality,
because space is a medium of three dimensions.
But how can they fail to notice that, in order
to perceive a line as a line, it is necessary to take
up a position outside it, to take account of the
void which surrounds it, and consequently to think
a space of three dimensions? If our conscious
point A does not yet possess the idea of space&mdash;and
this is the hypothesis which we have agreed
to adopt&mdash;the succession of states through which
it passes cannot assume for it the form of a line;
but its sensations will add themselves dynamically
to one another and will organize themselves, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the successive notes of a tune by which we allow
ourselves to be lulled and soothed. In a word,
pure duration might well be nothing but a succession
of qualitative changes, which melt into
and permeate one another, without precise outlines,
without any tendency to externalize themselves
in relation to one another, without any
affiliation with number: it would be pure heterogeneity.
But for the present we shall not insist
upon this point; it is enough for us to have shown
that, from the moment when you attribute the
least homogeneity to duration, you surreptitiously
introduce space.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pure duration is wholly qualitative.
It cannot be measured unless symbolically represented
in space.</div>

<p>It is true that we count successive moments
of duration, and that, because of its relations with
number, time at first seems to us to be
a measurable magnitude, just like space.
But there is here an important distinction
to be made. I say, e.g., that
a minute has just elapsed, and I mean
by this that a pendulum, beating the
seconds, has completed sixty oscillations. If I
picture these sixty oscillations to myself all at
once by a single mental perception, I exclude by
hypothesis the idea of a succession. I do not think
of sixty strokes which succeed one another, but
of sixty points on a fixed line, each one of which
symbolizes, so to speak, an oscillation of the
pendulum. If, on the other hand, I wish to picture
these sixty oscillations in succession, but without
altering the way they are produced in space, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
be compelled to think of each oscillation to the
exclusion of the recollection of the preceding one,
for space has preserved no trace of it; but by
doing so I shall condemn myself to remain for
ever in the present; I shall give up the attempt
to think a succession or a duration. Now if,
finally, I retain the recollection of the preceding
oscillation together with the image of the present
oscillation, one of two things will happen. Either
I shall set the two images side by side, and we then
fall back on our first hypothesis, or I shall perceive
one in the other, each permeating the other and
organizing themselves like the notes of a tune, so
as to form what we shall call a continuous or
qualitative multiplicity with no resemblance to
number. I shall thus get the image of pure duration;
but I shall have entirely got rid of the idea
of a homogeneous medium or a measurable quantity.
By carefully examining our consciousness
we shall recognize that it proceeds in this way
whenever it refrains from representing duration
symbolically. When the regular oscillations of the
pendulum make us sleepy, is it the last sound
heard, the last movement perceived, which produces
this effect? No, undoubtedly not, for why
then should not the first have done the same?
Is it the recollection of the preceding sounds or
movements, set in juxtaposition to the last one?
But this same recollection, if it is later on set in
juxtaposition to a single sound or movement, will
remain without effect. Hence we must admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
that the sounds combined with one another and
acted, not by their quantity as quantity, but by
the quality which their quantity exhibited, i.e.
by the rhythmic organization of the whole. Could
the effect of a slight but continuous stimulation
be understood in any other way? If the sensation
remained always the same, it would continue
to be indefinitely slight and indefinitely bearable.
But the fact is that each increase of stimulation is
taken up into the preceding stimulations, and that
the whole produces on us the effect of a musical
phrase which is constantly on the point of ending
and constantly altered in its totality by the addition
of some new note. If we assert that it is
always the <i>same</i> sensation, the reason is that we
are thinking, not of the sensation itself, but of its
objective cause situated in space. We then set
it out in space in its turn, and in place of an
organism which develops, in place of changes which
permeate one another, we perceive one and the
same sensation stretching itself out lengthwise,
so to speak, and setting itself in juxtaposition to
itself without limit. Pure duration, that which
consciousness perceives, must thus be reckoned
among the so-called intensive magnitudes, if intensities
can be called magnitudes: strictly speaking,
however, it is not a quantity, and as soon as we
try to measure it, we unwittingly replace it by
space.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Time, as dealt with by the astronomer
and the physicist, does indeed <i>seem</i> to be measurable
and therefore homogeneous.</div>

<p>But we find it extraordinarily difficult to think
of duration in its original purity; this is due,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
no doubt, to the fact that we do not <i>endure</i>
alone, external objects, it seems, <i>endure</i>
as we do, and time, regarded from
this point of view, has every appearance
of a homogeneous medium. Not
only do the moments of this duration
seem to be external to one another, like
bodies in space, but the movement perceived by
our senses is the, so to speak, palpable sign of a
homogeneous and measurable duration. Nay
more, time enters into the formulae of mechanics,
into the calculations of the astronomer, and even
of the physicist, under the form of a quantity.
We measure the velocity of a movement, implying
that time itself is a magnitude. Indeed, the
analysis which we have just attempted requires
to be completed, for if duration properly so-called
cannot be measured, what is it that is measured
by the oscillations of the pendulum? Granted
that inner duration, perceived by consciousness,
is nothing else but the melting of states of
consciousness into one another, and the gradual
growth of the ego, it will be said, notwithstanding,
that the time which the astronomer introduces
into his formulae, the time which our clocks
divide into equal portions, this time, at least, is
something different: it must be a measurable
and therefore homogeneous magnitude.&mdash;It is
nothing of the sort, however, and a close examination
will dispel this last illusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But what we call measuring time is nothing
but counting simultaneities. The clock taken as an
illustration.</div>

<p>When I follow with my eyes on the dial of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
clock the movement of the hand which corresponds
to the oscillations of the pendulum,
I do not measure duration, as
seems to be thought; I merely count
simultaneities, which is very different.
Outside of me, in space, there is never
more than a single position of the hand and
the pendulum, for nothing is left of the
past positions. Within myself a process of
organization or interpenetration of conscious
states is going on, which constitutes true duration.
It is because I <i>endure</i> in this way that I picture
to myself what I call the past oscillations of the
pendulum at the same time as I perceive the
present oscillation. Now, let us withdraw for a
moment the ego which thinks these so-called successive
oscillations: there will never be more
than a single oscillation, and indeed only a single
position, of the pendulum, and hence no duration.
Withdraw, on the other hand, the pendulum and
its oscillations; there will no longer be anything
but the heterogeneous duration of the ego,
without moments external to one another, without
relation to number. Thus, within our ego,
there is succession without mutual externality;
outside the ego, in pure space, mutual externality
without succession: mutual externality, since
the present oscillation is radically distinct from
the previous oscillation, which no longer exists;
but no succession, since succession exists solely
for a conscious spectator who keeps the past in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
mind and sets the two oscillations or their symbols
side by side in an auxiliary space. Now,
between this succession without externality and
this externality without succession, a kind of
exchange takes place, very similar to what physicists
call the phenomenon of endosmosis. As the
successive phases of our conscious life, although
interpenetrating, correspond individually to an
oscillation of the pendulum which occurs at the
same time, and as, moreover, these oscillations
are sharply distinguished from one another, we
get into the habit of setting up the same distinction
between the successive moments of our conscious
life: the oscillations of the pendulum
break it up, so to speak, into parts external to
one another: hence the mistaken idea of a homogeneous
inner duration, similar to space, the
moments of which are identical and follow, without
penetrating, one another. But, on the other
hand, the oscillations of the pendulum, which
are distinct only because one has disappeared
when the other appears on the scene, profit, as
it were, from the influence which they have thus
exercised over our conscious life. Owing to the
fact that our consciousness has organized them
as a whole in memory, they are first preserved
and afterwards disposed in a series: in a word,
we create for them a fourth dimension of space,
which we call homogeneous time, and which
enables the movement of the pendulum, although
taking place at one spot, to be continually set in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
juxtaposition to itself. Now, if we try to determine
the exact part played by the real and the
imaginary in this very complex process, this is
what we find. There is a real space, without
duration, in which phenomena appear and disappear
simultaneously with our states of consciousness.
There is a real duration, the heterogeneous
moments of which permeate one another; each
moment, however, can be brought into relation with
a state of the external world which is contemporaneous
with it, and can be separated from the
other moments in consequence of this very process.
The comparison of these two realities gives
rise to a symbolical representation of duration,
derived from space. Duration thus assumes the
illusory form of a homogeneous medium, and
the connecting link between these two terms, space
and duration, is simultaneity, which might be
defined as the intersection of time and space.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two elements in motion: (1) the
space traversed, which is homogeneous and
divisible; (2) the act of traversing,
indivisible and real only for consciousness.</div>

<p>If we analyse in the same way the concept of
motion, the living symbol of this seemingly homogeneous
duration, we shall be led to
make a distinction of the same kind.
We generally say that a movement
takes place <i>in</i> space, and when we assert
that motion is homogeneous and divisible,
it is of the space traversed that
we are thinking, as if it were interchangeable
with the motion itself. Now, if we
reflect further, we shall see that the successive
positions of the moving body really do occupy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
space, but that the process by which it passes
from one position to the other, a process which
occupies duration and which has no reality except
for a conscious spectator, eludes space. We
have to do here not with an <i>object</i> but with a
<i>progress</i>: motion, in so far as it is a passage from
one point to another, is a mental synthesis, a
psychic and therefore unextended process. Space
contains only parts of space, and at whatever point
of space we consider the moving body, we shall
get only a position. If consciousness is aware
of anything more than positions, the reason is
that it keeps the successive positions in mind and
synthesizes them. But how does it carry out a
synthesis of this kind? It cannot be by a fresh
setting out of these same positions in a homogeneous
medium, for a fresh synthesis would be
necessary to connect the positions with one
another, and so on indefinitely. We are thus compelled
to admit that we have here to do with a
synthesis which is, so to speak, qualitative, a
gradual organization of our successive sensations,
a unity resembling that of a phrase in a melody.
This is just the idea of motion which we form
when we think of it by itself, when, so to speak,
from motion we extract mobility. Think of
what you experience on suddenly perceiving a
shooting star: in this extremely rapid motion
there is a natural and instinctive separation between
the space traversed, which appears to you
under the form of a line of fire, and the absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
indivisible sensation of motion or mobility. A
rapid gesture, made with one's eyes shut, will
assume for consciousness the form of a purely
qualitative sensation as long as there is no thought
of the space traversed. In a word, there are
two elements to be distinguished in motion, the
space traversed and the act by which we traverse
it, the successive positions and the synthesis of
these positions. The first of these elements is a
homogeneous quantity: the second has no reality
except in a consciousness: it is a quality or an
intensity, whichever you prefer. But here again
we meet with a case of endosmosis, an intermingling
of the purely intensive sensation of
mobility with the extensive representation of the
space traversed. On the one hand we attribute
to the motion the divisibility of the space which
it traverses, forgetting that it is quite possible
to divide an <i>object,</i> but not an <i>act</i>: and on the
other hand we accustom ourselves to projecting this
act itself into space, to applying it to the whole
of the line which the moving body traverses, in a
word, to solidifying it: as if this localizing of a
<i>progress</i> in space did not amount to asserting that,
even outside consciousness, the past co-exists
along with the present!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The common confusion between motion
and the space traversed gives rise to the paradoxes
of the Eleatics.</div>

<p>It is to this confusion between motion and the
space traversed that the paradoxes of the Eleatics
are due; for the interval which separates two
points is infinitely divisible, and if motion consisted
of parts like those of the interval itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the interval would never be crossed. But the
truth is that each of Achilles' steps is
a simple indivisible act, and that, after
a given number of these acts, Achilles
will have passed the tortoise. The mistake
of the Eleatics arises from their
identification of this series of acts, each of which is
<i>of a definite kind</i> and <i>indivisible,</i> with
the homogeneous space which underlies them. As this
space can be divided and put together again according
to any law whatever, they think they are
justified in reconstructing Achilles' whole movement,
not with Achilles' kind of step, but with the
tortoise's kind: in place of Achilles pursuing the
tortoise they really put two tortoises, regulated
by each other, two tortoises which agree to make
the same kind of steps or simultaneous acts, so as
never to catch one another. Why does Achilles
outstrip the tortoise? Because each of Achilles'
steps and each of the tortoise's steps are indivisible
acts in so far as they are movements, and are
different magnitudes in so far as they are space:
so that addition will soon give a greater length
for the space traversed by Achilles than is obtained
by adding together the space traversed by the
tortoise and the handicap with which it started.
This is what Zeno leaves out of account when he
reconstructs the movement of Achilles according
to the same law as the movement of the tortoise,
forgetting that space alone can be divided and
put together again in any way we like, and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
confusing space with motion. Hence we do not
think it necessary to admit, even after the acute
and profound analysis of a contemporary thinker,<a name="FNanchor_2_28" id="FNanchor_2_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_28" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
that the meeting of the two moving bodies
implies a discrepancy between real and imaginary
motion, between <i>space in itself</i> and indefinitely
divisible space, between concrete time and abstract
time. Why resort to a metaphysical hypothesis,
however ingenious, about the nature of space,
time, and motion, when immediate intuition shows
us motion within duration, and duration outside
space? There is no need to assume a limit to
the divisibility of concrete space; we can admit
that it is infinitely divisible, provided that we
make a distinction between the simultaneous
positions of the two moving bodies, which are in
fact in space, and their movements, which cannot
occupy space, being duration rather than extent,
quality and not quantity. To measure the velocity
of a movement, as we shall see, is simply to
ascertain a simultaneity; to introduce this velocity
into calculations is simply to use a convenient
means of anticipating a simultaneity. Thus mathematics
confines itself to its own province as long
as it is occupied with determining the simultaneous
positions of Achilles and the tortoise at a
given moment, or when it admits <i>à priori</i> that
the two moving bodies meet at a point <i>X</i>&mdash;a
meeting which is itself a simultaneity. But it goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
beyond its province when it claims to reconstruct
what takes place in the interval between two
simultaneities; or rather it is inevitably led,
even then, to consider simultaneities once more,
fresh simultaneities, the indefinitely increasing
number of which ought to be a warning that we
cannot make movement out of immobilities, nor
time out of space. In short, just as nothing will
be found homogeneous in duration except a symbolical
medium with no duration at all, namely
space, in which simultaneities are set out in line,
in the same way no homogeneous element will be
found in motion except that which least belongs
to it, the traversed space, which is motionless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Science has to eliminate duration from
time and mobility from motion before it can deal
with them.</div>

<p>Now, just for this reason, science cannot deal
with time and motion except on condition of first
eliminating the essential and qualitative
element&mdash;of time, duration, and of
motion, mobility. We may easily convince
ourselves of this by examining the
part played in astronomy and mechanics
by considerations of time, motion, and velocity.</p>

<p>Treatises on mechanics are careful to announce
that they do not intend to define duration itself
but only the equality of two durations. "Two
intervals of time are equal when two identical
bodies, in identical conditions at the beginning
of each of these intervals and subject to the same
actions and influences of every kind, have traversed
the same space at the end of these intervals." In
other words, we are to note the exact moment at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
which the motion begins, i.e. the coincidence of an
external change with one of our psychic states;
we are to note the moment at which the motion
ends, that is to say, another simultaneity; finally
we are to measure the space traversed, the only
thing, in fact, which is really measurable. Hence
there is no question here of duration, but only of
space and simultaneities. To announce that something
will take place at the end of a time <i>t</i> is to
declare that consciousness will note between now
and then a number <i>t</i> of simultaneities of a certain
kind. And we must not be led astray by the
words "between now and then," for the interval
of duration exists only for us and on account of
the interpenetration of our conscious states.
Outside ourselves we should find only space, and
consequently nothing but simultaneities, of which
we could not even say that they are objectively
successive, since succession can only be thought
through <i>comparing</i> the present with the past.&mdash;That
the interval of duration itself cannot be taken into
account by science is proved by the fact that, if
all the motions of the universe took place twice or
thrice as quickly, there would be nothing to alter
either in our formulae or in the figures which are
to be found in them. Consciousness would have
an indefinable and as it were qualitative impression
of the change, but the change would not make
itself felt outside consciousness, since the same
number of simultaneities would go on taking place
in space. We shall see, later on, that when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
astronomer predicts, e.g., an eclipse, he does something
of this kind: he shortens infinitely the intervals
of duration, as these do not count for science,
and thus perceives in a very short time&mdash;a few
seconds at the most&mdash;a succession of simultaneities
which may take up several centuries for the concrete
consciousness, compelled to live through the
intervals instead of merely counting their extremities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This is seen in the definition of <i>velocity.</i></div>

<p>A direct analysis of the notion of velocity will
bring us to the same conclusion. Mechanics gets
this notion through a series of ideas, the
connexion of which it is easy enough to
trace. It first builds up the idea of
uniform motion by picturing, on the one hand,
the path AB of a certain moving body, and, on
the other, a physical phenomenon which is repeated
indefinitely under the same conditions, e.g.,
a stone always falling from the same height on to
the same spot. If we mark on the path AB the
points Μ, Ν, Ρ ... reached by the moving
body at each of the moments when the stone
touches the ground, and if the intervals AM, MN
and NP are found to be equal to one another, the
motion will be said to be uniform: and any one
of these intervals will be called the velocity of the
moving body, provided that it is agreed to adopt
as unit of duration the physical phenomenon which
has been chosen as the term of comparison. Thus,
the velocity of a uniform motion is defined by
mechanics without appealing to any other notions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
than those of space and simultaneity. Now let us
turn to the case of a variable motion, that is, to the
case when the elements AM, MN, NP ... are
found to be unequal. In order to define the
velocity of the moving body A at the point M, we
shall only have to imagine an unlimited number of
moving bodies A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub> ... all moving uniformly
with velocities <i>v<sub>1</sub> v<sub>2</sub>, v<sub>3</sub></i> ... which are
arranged, e.g., in an ascending scale and which
correspond to all possible magnitudes. Let us
then consider on the path of the moving body <i>A</i>
two points M' and M", situated on either side of
the point M but very near it. At the same time
as this moving body reaches the points M', M, M",
the other moving bodies reach points M'<sub>1</sub> M<sub>1</sub> M"<sub>1</sub>,
M'<sub>2</sub> M<sub>2</sub> M"<sub>2</sub> ... on their respective paths; and
there must be two moving bodies Ah and Ap such
that we have on the one hand M' M= M'<sub>h</sub> M<sub>h</sub> and
on the other hand M M"= M<sub>p</sub> M"<sub>p</sub>. We shall then
agree to say that the velocity of the moving body
A at the point M lies between <i>v<sub>h</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>p</sub>.</i> But
nothing prevents our assuming that the points
M' and M" are still nearer the point M, and it will
then be necessary to replace <i>v<sub>h</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>p</sub></i> by two
fresh velocities <i>v<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>n</sub>,</i> the one greater than
<i>v<sub>h</sub></i> and the other less than <i>v<sub>p</sub>.</i> And in proportion
as we reduce the two intervals M'M and MM", we
shall lessen the difference between the velocities
of the uniform corresponding movements. Now,
the two intervals being capable of decreasing right
down to zero, there evidently exists between <i>v<sub>i</sub></i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and <i>v<sub>n</sub></i> a certain velocity <i>v<sub>m</sub>,</i> such that the difference
between this velocity and <i>v<sub>h</sub>, v<sub>i</sub></i> ... on the
one hand, and <i>v<sub>p</sub>, v<sub>n</sub></i> ... on the other, can become
smaller than any given quantity. It is this
common limit <i>v<sub>m</sub></i> which we shall call the velocity
of the moving body A at the point M.&mdash;Now, in
this analysis of variable motion, as in that of
uniform motion, it is a question only of spaces once
traversed and of simultaneous positions once
reached. We were thus justified in saying that,
while all that mechanics retains of time is simultaneity,
all that it retains of motion itself&mdash;restricted,
as it is, to a <i>measurement</i> of motion&mdash;is
immobility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mechanics deals with equations, which express
something finished, and not processes, such as duration
and motion.</div>

<p>This result might have been foreseen by noticing
that mechanics necessarily deals with equations,
and that an algebraic equation always
expresses something already done. Now,
it is of the very essence of duration and
motion, as they appear to our consciousness,
to be something that is unceasingly
being done; thus algebra can represent
the results gained at a certain moment of duration
and the positions occupied by a certain moving
body in space, but not duration and motion themselves.
Mathematics may, indeed, increase the
number of simultaneities and positions which it
takes into consideration by making the intervals
very small: it may even, by using the differential
instead of the difference, show that it is possible
to increase without limit the number of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
intervals of duration. Nevertheless, however
small the interval is supposed to be, it is the
extremity of the interval at which mathematics
always places itself. As for the interval itself,
as for the duration and the motion, they are necessarily
left out of the equation. The reason is that
duration and motion are mental syntheses, and
not objects; that, although the moving body
occupies, one after the other, points on a line,
motion itself has nothing to do with a line; and
finally that, although the positions occupied by
the moving body vary with the different moments
of duration, though it even creates distinct moments
by the mere fact of occupying different
positions, duration properly so called has no
moments which are identical or external to one
another, being essentially heterogeneous, continuous,
and with no analogy to number.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclusion: space alone is homogeneous: duration and succession
belong not to the external world, but to the conscious
mind.</div>

<p>It follows from this analysis that space alone is
homogeneous, that objects in space form a discrete
multiplicity, and that every discrete multiplicity
is got by a process of
unfolding in space. It also follows that
there is neither duration nor even succession
in space, if we give to these words
the meaning in which consciousness
takes them: each of the so-called successive
states of the external world exists alone;
their multiplicity is real only for a consciousness
that can first retain them and then set them
side by side by externalizing them in relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
to one another. If it retains them, it is because
these distinct states of the external world give rise
to states of consciousness which permeate one
another, imperceptibly organize themselves into
a whole, and bind the past to the present by
this very process of connexion. If it externalizes
them in relation to one another, the reason is that,
thinking of their radical distinctness (the one
having ceased to be when the other appears on the
scene), it perceives them under the form of a discrete
multiplicity, which amounts to setting them out in
line, in the space in which each of them existed
separately. The space employed for this purpose
is just that which is called homogeneous time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two kinds of multiplicity: two senses of
the word "distinguish," the one qualitative and the
other quantitative.</div>

<p>But another conclusion results from this analysis,
namely, that the multiplicity of conscious states,
regarded in its original purity, is not at
all like the discrete multiplicity which
goes to form a number. In such a case
there is, as we said, a qualitative
multiplicity. In short, we must admit two
kinds of multiplicity, two possible senses
of the word "distinguish," two conceptions, the
one qualitative and the other quantitative, of the
difference between <i>same</i> and <i>other.</i> Sometimes
this multiplicity, this distinctness, this heterogeneity
contains number only potentially, as
Aristotle would have said. Consciousness, then,
makes a qualitative discrimination without any
further thought of counting the qualities or
even of distinguishing them as <i>several.</i> In such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
a case we have multiplicity without quantity.
Sometimes, on the other hand, it is a question of a
multiplicity of terms which are counted or which
are conceived as capable of being counted; but
we think then of the possibility of externalizing
them in relation to one another, we set them out
in space. Unfortunately, we are so accustomed to
illustrate one of these two meanings of the same
word by the other, and even to perceive the one
in the other, that we find it extraordinarily difficult
to distinguish between them or at least to express
this distinction in words. Thus I said that several
conscious states are organized into a whole, permeate
one another, gradually gain a richer content,
and might thus give any one ignorant of
space the feeling of pure duration; but the very
use of the word "several" shows that I had already
isolated these states, externalized them in relation
to one another, and, in a word, set them side by
side; thus, by the very language which I was
compelled to use, I betrayed the deeply ingrained
habit of setting out time in space. From this
spatial setting out, already accomplished, we are
compelled to borrow the terms which we use to
describe the state of a mind which has not yet
accomplished it: these terms are thus misleading
from the very beginning, and the idea of a multiplicity
without relation to number or space,
although clear for pure reflective thought, cannot
be translated into the language of common sense.
And yet we cannot even form the idea of discrete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
multiplicity without considering at the same time
a qualitative multiplicity. When we explicitly
count units by stringing them along a spatial
line, is it not the case that, alongside this addition
of identical terms standing out from a homogeneous
background, an organization of these units
is going on in the depths of the soul, a wholly
dynamic process, not unlike the purely qualitative
way in which an anvil, if it could feel, would
realize a series of blows from a hammer? In
this sense we might almost say that the numbers
in daily use have each their emotional equivalent.
Tradesmen are well aware of it, and instead of
indicating the price of an object by a round number
of shillings, they will mark the next smaller
number, leaving themselves to insert afterwards
a sufficient number of pence and farthings. In a
word, the process by which we count units and
make them into a discrete multiplicity has two
sides; on the one hand we assume that they
are identical, which is conceivable only on condition
that these units are ranged alongside each
other in a homogeneous medium; but on the
other hand the third unit, for example, when
added to the other two, alters the nature, the
appearance and, as it were, the rhythm of the
whole; without this interpenetration and this,
so to speak, qualitative progress, no addition
would be possible. Hence it is through the
quality of quantity that we form the idea of
quantity without quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Our successive sensations are regarded as mutually
external, like their objective causes, and this reacts on our
deeper psychic life.</div>

<p>It is therefore obvious that, if it did not betake
itself to a symbolical substitute, our consciousness
our successive would never regard time as a homogeneous
medium, in which the terms of a
succession remain outside one another.
But we naturally reach this symbolical
representation by the mere fact that,
in a series of identical terms, each term
assumes a double aspect for our consciousness:
one aspect which is the same for all of them,
since we are thinking then of the sameness of the
external object, and another aspect which is
characteristic of each of them, because the supervening
of each term brings about a new organization
of the whole. Hence the possibility of
setting out in space, under the form of numerical
multiplicity, what we have called a qualitative
multiplicity, and of regarding the one as the
equivalent of the other. Now, this twofold process
is nowhere accomplished so easily as in the
perception of the external phenomenon which
takes for us the form of motion. Here we certainly
have a series of identical terms, since it is
always the same moving body; but, on the other
hand, the synthesis carried out by our consciousness
between the actual position and what our memory
calls the former positions, causes these images to
permeate, complete, and, so to speak, continue
one another. Hence, it is principally by the help
of motion that duration assumes the form of a
homogeneous medium, and that time is projected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
into space. But, even if we leave out motion,
any repetition of a well-marked external phenomenon
would suggest to consciousness the same
mode of representation. Thus, when we hear
a series of blows of a hammer, the sounds form
an indivisible melody in so far as they are pure
sensations, and, here again, give rise to a dynamic
progress; but, knowing that the same objective
cause is at work, we cut up this progress into
phases which we then regard as identical; and
this multiplicity of elements no longer being conceivable
except by being set out in space, since
they have now become identical, we are necessarily
led to the idea of a homogeneous time, the symbolical
image of real duration. In a word, our
ego comes in contact with the external world at
its surface; our successive sensations, although
dissolving into one another, retain something of the
mutual externality which belongs to their objective
causes; and thus our superficial psychic life
comes to be pictured without any great effort as
set out in a homogeneous medium. But the
symbolical character of such a picture becomes
more striking as we advance further into the
depths of consciousness: the deep-seated self which
ponders and decides, which heats and blazes up,
is a self whose states and changes permeate one
another and undergo a deep alteration as soon as we
separate them from one another in order to set
them out in space. But as this deeper self forms
one and the same person with the superficial ego,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the two seem to <i>endure</i> in the same way. And as
the repeated picture of one identical objective
phenomenon, ever recurring, cuts up our superficial
psychic life into parts external to one another,
the moments which are thus determined determine
in their turn distinct segments in the dynamic
and undivided progress of our more personal conscious
states. Thus the mutual externality which
material objects gain from their juxtaposition in
homogeneous space reverberates and spreads into
the depths of consciousness: little by little our
sensations are distinguished from one another like
the external causes which gave rise to them, and
our feelings or ideas come to be separated like the
sensations with which they are contemporaneous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eliminate the superficial psychic states,
and we no longer perceive a homogeneous time or measure
duration, but feel it as a quality.</div>

<p>That our ordinary conception of duration
depends on a gradual incursion of space into the
domain of pure consciousness is proved by
the fact that, in order to deprive the ego
of the faculty of perceiving a homogeneous
time, it is enough to take away from
it this outer circle of psychic states which
it uses as a balance-wheel. These conditions
are realized when we dream; for sleep, by
relaxing the play of the organic functions, alters
the communicating surface between the ego and
external objects. Here we no longer measure
duration, but we feel it; from quantity it returns
to the state of quality; we no longer estimate
past time mathematically: the mathematical
estimate gives place to a confused instinct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
capable, like all instincts, of committing gross
errors, but also of acting at times with extraordinary
skill. Even in the waking state, daily experience
ought to teach us to distinguish between
duration as quality, that which consciousness
reaches immediately and which is probably what
animals perceive, and time so to speak materialized,
time that has become quantity by being set out in
space. Whilst I am writing these lines, the hour
strikes on a neighbouring clock, but my inattentive
ear does not perceive it until several strokes
have made themselves heard. Hence I have not
counted them; and yet I only have to turn my
attention backwards to count up the four strokes
which have already sounded and add them to
those which I hear. If, then, I question myself
carefully on what has just taken place, I perceive
that the first four sounds had struck my ear and
even affected my consciousness, but that the sensations
produced by each one of them, instead of
being set side by side, had melted into one another
in such a way as to give the whole a peculiar quality,
to make a kind of musical phrase out of it. In
order, then, to estimate retrospectively the number
of strokes sounded, I tried to reconstruct this phrase
in thought: my imagination made one stroke, then
two, then three, and as long as it did not reach the
exact number four, my feeling, when consulted,
answered that the total effect was qualitatively
different. It had thus ascertained in its own
way the succession of four strokes, but quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
otherwise than by a process of addition, and without
bringing in the image of a juxtaposition of distinct
terms. In a word, the number of strokes
was perceived as a quality and not as a quantity:
it is thus that duration is presented to immediate
consciousness, and it retains this form so long as it
does not give place to a symbolical representation
derived from extensity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">There are therefore two forms of multiplicity,
of duration and conscious life.</div>

<p>We should therefore distinguish two forms of
multiplicity, two very different ways of regarding
duration, two aspects of conscious life.
Below homogeneous duration, which is
the extensive symbol of true duration,
a close psychological analysis distinguishes
a duration whose heterogeneous moments
permeate one another; below the numerical
multiplicity of conscious states, a qualitative
multiplicity; below the self with well-defined
states, a self in which <i>succeeding each other</i> means
<i>melting into one another</i> and forming an organic
whole. But we are generally content with the
first, i.e. with the shadow of the self projected
into homogeneous space. Consciousness, goaded
by an insatiable desire to separate, substitutes the
symbol for the reality, or perceives the reality
only through the symbol. As the self thus
refracted, and thereby broken to pieces, is much
better adapted to the requirements of social life
in general and language in particular, consciousness
prefers it, and gradually loses sight of the fundamental
self.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The two aspects of our conscious states.</div>

<p>In order to recover this fundamental self, as
the unsophisticated consciousness would perceive
it, a vigorous effort of analysis is necessary,
which will isolate the fluid inner
states from their image, first refracted,
then solidified in homogeneous space. In other
words, our perceptions, sensations, emotions and
ideas occur under two aspects: the one clear and
precise, but impersonal; the other confused, ever
changing, and inexpressible, because language
cannot get hold of it without arresting its mobility
or fit it into its common-place forms without
making it into public property. If we have been
led to distinguish two forms of multiplicity, two
forms of duration, we must expect each conscious
state, taken by itself, to assume a different aspect
according as we consider it within a discrete
multiplicity or a confused multiplicity, in the
time as quality, in which it is produced, or in the
time as quantity, into which it is projected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One of which is due to the solidifying influence
of external objects and language on our constantly changing
feelings.</div>

<p>When e.g. I take my first walk in a town in
which I am going to live, my environment produces
on me two impressions at the
same time, one of which is destined to
last while the other will constantly
change. Every day I perceive the
same houses, and as I know that they
are the same objects, I always call them by
the same name and I also fancy that they always
look the same to me. But if I recur, at the
end of a sufficiently long period, to the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
which I experienced during the first few years,
I am surprised at the remarkable, inexplicable,
and indeed inexpressible change which has taken
place. It seems that these objects, continually
perceived by me and constantly impressing themselves
on my mind, have ended by borrowing
from me something of my own conscious existence;
like myself they have lived, and like myself they
have grown old. This is not a mere illusion;
for if to-day's impression were absolutely identical
with that of yesterday, what difference would
there be between perceiving and recognizing,
between learning and remembering? Yet this
difference escapes the attention of most of us; we
shall hardly perceive it, unless we are warned of
it and then carefully look into ourselves. The
reason is that our outer and, so to speak, social
life is more practically important to us than our
inner and individual existence. We instinctively
tend to solidify our impressions in order to express
them in language. Hence we confuse the feeling
itself, which is in a perpetual state of becoming,
with its permanent external object, and especially
with the word which expresses this object. In
the same way as the fleeting duration of our ego
is fixed by its projection in homogeneous space,
our constantly changing impressions, wrapping
themselves round the external object which is
their cause, take on its definite outlines and its
immobility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How language gives a fixed form to fleeting
sensations.</div>

<p>Our simple sensations, taken in their natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
state, are still more fleeting. Such and such a
flavour, such and such a scent, pleased
me when I was a child though I dislike
them to-day. Yet I still give the same
name to the sensation experienced, and
I speak as if only my taste had changed, whilst the
scent and the flavour have remained the same.
Thus I again solidify the sensation; and when
its changeableness becomes so obvious that I cannot
help recognizing it, I abstract this changeableness
to give it a name of its own and solidify it in the
shape of a <i>taste.</i> But in reality there are neither
identical sensations nor multiple tastes: for
sensations and tastes seem to me to be <i>objects</i> as
soon as I isolate and name them, and in the
human soul there are only <i>processes.</i> What I
ought to say is that every sensation is altered by
repetition, and that if it does not seem to me to
change from day to day, it is because I perceive
it through the object which is its cause, through
the word which translates it. This influence of
language on sensation is deeper than is usually
thought. Not only does language make us believe
in the unchangeableness of our sensations, but it
will sometimes deceive us as to the nature of the
sensation felt. Thus, when I partake of a dish
that is supposed to be exquisite, the name which
it bears, suggestive of the approval given to it,
comes between my sensation and my consciousness;
I may believe that the flavour pleases me when a
slight effort of attention would prove the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
In short, the word with well-defined outlines,
the rough and ready word, which stores up the
stable, common, and consequently impersonal
element in the impressions of mankind, overwhelms
or at least covers over the delicate and
fugitive impressions of our individual consciousness.
To maintain the struggle on equal terms,
the latter ought to express themselves in precise
words; but these words, as soon as they were
formed, would turn against the sensation which
gave birth to them, and, invented to show that
the sensation is unstable, they would impose on
it their own stability.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How analysis and description distort the feelings.</div>

<p>This overwhelming of the immediate consciousness
is nowhere so striking as in the case of our
feelings. A violent love or a deep
melancholy takes possession of our
SOUL: here we feel a thousand different
elements which dissolve into and permeate one
another without any precise outlines, without
the least tendency to externalize themselves in
relation to one another; hence their originality.
We distort them as soon as we distinguish a
numerical multiplicity in their confused mass:
what will it be, then, when we set them out,
isolated from one another, in this homogeneous
medium which may be called either time or space,
whichever you prefer? A moment ago each
of them was borrowing an indefinable colour from
its surroundings: now we have it colourless, and
ready to accept a name. The feeling itself is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
being which lives and develops and is therefore constantly
changing; otherwise how could it gradually
lead us to form a resolution? Our resolution
would be immediately taken. But it lives because
the duration in which it develops is a duration
whose moments permeate one another. By
separating these moments from each other, by
spreading out time in space, we have caused this
feeling to lose its life and its colour. Hence, we
are now standing before our own shadow: we
believe that we have analysed our feeling, while
we have really replaced it by a juxtaposition
of lifeless states which can be translated into words,
and each of which constitutes the common element,
the impersonal residue, of the impressions felt in a
given case by the whole of society. And this is
why we reason about these states and apply our
simple logic to them: having set them up as
genera by the mere fact of having isolated them
from one another, we have prepared them for
use in some future deduction. Now, if some bold
novelist, tearing aside the cleverly woven curtain
of our conventional ego, shows us under this
appearance of logic a fundamental absurdity,
under this juxtaposition of simple states an
infinite permeation of a thousand different impressions
which have already ceased to exist the
instant they are named, we commend him for
having known us better than we knew ourselves.
This is not the case, however, and the very fact
that he spreads out our feeling in a homogeneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
time, and expresses its elements by words, shows
that he in his turn is only offering us its shadow:
but he has arranged this shadow in such a way as
to make us suspect the extraordinary and illogical
nature of the object which projects it; he has
made us reflect by giving outward expression to
something of that contradiction, that interpenetration,
which is the very essence of the elements
expressed. Encouraged by him, we have put
aside for an instant the veil which we interposed
between our consciousness and ourselves. He
has brought us back into our own presence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On the surface our conscious states obey the
laws of association. Deeper down they interpenetrate and
form a part of ourselves.</div>

<p>We should experience the same sort of surprise
if we strove to seize our ideas themselves in their
natural state, as our consciousness would
perceive them if it were no longer beset
by space. This breaking up of the
constituent elements of an idea, which
issues in abstraction, is too convenient
for us to do without it in ordinary life
and even in philosophical discussion. But when
we fancy that the parts thus artificially separated
are the genuine threads with which the
concrete idea was woven, when, substituting for
the interpenetration of the real terms the juxtaposition
of their symbols, we claim to make
duration out of space, we unavoidably fall into the
mistakes of associationism. We shall not insist
on the latter point, which will be the subject of a
thorough examination in the next chapter. Let
it be enough to say that the impulsive zeal with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
which we take sides on certain questions shows how
our intellect has its instincts&mdash;and what can an
instinct of this kind be if not an impetus common
to all our ideas, i.e. their very interpenetration?
The beliefs to which we most strongly adhere are
those of which we should find it most difficult to
give an account, and the reasons by which we
justify them are seldom those which have led us to
adopt them. In a certain sense we have adopted
them without any reason, for what makes them
valuable in our eyes is that they match the colour
of all our other ideas, and that from the very
first we have seen in them something of ourselves.
Hence they do not take in our minds that common
looking form which they will assume as soon as we
try to give expression to them in words; and,
although they bear the same name in other minds,
they are by no means the same thing. The fact
is that each of them has the same kind of life as a
cell in an organism: everything which affects the
general state of the self affects it also. But while
the cell occupies a definite point in the organism,
an idea which is truly ours fills the whole of our
self. Not all our ideas, however, are thus incorporated
in the fluid mass of our conscious states.
Many float on the surface, like dead leaves on the
water of a pond: the mind, when it thinks
them over and over again, finds them ever the
same, as if they were external to it. Among
these are the ideas which we receive ready made,
and which remain in us without ever being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
properly assimilated, or again the ideas which we
have omitted to cherish and which have withered
in neglect. If, in proportion as we get away
from the deeper strata of the self, our conscious
states tend more and more to assume the form of a
numerical multiplicity, and to spread out in a
homogeneous space, it is just because these conscious
states tend to become more and more
lifeless, more and more impersonal. Hence we
need not be surprised if only those ideas which least
belong to us can be adequately expressed in
words: only to these, as we shall see, does the
associationist theory apply. External to one
another, they keep up relations among themselves
in which the inmost nature of each of them counts
for nothing, relations which can therefore be classified.
It may thus be said that they are associated
by contiguity or for some logical reason. But if,
digging below the surface of contact between the
self and external objects, we penetrate into the
depths of the organized and living intelligence, we
shall witness the joining together or rather the
blending of many ideas which, when once dissociated,
seem to exclude one another as logically
contradictory terms. The strangest dreams, in
which two images overlie one another and show
us at the same time two different persons, who
yet make only one, will hardly give us an idea of the
interweaving of concepts which goes on when
we are awake. The imagination of the dreamer,
cut off from the external world, imitates with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
mere images, and parodies in its own way, the
process which constantly goes on with regard
to ideas in the deeper regions of the intellectual life.</p>


<div class="sidenote">By separating our conscious states we promote social
life, but raise problems soluble only by recourse to the concrete and living self.</div>

<p>Thus may be verified, thus, too, will be illustrated
by a further study of deep-seated psychic
phenomena the principle from which
we started: conscious life displays two
aspects according as we perceive it
directly or by refraction through space.
Considered in themselves, the deep-seated
conscious states have no relation
to quantity, they are pure quality; they
intermingle in such a way that we cannot tell
whether they are one or several, nor even examine
them from this point of view without at once
altering their nature. The duration which they
thus create is a duration whose moments do not
constitute a numerical multiplicity: to characterize
these moments by saying that they encroach
on one another would still be to distinguish them.
If each of us lived a purely individual life, if there
were neither society nor language, would our
consciousness grasp the series of inner states in
this unbroken form? Undoubtedly it would not
quite succeed, because we should still retain the
idea of a homogeneous space in which objects are
sharply distinguished from one another, and
because it is too convenient to set out in such a
medium the somewhat cloudy states which first
attract the attention of consciousness, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
resolve them into simpler terms. But mark that
the intuition of a homogeneous space is already
a step towards social life. Probably animals do
not picture to themselves, beside their sensations,
as we do, an external world quite distinct from
themselves, which is the common property of all
conscious beings. Our tendency to form a clear
picture of this externality of things and the homogeneity
of their medium is the same as the impulse
which leads us to live in common and to
speak. But, in proportion as the conditions of
social life are more completely realized, the current
which carries our conscious states from
within outwards is strengthened; little by little
these states are made into objects or things; they
break off not only from one another, but from
ourselves. Henceforth we no longer perceive
them except in the homogeneous medium in which
we have set their image, and through the word
which lends them its common-place colour. Thus
a second self is formed which obscures the first,
a self whose existence is made up of distinct
moments, whose states are separated from one
another and easily expressed in words. I do not
mean, here, to split up the personality, nor to
bring back in another form the numerical multiplicity
which I shut out at the beginning. It is
the same self which perceives distinct states at
first, and which, by afterwards concentrating its
attention, will see these states melt into one another
like the crystals of a snow-flake when touched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
for some time with the finger. And, in truth, for
the sake of language, the self has everything to
gain by not bringing back confusion where order
reigns, and in not upsetting this ingenious arrangement
of almost impersonal states by which it has
ceased to form "a kingdom within a kingdom."
An inner life with well distinguished moments
and with clearly characterized states will answer
better the requirements of social life. Indeed, a
superficial psychology may be content with describing
it without thereby falling into error, on
condition, however, that it restricts itself to the
study of what has taken place and leaves out what
is going on. But if, passing from statics to dynamics,
this psychology claims to reason about
things in the making as it reasoned about things
made, if it offers us the concrete and living self as
an association of terms which are distinct from
one another and are set side by side in a homogeneous
medium, it will see difficulty after difficulty
rising in its path. And these difficulties
will multiply the greater the efforts it makes to
overcome them, for all its efforts will only bring
into clearer light the absurdity of the fundamental
hypothesis by which it spreads out time in space and
puts succession at the very centre of simultaneity.
We shall see that the contradictions implied in the
problems of causality, freedom, personality, spring
from no other source, and that, if we wish to get
rid of them, we have only to go back to the real and
concrete self and give up its symbolical substitute.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_27" id="Footnote_1_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_27"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> I had already completed the present work when I read
in the <i>Critique philosophique</i>(for 1883 and 1884) F. Pillon's
very remarkable refutation of an interesting article by G. Noël
on the interconnexion of the notions of number and space.
But I have not found it necessary to make any alterations in
the following pages, seeing that Pillon does not distinguish
between time as quality and time as quantity, between the multiplicity
of juxtaposition and that of interpenetration. Without
this vital distinction, which it is the chief aim of the present
chapter to establish, it would be possible to maintain, with
Pillon, that number may be built up from the relation of
co-existence. But what is here meant by co-existence? If
the co-existing terms form an organic whole, they will never
lead us to the notion of number; if they remain distinct,
they are in juxtaposition and we are dealing with space. It
is no use to quote the example of simultaneous impressions
received by several senses. We either leave these sensations
their specific differences, which amounts to saying that we do
not count them; or else we eliminate their differences, and
then how are we to distinguish them if not by their position or
that of their symbols? We shall see that the verb "to distinguish"
has two meanings, the one qualitative, the other
quantitative: these two meanings have been confused, in my
opinion, by the philosophers who have dealt with the relations
between number and space.</p></div>

<h5><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h5>


<h4>THE ORGANIZATION OF CONSCIOUS STATES</h4>

<h5>FREE WILL</h5>



<div class="sidenote">Mechanism, dynamism and free will.</div>

<p>It is easy to see why the question of free will
brings into conflict these two rival systems of
nature, mechanism and dynamism. Dynamism
starts from the idea of voluntary
activity, given by consciousness,
and comes to represent inertia by gradually emptying
this idea: it has thus no difficulty in conceiving
free force on the one hand and matter governed
by laws on the other. Mechanism follows the
opposite course. It assumes that the materials
which it synthesizes are governed by necessary
laws, and although it reaches richer and richer
combinations, which are more and more difficult
to foresee, and to all appearance more and more
contingent, yet it never gets out of the narrow
circle of necessity within which it at first shut
itself up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">For dynamism facts more real than laws:
mechanism reverses this attitude. This idea of spontaneity
simpler than that of inertia.</div>

<p>A thorough examination of these two conceptions
of nature will show that they involve two
very different hypotheses as to the relations
between laws and the facts which
they govern. As he looks higher and
higher, the believer in dynamism thinks
that he perceives facts which more and
more elude the grasp of laws: he thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
sets up the fact as the absolute reality, and the
law as the more or less symbolical expression of
this reality. Mechanism, on the contrary, discovers
within the particular fact a certain number
of laws of which the fact is thus made to be the
meeting point, and nothing else: on this hypothesis
it is the law which becomes the genuine reality.
Now, if it is asked why the one party assigns a
higher reality to the fact and the other to the
law, it will be found that mechanism and dynamism
take the word <i>simplicity</i> in two very different
senses. For the first, any principle is simple of
which the effects can be foreseen and even calculated:
thus, by the very definition, the notion of
inertia becomes simpler than that of freedom, the
homogeneous simpler than the heterogeneous, the
abstract simpler than the concrete. But dynamism
is not anxious so much to arrange the notions
in the most convenient order as to find out their
real relationship: often, in fact, the so-called
simple notion&mdash;that which the believer in mechanism
regards as primitive&mdash;has been obtained by the
blending together of several richer notions which
seem to be derived from it, and which have
more or less neutralized one another in this very
process of blending, just as darkness may be produced
by the interference of two lights. Regarded
from this new point of view, the idea of
spontaneity is indisputably simpler than that of
inertia, since the second can be understood and
defined only by means of the first, while the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
is self-sufficient. For each of us has the immediate
knowledge (be it thought true or fallacious)
of his free spontaneity, without the notion
of inertia having anything to do with this
knowledge. But, if we wish to define the inertia
of matter, we must say that it cannot move or
stop of its own accord, that every body perseveres
in the state of rest or motion so long as it is not
acted upon by any force: and in both cases we are
unavoidably carried back to the idea of activity.
It is therefore natural that, <i>a priori,</i> we should
reach two opposite conceptions of human activity,
according to the way in which we understand the
relation between the concrete and the abstract,
the simple and the complex, facts and laws.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Determinism: (1) physical (2) psychological.
Former reducible to latter, which itself rests on inaccurate
conception of multiplicity of conscious states or duration.</div>

<p><i>A posteriori,</i> however, definite facts are appealed
to against freedom, some physical, others psychological.
Sometimes it is asserted that
our actions are necessitated by our
feelings, our ideas, and the whole preceding
series of our conscious states;
sometimes freedom is denounced as being
incompatible with the fundamental properties
of matter, and in particular with
the principle of the conservation of
energy. Hence two kinds of determinism, two
apparently different empirical proofs of universal
necessity. We shall show that the second of these
two forms is reducible to the first, and that all
determinism, even physical determinism, involves
a psychological hypothesis: we shall then prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
that psychological determinism itself, and the
refutations which are given of it, rest on an inaccurate
conception of the multiplicity of conscious
states, or rather of duration. Thus, in the light
of the principles worked out in the foregoing
chapter, we shall see a self emerge whose activity
cannot be compared to that of any other
force.</p>


<div class="sidenote" style="margin-top: 2em;">Physical determinism stated in the language
of the molecular theory of matter.</div>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Physical determinism, in its latest form, is
closely bound up with mechanical or rather kinetic
theories of matter. The universe is
pictured as a heap of matter which the
imagination resolves into molecules and
atoms. These particles are supposed to
carry out unceasingly movements of every kind,
sometimes of vibration, sometimes of translation;
and physical phenomena, chemical action, the
qualities of matter which our senses perceive, heat,
sound, electricity, perhaps even attraction, are
thought to be reducible objectively to these
elementary movements. The matter which goes
to make up organized bodies being subject to the
same laws, we find in the nervous system, for
example, only molecules and atoms which are in
motion and attract and repel one another. Now
if all bodies, organized or unorganized, thus act
and react on one another in their ultimate parts,
it is obvious that the molecular state of the brain
at a given moment will be modified by the shocks
which the nervous system receives from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
surrounding matter, so that the sensations, feelings
and ideas which succeed one another in us can be
defined as mechanical resultants, obtained by the
compounding of shocks received from without
with the previous movements of the atoms of the
nervous substance. But the opposite phenomenon
may occur; and the molecular movements which
go on in the nervous system, if compounded with
one another or with others, will often give as resultant
a reaction of our organism on its environment:
hence the reflex movements, hence also the so-called
free and voluntary actions. As, moreover,
the principle of the conservation of energy has
been assumed to admit of no exception, there is
not an atom, either in the nervous system or in
the whole of the universe, whose position is not
determined by the sum of the mechanical actions
which the other atoms exert upon it. And the
mathematician who knew the position of the
molecules or atoms of a human organism at a
given moment, as well as the position and motion
of all the atoms in the universe capable of
influencing it, could calculate with unfailing
certainty the past, present and future actions
of the person to whom this organism belongs,
just as one predicts an astronomical phenomenon.<a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">If principle of conservation of energy is universal,
physiological and nervous phenomena are necessitated, but
perhaps not conscious states.</div>

<p>We shall not raise any difficulty about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
recognizing that this conception of physiological phenomena
in general, and nervous phenomena in particular, is a very natural
deduction from the law of the conservation
of energy. Certainly, the atomic
theory of matter is still at the hypothetical
stage, and the purely kinetic explanations
of physical facts lose more than they
gain by being too closely bound up with it. We
must observe, however, that, even if we leave aside
the atomic theory as well as any other hypothesis
as to the nature of the ultimate elements of matter,
the necessitating of physiological facts by their
antecedents follows from the theorem of the conservation
of energy, as soon as we extend this
theorem to all processes going on in all living bodies.
For to admit the universality of this theorem is to
assume, at bottom, that the material points of
which the universe is composed are subject solely
to forces of attraction and repulsion, arising from
these points themselves and possessing intensities
which depend only on their distances: hence the
relative position of these material points at a given
moment&mdash;whatever be their nature&mdash;would be
strictly determined by relation to what it was at
the preceding moment. Let us then assume for
a moment that this last hypothesis is true: we
propose to show, in the first place, that it does not
involve the absolute determination of our conscious
states by one another, and then that the very
universality of the principle of the conservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of energy cannot be admitted except in virtue of
some psychological hypothesis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To prove conscious states determined, we should
have to show a necessary connexion between them and cerebral
states. No such proof.</div>

<p>Even if we assumed that the position, the direction
and the velocity of each atom of cerebral
matter are determined at every moment
of time, it would not at all follow that our
psychic life is subject to the same necessity.
For we should first have to prove
that a strictly determined psychic state
corresponds to a definite cerebral state,
and the proof of this is still to be given. As a rule
we do not think of demanding it, because we
know that a definite vibration of the tympanum,
a definite stimulation of the auditory nerve, gives
a definite note on the scale, and because the
parallelism of the physical and psychical series
has been proved in a fairly large number of cases.
But then, nobody has ever contended that we were
free, under given conditions, to hear any note or
perceive any colour we liked. Sensations of this
kind, like many other psychic states, are obviously
bound up with certain determining conditions,
and it is just for this reason that it has been
possible to imagine or discover beneath them a
system of movements which obey our abstract
mechanics. In short, wherever we succeed in
giving a mechanical explanation, we observe a
fairly strict parallelism between the physiological
and the psychological series, and we need not be
surprised at it, since explanations of this kind will
assuredly not be met with except where the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
series exhibit parallel terms. But to extend this
parallelism to the series themselves in their totality
is to settle <i>a priori</i> the problem of freedom.
Certainly this may be done, and some of the
greatest thinkers have set the example; but
then, as we said at first, it was not for reasons of a
physical order that they asserted the strict correspondence
between states of consciousness and
modes of extension. Leibniz ascribed it to a preestablished
harmony, and would never have
admitted that a motion could give rise to a perception
as a cause produces an effect. Spinoza
said that the modes of thought and the modes of
extension correspond with but never influence
one another: they only express in two different
languages the same eternal truth. But the theories
of physical determinism which are rife at the
present day are far from displaying the same
clearness, the same geometrical rigour. They
point to molecular movements taking place in the
brain: consciousness is supposed to arise out of
these at times in some mysterious way, or rather
to follow their track like the phosphorescent line
which results from the rubbing of a match. Or
yet again we are to think of an invisible musician
playing behind the scenes while the actor strikes
a keyboard the notes of which yield no sound:
consciousness must be supposed to come from an
unknown region and to be superimposed on the
molecular vibrations, just as the melody is on the
rhythmical movements of the actor. But, whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
image we fall back upon, we do not prove
and we never shall prove by any reasoning that
the psychic fact is fatally determined by the molecular
movement. For in a movement we may
find the reason of another movement, but not the
reason of a conscious state: only observation
can prove that the latter accompanies the former.
Now the unvarying conjunction of the two
terms has not been verified by experience except
in a very limited number of cases and with regard
to facts which all confess to be almost independent
of the will. But it is easy to understand why
physical determinism extends this conjunction to
all possible cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical determinism, when assumed to be
universal, postulates psychological determinism.</div>

<p>Consciousness indeed informs us that the majority
of our actions can be explained by motives.
But it does not appear that determination
here means necessity, since common
sense believes in free will. The determinist,
however, led astray by a conception
of duration and causality which we shall
criticise a little later, holds that the determination
of conscious states by one another is absolute.
This is the origin of associationist determinism,
an hypothesis in support of which the testimony
of consciousness is appealed to, but which cannot,
in the beginning, lay claim to scientific rigour. It
seems natural that this, so to speak, approximate
determinism, this determinism of quality, should
seek support from the same mechanism that
underlies the phenomena of nature: the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
would thus convey to the former its own
geometrical character, and the transaction would
be to the advantage both of psychological
determinism, which would emerge from it in a
stricter form, and of physical mechanism, which
would then spread over everything. A fortunate
circumstance favours this alliance. The simplest
psychic states do in fact occur as accessories
to well-defined physical phenomena, and the
greater number of sensations seem to be bound
up with definite molecular movements. This
mere beginning of an experimental proof is
quite enough for the man who, for psychological
reasons, is already convinced that our conscious
states are the necessary outcome of the circumstances
under which they happen. Henceforth
he no longer hesitates to hold that the drama
enacted in the theatre of consciousness is a literal
and even slavish translation of some scenes performed
by the molecules and atoms of organized
matter. The physical determinism which is
reached in this way is nothing but psychological
determinism, seeking to verify itself and fix its
own outlines by an appeal to the sciences of nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is the principle of conservation of energy
universal valid?</div>

<p>But we must own that the amount of freedom
which is left to us after strictly complying with the
principle of the conservation of energy
is rather limited. For, even if this law
does not exert a necessitating influence
over the course of our ideas, it will at least
determine our movements. Our inner life will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
still depend upon ourselves up to a certain
point; but, to an outside observer, there will be
nothing to distinguish our activity from absolute
automatism. We are thus led to inquire whether
the very extension of the principle of the conservation
of energy to all the bodies in nature does
not itself involve some psychological theory, and
whether the scientist who did not possess <i>a priori</i>
any prejudice against human freedom would
think of setting up this principle as a universal
law.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It implies that a system can return to its
original state. Neglects duration, hence inapplicable
to living beings and conscious states.</div>

<p>We must not overrate the part played by the
principle of the conservation of energy in the history
of the natural sciences. In its
present form it marks a certain phase
in the evolution of certain sciences; but
it has not been the governing factor in
this evolution and we should be wrong
in making it the indispensable postulate
of all scientific research. Certainly,
every mathematical operation which we carry out
on a given quantity implies the permanence of this
quantity throughout the course of the operation,
in whatever way we may split it up. In other
words, what is given is given, what is not given is not
given, and in whatever order we add up the same
terms we shall get the same result. Science will
for ever remain subject to this law, which is nothing
but the law of non-contradiction; but this law
does not involve any special hypothesis as to the
nature of what we ought to take as given, or what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
will remain constant. No doubt it informs us
that something cannot come from nothing; but
experience alone will tell us which aspects or
functions of reality must count for something, and
which for nothing, from the point of view of positive
science. In short, in order to foresee the
state of a determinate system at a determinate
moment, it is absolutely necessary that something
should persist as a constant quantity throughout
a series of combinations; but it belongs to experience
to decide as to the nature of this something,
and especially to let us know whether it is found
in all possible systems, whether, in other words,
all possible systems lend themselves to our calculations.
It is not certain that all the physicists before
Leibniz believed, like Descartes, in the conservation
of a fixed quantity of motion in the universe:
were their discoveries less valuable on this account
or their researches less successful? Even when
Leibniz had substituted for this principle that of
the conservation of <i>vis viva,</i> it was not possible
to regard the law as quite general, since it admitted
of an obvious exception in the case of the direct
impact of two inelastic bodies. Thus science has
done for a very long time without a universal
conservative principle. In its present form, and
since the development of the mechanical theory
of heat, the principle of the conservation of energy
certainly seems to apply to the whole range of
physico-chemical phenomena. But no one can
tell whether the study of physiological phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in general, and of nervous phenomena in
particular, will not reveal to us, besides the <i>vis
viva</i> or kinetic energy of which Leibniz spoke, and
the potential energy which was a later and necessary
adjunct, some new kind of energy which
may differ from the other two by rebelling against
calculation. Physical science would not thereby
lose any of its exactitude or geometrical rigour,
as has lately been asserted: only it would be
realized that conservative systems are not the
only systems possible, and even, perhaps, that in
the whole of concrete reality each of these systems
plays the same part as the chemist's atom in bodies
and their combinations. Let us note that the
most radical of mechanical theories is that which
makes consciousness an <i>epiphenomenon</i> which,
in given circumstances, may supervene on certain
molecular movements. But, if molecular movement
can create sensation out of a zero of consciousness,
why should not consciousness in its
turn create movement either out of a zero of kinetic
and potential energy, or by making use of this
energy in its own way? Let us also note that the
law of the conservation of energy can only be
intelligibly applied to a system of which the points,
after moving, can return to their former positions.
This return is at least conceived of as possible, and
it is supposed that under these conditions nothing
would be changed in the original state of the
system as a whole or of its elements. In short,
time cannot bite into it; and the instinctive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
though vague, belief of mankind in the conservation
of a fixed quantity of matter, a fixed quantity
of energy, perhaps has its root in the very fact that
inert matter does not seem to endure or to preserve
any trace of past time. But this is not the case
in the realm of life. Here duration certainly seems
to act like a cause, and the idea of putting things
back in their place at the end of a certain time
involves a kind of absurdity, since such a turning
backwards has never been accomplished in the
case of a living being. But let us admit that the
absurdity is a mere appearance, and that the
impossibility for living beings to come back to the
past is simply owing to the fact that the physico-chemical
phenomena which take place in living
bodies, being infinitely complex, have no chance
of ever occurring again all at the same time: at
least it will be granted to us that the hypothesis of
a turning backwards is almost meaningless in the
sphere of conscious states. A sensation, by the
mere fact of being prolonged, is altered to the
point of becoming unbearable. The same does
not here remain the same, but is reinforced and
swollen by the whole of its past. In short, while
the material point, as mechanics understands it,
remains in an eternal present, the past is a reality
perhaps for living bodies, and certainly for conscious
beings. While past time is neither a gain
nor a loss for a system assumed to be conservative,
it may be a gain for the living being, and it is
indisputably one for the conscious being. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
being the case, is there not much to be said for the
hypothesis of a conscious force or free will, which,
subject to the action of time and storing up duration,
may thereby escape the law of the conservation
of energy?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The idea of the universality of conservation
depends on confusion between concrete duration and abstract
time.</div>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">In truth, it is not a wish to meet the requirements
of positive science, but rather a psychological
mistake which has caused this abstract
principle of mechanics to be set up as a
universal law. As we are not accustomed
to observe ourselves directly, but perceive
ourselves through forms borrowed
from the external world, we are led to believe that
real duration, the duration lived by consciousness,
is the same as the duration which glides over the
inert atoms without penetrating and altering
them. Hence it is that we do not see any absurdity
in putting things back in their place after a
lapse of time, in supposing the same motives
acting afresh on the same persons, and in concluding
that these causes would again produce the
same effect. That such an hypothesis has no real
meaning is what we shall prove later on. For the
present let us simply show that, if once we enter
upon this path, we are of course led to set up
the principle of the conservation of energy as a
universal law. For we have thereby got rid of
just that difference between the outer and the inner
world which a close examination shows to be the
main one: we have identified true duration with
apparent duration. After this it would be absurd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
to consider time, even <i>our</i> time, as a cause of gain
or loss, as a concrete reality, or a force in its own
way. Thus, while we ought only to say (if we
kept aloof from all presuppositions concerning free
will) that the law of the conservation of energy
governs physical phenomena and <i>may,</i> one day,
be extended to all phenomena if psychological
facts also prove favourable to it, we go far beyond
this, and, under the influence of a metaphysical
prepossession, we lay down the principle of the
conservation of energy as a law which <i>should</i>
govern all phenomena whatever, or must be supposed
to do so until psychological facts have
actually spoken against it. Science, properly so
called, has therefore nothing to do with all this.
We are simply confronted with a confusion between
concrete duration and abstract time, two very
different things. In a word, the so-called physical
determinism is reducible at bottom to a psychological
determinism, and it is this latter doctrine,
as we hinted at first, that we have to examine.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Psychological determinism depends on
associationist conception of mind.</div>

<p>Psychological determinism, in its latest and
most precise shape, implies an associationist
conception of mind. The existing state
of consciousness is first thought of as
necessitated by the preceding states, but
it is soon realized that this cannot be
a geometrical necessity, such as that which connects
a resultant, for example, with its components.
For between successive conscious states there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
exists a difference of quality which will always
frustrate any attempt to deduce any one of them
<i>a priori</i> from its predecessors. So experience is
appealed to, with the object of showing that the
transition from one psychic state to another can
always be explained by some simple reason, the
second obeying as it were the call of the first.
Experience really does show this: and, as for ourselves,
we shall willingly admit that there always
is some relation between the existing state of
consciousness and any new state to which
consciousness passes. But is this relation,
which explains the transition, the cause of
it?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The series of associations may be merely
an ex post facto attempt to account for a new idea.</div>

<p>May we here give an account of what we have
personally observed? In resuming a conversation
which had been interrupted for a few
moments we have happened to notice
that both we ourselves and our friend
were thinking of some new object at the
same time.&mdash;The reason is, it will be said, that
each has followed up for his own part the natural
development of the idea at which the conversation
had stopped: the same series of associations has
been formed on both sides.&mdash;No doubt this interpretation
holds good in a fairly large number of
cases; careful inquiry, however, has led us to an
unexpected result. It is a fact that the two
speakers do connect the new subject of conversation
with the former one: they will even point
out the intervening ideas; but, curiously enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
they will not always connect the new idea, which
they have both reached, with the same point of
the preceding conversation, and the two series
of intervening associations may be quite different.
What are we to conclude from this, if not that this
common idea is due to an unknown cause&mdash;perhaps
to some physical influence&mdash;and that, in
order to justify its emergence, it has called forth
a series of antecedents which explain it and
which seem to be its cause, but are really its
effect?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustration from hypnotic suggestion.</div>

<p>When a patient carries out at the appointed time
the suggestion received in the hypnotic state,
the act which he performs is brought
about, according to him, by the preceding
series of his conscious states. Yet
these states are really effects, and not causes:
it was necessary that the act should take place;
it was also necessary that the patient should
explain it to himself; and it is the future act
which determined, by a kind of attraction, the
whole series of psychic states of which it is to be
the natural consequence. The determinists will
seize on this argument: it proves as a matter of
fact that we are sometimes irresistibly subject
to another's will. But does it not also show us
how our own will is capable of willing for willing's
sake, and of then leaving the act which has been
performed to be explained by antecedents of which
it has really been the cause?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustration from deliberation.</div>

<p>If we question ourselves carefully, we shall see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
that we sometimes weigh motives and deliberate
over them, when our mind is already made
up. An inner voice, hardly perceivable,
whispers: "Why this deliberation?
You know the result and you are quite certain of
what you are going to do." But no matter! it
seems that we make a point of safe-guarding the
principle of mechanism and of conforming to the
laws of the association of ideas. The abrupt intervention
of the will is a kind of <i>coup d'état</i> which
our mind foresees and which it tries to legitimate
beforehand by a formal deliberation. True, it
could be asked whether the will, even when it
wills for willing's sake, does not obey some
decisive reason, and whether willing for willing's
sake is free willing. We shall not insist on
this point for the moment. It will be enough
for us to have shown that, even when adopting
the point of view of associationism, it is
difficult to maintain that an act is absolutely
determined by its motive and our conscious states
by one another. Beneath these deceptive appearances
a more attentive psychology sometimes
reveals to us effects which precede their causes,
and phenomena of psychic attraction which elude
the known laws of the association of ideas. But
the time has come to ask whether the very point
of view which associationism adopts does not
involve a defective conception of the self and of the
multiplicity of conscious states.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Associationism involves a defective conception
of the self.</div>

<p>Associationist determinism represents the self as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
a collection of psychic states, the strongest of
which exerts a prevailing influence and
carries the others with it. This doctrine
thus sharply distinguishes co-existing
psychic phenomena from one another. "I could
have abstained from murder," says Stuart Mill,
"if my aversion to the crime and my dread of its
consequences had been weaker than the temptation
which impelled me to commit it."<a name="FNanchor_2_30" id="FNanchor_2_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_30" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And a little
further on: "His desire to do right and his
aversion to doing wrong are strong enough to
overcome ... any other desire or aversion which
may conflict with them."<a name="FNanchor_3_31" id="FNanchor_3_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_31" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Thus desire, aversion,
fear, temptation are here presented as distinct
things which there is no inconvenience in naming
separately. Even when he connects these states
with the self which experiences them, the English
philosopher still insists on setting up clear-cut
distinctions: "The conflict is between me and
myself; between (for instance) me desiring a
pleasure and me dreading self-reproach."<a name="FNanchor_4_32" id="FNanchor_4_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_32" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Bain,
for his part, devotes a whole chapter to the "Conflict
of Motives."<a name="FNanchor_5_33" id="FNanchor_5_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_33" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In it he balances pleasures
and pains as so many terms to which one might
attribute, at least by abstraction, an existence of
their own. Note that the opponents of determinism
agree to follow it into this field. They too
speak of associations of ideas and conflicts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
motives, and one of the ablest of these philosophers,
Alfred Fouillée, goes so far as to make the idea of
freedom itself a motive capable of counterbalancing
others.<a name="FNanchor_6_34" id="FNanchor_6_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_34" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Here, however, lies the danger. Both
parties commit themselves to a confusion which
arises from language, and which is due to the
fact that language is not meant to convey all the
delicate shades of inner states.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This erroneous tendency aided by language.
Illustration.</div>

<p>I rise, for example, to open the window, and I
have hardly stood up before I forget what I had
to do.&mdash;All right, it will be said; you
have associated two ideas, that of an
end to be attained and that of a movement
to be accomplished: one of the
ideas has vanished and only the idea of the movement
remains.&mdash;However, I do not sit down again;
I have a confused feeling that something remains
to be done. This particular standing still, therefore,
is not the same as any other standing still; in the
position which I take up the act to be performed
is as it were prefigured, so that I have only to
keep this position, to study it, or rather to feel it
intimately, in order to recover the idea which had
vanished for a moment. Hence, this idea must
have tinged with a certain particular colouring
the mental image of the intended movement and
the position taken up, and this colouring, without
doubt, would not have been the same if the end
to be attained had been different. Nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
language would have still expressed the movement
and the position in the same way; and
associationism would have distinguished the two
cases by saying that with the idea of the same
movement there was associated this time the idea
of a new end: as if the mere newness of the end
to be attained did not alter in some degree the
idea of the movement to be performed, even though
the movement itself remained the same! We
should thus say, not that the image of a certain
position can be connected in consciousness with
images of different ends to be attained, but rather
that positions geometrically identical outside look
different to consciousness from the inside, according
to the end contemplated. The mistake of
associationism is that it first did away with the
qualitative element in the act to be performed and
retained only the geometrical and impersonal
element: with the idea of this act, thus rendered
colourless, it was then necessary to associate some
specific difference to distinguish it from many
other acts. But this association is the work of
the associationist philosopher who is studying my
mind, rather than of my mind itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustration from "associations" of smell.</div>

<p>I smell a rose and immediately confused recollections
of childhood come back to my memory.
In truth, these recollections have not
been called up by the perfume of the
rose: I breathe them in with the very
scent; it means all that to me. To others it will
smell differently.&mdash;It is always the same scent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
you will say, but associated with different ideas.&mdash;I
am quite willing that you should express yourself
in this way; but do not forget that you have
first removed the personal element from the different
impressions which the rose makes on each one
of us; you have retained only the objective aspect,
that part of the scent of the rose which is public
property and thereby belongs to space. Only thus
was it possible to give a name to the rose and its
perfume. You then found it necessary, in order
to distinguish our personal impressions from one
another, to add specific characteristics to the
general idea of rose-scent. And you now say
that our different impressions, our personal impressions,
result from the fact that we associate different
recollections with rose-scent. But the association
of which you speak hardly exists except
for you, and as a method of explanation. It is
in this way that, by setting side by side certain
letters of an alphabet common to a number of
known languages, we may imitate fairly well such
and such a characteristic sound belonging to a
new one; but not with any of these letters, nor
with all of them, has the sound itself been built up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Associationism fails to distinguish between
the multiplicity of juxtaposition and that of fusion.</div>

<p>We are thus brought back to the distinction
which we set up above between the multiplicity
of juxtaposition and that of fusion or
interpenetration. Such and such a feeling
such and such an idea, contains an
indefinite plurality of conscious states:
but the plurality will not be observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
unless it is, as it were, spread out in this homogeneous
medium which some call duration, but which is
in reality space. We shall then perceive terms
external to one another, and these terms will no
longer be the states of consciousness themselves,
but their symbols, or, speaking more exactly, the
words which express them. There is, as we have
pointed out, a close connexion between the faculty
of conceiving a homogeneous medium, such as
space, and that of thinking by means of general
ideas. As soon as we try to give an account of a
conscious state, to analyse it, this state, which is
above all personal, will be resolved into impersonal
elements external to one another, each of
which calls up the idea of a genus and is expressed
by a word. But because our reason, equipped
with the idea of space and the power of creating
symbols, draws these multiple elements out of the
whole, it does not follow that they were contained
in it. For within the whole they did not
occupy space and did not care to express themselves
by means of symbols; they permeated
and melted into one another. Associationism
thus makes the mistake of constantly replacing
the concrete phenomenon which takes place in
the mind by the artificial reconstruction of it
given by philosophy, and of thus confusing the
explanation of the fact with the fact itself. We
shall perceive this more clearly as we consider
deeper and more comprehensive psychic states.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Failure of associationism to explain the
deeper states of the self.</div>

<p>The self comes into contact with the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
world at its surface; and as this surface retains
the imprint of objects, the self will
associate by contiguity terms which it
has perceived in juxtaposition: it is
connexions of this kind, connexions
of quite simple and so to speak impersonal sensations,
that the associationist theory fits. But,
just in proportion as we dig below the surface and
get down to the real self, do its states of consciousness
cease to stand in juxtaposition and begin to
permeate and melt into one another, and each to be
tinged with the colouring of all the others. Thus
each of us has his own way of loving and hating;
and this love or this hatred reflects his whole
personality. Language, however, denotes these
states by the same words in every case: so that
it has been able to fix only the objective and
impersonal aspect of love, hate, and the thousand
emotions which stir the soul. We estimate the
talent of a novelist by the power with which he
lifts out of the common domain, to which language
had thus brought them down, feelings and ideas
to which he strives to restore, by adding detail to
detail, their original and living individuality.
But just as we can go on inserting points between
two positions of a moving body without ever filling
up the space traversed, in the same way, by the
mere fact that we associate states with states and
that these states are set side by side instead of
permeating one another, we fail to translate
completely what our soul experiences: there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
is no common measure between mind and language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The self is not an aggregate of conscious states.
Freedom is self-expression, admitting of degrees, and may be
curtailed by education.</div>

<p>Therefore, it is only an inaccurate psychology,
misled by language, which will show us the soul
determined by sympathy, aversion, or
hate as though by so many forces
pressing upon it. These feelings, provided
that they go deep enough, each
make up the whole soul, since the whole
content of the soul is reflected in each
of them. To say that the soul is determined
under the influence of any one of these feelings
is thus to recognize that it is self-determined. The
associationist reduces the self to an aggregate
of conscious states: sensations, feelings, and
ideas. But if he sees in these various states no
more than is expressed in their name, if he retains
only their impersonal aspect, he may set them side
by side for ever without getting anything but a
phantom self, the shadow of the ego projecting
itself into space. If, on the contrary, he takes
these psychic states with the particular colouring
which they assume in the case of a definite person,
and which comes to each of them by reflection
from all the others, then there is no need to associate
a number of conscious states in order to
rebuild the person, for the whole personality is in
a single one of them, provided that we know how
to choose it. And the outward manifestation
of this inner state will be just what is called a free
act, since the self alone will have been the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of it, and since it will express the whole of the self.
Freedom, thus understood, is not <i>absolute,</i> as a
radically libertarian philosophy would have it;
it admits of degrees. For it is by no means the
case that all conscious states blend with one another
as raindrops with the water of a lake. The
self, in so far as it has to do with a homogeneous
space, develops on a kind of surface, and on this
surface independent growths may form and float.
Thus a suggestion received in the hypnotic state
is not incorporated in the mass of conscious states,
but, endowed with a life of its own, it will usurp
the whole personality when its time comes. A
violent anger roused by some accidental circumstance,
an hereditary vice suddenly emerging
from the obscure depths of the organism to the
surface of consciousness, will act almost like a
hypnotic suggestion. Alongside these independent
elements there may be found more complex
series, the terms of which do permeate one another,
but which never succeed in blending perfectly
with the whole mass of the self. Such is the
system of feelings and ideas which are the result
of an education not properly assimilated, an
education which appeals to the memory rather
than to the judgment. Here will be found, within
the fundamental self, a parasitic self which continually
encroaches upon the other. Many live
this kind of life, and die without having known
true freedom. But suggestion would become
persuasion if the entire self assimilated it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
passion, even sudden passion, would no longer bear
the stamp of fatality if the whole history of the
person were reflected in it, as in the indignation
of Alceste;<a name="FNanchor_7_35" id="FNanchor_7_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_35" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and the most authoritative education
would not curtail any of our freedom if it only
imparted to us ideas and feelings capable of impregnating
the whole soul. It is the whole soul, in
fact, which gives rise to the free decision: and the
act will be so much the freer the more the dynamic
series with which it is connected tends to be the
fundamental self.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our every-day acts obey the laws of association.
At great great crises our decisions are really free as
expressing the fundamental self.</div>

<p>Thus understood, free acts are exceptional,
even on the part of those who are most given to
controlling and reasoning out what they
do. It has been pointed out that we
generally perceive our own self by
refraction through space, that our conscious
states crystallize into words, and
that our living and concrete self thus
gets covered with an outer crust of clean-cut
psychic states, which are separated from one
another and consequently fixed. We added that,
for the convenience of language and the promotion
of social relations, we have everything to gain by
not breaking through this crust and by assuming
it to give an exact outline of the form of the object
which it covers. It should now be added that
our daily actions are called forth not so much
by our feelings themselves, which are constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
changing, as by the unchanging images with which
these feelings are bound up. In the morning,
when the hour strikes at which I am accustomed
to rise, I might receive this impression σὺν ὄλῃ
τῇ ψυχῆ, as Plato says; I might let it blend with
the confused mass of impressions which fill my
mind; perhaps in that case it would not determine
me to act. But generally this impression, instead
of disturbing my whole consciousness like a stone
which falls into the water of a pond, merely stirs
up an idea which is, so to speak, solidified on the
surface, the idea of rising and attending to my
usual occupations. This impression and this
idea have in the end become tied up with one
another, so that the act follows the impression
without the self interfering with it. In this instance
I am a conscious automaton, and I am so
because I have everything to gain by being so.
It will be found that the majority of our daily
actions are performed in this way and that,
owing to the solidification in memory of such and
such sensations, feelings, or ideas, impressions
from the outside call forth movements on our
part which, though conscious and even intelligent,
have many points of resemblance with reflex acts.
It is to these acts, which are very numerous but
for the most part insignificant, that the associationist
theory is applicable. They are, taken all
together, the substratum of our free activity, and
with respect to this activity they play the same
part as our organic functions in relation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
whole of our conscious life. Moreover we will
grant to determinism that we often resign our
freedom in more serious circumstances, and that,
by sluggishness or indolence, we allow this same
local process to run its course when our whole
personality ought, so to speak, to vibrate. When
our most trustworthy friends agree in advising us
to take some important step, the sentiments
which they utter with so much insistence lodge
on the surface of our ego and there get solidified
in the same way as the ideas of which we spoke
just now. Little by little they will form a thick
crust which will cover up our own sentiments;
we shall believe that we are acting freely, and it
is only by looking back to the past, later on, that
we shall see how much we were mistaken. But
then, at the very minute when the act is going
to be performed, <i>something</i> may revolt against it.
It is the deep-seated self rushing up to the surface.
It is the outer crust bursting, suddenly giving
way to an irresistible thrust. Hence in the depths
of the self, below this most reasonable pondering
over most reasonable pieces of advice, something
else was going on&mdash;a gradual heating and a sudden
boiling over of feelings and ideas, not unperceived,
but rather unnoticed. If we turn back to them
and carefully scrutinize our memory, we shall see
that we had ourselves shaped these ideas, ourselves
lived these feelings, but that, through some strange
reluctance to exercise our will, we had thrust
them back into the darkest depths of our soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
whenever they came up to the surface. And this
is why we seek in vain to explain our sudden
change of mind by the visible circumstances which
preceded it. We wish to know the reason why
we have made up our mind, and we find that we
have decided without any reason, and perhaps
even against every reason. But, in certain cases,
that is the best of reasons. For the action which
has been performed does not then express some
superficial idea, almost external to ourselves,
distinct and easy to account for: it agrees with
the whole of our most intimate feelings, thoughts
and aspirations, with that particular conception
of life which is the equivalent of all our past
experience, in a word, with our personal idea of
happiness and of honour. Hence it has been a
mistake to look for examples in the ordinary and
even indifferent circumstances of life in order
to prove that man is capable of choosing without
a motive. It might easily be shown that these
insignificant actions are bound up with some
determining reason. It is at the great and solemn
crisis, decisive of our reputation with others, and
yet more with ourselves, that we choose in defiance
of what is conventionally called a motive, and
this absence of any tangible reason is the more
striking the deeper our freedom goes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Determinism sets on the one side the ego,
always self-identical and on the other contrary feelings.
But this is mere symbolism.</div>

<p>But the determinist, even when he refrains
from regarding the more serious emotions or deep-seated
psychic states as forces, nevertheless distinguishes
them from one another and is thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
led to a mechanical conception of the self. He
will show us this self hesitating between
two contrary feelings, passing from
one to the other and finally deciding in
favour of one of them. The self and the
feelings which stir it are thus treated
as well defined objects, which remain
identical during the whole of the process. But if
it is always the same self which deliberates, and
if the two opposite feelings by which it is moved
do not change, how, in virtue of this very principle
of causality which determinism appeals to, will
the self ever come to a decision? The truth is
that the self, by the mere fact of experiencing
the first feeling, has already changed to a slight
extent when the second supervenes: all the time
that the deliberation is going on, the self is changing
and is consequently modifying the two feelings
which agitate it. A dynamic series of states is
thus formed which permeate and strengthen one
another, and which will lead by a natural evolution
to a free act. But determinism, ever craving
for symbolical representation, cannot help substituting
words for the opposite feelings which
share the ego between them, as well as for the ego
itself. By giving first the person and then the
feelings by which he is moved a fixed form by
means of sharply defined words, it deprives them
in advance of every kind of living activity. It
will then see on the one side an ego always self-identical,
and on the other contrary feelings, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
self-identical, which dispute for its possession;
victory will necessarily belong to the stronger.
But this mechanism, to which we have condemned
ourselves in advance, has no value beyond that
of a symbolical representation: it cannot hold
good against the witness of an attentive consciousness,
which shows us inner dynamism as a fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Freedom and character. The determinist next
asks, could your act have been different or can it be foretold?</div>

<p>In short, we are free when our acts spring from
our whole personality, when they express it, when
that indefinable resemblance
to it which one sometimes finds between
the artist and his work. It is no use
asserting that we are then yielding to
the all-powerful influence of our character.
Our character is still ourselves; and because
we are pleased to split the person into two parts so
that by an effort of abstraction we may consider
in turn the self which feels or thinks and the self
which acts, it would be very strange to conclude
that one of the two selves is coercing the other.
Those who ask whether we are free to alter our
character lay themselves open to the same objection.
Certainly our character is altering imperceptibly
every day, and our freedom would suffer
if these new acquisitions were grafted on to our
self and not blended with it. But, as soon as
this blending takes place, it must be admitted that
the change which has supervened in our character
belongs to us, that we have appropriated it. In
a word, if it is agreed to call every act free which
springs from the self and from the self alone, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
act which bears the mark of our personality is
truly free, for our self alone will lay claim to its
paternity. It would thus be recognized that
free will is a fact, if it were agreed to look for it
in a certain characteristic of the decision which is
taken, in the free act itself. But the determinist
feeling that he cannot retain his hold on this position,
takes refuge in the past or the future. Sometimes
he transfers himself in thought to some
earlier period and asserts the necessary determination,
from this very moment, of the act which is
to come; sometimes, assuming in advance that
the act is already performed, he claims that it
could not have taken place in any other way.
The opponents of determinism themselves willingly
follow it on to this new ground and agree
to introduce into their definition of our free act
-perhaps not without some risk&mdash;the anticipation
of what we might do and the recollection of some
other decision which we might have taken. It is
advisable, then, that we should place ourselves
at this new point of view, and, setting aside all
translation into words, all symbolism in space,
attend to what pure consciousness alone shows
us about an action that has come to pass or an
action which is still to come. The original error
of determinism and the mistake of its opponents
will thus be grasped on another side, in so far as
they bear explicitly on a certain misconception
of duration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Determinist and libertarian doctrines of
possible acts.</div>

<p>"To be conscious of free will," says Stuart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Mill, "must mean to be conscious, before I have
decided, that I am able to decide either
way.<a name="FNanchor_8_36" id="FNanchor_8_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_36" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This is really the way in which
the defenders of free will understand it;
and they assert that when we perform an action
freely, some other action would have been "equally
possible." On this point they appeal to the testimony
of consciousness, which shows us, beyond
the act itself, the power of deciding in favour of
the opposite course. Inversely, determinism claims
that, given certain antecedents, only one resultant
action was possible. "When we think of ourselves
hypothetically," Stuart Mill goes on, "as
having acted otherwise than we did, we always
suppose a difference in the antecedents. We picture
ourselves as having known something that
we did not know, or not known something that
we did know."<a name="FNanchor_9_37" id="FNanchor_9_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_37" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And, faithful to his principle,
the English philosopher assigns consciousness the
rôle of informing us about what is, not about what
might be. We shall not insist for the moment on
this last point: we reserve the question in what
sense the ego perceives itself as a determining
cause. But beside this psychological question
there is another, belonging rather to metaphysics,
which the determinists and their opponents solve
<i>a priori</i> along opposite lines. The argument of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
the former implies that there is only one possible
act corresponding to given antecedents: the
believers in free will assume, on the other hand,
that the same series could issue in several different
acts, equally possible. It is on this question of
the equal possibility of two contrary actions or
volitions that we shall first dwell: perhaps we
shall thus gather some indication as to the nature
of the operation by which the will makes its choice.</p>


<div class="sidenote" style="margin-top: 2em;">Geometrical (and thereby deceptive) representation
of the process of coming to a decision.</div>

<p class="p2">I hesitate between two possible actions X and
Y, and I go in turn from one to the other. This
means that I pass through a series of
states, and that these states can be
divided into two groups according as I
incline more towards X or in the contrary
direction. Indeed, these opposite inclinations
alone have a real existence, and X and Y
are two symbols by which I represent at their
arrival-or termination-points, so to speak, two
different tendencies of my personality at successive
moments of duration. Let us then rather
denote the tendencies themselves by X and Y;
will this new notation give a more faithful image
of the concrete reality? It must be noticed, as
we said above, that the self grows, expands, and
changes as it passes through the two contrary
states: if not, how would it ever come to a decision?
Hence there are not exactly two contrary
states, but a large number of successive and different
states within which I distinguish, by an effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
of imagination, two opposite directions.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 50px;">
<img src="images/image_001.jpg" width="50" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Thus
we shall get still nearer the reality by agreeing to
use the invariable signs X and Y to
denote, not these tendencies or states
themselves, since they are constantly
changing, but the two different directions
which our imagination ascribes
to them for the greater convenience
of language. It will also be understood
that these are symbolical representations,
that in reality there are
not two tendencies, or even two directions,
but a self which lives and
develops by means of its very hesitations,
until the free action drops from it like an
over-ripe fruit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The only reality is the living developing
self, in which we distinguish by abstraction two
opposite tendencies or directions.</div>

<p>But this conception of voluntary activity does
not satisfy common sense, because, being essentially
a devotee of mechanism, it loves
clear-cut distinctions, those which are
expressed by sharply defined words or
by different positions in space. Hence
it will picture a self which, after having
traversed a series Μ Ο of conscious states, when
it reaches the point Ο finds before it two
directions Ο X and Ο Y, equally open. These
directions thus become <i>things,</i> real paths into
which the highroad of consciousness leads, and
it depends only on the self which of them is
entered upon. In short, the continuous and
living activity of this self, in which we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
distinguished, by abstraction only, two opposite
directions, is replaced by these directions themselves,
transformed into indifferent inert things
awaiting our choice. But then we must certainly
transfer the activity of the self somewhere or
other. We will put it, according to this hypothesis,
at the point Ο: we will say that the self,
when it reaches Ο and finds two courses open to
it, hesitates, deliberates and finally decides in
favour of one of them. As we find it difficult
to picture the double direction of the conscious
activity in all the phases of its continuous development,
we separate off these two tendencies on
the one hand and the activity of the self on the
other: we thus get an impartially active ego
hesitating between two inert and, as it were,
solidified courses of action. Now, if it decides
in favour of Ο X, the line Ο Y will nevertheless
remain; if it chooses Ο Y, the path Ο X will
remain open, waiting in case the self retraces its
steps in order to make use of it. It is in this sense
that we say, when speaking of a free act, that
the contrary action was equally possible. And,
even if we do not draw a geometrical figure on
paper, we involuntarily and almost unconsciously
think of it as soon as we distinguish in the free
act a number of successive phases, the <i>conception</i>
of opposite motives, <i>hesitation</i> and <i>choice</i>&mdash;thus
hiding the geometrical symbolism under a kind
of verbal crystallization. Now it is easy to see
that this really mechanical conception of freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
issues naturally and logically in the most unbending
determinism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">If this symbolism represents the facts, the
activity of the self has always tended in one direction,
and determinism results.</div>

<p>The living activity of the self, in which we
distinguish by abstraction two opposite tendencies,
will finally issue either at X or
Y. Now, since it is agreed to localize
the double activity of the self at the
point O, there is no reason to separate
this activity from the act in which it
will issue and which forms part and
parcel of it. And if experience shows that the
decision has been in favour of X, it is not a neutral
activity which should be placed at the point O,
but an activity tending in advance in the direction
Ο X, in spite of apparent hesitations. If, on the
contrary, observation proves that the decision
has been in favour of Y, we must infer that the
activity localized by us at the point Ο was bent
in this second direction in spite of some oscillations
towards the first. To assert that the self, when
it reaches the point O, chooses indifferently between
X and Y, is to stop half way in the course
of our geometrical symbolism; it is to separate
off at the point Ο only a part of this continuous
activity in which we undoubtedly distinguished
two different directions, but which in addition
has gone on to X or Y: why not take this last
fact into account as well as the other two? Why
not assign it the place that belongs to it in the
symbolical figure which we have just constructed?
But if the self, when it reaches the point O, is already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
determined in one direction, there is no use in the
other way remaining open, the self cannot take it.
And the same rough symbolism which was meant
to show the contingency of the action performed,
ends, by a natural extension, in proving its absolute
necessity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Libertarians ignore the fact that one path
has been chosen, and not the other.</div>

<p>In short, defenders and opponents of free will
agree in holding that the action is preceded by a
kind of mechanical oscillation between
two points X and Y. If I decide
in favour of X, the former will tell me:
you hesitated and deliberated, therefore
Y was possible. The others will answer: you
chose X, therefore you had some reason for doing
so, and those who declare that Y was equally
possible forget this reason: they leave aside one
of the conditions of the problem. Now, if I dig
deeper underneath these two opposite solutions,
I discover a common postulate: both take up
their position after the action X has been performed,
and represent the process of my voluntary
activity by a path Μ Ο which branches off at the
point O, the lines Ο X and Ο Y symbolizing the
two directions which abstraction distinguishes
within the continuous activity of which X is the
goal. But while the determinists take account
of all that they know, and note that the path
Μ Ο X has been traversed, their opponents mean
to ignore one of the data with which they have
constructed the figure, and after having traced
out the lines Ο X and Ο Y, which should together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
represent the progress of the activity of the self,
they bring back the self to the point Ο to oscillate
there until further orders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But the figure merely gives the stereotyped
memory of the process, and not the dynamic progress
which issued in the set.</div>

<p>It should not be forgotten, indeed, that the
figure, which is really a splitting of our psychic
activity in space, is purely symbolical,
and as such, cannot be constructed
unless we adopt the hypothesis that
our deliberation is finished and our mind
made up. If you trace it beforehand,
act you assume that you have reached the
end and are present in imagination at the final
act. In short this figure does not show me the
deed in the doing but the deed already done.
Do not ask me then whether the self, having
traversed the path Μ Ο and decided in favour of
X, could or could not choose Y: I should answer
that the question is meaningless, because there
is no line Μ Ο, no point O, no path Ο X, no direction
O Y. To ask such a question is to admit the possibility
of adequately representing time by space
and a succession by a simultaneity. It is to
ascribe to the figure we have traced the value
of a description, and not merely of a symbol;
it is to believe that it is possible to follow the
process of psychic activity on this figure like the
march of an army on a map. We have been
present at the deliberation of the self in all its
phases until the act was performed: then, recapitulating
the terms of the series, we perceive succession
under the form of simultaneity, we project<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
time into space, and we base our reasoning, consciously
or unconsciously, on this geometrical
figure. But this figure represents a <i>thing</i> and not
a <i>progress</i>; it corresponds, in its inertness, to a
kind of stereotyped memory of the whole process
of deliberation and the final decision arrived at:
how could it give us the least idea of the concrete
movement, the dynamic progress by which the
deliberation issued in the act? And yet, once
the figure is constructed, we go back in imagination
into the past and will have it that our psychic
activity has followed exactly the path traced out
by the figure. We thus fall into the mistake which
has been pointed out above: we give a mechanical
explanation of a fact, and then substitute the
explanation for the fact itself. Hence we encounter
insuperable difficulties from the very beginning:
if the two courses were equally possible, how
have we made our choice? If only one of them
was possible, why did we believe ourselves free?
And we do not see that both questions come back
to this: Is time space?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fundamental error is confusion of time and space
The self infallible in affirming immediate experience of
freedom, but cannot explain it.</div>

<p>If I glance over a road marked on the map
and follow it up to a certain point, there is
nothing to prevent my turning back and
trying to find out whether it branches
off anywhere. But time is not a line
along which one can pass again. Certainly,
once it has elapsed, we are justified
in picturing the successive moments
as external to one another and in thus thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of a line traversing space; but it must then be
understood that this line does not symbolize the
time which is passing but the time which has
passed. Defenders and opponents of free will
alike forget this&mdash;the former when they assert,
and the latter when they deny the possibility
of acting differently from what we have done.
The former reason thus: "The path is not yet
traced out, therefore it may take any direction
whatever." To which the answer is: "You
forget that it is not possible to speak of a path till
the action is performed: but then it will have
been traced out." The latter say: "The path
has been traced out in such and such a way:
therefore its possible direction was not any direction
whatever, but only this one direction." To
which the answer is: "Before the path was
traced out there was no direction, either possible
or impossible, for the very simple reason that there
could not yet be any question of a path." Get
rid of this clumsy symbolism, the idea of which
besets you without your knowing it; you will see
that the argument of the determinists assumes
this puerile form: "The act, once performed, is
performed," and that their opponents reply:
"The act, before being performed, was not yet
performed." In other words, the question of
freedom remains after this discussion exactly
where it was to begin with; nor must we be surprised
at it, since freedom must be sought in a
certain shade or quality of the action itself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
not in the relation of this act to what it is not
or to what it might have been. All the difficulty
arises from the fact that both parties picture the
deliberation under the form of an oscillation in
space, while it really consists in a dynamic progress
in which the self and its motives, like real
living beings, are in a constant state of becoming.
The self, infallible when it affirms its immediate
experiences, feels itself free and says so; but, as
soon as it tries to explain its freedom to itself, it
no longer perceives itself except by a kind of
refraction through space. Hence a symbolism
of a mechanical kind, equally incapable of proving,
disproving, or illustrating free will.</p>


<div class="sidenote" style="margin-top: 2em;">Is prediction of an act possible? Probable
and infallible conclusions.</div>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">But determinism will not admit itself beaten,
and, putting the question in a new form, it will
say: "Let us leave aside actions already
performed: let us consider only
actions that are to come. The question
is whether, knowing from now
onwards all the future antecedents, some higher
intelligence would not be able to predict with
absolute certainty the decision which will result."
&mdash;We gladly agree to the question being put in
these terms: it will give us a chance of stating
our own theory with greater precision. But we
shall first draw a distinction between those who
think that the knowledge of antecedents would
enable us to state a <i>probable</i> conclusion and those
who speak of an <i>infallible</i> foresight. To say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
a certain friend, under certain circumstances,
will very probably act in a certain way, is not so
much to predict the future conduct of our friend
as to pass a judgment on his present character,
that is to say, on his past. Although our feelings,
our ideas, our character, are constantly altering,
a sudden change is seldom observed; and it is
still more seldom that we cannot say of a person
whom we know that certain actions seem to
accord fairly well with his nature and that certain
others are absolutely inconsistent with it. All
philosophers will agree on this point; for to say
that a given action is consistent or inconsistent
with the present character of a person whom one
knows is not to bind the future to the present. But
the determinist goes much further: he asserts
that our solution is provisional simply because
we never know all the conditions of the problem:
that our forecast would gain in probability
in proportion as we were provided with a larger
number of these conditions; that, therefore,
complete and perfect knowledge of all the antecedents
without any exception would make our
forecast infallibly true. Such, then, is the hypothesis
which we have to examine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To know <i>completely</i> the antecedents and conditions
of an action is to be actually performing it.</div>

<p>For the sake of greater definiteness, let us
imagine a person called upon to make a seemingly
free decision under serious circumstances:
we shall call him Peter. The question
is whether a philosopher Paul, living at
the same period as Peter, or, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
prefer, a few centuries before, would have been
able, knowing <i>all</i> the conditions under which
Peter acts, to foretell with certainty the choice
which Peter made.</p>

<p>There are several ways of picturing the mental
condition of a person at a given moment. We
try to do it when e.g. we read a novel; but
whatever care the author may have taken in
depicting the feelings of his hero, and even in tracing
back his history, the end, foreseen or unforeseen,
will add something to the idea which we had
formed of the character: the character, therefore,
was only imperfectly known to us. In truth, the
deeper psychic states, those which are translated
by free acts, express and sum up the whole of our
past history: if Paul knows all the conditions
under which Peter acts, we must suppose that no
detail of Peter's life escapes him, and that his
imagination reconstructs and even lives over again
Peter's history. But we must here make a vital
distinction. When I myself pass through a certain
psychic state, I know exactly the intensity of
this state and its importance in relation to the
others, not by measurement or comparison, but
because the intensity of e.g. a deep-seated feeling
is nothing else than the feeling itself. On the
other hand, if I try to give you an account of this
psychic state, I shall be unable to make you realize
its intensity except by some definite sign of a
mathematical kind: I shall have to measure its
importance, compare it with what goes before and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
what follows, in short determine the part which
it plays in the final act. And I shall say that it
is more or less intense, more or less important,
according as the final act is explained by it or
apart from it. On the other hand, for my own
consciousness, which perceived this inner state,
there was no need of a comparison of this kind:
the intensity was given to it as an inexpressible
quality of the state itself. In other words, the
intensity of a psychic state is not given to consciousness
as a special sign accompanying this
state and denoting its power, like an exponent in
algebra; we have shown above that it expresses
rather its shade, its characteristic colouring, and
that, if it is a question of a feeling, for example, its
intensity consists in being felt. Hence we have
to distinguish two ways of assimilating the conscious
states of other people: the one dynamic,
which consists in experiencing them oneself; the
other static, which consists in substituting for the
consciousness of these states their image or rather
their intellectual symbol, their idea. In this case
the conscious states are <i>imagined</i> instead of being
<i>reproduced</i>; but, then, to the image of the psychic
states themselves some indication of their <i>intensity</i>
should be added, since they no longer act on the
person in whose mind they are pictured and the
latter has no longer any chance of experiencing
their force by actually feeling them. Now, this
indication itself will necessarily assume a quantitative
character: it will be pointed out, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
example, that a certain feeling has more strength
than another feeling, that it is necessary to take
more account of it, that it has played a greater
part; and how could this be known unless the
later history of the person were known in advance,
with the precise actions in which this multiplicity
of states or inclinations has issued? Therefore, if
Paul is to have an adequate idea of Peter's state
at any moment of his history, there are only
two courses open; either, like a novelist who
knows whither he is conducting his characters,
Paul must already know Peter's final act, and
must thus be able to supplement his mental image
of the successive states through which Peter is
going to pass by some indication of their value
in relation to the whole of Peter's history; or he
must make up his mind to pass through these
different states, not in imagination, but in reality.
The former hypothesis must be put on one side
since the very point at issue is whether, the antecedents
<i>alone</i> being given, Paul will be able to
foresee the final act. We find ourselves compelled,
therefore, to alter radically the idea which we had
formed of Paul: he is not, as we had thought at
first, a spectator whose eyes pierce the future, but
an actor who plays Peter's part in advance. And
notice that you cannot exempt him from any
detail of this part, for the most common-place
events have their importance in a life-story;
and even supposing that they have not, you cannot
decide that they are insignificant except in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
relation to the final act, which, by hypothesis, is
not given. Neither have you the right to cut
short&mdash;were it only by a second&mdash;the different
states of consciousness through which Paul is
going to pass before Peter; for the effects of the
same feeling, for example, go on accumulating at
every moment of duration, and the sum total of
these effects could not be realized all at once unless
one knew the importance of the feeling, taken
in its totality, in relation to the final act, which is
the very thing that is supposed to remain unknown.
But if Peter and Paul have experienced the same
feelings in the same order, if their minds have the
same history, how will you distinguish one from
the other? Will it be by the body in which they
dwell? They would then always differ in some
respect, viz., that at no moment of their history
would they have a mental picture of the same
body. Will it be by the place which they occupy
in time? In that case they would no longer be
present at the same events: now, by hypothesis,
they have the same past and the same present,
having the same experience. You must now
make up your mind about it: Peter and Paul
are one and the same person, whom you call Peter
when he acts and Paul when you recapitulate
his history. The more complete you made the
sum of the conditions which, when known, would
have enabled you to predict Peter's future action,
the closer became your grasp of his existence and
the nearer you came to living his life over again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
down to its smallest details: you thus reached the
very moment when, the action taking place, there
was no longer anything to be foreseen, but only
something to be done. Here again any attempt
to reconstruct ideally an act really <i>willed</i>
ends in the mere witnessing of the act whilst
it is being performed or when it is already
done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hence meaningless to ask whether an act can be
foreseen when <i>all</i> its antecedents are given.</div>

<p>Hence it is a question devoid of meaning to
ask: Could or could not the act be foreseen, given
the sum total of its antecedents?
For there are two ways of assimilating
these antecedents, the one dynamic the
other static. In the first case we shall
be led by imperceptible steps to identify
ourselves with the person we are dealing with,
to pass through the same series of states, and thus
to get back to the very moment at which the act
is performed; hence there can no longer be
any question of foreseeing it. In the second
case, we presuppose the final act by the mere fact
of annexing to the qualitative description of the
previous states the quantitative appreciation of
their importance. Here again the one party is
led merely to realize that the act is not yet performed
when it is to be performed, and the other,
that when performed it is performed. This,
like the previous discussion, leaves the question
of freedom exactly where it was to begin
with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The two fallacies involved:
(1) regarding intensity as a magnitude, not a quality;
(2) substituting material symbol for dynamic process.</div>

<p>By going deeper into this twofold argument, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
shall find, at its very root, the two fundamental
illusions of the reflective consciousness.
The first consists in regarding: intensity
as a mathematical property of psychic
states and not, as we said at the beginning
of this essay, as a special quality,
as a particular shade of these various
states. The second consists in substituting
for the concrete reality or dynamic progress,
which consciousness perceives, the material symbol
of this progress when it has already reached its
end, that is to say, of the act already accomplished
together with the series of its antecedents. Certainly,
once the final act is completed, I can ascribe
to all the antecedents their proper value, and picture
the interplay of these various elements as a
conflict or a composition of forces. But to ask
whether, the antecedents being known as well as
their value, one could foretell the final act, is to
beg the question; it is to forget that we cannot
know the value of the antecedents without knowing
the final act, which is the very thing that is not yet
known; it is to suppose wrongly that the symbolical
diagram which we draw in our own way
for representing the action <i>when completed</i> has
been drawn by the action itself <i>whilst progressing,</i>
and drawn by it in an automatic manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Claiming to foresee an action always comes back
to confusing time with space.</div>

<p>Now, in these two illusions themselves a third
one is involved, and you will see that the question
whether the act could or could not be foreseen
always comes back to this: Is time space?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
You begin by setting side by side in some ideal
space the conscious states which succeed
one another in Peter's mind, and
you perceive his life as a kind of path
Μ Ο X Y traced out by a moving body M
in space. You then blot out in thought
the part Ο X Y of this curve, and you inquire
whether, knowing Μ Ο, you would have been able
to determine the portion Ο X of the curve which
the moving body describes beyond O.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/image_002.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Such is, in the main, the question which you put when you
bring in a philosopher Paul, who lives before Peter
and has to picture to himself the conditions under
which Peter will act. You thus materialize these
conditions; you make the time to come into a
road already marked out across the plain, which
we can contemplate from the top of the mountain,
even if we have not traversed it and are never to
do so. But, now, you soon notice that the knowledge
of the part Μ Ο of the curve would not be
enough, unless you were shown the position of the
points of this line, not only in relation to one
another, but also in relation to the points of the
whole line Μ O X Y; which would amount to being
given in advance the very elements which have
to be determined. So you then alter your hypothesis;
you realize that time does not require to
be seen, but to be lived; and hence you conclude
that, if your knowledge of the line Μ Ο was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
a sufficient datum, the reason must have been that
you looked at it from the outside instead of identifying
yourself with the point M, which describes
not only Μ Ο but also the whole curve, and thus
making its movement your own. Therefore, you
persuade Paul to come and coincide with Peter;
and naturally, then, it is the line Μ Ο X Y which
Paul traces out in space, since, by hypothesis,
Peter describes this line. But in no wise do you
prove thus that Paul foresaw Peter's action; you
only show that Peter acted in the way he did, since
Paul became Peter. It is true that you then come
back, unwittingly, to your former hypothesis,
because you continually confuse the line Μ Ο X Y
in its tracing with the line Μ Ο X Y already traced,
that is to say, time with space. After causing
Paul to come down and identify himself with
Peter as long as was required, you let him go up
again and resume his former post of observation.
No wonder if he then perceives the line Μ Ο X Y
complete: he himself has just been completing it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion arising from prediction of
astronomical phenomena.</div>

<p>What makes the confusion a natural and almost
an unavoidable one is that science seems to point
to many cases where we do anticipate
the future. Do we not determine beforehand
the conjunctions of heavenly
bodies, solar and lunar eclipses, in short
the greater number of astronomical phenomena?
Does not, then, the human intellect embrace in the
present moment immense intervals of duration
still to come? No doubt it does; but an anticipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of this kind has not the slightest resemblance
to the anticipation of a voluntary act. Indeed,
as we shall see, the reasons which render it possible
to foretell an astronomical phenomenon are the
very ones which prevent us from determining in
advance an act which springs from our free activity.
For the future of the material universe,
although contemporaneous with the future of a
conscious being, has no analogy to it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustration from hypothetical acceleration
of physical movements.</div>

<p>In order to put our finger on this vital difference,
let us assume for a moment that some mischievous
illustration genius, more powerful still than the
mischievous genius conjured up by Descartes
decreed that all the movements
of the universe should go twice as fast.
There would be no change in astronomical phenomena,
or at any rate in the equations which
enable us to foresee them, for in these equations
the symbol <i>t</i> does not stand for a duration, but
for a relation between two durations, for a certain
number of units of time, in short, for a certain
number of <i>simultaneities:</i> these simultaneities,
these coincidences would still take place in equal
number: only the intervals which separate them
would have diminished, but these intervals
never make their appearance in our calculations.
Now these intervals are just duration <i>lived,</i>
duration which our consciousness perceives, and
our consciousness would soon inform us of a shortening
of the day if we had not experienced the
usual amount of duration between sunrise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
sunset. No doubt it would not measure this
shortening, and perhaps it would not even perceive
it immediately as a change of quantity; but
it would realize in some way or other a decline in
the usual storing up of experience, a change in
the progress usually accomplished between sunrise
and sunset.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Astronomical prophecy such as acceleration.</div>

<p>Now, when an astronomer foretells e.g. a lunar
eclipse, he merely exercises in his own way the
power which we have ascribed to our
mischievous genius. He decrees that
time shall go ten times, a hundred times,
a thousand times as fast, and he has a right to do
so, since all that he thus changes is the nature of
the conscious intervals, and since these intervals,
by hypothesis, do not enter into the calculations.
Therefore, into a psychological duration of a few
seconds he may put several years, even several
centuries of astronomical time: that is his procedure
when he traces in advance the path of a
heavenly body or represents it by an equation.
What he does is nothing but establishing a series
of relations of position between this body and
other given bodies, a series of simultaneities and
coincidences, a series of numerical relations:
as for duration properly so called, it remains outside
the calculation and could only be perceived
by a consciousness capable of living through the
intervals and, in fact, living the intervals themselves,
instead of merely perceiving their extremities.
Indeed it is even conceivable that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
consciousness could live so slow and lazy a life as
to take in the whole path of the heavenly body
in a single perception, just as we do when we perceive
the successive positions of a shooting star
as one line of fire. Such a consciousness would
find itself really in the same conditions in which
the astronomer places himself ideally; it would
see in the present what the astronomer perceives
in the future. In truth, if the latter foresees a
future phenomenon, it is only on condition of
making it to a certain extent a present phenomenon,
or at least of enormously reducing the
interval which separates us from it. In short, the
time of which we speak in astronomy is a number,
and the nature of the units of this number cannot
be specified in our calculations; we may therefore
assume them to be as small as we please, provided
that the same hypothesis is extended to the whole
series of operations, and that the successive relations
of position in space are thus preserved. We
shall then be present in imagination at the phenomenon
we wish to foretell; we shall know exactly
at what point in space and after how many
units of time this phenomenon takes place; if we
then restore to these units their psychical nature,
we shall thrust the event again into the future and
say that we have foreseen it, when in reality we
have seen it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In dealing with states of consciousness
we cannot vary their duration without altering their nature.</div>

<p>But these units of time which make up living
duration, and which the astronomer can dispose
of as he pleases because they give no handle to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
science, are just what concern the psychologist,
for psychology deals with the intervals
themselves and not with their extremities.
Certainly pure consciousness does
not perceive time as a sum of units of
duration: left to itself, it has no means
and even no reason to measure time; but a feeling
which lasted only half the number of days, for
example, would no longer be the same feeling
for it; it would lack thousands of impressions
which gradually thickened its substance and
altered its colour. True, when we give this feeling
a certain name, when we treat it as a thing, we
believe that we can diminish its duration by half,
for example, and also halve the duration of all the
rest of our history: it seems that it would still
be the same life, only on a reduced scale. But we
forget that states of consciousness are processes,
and not things; that if we denote them each by a
single word, it is for the convenience of language;
that they are alive and therefore constantly changing;
that, in consequence, it is impossible to cut
off a moment from them without making them
poorer by the loss of some impression, and thus
altering their quality. I quite understand that
the orbit of a planet might be perceived all at
once or in a very short time, because its successive
positions or the <i>results</i> of its movement are the
only things that matter, and not the duration of
the equal intervals which separate them. But
when we have to do with a feeling, it has no precise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
result except its having been felt; and, to estimate
this result adequately, it would be necessary to
have gone through all the phases of the feeling
itself and to have taken up the same duration.
Even if this feeling has finally issued in some definite
action, which might be compared to the
definite position of a planet in space, the knowledge
of this act will hardly enable us to estimate
the influence of the feeling on the whole of a life-story,
and it is this very influence which we want
to know. All foreseeing is in reality seeing, and
this seeing takes place when we can reduce as
much as we please an interval of future time while
preserving the relation of its parts to one another,
as happens in the case of astronomical predictions.
But what does reducing an interval of time mean,
except emptying or impoverishing the conscious
states which fill it? And does not the very
possibility of seeing an astronomical period in
miniature thus imply the impossibility of modifying
a psychological series in the same way, since
it is only by taking this psychological series as an
invariable basis that we shall be able to make an
astronomical period vary arbitrarily as regards
the unit of duration?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difference between past and
future duration in this respect.</div>

<p>Thus, when we ask whether a future action
could have been foreseen, we unwittingly identify
that time with which we have to do in
the exact sciences, and which is reducible
to a number, with real duration, whose
so-called quantity is really a quality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and which we cannot curtail by an instant without
altering the nature of the facts which fill it. No
doubt the identification is made easier by the fact
that in a large number of cases we are justified in
dealing with real duration as with astronomical
time. Thus, when we call to mind the past, i.e.
a series of deeds done, we always shorten it, without
however distorting the nature of the event
which interests us. The reason is that we know
it already; for the psychic state, when it reaches
the end of the <i>progress</i> which constitutes its very
existence, becomes a <i>thing</i> which one can picture
to oneself all at once. Here we find ourselves
in the same position as the astronomer, when he
takes in at a glance the orbit which a planet
will need several years to traverse. In fact,
astronomical prediction should be compared with
the recollection of the past state of consciousness,
not with the anticipation of the future one. But
when we have to determine a future state of consciousness,
however superficial it may be, we can
no longer view the antecedents in a static condition
as things; we must view them in a dynamic
condition as processes, since we are concerned
with their influence alone. Now their duration
is this very influence. Therefore it will no longer
do to shorten future duration in order to picture
its parts beforehand; one is bound to <i>live</i> this
duration whilst it is unfolding. As far as
deep-seated psychic states are concerned, there
is no perceptible difference between foreseeing,
seeing, and acting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The determinist argument that psychic
phenomena are subject to the law "same antecedents,
same consequent."</div>

<p>Only one course will remain open to the determinist.
He will probably give up asserting the
possibility of foreseeing a certain future
act or state of consciousness, but will
maintain that every act is determined
by its psychic antecedents, or, in other
words, that the facts of consciousness,
went, the phenomena of nature, are subject
to laws. This way of arguing means, at
bottom, that he will leave out the particular
features of the concrete psychic states, lest he
find himself confronted by phenomena which
defy all symbolical representation and therefore
all anticipation. The particular nature of these
phenomena is thus thrust out of sight, but it is
asserted that, being phenomena, they must remain
subject to the law of causality. Now, it is
argued, this law means that every phenomenon
is determined by its conditions, or, in other words,
that the same causes produce the same effects.
Either, then, the act is inseparably bound to its
antecedents, or the principle of causality admits
of an incomprehensible exception.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But as regards inner states the same
antecedents will never recur.</div>

<p>This last form of the determinist argument
differs less than might be thought from all the
others which have been examined above.
To say that the same inner causes will
reproduce the same effects is to assume
that the same cause can appear
a second time on the stage of consciousness.
Now, if duration is what we say, deep-seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
psychic states are radically heterogeneous
to each other, and it is impossible that any two of
them should be quite alike, since they are two
different moments of a life-story. While the
external object does not bear the mark of the time
that has elapsed and thus, in spite of the difference
of time, the physicist can again encounter
identical elementary conditions, duration is something
real for the consciousness which preserves
the trace of it, and we cannot here speak of identical
conditions, because the same moment does
not occur twice. It is no use arguing that, even
if there are no two deep-seated psychic states
which are altogether alike, yet analysis would
resolve these different states into more general
and homogeneous elements which might be compared
with each other. This would be to forget
that even the simplest psychic elements possess
a personality and a life of their own, however
superficial they may be; they are in a constant
state of becoming, and the same feeling, by
the mere fact of being repeated, is a new feeling.
Indeed, we have no reason for calling it by its
former name save that it corresponds to the same
external cause or projects itself outwardly into
similar attitudes: hence it would simply be begging
the question to deduce from the so-called
likeness of two conscious states that the same cause
produces the same effect. In short, if the causal
relation still holds good in the realm of inner states,
it cannot resemble in any way what we call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
causality in nature. For the physicist, the same
cause always produces the same effect: for a
psychologist who does not let himself be misled
by merely apparent analogies, a deep-seated inner
cause produces its effect once for all and will
never reproduce it. And if it is now asserted that
this effect was inseparably bound up with this
particular cause, such an assertion will mean one
of two things: either that, the antecedents being
given, the future action might have been foreseen;
or that, the action having once been performed,
any other actionals seen, under the given conditions,
to have been impossible. Now we saw that both
these assertions were equally meaningless, and that
they also involved a false conception of duration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analysis οf the conception of
cause, which underlies the whole determinist
argument.</div>

<p>Nevertheless it will be worth while to dwell on
this latter form of the determinist argument, even
though it be only to explain from our
point of view the meaning of the two
words "determination" and "causality."
In vain do we argue that there
cannot be any question either of foreseeing
a future action in the way that an astronomical
phenomenon is foreseen, or of asserting,
when once an action is done, that any other action
would have been impossible under the given conditions.
In vain do we add that, even when it
takes this form: "The same causes produce the
same effects," the principle of universal determination
loses every shred of meaning in the inner world
of conscious states. The determinist will perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
yield to our arguments on each of these three
points in particular, will admit that in the psychical
field one cannot ascribe any of these three
meanings to the word determination, will probably
fail to discover a fourth meaning, and yet will go
on repeating that the act is inseparably bound
up with its antecedents. We thus find ourselves
here confronted by so deep-seated a misapprehension
and so obstinate a prejudice that we cannot
get the better of them without attacking them at
their root, which is the principle of causality. By
analysing the concept of cause, we shall show the
ambiguity which it involves, and, though not
aiming at a formal definition of freedom, we shall
perhaps get beyond the purely negative idea of
it which we have framed up to the present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causality as "regular succession" does not apply
to conscious states and cannot disprove free will.</div>

<p>We perceive physical phenomena, and these
phenomena obey laws. This means: (i) that
phenomena <i>a, b, c, d,</i> previously perceived,
can occur again in the same
shape; (2) that a certain phenomenon
<i>P,</i> which appeared after the conditions
<i>a, b, c, d,</i> and after these conditions
only, will not fail to recur as soon as the
same conditions are again present. If the principle
of causality told us nothing more, as the empiricists
claim, we should willingly grant these
philosophers that their principle is derived from
experience; but it would no longer prove anything
against our freedom. For it would then be understood
that definite antecedents give rise to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
definite consequent <i>wherever</i> experience shows us
this regular succession; but the question is
whether this regularity is found in the domain
of consciousness too, and that is the whole problem
of free will. We grant you for a moment
that the principle of causality is nothing but the
summing up of the uniform and unconditional
successions observed in the past: by what right,
then, do you apply it to those deep-seated states
of consciousness in which no regular succession
has yet been discovered, since the attempt to
foresee them ever fails? And how can you base
on this principle your argument to prove the
determinism of inner states, when, according
to you, the determinism of observed facts is
the sole source of the principle itself? In truth,
when the empiricists make use of the principle
of causality to disprove human freedom, they take
the word cause in a new meaning, which is the
very meaning given to it by common sense.</p>

<p>To assert the regular succession of two phenomena
is, indeed, to recognize that, the first being
given, we already catch sight of the second. But
this wholly subjective connexion between two ideas
is not enough for common sense. It seems to
common sense that, if the idea of the second
phenomenon is already implied in that of the first,
the second phenomenon itself must exist objectively,
in some way or other, within the first phenomenon.
And common sense was bound to come
to this conclusion, because to distinguish exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
between an objective connexion of phenomena
and a subjective association between their ideas
presupposes a fairly high degree of philosophical
culture. We thus pass imperceptibly from the
first meaning to the second, and we picture the
causal relation as a kind of prefiguring of the
future phenomenon in its present conditions.
Now this prefiguring can be understood in two
very different ways, and it is just here that the
ambiguity begins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Causality, as the prefiguring of the
future phenomenon in its present conditions, in one
form destroys concrete phenomena.</div>

<p>In the first place, mathematics furnishes us
with <i>one</i> type of this kind of prefiguring. The
very movement by which we draw the
circumference of a circle on a sheet of
paper generates all the mathematical
properties of this figure: in this sense
an unlimited number of theorems can
be said to pre-exist within the definition,
although they will be spread out in duration for the
mathematician who deduces them. It is true that
we are here in the realm of pure quantity and that,
as geometrical properties can be expressed in the
form of equations, it is easy to understand how the
original equation, expressing the fundamental
property of the figure, is transformed into an
unlimited number of new ones, all virtually contained
in the first. On the contrary, physical
phenomena, which succeed one another and are
perceived by our senses, are distinguished by
quality not less than by quantity, so that there
would be some difficulty in at once declaring them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
equivalent to one another. But, just because
they are perceived through our sense-organs, we
seem justified in ascribing their qualitative differences
to the impression which they make on us and
in assuming, behind the heterogeneity of our sensations,
a homogeneous physical universe. Thus,
we shall strip matter of the concrete qualities
with which our senses clothe it, colour, heat, resistance,
even weight, and we shall finally find
ourselves confronted with homogeneous extensity,
space without body. The only step then remaining
will be to describe figures in space, to make
them move according to mathematically formulated
laws, and to explain the apparent qualities
of matter by the shape, position, and motion of
these geometrical figures. Now, position is given
by a system of fixed magnitudes and motion is
expressed by a law, i.e. by a constant relation
between variable magnitudes; but shape is a
mental image, and, however tenuous, however
transparent we assume it to be, it still constitutes,
in so far as our imagination has, so to speak, the
visual perception of it, a concrete and therefore
irreducible quality of matter. It will therefore
be necessary to make a clean sweep of this image
itself and replace it by the abstract formula of the
movement which gives rise to the figure. Picture
then algebraical relations getting entangled
in one another, becoming objective by this very
entanglement, and producing, by the mere effect
of their complexity, concrete, visible, and tangible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
reality,&mdash;you will be merely drawing the consequences
of the principle of causality, understood
in the sense of an actual prefiguring of the future
in the present. The scientists of our time do not
seem, indeed, to have carried abstraction so far,
except perhaps Lord Kelvin. This acute and profound
physicist assumed that space is filled with
a homogeneous and incompressible fluid in which
vortices move, thus producing the properties of
matter: these vortices are the constituent elements
of bodies; the atom thus becomes a movement,
and physical phenomena are reduced to
regular movements taking place within an incompressible
fluid. But, if you will notice that this
fluid is perfectly homogeneous, that between its
parts there is neither an empty interval which
separates them nor any difference whatever by
which they can be distinguished, you will see that
all movement taking place within this fluid is
really equivalent to absolute immobility, since
before, during, and after the movement nothing
changes and nothing has changed in the whole.
The movement which is here spoken of is thus not
a movement which actually takes place, but only
a movement which is pictured mentally: it is a
relation between relations. It is implicitly supposed,
though perhaps not actually realized, that
motion has something to do with consciousness,
that in space there are only simultaneities, and
that the business of the physicist is to provide
us with the means of calculating these relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of simultaneity for any moment of our duration.
Nowhere has mechanism been carried further
than in this system, since the very shape of the
ultimate elements of matter is here reduced to a
movement. But the Cartesian physics already
anticipated this interpretation; for if matter is
nothing, as Descartes claimed, but homogeneous
extensity, the movements of the parts of this
extensity can be conceived through the abstract
law which governs them or through an algebraical
equation between variable magnitudes, but cannot
be represented under the concrete form of an
image. And it would not be difficult to prove
that the more the progress of mechanical explanations
enables us to develop this conception of
causality and therefore to relieve the atom of the
weight of its sensible qualities, the more the concrete
existence of the phenomena of nature tends
to vanish into algebraical smoke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It thus leads to Descartes' physics and
Spinoza's metaphysics, but cannot bind future to
present without neglecting duration.</div>

<p>Thus understood, the relation of causality is a
necessary relation in the sense that it will indefinitely
approach the relation of identity,
as a curve approaches its asymptote.
The Principle of identity is the absolute
law of our consciousness: it asserts
that what is thought is thought at the
moment when we think it: and what
gives this principle its absolute necessity is that it
does not bind the future to the present, but only
the present to the present: it expresses the
unshakable confidence that consciousness feels in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
itself, so long as, faithful to its duty, it confines
itself to declaring the apparent present state of
the mind. But the principle of causality, in so
far as it is supposed to bind the future to the present,
could never take the form of a necessary
principle; for the successive moments of real
time are not bound up with one another, and no
effort of logic will succeed in proving that what
has been will be or will continue to be, that the
same antecedents will always give rise to identical
consequents. Descartes understood this so well
that he attributed the regularity of the physical
world and the continuation of the same effects to
the constantly renewed grace of Providence; he
built up, as it were, an instantaneous physics,
intended for a universe the whole duration of
which might as well be confined to the present
moment. And Spinoza maintained that the indefinite
series of phenomena, which takes for us the
form of a succession in time, was equivalent, in the
absolute, to the divine unity: he thus assumed,
on the one hand, that the relation of apparent
causality between phenomena melted away into
a relation of identity in the absolute, and, on the
other, that the indefinite duration of things was
all contained in a single moment, which is eternity.
In short, whether we study Cartesian physics,
Spinozistic metaphysics, or the scientific theories
of our own time, we shall find everywhere the same
anxiety to establish a relation of logical necessity
between cause and effect, and we shall see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
this anxiety shows itself in a tendency to transform
relations of succession into relations of
inherence, to do away with active duration, and to
substitute for apparent causality a fundamental
identity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The necessary determination of phenomena
implies non-duration; but we <i>endure</i> and are therefore
free.</div>

<p>Now, if the development of the notion of
causality, understood in the sense of necessary
connexion, leads to the Spinozistic or Cartesian
conception of nature, inversely,
all relation of necessary determination
established between successive phenomena
may be supposed to arise from
our perceiving, in a confused form, some mathematical
mechanism behind their heterogeneity.
We do not claim that common sense has any
intuition of the kinetic theories of matter, still
less perhaps of a Spinozistic mechanism; but it
will be seen that the more the effect seems necessarily
bound up with the cause, the more we tend
to put it in the cause itself, as a mathematical
consequence in its principle, and thus to cancel
the effect of duration. That under the influence
of the same external conditions I do not behave
to-day as I behaved yesterday is not at all surprising,
because I <i>change,</i> because I <i>endure.</i> But
things considered apart from our perception do
not seem to endure; and the more thoroughly we
examine this idea, the more absurd it seems to us
to suppose that the same cause should not produce
to-day the effect which it produced yesterday. We
certainly feel, it is true, that although things do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
endure as we do ourselves, nevertheless there must
be some reason why phenomena are seen to <i>succeed</i>
one another instead of being set out all at once.
And this is why the notion of causality, although
it gets indefinitely near that of identity, will never
seem to us to coincide with it, unless we conceive
clearly the idea of a mathematical mechanism or
unless some subtle metaphysics removes our very
legitimate scruples on the point. It is no less
obvious that our belief in the necessary determination
of phenomena by one another becomes
stronger in proportion as we are more inclined to
regard duration as a subjective form of our consciousness.
In other words, the more we tend to
set up the causal relation as a relation of necessary
determination, the more we assert thereby that
things do not <i>endure</i> like ourselves. This amounts
to saying that the more we strengthen the principle
of causality, the more we emphasize the
difference between a physical series and a psychical
one. Whence, finally, it would result (however paradoxical
the opinion may seem) that the assumption
of a relation of mathematical inherence between
external phenomena ought to bring with it,
as a natural or at least as a plausible consequence,
the belief in human free will. But this last consequence
will not concern us for the moment: we
are merely trying here to trace out the first meaning
of the word causality, and we think we have
shown that the prefiguring of the future in the
present is easily conceived under a mathematical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
form, thanks to a certain conception of duration
which, without seeming to be so, is fairly familiar
to common sense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prefiguring, as having an idea of a future act
which we cannot realize without effort, does not involve
necessary determination.</div>

<p>But there is a prefiguring of another kind, still
more familiar to our mind, because immediate
prefiguring, as consciousness gives us the type of it.
We go, in fact, through successive states
of consciousness, and although the later
was not contained in the earlier, we had
before us at the time a more or less confused
idea of it. The actual realization
of this idea, however, did not appear as certain
but merely as possible. Yet, between the idea and
the action, some hardly perceptible intermediate
processes come in, the whole mass of which takes
for us a form <i>sui generis,</i> which is called the feeling
of effort. And from the idea to the effort, from
the effort to the act, the progress has been so
continuous that we cannot say where the idea and
the effort end, and where the act begins. Hence
we see that in a certain sense we may still say here
that the future was prefigured in the present;
but it must be added that this prefiguring is very
imperfect, since the future action of which we
have the present idea is conceived as realizable but
not as realized, and since, even when we plan the
effort necessary to accomplish it, we feel that there
is still time to stop. If, then, we decide to picture
the causal relation in this second form, we can
assert <i>a priori</i> that there will no longer be a relation
of necessary determination between the cause and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
the effect, for the effect will no longer be given
in the cause. It will be there only in the state
of pure possibility and as a vague idea which
perhaps will not be followed by the corresponding
action. But we shall not be surprised that this
approximation is enough for common sense if we
think of the readiness with which children and
primitive people accept the idea of a whimsical
Nature, in which caprice plays a part no less
important than necessity. Nay, this way of
conceiving causality will be more easily understood
by the general run of people, since it does not
demand any effort of abstraction and only implies
a certain analogy between the outer and the inner
world, between the succession of objective phenomena
and that of our subjective states.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This second conception of causality leads
to Leibniz as the first led to Spinoza.</div>

<p>In truth, this second way of conceiving the relation
of cause to effect is more natural than the first
in that it immediately satisfies the need
of a mental image. If we look for the
phenomenon Β within the phenomenon
A, which regularly precedes it, the reason
is that the habit of associating the two images
ends in giving us the idea of the second phenomenon
wrapped up, as it were, in that of the first.
It is natural, then, that we should push this objectification
to its furthest limit and that we should
make the phenomenon A itself into a psychic state,
in which the phenomenon Β is supposed to be
contained as a very vague idea. We simply
suppose, thereby, that the objective connexion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
of the two phenomena resembles the subjective
association which suggested the idea of it to us.
The qualities of things are thus set up as actual
<i>states,</i> somewhat analogous to those of our own
self; the material universe is credited with a vague
personality which is diffused through space and
which, although not exactly endowed with a conscious
will, is led on from one state to another by
an inner impulse, a kind of effort. Such was
ancient hylozoism, a half-hearted and even contradictory
hypothesis, which left matter its extensity
although attributing to it real conscious states,
and which spread the qualities of matter throughout
extensity while treating these qualities as
inner i.e. simple states. It was reserved for
Leibniz to do away with this contradiction and to
show that, if the succession of external qualities
or phenomena is understood as the succession of
our own ideas, these qualities must be regarded
as simple states or perceptions, and the matter
which supports them as an unextended monad,
analogous to our soul. But, if such be the case,
the successive states of matter cannot be perceived
from the outside any more than our own
psychic states; the hypothesis of pre-established
harmony must be introduced in order to explain
how these inner states are representative of one
another. Thus, with our second conception of the
relation of causality we reach Leibniz, as with the
first we reached Spinoza. And in both cases we
merely push to their extreme limit or formulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
with greater precision two half-hearted and confused
ideas of common sense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It does not involve necessary determination.</div>

<p>Now it is obvious that the relation of causality,
understood in this second way, does not involve
the necessary determination of the effect
by the cause. History indeed proves it.
We see ancient hylozoism, the first
outcome of this conception of causality, explained
the regular succession of causes and effects by a
real <i>deus ex machina</i>: sometimes it was a Necessity
external to things and hovering over them, sometimes
an inner Reason acting by rules somewhat
similar to those which govern our own conduct.
Nor do the perceptions of Leibniz's monad necessitate
one another; God has to regulate their order
in advance. In fact, Leibniz's determinism does
not spring from his conception of the monad, but
from the fact that he builds up the universe with
monads only. Having denied all mechanical
influence of substances on one another, he had to
explain how it happens that their states correspond.
Hence a determinism which arises from
the necessity of positing a pre-established harmony,
and not at all from the dynamic conception of
the relation of causality. But let us leave
history aside. Consciousness itself testifies that
the abstract idea of force is that of indeterminate
effort, that of an effort which has not
yet issued in an act and in which the act is
still only at the stage of an idea. In other
words, the dynamic conception of the causal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
relation ascribes to things a duration absolutely
like our own, whatever may be the nature of this
duration; to picture in this way the relation of
cause to effect is to assume that the future is not
more closely bound up with the present in the
external world than it is in our own inner life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Each of these contradictory interpretations
of causality and duration by itself safeguards
freedom; taken together they destroy it.</div>

<p>It follows from this twofold analysis that the
principle of causality involves two contradictory
conceptions of duration, two mutually
exclusive ways of prefiguring the future
in the present. Sometimes all phenomena,
physical or psychical, are pictured
as <i>enduring</i> in the same way, and therefore
in the way that <i>we</i> do: in this
case the future will exist in the present
only as an idea, and the passing from the present
to the future will take the form of an effort which
does not always lead to the realization of the idea
conceived. Sometimes, on the other hand, duration
is regarded as the characteristic form of conscious
states; in this case, things are no longer
supposed to <i>endure</i> as we do, and a mathematical
pre-existence of their future in their present is
admitted. Now, each of these two hypotheses,
when taken by itself, safeguards human freedom;
for the first would lead to the result that even the
phenomena of nature were contingent, and the
second, by attributing the necessary determination
of physical phenomena to the fact that
things do not <i>endure</i> as we do, invites us to
regard the self which is subject to duration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
as a free force. Therefore, every clear conception
of causality, where we know our own
meaning, leads to the idea of human freedom
as a natural consequence. Unfortunately, the
habit has grown up of taking the principle of causality
in both senses at the same time, because the
one is more flattering to our imagination and the
other is more favourable to mathematical reasoning.
Sometimes we think particularly of the
regular <i>succession</i> of physical phenomena and of
the kind of inner effort by which one <i>becomes</i>
another; sometimes we fix our mind on the absolute
<i>regularity</i> of these phenomena, and from the idea
of regularity we pass by imperceptible steps to
that of mathematical necessity, which excludes
duration understood in the first way. And we
do not see any harm in letting these two conceptions
blend into one another, and in assigning
greater importance to the one or the other according
as we are more or less concerned with the
interests of science. But to apply the principle
of causality, in this ambiguous form, to the succession
of conscious states, is uselessly and wantonly
to run into inextricable difficulties. The
idea of force, which really excludes that of necessary
determination, has got into the habit, so to
speak, of amalgamating with that of necessity, in
consequence of the very use which we make of
the principle of causality in nature. On the one
hand, we know force only through the witness of
consciousness, and consciousness does not assert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
does not even understand, the absolute determination,
now, of actions that are still to come: that
is all that experience teaches us, and if we hold by
experience we should say that we feel ourselves
free, that we perceive force, rightly or wrongly,
as a free spontaneity. But, on the other hand,
this idea of force, carried over into nature, travelling
there side by side with the idea of necessity,
has got corrupted before it returns from the journey.
It returns impregnated with the idea of
necessity: and in the light of the rôle which we
have made it play in the external world, we regard
force as determining with strict necessity the effects
which flow from it. Here again the mistake made
by consciousness arises from the fact that it looks
at the self, not directly, but by a kind of refraction
through the forms which it has lent to external
perception, and which the latter does not give
back without having left its mark on them. A
compromise, as it were, has been brought about
between the idea of force and that of necessary
determination. The wholly mechanical determination
of two external phenomena by one
another now assumes in our eyes the same form
as the dynamic relation of our exertion of force to
the act which springs from it: but, in return, this
latter relation takes the form of a mathematical
derivation, the human action being supposed to
issue mechanically, and therefore necessarily,
from the force which produces it. There is no
doubt that this mingling of two different and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
almost opposite ideas offers advantages to common
sense, since it enables us to picture in the
same way, and denote by one and the same word,
both the relation which exists between two moments
of our life and that which binds together the
successive moments of the external world. We
have seen that, though our deepest conscious states
exclude numerical multiplicity, yet we break them
up into parts external to one another; that though
the elements of concrete duration permeate one
another, duration expressing itself in extensity
exhibits moments as distinct as the bodies
scattered in space. Is it surprising, then, that
between the moments of our life, when it has
been, so to speak, objectified, we set up a relation
analogous to the objective relation of causality,
and that an exchange, which again may be compared
to the phenomenon of endosmosis, takes
place between the dynamic idea of free effort and
the mathematical concept of necessary determination?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Though united in popular thought, the
ideas of free effort and necessary determination are
kept apart by physical science.</div>

<p>But the sundering of these two ideas is an accomplished
fact in the natural sciences. The physicist
may speak of <i>forces,</i> and even picture
their mode of action by analogy with an
inner effort, but he will never introduce
this hypothesis into a scientific explanation.
Even those who, with Faraday,
replace the extended atoms by dynamic
points, will treat the centres of force and the lines
of force mathematically, without troubling about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
force itself considered as an activity or an effort.
It thus comes to be understood that the relation
of external causality is purely mathematical, and
has no resemblance to the relation between psychical
force and the act which springs from it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They should be kept apart too by psychology.</div>

<p>It is now time to add that the relation of inner
causality is purely dynamic, and has no analogy
with the relation of two external phenomena
which condition one another.
For as the latter are capable of recurring
in a homogeneous space, their relation can be
expressed in terms of a law, whereas deep-seated
psychic states occur once in consciousness and will
never occur again. A careful analysis of the
psychological phenomenon led us to this conclusion
in the beginning: the study of the notions
of causality and duration, viewed in themselves,
has merely confirmed it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Freedom real but indefineable.</div>

<p>We can now formulate our conception of
freedom. Freedom is the relation of the concrete
self to the act which it performs. This
relation is indefinable, just because we
<i>are</i> free. For we can analyse a thing,
but not a process; we can break up extensity, but
not duration. Or, if we persist in analysing it,
we unconsciously transform the process into a
thing and duration into extensity. By the very
fact of breaking up concrete time we set out its
moments in homogeneous space; in place of the
doing we put the already done; and, as we have
begun by, so to speak, stereotyping the activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
of the self, we see spontaneity settle down into
inertia and freedom into necessity. Thus, any
positive definition of freedom will ensure the
victory of determinism.</p>

<p>Shall we define the free act by saying of this act,
when it is once done, that it might have been left
undone? But this assertion, as also its opposite,
implies the idea of an absolute equivalence between
concrete duration and its spatial symbol: and
as soon as we admit this equivalence, we are led
on, by the very development of the formula which
we have just set forth, to the most rigid determinism.</p>

<p>Shall we define the free act as "that which could
not be foreseen, even when all the conditions were
known in advance?" But to conceive all the
conditions as given, is, when dealing with concrete
duration, to place oneself at the very moment at
which the act is being performed. Or else it is
admitted that the matter of psychic duration can be
pictured symbolically in advance, which amounts,
as we said, to treating time as a homogeneous
medium, and to reasserting in new words the
absolute equivalence of duration with its symbol.
A closer study of this second definition of freedom
will thus bring us once more to determinism.</p>

<p>Shall we finally define the free act by saying
that it is not necessarily determined by its cause?
But either these words lose their meaning or we
understand by them that the same inner causes will
not always call forth the same effects. We admit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
then, that the psychic antecedents of a free act
can be repeated, that freedom is displayed in a
duration whose moments resemble one another,
and that time is a homogeneous medium, like
space. We shall thus be brought back to the idea
of an equivalence between duration and its spatial
symbol; and by pressing the definition of freedom
which we have laid down, we shall once more get
determinism out of it.</p>

<p>To sum up; every demand for explanation
in regard to freedom comes back, without our
suspecting it, to the following question: "Can
time be adequately represented by space?"
To which we answer: Yes, if you are dealing with
time flown; No, if you speak of time flowing.
Now, the free act takes place in time which is
flowing and not in time which has already flown.
Freedom is therefore a fact, and among the facts
which we observe there is none clearer. All the
difficulties of the problem, and the problem itself,
arise from the desire to endow duration with the
same attributes as extensity, to interpret a succession
by a simultaneity, and to express the idea
of freedom in a language into which it is obviously
untranslatable.</p>

<h4><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION</a></h4>


<div class="sidenote">Modern psychology holds hat we perceive things
through forms borrowed from our own constitution.</div>

<p>To sum up the foregoing discussion, we shall put
aside for the present Kant's terminology and also
his doctrine, to which we shall return
later, and we shall take the point of
view of common sense. Modern psychology
seems to us particularly concerned
to prove that we perceive things
through the medium of certain forms,
borrowed from our own constitution. This tendency
has become more and more marked since
Kant: while the German philosopher drew a
sharp line of separation between time and space,
the extensive and the intensive, and, as we should
say to-day, consciousness and external perception,
the empirical school, carrying analysis still
further, tries to reconstruct the extensive out of
the intensive, space out of duration, and externality
out of inner states. Physics, moreover,
comes in to complete the work of psychology in
this respect: it shows that, if we wish to forecast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
phenomena, we must make a clean sweep of the
impression which they produce on consciousness
and treat sensations as signs of reality, not as
reality itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But are not the states of the self perceived
through forms borrowed from the external world?</div>

<p>It seemed to us that there was good reason to
set ourselves the opposite problem and to ask
whether the most obvious states of the
ego itself, which we believe that we
grasp directly, are not mostly perceived
through the medium of certain
forms borrowed from the external world,
which thus gives us back what we have lent it.
<i>A priori</i> it seems fairly probable that this is what
happens. For, assuming that the forms alluded
to, into which we fit matter, come entirely from
the mind, it seems difficult to apply them constantly
to objects without the latter soon leaving
a mark on them: by then using these forms to
gain a knowledge of our own person we run the
risk of mistaking for the colouring of the self
the reflection of the frame in which we place it,
i.e. the external world. But one can go further
still and assert that forms applicable to things
cannot be entirely our own work, that they must
result from a compromise between matter and
mind, that if we give much to matter we probably
receive something from it, and that thus, when
we try to grasp ourselves after an excursion into
the external world, we no longer have our hands
free.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To understand the intensity, duration and
voluntary determination of psychic states,
we must eliminate the idea of space.</div>

<p>Now just as, in order to ascertain the real relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
of physical phenomena to one another, we
abstract whatever obviously clashes with
them in our way of perceiving and
thinking, so, in order to view the self
in its original purity, psychology ought
to eliminate or correct certain forms
which bear the obvious mark of the
external world. What are these forms? When
isolated from one another and regarded as so many
distinct units, psychic states seem to be more or
less <i>intense.</i> Next, looked at in their multiplicity,
they unfold in time and constitute <i>duration.</i>
Finally, in their relations to one another, and in so
far as a certain unity is preserved throughout their
multiplicity, they seem to <i>determine</i> one another.
Intensity, duration, voluntary determination,
these are the three ideas which had to be clarified
by ridding them of all that they owe to the intrusion
of the sensible world and, in a word, to the
obsession of the idea of space.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intensity is quality and not quantity
or magnitude.</div>

<p>Examining the first of these ideas, we found
that psychic phenomena were in themselves pure
quality or qualitative multiplicity, and
that, on the other hand, their cause
situated in space was quantity. In so
far as this quality becomes the sign of the
quantity and we suspect the presence of the
latter behind the former, we call it intensity.
The intensity of a simple state, therefore, is
not quantity but its qualitative sign. You will
find that it arises from a compromise between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
pure quality, which is the state of consciousness,
and pure quantity, which is necessarily space.
Now you give up this compromise without the least
scruple when you study external things, since you
then leave aside the forces themselves, assuming
that they exist, and consider only their measurable
and extended effects. Why, then, do you keep
to this hybrid concept when you analyse in its
turn the state of consciousness? If magnitude,
outside you, is never intensive, intensity, within
you, is never magnitude. It is through having
overlooked this that philosophers have been
compelled to distinguish two kinds of quantity,
the one extensive, the other intensive, without
ever succeeding in explaining what they had in
common or how the same words "increase" and
"decrease" could be used for things so unlike.
In the same way they are responsible for the exaggerations
of psychophysics, for as soon as the
power of increasing in magnitude is attributed
to sensation in any other than a metaphorical
sense, we are invited to find out by how much it
increases. And, although consciousness does not
measure intensive quantity, it does not follow that
science may not succeed indirectly in doing so,
if it be a magnitude. Hence, either a psychophysical
formula is possible or the intensity of a
simple psychic state is pure quality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our conscious states not a discreet multiplicity.</div>

<p>Turning then to the concept of multiplicity, we
saw that to construct a number we must first
have the intuition of a homogeneous medium,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
viz. space, in which terms distinct from one
another could be set out in line, and,
secondly, a process of permeation and organization
by which these units are dynamically
added together and form what we called
a qualitative multiplicity. It is owing to this
dynamic process that the units <i>get added,</i> but it is
because of their presence in space that they remain
<i>distinct.</i> Hence number or discrete multiplicity
also results from a compromise. Now,
when we consider material objects in themselves,
we give up this compromise, since we regard them
as impenetrable and divisible, i.e. endlessly distinct
from one another. Therefore, we must give it
up, too, when we study our own selves. It is
through having failed to do so that associationism
has made many mistakes, such as trying to reconstruct
a psychic state by the addition of distinct
states of consciousness, thus substituting the
symbol of the ego for the ego itself.</p>

<p>These preliminary considerations enabled us to
approach the principal object of this work, the
analysis of the ideas of duration and voluntary
determination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inner duration is a qualitative multiplicity.</div>

<p>What is duration within us? A qualitative
multiplicity, with no likeness to number; an
organic evolution which is yet not an
increasing quantity; a pure heterogeneity
within which there are no distinct
qualities. In a word, the moments of inner
duration are not external to one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">In the external we find not duration but simultaneity.</div>

<p>What duration is there existing outside us?
The present only, or, if we prefer the expression,
simultaneity. No doubt external things
change, but their moments do not
<i>succeed</i> one another, if we retain the
ordinary meaning of the word, except for a consciousness
which keeps them in mind. We observe
outside us at a given moment a whole
system of simultaneous positions; of the simultaneities
which have preceded them nothing
remains. To put duration in space is really to
contradict oneself and place succession within
simultaneity. Hence we must not say that external
things <i>endure,</i> but rather that there is in them
some inexpressible reason in virtue of which we
cannot examine them at successive moments of our
own duration without observing that they have
changed. But this change does not involve succession
unless the word is taken in a new meaning:
on this point we have noted the agreement of
science and common sense.</p>

<p>Thus in consciousness we find states which
succeed, without being distinguished from one
another; and in space simultaneities which,
without succeeding, are distinguished from one
another, in the sense that one has ceased to exist
when the other appears. Outside us, mutual
externality without succession; within us, succession
without mutual externality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The idea of a measurable time arises
from compromise between ideas of succession and
externality.</div>

<p>Here again a compromise comes in. To the
simultaneities, which constitute the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
world, and, although distinct, succeed one another
<i>for our consciousness,</i> we attribute
succession <i>in themselves.</i> Hence the
idea that things <i>endure</i> as we do ourselves
and that time may be brought
within space. But while our consciousness
thus introduces succession into external things,
inversely these things themselves externalize the
successive moments of our inner duration in
relation to one another. The simultaneities of
physical phenomena, absolutely distinct in the
sense that the one has ceased to be when the other
takes place, cut up into portions, which are also
distinct and external to one another, an inner life
in which succession implies interpenetration, just
as the pendulum of a clock cuts up into distinct
fragments and spreads out, so to speak, lengthwise,
the dynamic and undivided tension of the
spring. Thus, by a real process of endosmosis
we get the mixed idea of a measurable time,
which is space in so far as it is homogeneity, and
duration in so far as it is succession, that is to
say, at bottom, the contradictory idea of succession
in simultaneity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">As science eliminates duration from
the outer, philosophy must eliminate space from the
inner world.</div>

<p>Now, these two elements, extensity and duration,
science tears asunder when it undertakes
the close study of external things.
For we have pointed out that science
retains nothing of duration but simultaneity,
and nothing of motion itself
position of the moving body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
i.e. immobility. A very sharp separation is here
made and space gets the best of it.</p>

<p>Therefore the same separation will have to be
made again, but this time to the advantage of
duration, when inner phenomena are studied,
&mdash;not inner phenomena once developed, to be sure,
or after the discursive reason has separated them
and set them out in a homogeneous medium in
order to understand them, but inner phenomena
in their developing, and in so far as they make up,
by their interpenetration, the continuous evolution
of a free person. Duration, thus restored to its
original purity, will appear as a wholly qualitative
multiplicity, an absolute heterogeneity
of elements which pass over into one another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The neglect to separate extensity and
duration leads one party to deny freedom
and the other to define it.</div>

<p>Now it is because they have neglected to make
this necessary separation that one party has been
led to deny freedom and the other to
define it, and thereby, involuntarily,
to deny it too. They ask in fact
whether the act could or could not be
foreseen, the whole of its conditions
being given; and whether they assert it or deny it,
they admit that this totality of conditions could
be conceived as given in advance: which amounts,
as we have shown, to treating duration as a homogeneous
thing and intensities as magnitudes.
They will either say that the act is <i>determined</i> by
its conditions, without perceiving that they are
playing on the double sense of the word causality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
and that they are thus giving to duration at the
same time two forms which are mutually exclusive.
Or else they will appeal to the principle of
the conservation of energy, without asking whether
this principle is equally applicable to the moments
of the external world, which are equivalent to one
another, and to the moments of a living and
conscious being, which acquire a richer and richer
content. In whatever way, in a word, freedom is
viewed, it cannot be denied except on condition of
identifying time with space; it cannot be defined
except on condition of demanding that space should
adequately represent time; it cannot be argued
about in one sense or the other except on condition
of previously confusing succession and simultaneity.
All determinism will thus be refuted by
experience, but every attempt to define freedom
will open the way to determinism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This separation favourable to physical
science, but against the interests of language and
social life.</div>

<p>Inquiring then why this separation of duration
and extensity, which science carries out so naturally
in the external world, demands such
an effort and rouses so much repugnance
when it is a question of inner states,
we were not long in perceiving the reason.
The main object of science is to forecast
and measure: now we cannot forecast physical
phenomena except on condition that we assume
that they do not <i>endure</i> as we do; and, on the
other hand, the only thing we are able to measure
is space. Hence the breach here comes about of
itself between quality and quantity, between true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
duration and pure extensity. But when we turn
to our conscious states, we have everything to
gain by keeping up the illusion through which
we make them share in the reciprocal externality
of outer things, because this distinctness, and at
the same time this solidification, enables us to
give them fixed names in spite of their instability,
and distinct ones in spite of their interpenetration.
It enables us to objectify them, to throw them
out into the current of social life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hence two different selves:
(1) the fundamental self; (2) its spatial
and social representation: only the former
is free.</div>

<p>Hence there are finally two different selves,
one of which is, as it were, the external projection
of the other, its spatial and, so to speak,
social representation. We reach the
former by deep introspection, which
leads us to grasp our inner states as
living things, constantly <i>becoming,</i> as
states not amenable to measure, which
permeate one another and of which the succession
in duration has nothing in common with juxtaposition
in homogeneous space. But the moments
at which we thus grasp ourselves are rare,
and that is just why we are rarely free. The
greater part of the time we live outside ourselves,
hardly perceiving anything of ourselves but
our own ghost, a colourless shadow which pure
duration projects into homogeneous space. Hence
our life unfolds in space rather than in time;
we live for the external world rather than for
ourselves; we speak rather than think; we
"are acted" rather than act ourselves. To act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
freely is to recover possession of oneself, and to
get back into pure duration.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Kant clung to freedom, but put the self
which is free outside both space and time.</div>

<p>Kant's great mistake was to take time as a
homogeneous medium. He did not notice that
real duration is made up of moments
inside one another, and that when it
seems to assume the form of a homogeneous
whole, it is because it gets expressed
in space. Thus the very distinction which he
makes between space and time amounts at bottom
to confusing time with space, and the symbolical
representation of the ego with the ego itself. He
thought that consciousness was incapable of
perceiving psychic states otherwise than by
juxtaposition, forgetting that a medium in which
these states are set side by side and distinguished
from one another is of course space, and not
duration. He was thereby led to believe that
the same states can recur in the depths of consciousness,
just as the same physical phenomena
are repeated in space; this at least is what he
implicitly admitted when he ascribed to the
causal relation the same meaning and the same
function in the inner as in the outer world. Thus
freedom was made into an incomprehensible
fact. And yet, owing to his unlimited though
unconscious confidence in this inner perception
whose scope he tried to restrict, his belief in
freedom remained unshakable. He therefore
raised it to the sphere of noumena; and as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
confused duration with space, he made this
genuine free self, which is indeed outside space,
into a self which is supposed to be outside duration
too, and therefore out of the reach of our faculty of
knowledge. But the truth is that we perceive this
self whenever, by a strenuous effort of reflection,
we turn our eyes from the shadow which follows us
and retire into ourselves. Though we generally
live and act outside our own person, in space
rather than in duration, and though by this
means we give a handle to the law of causality,
which binds the same effects to the same causes, we
can nevertheless always get back into pure duration,
of which the moments are internal and heterogeneous
to one another, and in which a cause
cannot repeat its effect since it will never repeat
itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kant regarded both space and time as homogeneous.</div>

<p>In this very confusion of true duration with
its symbol both the strength and the weakness
of Kantianism reside. Kant imagines
on the one side "things in themselves,"
and on the other a homogeneous Time
and Space, through which the "things in themselves,"
are refracted: thus are supposed to
arise on the one hand the phenomenal self&mdash;a self
which consciousness perceives&mdash;and, on the other,
external objects. Time and space on this view
would not be any more in us than outside us;
the very distinction of outside and inside would
be the work of time and space. This doctrine has
the advantage of providing our empirical thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
with a solid foundation, and of guaranteeing that
phenomena, as phenomena, are adequately knowable.
Indeed, we might set up these phenomena
as absolute and do without the incomprehensible
"things in themselves," were it not that the Practical
Reason, the revealer of duty, came in, like the
Platonic reminiscence, to warn us that the "thing
in itself" exists, invisible but present. The controlling
factor in the whole of this theory is the
very sharp distinction between the matter of
consciousness and its form, between the homogeneous
and the heterogeneous, and this vital distinction
would probably never have been made
unless time also had been regarded as a medium
indifferent to what fills it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But if time, as duration, were homogeneous,
science could deal with it.</div>

<p>But if time, as immediate consciousness perceives
it, were, like space, a homogeneous medium,
science would be able to deal with it,
as it can with space. Now we have
tried to prove that duration, as duration,
and motion, as motion, elude the grasp of
mathematics: of time everything slips through
its fingers but simultaneity, and of movement
everything but immobility. This is what the
Kantians and even their opponents do not seem
to have perceived: in this so-called phenomenal
world, which, we are told, is a world cut out for
scientific knowledge, all the relations which cannot
be translated into simultaneity, i.e. into space,
are scientifically unknowable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">And freedom would be incomprehensible. Kant's solution.</div>

<p>In the second place, in a duration assumed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
be homogeneous, the same states could occur
over again, causality would imply necessary
determination, and all freedom
would become incomprehensible. Such,
indeed, is the result to which the Critique
of Pure Reason leads. But instead of concluding
from this that real duration is heterogeneous,
which, by clearing up the second difficulty, would
have called his attention to the first, Kant preferred
to put freedom outside time and to raise
an impassable barrier between the world of
phenomena, which he hands over root and branch
to our understanding, and the world of things
in themselves, which he forbids us to enter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How corrected by taking real duration into account.</div>

<p>But perhaps this distinction is too sharply
drawn and perhaps the barrier is easier to cross
than he supposed. For if perchance
the moments of real duration, perceived
by an attentive consciousness, permeated
one another instead of lying
side by side, and if these moments formed in
relation to one another a heterogeneity within
which the idea of necessary determination lost
every shred of meaning, then the self grasped
by consciousness would be a free cause, we should
have absolute knowledge of ourselves, and, on
the other hand, just because this absolute constantly
commingles with phenomena and, while
filling itself with them, permeates them, these
phenomena themselves would not be as amenable
as is claimed to mathematical reasoning,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">With Kant, we assume a homogeneous
space, the intuition of which is peculiar to
man and prepares the way for social life.</div>

<p>So we have assumed the existence of a homogeneous
Space and, with Kant, distinguished this
space from the matter which fills it.
With him we have admitted that homogeneous
space is a "form of our sensibility":
and we understand by this simply
that other minds, e.g. those of animals,
social life, although they perceive objects, do not
distinguish them so clearly either from one another
or from themselves. This intuition of a homogeneous
medium, an intuition peculiar to man, enables
us to externalize our concepts in relation to one
another, reveals to us the objectivity of things,
and thus, in two ways, on the one hand by getting
everything ready for language, and on the other
by showing us an external world, quite distinct
from ourselves, in the perception of which all
minds have a common share, foreshadows and
prepares the way for social life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">But if concrete duration is heterogeneous,
the relation of psychic state to act is unique and the
act is rightly judged free.</div>

<p>Over against this homogeneous space we have
put the self as perceived by an attentive consciousness,
a living self, whose states,
at once undistinguished and unstable,
cannot <i>be</i> separated without changing
their nature, and cannot receive a fixed
form or be expressed in words without
becoming public property. How could
this self, which distinguishes external objects so
sharply and represents them so easily by means of
symbols, withstand the temptation to introduce the
same distinctions into its own life and to replace the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
interpenetration of its psychic states, their wholly
qualitative multiplicity, by a numerical plurality
of terms which are distinguished from one another,
set side by side, and expressed by means of words?
In place of a heterogeneous duration whose
moments permeate one another, we thus get a
homogeneous time whose moments are strung on a
spatial line. In place of an inner life whose successive
phases, each unique of its kind, cannot
be expressed in the fixed terms of language, we
get a self which can be artificially reconstructed,
and simple psychic states which can be added
to and taken from one another just like the letters
of the alphabet in forming words. Now, this
must not be thought to be a mode of symbolical
representation only, for immediate intuition and
discursive thought are one in concrete reality,
and the very mechanism by which we only meant
at first to explain our conduct will end by also
controlling it. Our psychic states, separating
then from each other, will get solidified; between
our ideas, thus crystallized, and our external
movements we shall witness permanent associations
being formed; and little by little, as our consciousness
thus imitates the process by which nervous
matter procures reflex actions, automatism will
cover over freedom.<a name="FNanchor_10_38" id="FNanchor_10_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_38" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is just at this point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
that the associationists and the determinists come
in on the one side, and the Kantians on the other.
As they look at only the commonest aspect of
our conscious life, they perceive clearly marked
states, which can recur in time like physical
phenomena, and to which the law of causal determination
applies, if we wish, in the same sense as
it does to nature. As, on the other hand, the
medium in which these psychic states are set side
by side exhibits parts external to one another,
in which the same facts seem capable of being
repeated, they do not hesitate to make time a
homogeneous medium and treat it as space.
Henceforth all difference between duration and
extensity, succession and simultaneity, is abolished:
the only thing left is to turn freedom out of doors,
or, if you cannot entirely throw off your traditional
respect for it, to escort it with all due ceremony
up to the supratemporal domain of "things in themselves,"
whose mysterious threshold your consciousness
cannot cross. But, in our view, there is a third
course which might be taken, namely, to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
ourselves back in thought to those moments of our
life when we made some serious decision, moments
unique of their kind, which will never be repeated
&mdash;any more than the past phases in the history of a
nation will ever come back again. We should see
that if these past states cannot be adequately
expressed in words or artificially reconstructed
by a juxtaposition of simpler states, it is because
in their dynamic unity and wholly qualitative
multiplicity they are phases of our real and concrete
duration, a heterogeneous duration and a
living one. We should see that, if our action
was pronounced by us to be free, it is because
the relation of this action to the state from which
it issued could not be expressed by a law, this
psychic state being unique of its kind and unable
ever to occur again. We should see, finally, that
the very idea of necessary determination here
loses every shred of meaning, that there cannot be
any question either of foreseeing the act before
it is performed or of reasoning about the possibility
of the contrary action once the deed is done, for
to have all the conditions given is, in concrete
duration, to place oneself at the very moment of
the act and not to foresee it. But we should also
understand the illusion which makes the one party
think that they are compelled to deny freedom,
and the others that they must define it. It is
because the transition is made by imperceptible
steps from concrete duration, whose elements permeate
one another, to symbolical duration, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
moments are set side by side, and consequently
from free activity to conscious automatism. It
is because, although we are free whenever we are
willing to get back into ourselves, it seldom
happens that we are willing. It is because, finally,
even in the cases where the action is freely performed,
we cannot reason about it without setting
out its conditions externally to one another,
therefore in space and no longer in pure duration.
The problem of freedom has thus sprung from a
misunderstanding: it has been to the moderns what
the paradoxes of the Eleatics were to the ancients,
and, like these paradoxes, it has its origin in
the illusion through which we confuse succession
and simultaneity, duration and extensity, quality
and quantity.</p>

which may be compared to reflex movements, and he has
restricted freedom to moments of crisis. But he does not
seem to have noticed that the process of our free activity goes
on, as it were, unknown to ourselves, in the obscure depths of
our consciousness at every moment of duration, that the very
feeling of duration comes from this source, and that without
this heterogeneous and continuous duration, in which our self
evolves, there would be no moral crisis. The study, even the
close study, of a given free action will thus not settle the problem
of freedom. The whole series of our heterogeneous
states of consciousness must be taken into consideration. In
other words, it is in a close analysis of the idea of duration
that the key to the problem must be sought.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
