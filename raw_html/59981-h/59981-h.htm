<p><span class="smcap">Dear Publisher</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>You have asked me to furnish you with data concerning
my life and literary activities. Permit me
to repeat what I have already told my French publishers
in answer to a similar request.</p>

<p>I am a descendant of an ancient noble family which
has given to Russia a considerable number of prominent
names, both in the field of statesmanship and
in the realm of art. In the latter, two poets are especially
well-known, Anna Petrovna Bunina and Vasili
Zhookovski, one of the shining lights of Russian Literature,
the son of Afanasi Bunin and a Turkish captive,
Salma.</p>

<p>All my ancestors had always been connected with
the people and with the land; they were landed proprietors.
My parents were also land-owners, who possessed
estates in Central Asia, in the fertile fringe of
the steppes, where the ancient Tsars of Moscow had
created settlements of colonists from various Russian
territories, to serve as protectors of their Kingdom
against the incursions of the Southern Tartars.
Thanks to this, it was here that the richest Russian
language developed, and from here have come nearly
all the greatest Russian writers, with Turgenev and
Tolstoy at their head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>I was born in 1870, in the town of Voronezh, and
passed my childhood and youth almost entirely in the
country, on my father&#8217;s estates. As a boy, I was
deeply affected by the death of my little sister, and
passed through a violent religious crisis, which left,
however, no morbid traces whatsoever in my soul.</p>

<p>I also had a passion for painting, which, I believe,
has manifested itself in my literary works. I began
to write both verse and prose rather early in my
life. My first appearance in print was likewise at an
early date.</p>

<p>When publishing my books, I nearly always made
them up of prose and verse, both original and translated
from the English. If classified according to their
literary varieties, these books would constitute some
four volumes of original poems, approximately two of
translations, and six volumes or so of prose.</p>

<p>The attention of the critics was very quickly attracted
to me. Later on my books were more than
once granted the highest award within the gift of the
Russian Academy of Sciences&mdash;the prize bearing Pushkin&#8217;s
name. In 1909 that Academy elected me one of
the twelve Honorary Academicians, who correspond
to the French Immortals, and of whom Lyof Tolstoy
was one at that time.</p>

<p>For a long time, however, I did not enjoy any wide
popularity, owing to many reasons: for years, after
my first stories had appeared in print, I wrote and
published almost nothing but verse; I took no part
in politics and, in my works, never touched upon questions
connected with politics; I belonged to no particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
literary school, called myself neither decadent, nor
symbolist, nor romantic, nor naturalist, donned no
mask of any kind, and hung out no flamboyant flag.
Yet, during these last stormy decades in Russia, the
fate of a Russian writer has frequently depended upon
such questions as: Is he an opponent of the existing
form of Government? Has he come from &#8220;the people&#8221;?
Has he been in prison, in exile? Or, does he
take part in the literary hubbub, in the &#8220;literary revolution,&#8221;
which&mdash;merely in imitation of Western Europe&mdash;went
on during those years in Russia, together
with a rapid development of public life in the towns, of
new critics and readers from among the young bourgeoisie
and the youthful proletariat, who were as ignorant
in the understanding of art as they were avid
of imaginary novelties and all kinds of sensations.
Besides, I mixed very little in literary society. I lived
a great deal in the country, and traveled extensively
both in Russia and abroad: in Italy, in Sicily, in Turkey,
in the Balkans, in Greece, in Syria, in Palestine,
in Egypt, in Algeria, in Tunisia, in the tropics. I
strove &#8220;to view the face of the earth and leave thereon
the impress of my soul,&#8221; to quote Saadi, and I have
been interested in philosophic, religious, ethical and
historical problems.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago I published my novel &#8220;The Village.&#8221;
This was the first of a whole series of works
which depicted the Russian character without adornment,
the Russian soul, its peculiar complexity, its
depths, both bright and dark, though almost invariably
tragic. On the part of the Russian critics and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
among the Russian intellectuals, where &#8220;the people&#8221;
had nearly always been idealized, owing to numerous
Russian conditions <i>sui generis</i>, and, of late, merely because
of the ignorance of the people, or for political
reasons,&mdash;these &#8220;merciless&#8221; works of mine called forth
passionate controversies and, as a final result, brought
me what is called success, success strengthened still
further by my subsequent works.</p>

<p>During those years I felt my hand growing firmer
every hour; I felt that the powers which had accumulated
and matured in me, passionately and boldly,
demanded an outlet. Just then the World War broke
out and afterwards the Russian Revolution came. I
was not among those who were taken unawares by
these events, for whom their extent and beastliness
were a complete surprise; yet the reality has surpassed
all my expectations.</p>

<p>What the Russian Revolution turned into very soon,
none will comprehend who has not seen it. This spectacle
was utterably unbearable to any one who had
not ceased to be a man in the image and likeness of
God, and all who had a chance to flee, fled from Russia.
Flight was sought by the vast majority of the
most prominent Russian writers, primarily, because
in Russia there awaited them either senseless death at
the hands of the first chance miscreant, drunk with
licentiousness and impunity, with rapine, with wine,
with blood, with cocaine; or an ignominious existence
as a slave in the darkness, teeming with lice, in rags,
amid epidemic diseases, exposed to cold, to hunger, to
the primitive torments of the stomach, and absorbed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that single, degrading concern, under the eternal
threat of being thrown out of his mendicant&#8217;s den into
the street, of being sent to the barracks to clean up
the soldiers&#8217; filth, of being&mdash;without any reason whatever,&mdash;arrested,
beaten, abused, of seeing one&#8217;s own
mother, sister or wife violated&mdash;and yet having to
preserve utter silence, for in Russia they cut out
tongues for the slightest word of freedom.</p>

<p>I left Moscow in May, 1918, lived in the South of
Russia (which passed back and forth from the hands
of the &#8220;Whites&#8221; into those of the &#8220;Reds&#8221;) and then
emigrated in February, 1919, after having drained to
the dregs the cup of unspeakable suffering and vain
hopes. For too long I had believed that the eyes of
the Christian world would be opened, that it would be
horrified at its own heartlessness, and would extend to
us a helping hand in the name of God, of humanity
and of its own safety.</p>

<p>Some critics have called me cruel and gloomy. I
do not think that this definition is fair and accurate.
But of course, I have derived much honey and still
more bitterness from my wanderings throughout the
world, and my observations of human life. I had felt
a vague fear for the fate of Russia, when I was depicting
her. Is it my fault that reality, the reality in
which Russia has been living for more than five years
now, has justified my apprehensions beyond all measure;
that those pictures of mine which had once upon
a time appeared black, and wide of the truth, even in
the eyes of Russian people, have become <i>prophetic</i>, as
some call them now? &#8220;Woe unto thee, Babylon!&#8221;&mdash;those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
terrible words of the Apocalypse kept persistently
ringing in my soul when I wrote &#8220;The Brothers&#8221;
and conceived &#8220;The Gentleman from San Francisco,&#8221;
only a few months before the War, when I had a presentiment
of all its horror, and of the abysses which
have since been laid bare in our present-day civilization.
Is it my fault, that here again my presentiments
have not deceived me?</p>

<p>However, does it mean that my soul is filled only
with darkness and despair? Not at all. &#8220;As the hart
panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
after thee, O God!&#8221;</p>

<h3>I</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE great-grandfather of the Krasoffs, known by
the manor-house servants under the nickname
of &#8220;The Gipsy,&#8221; was hunted with wolf-hounds
by Cavalry Captain Durnovo. The Gipsy had lured
his lord-and-master&#8217;s mistress away from him. Durnovo
gave orders that The Gipsy should be taken out
into the fields and placed on a hillock. Then he himself
went out there with a pack of hounds and shouted
&#8220;Tallyho! Go for him!&#8221; The Gipsy, who was sitting
there in a state of stupor, started to run. But there
is no use in running away from wolf-hounds.</p>

<p>The grandfather of the Krasoffs, for some reason or
other, was given a letter of enfranchisement. He
went off with his family to the town&mdash;and soon distinguished
himself by becoming a famous thief. He
hired a tiny hovel in the Black Suburb for his wife
and set her to weaving lace for sale, while he, in
company with a petty burgher named Byelokopytoff,
roamed about the province robbing churches. At the
end of a couple of years he was caught. But at his
trial he bore himself in such fashion that his replies to
the judges were current for a long time thereafter. He
stood before them, it appears, in a velveteen kaftan,
with a silver watch and goat-hide boots, making insolent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
play with his cheek-bones and his eyes and, in
the most respectful manner, confessing every one of his
innumerable crimes, even the most insignificant: &#8220;Yes,
sir. Just so, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The father of the Krasoffs was a petty huckster.
He roved about the county, lived for a time in
Durnovka, set up a pot-house and a little shop, failed,
took to drink, returned to the town, and soon died.
After serving for a while in shops his sons, Tikhon and
Kuzma, who were almost of an age, also took to peddling.
They drove about in a peasant cart which had
a carved front and a roofed, shop-like arrangement in
the middle, and shouted in doleful tones: &#8220;Wo-omen,
here&#8217;s merchandise! Wo-omen, here&#8217;s merchandise!&#8221;</p>

<p>The merchandise consisted of small mirrors, cheap
soap, rings, thread, kerchiefs, needles, cracknels&mdash;these
in the covered shop. The open-body cart contained
everything they gathered in: dead cats, eggs, heavy
linen, crash, rags. But one day, after having thus
travelled about for the space of several years, the
brothers came near cutting each other&#8217;s throats&mdash;in a
dispute over the division of the profits, rumour averred&mdash;and
separated to avoid a catastrophe. Kuzma hired
himself to a drover. Tikhon took over a small posting-house
on the metalled highway of Vorgol, five
versts<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> from Durnovka, and opened a dram-shop and
a tiny &#8220;popular&#8221; shop.&mdash;&#8220;I deal in small wears tea
shugar tubako sigars and so furth.&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">BY the time Tikhon Hitch was about forty years
of age his beard resembled silver with patterns
of black enamel. But he was handsome and
tall, with a fine figure, as before. He was austere and
swarthy of face, slightly pock-marked, with broad, lean
shoulders; authoritative and abrupt of speech, quick
and supple in his movements. Only&mdash;his eyebrows had
begun to come closer together and his eyes to flash
more frequently and more sharply than before. Business
demanded it!</p>

<p>Indefatigably he followed up the rural police on
those dull autumnal days when taxes are collected and
forced sale follows forced sale. Unweariedly he bought
standing grain on the stalk from the landed proprietors
and took land from them and from the peasants, in
small parcels, not scorning even half a meadow. He
lived for a long time with his dumb cook&mdash;&#8220;A dumb
woman can&#8217;t betray anything with her chatter!&#8221;&mdash;and
had by her one child, whom she overlay and crushed in
her sleep, after which he married an elderly waiting-maid
of old Princess Schakhovoy. And on marrying
and receiving the dowry he &#8220;finished off&#8221; the last scion
of the impoverished Durnovo family, a fat, affable
young nobleman, bald at twenty-five, but possessed of
a magnificent chestnut beard. And the peasants fairly
grunted with pride when Tikhon took possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Durnovo estate&mdash;for almost the whole of Durnovka
consisted of Krasoffs!</p>

<p>They <i>sh</i>-ed and <i>oh</i>-ed, also, over the way in which
he had cunningly contrived not to ruin himself. He
bargained and bought, went to the estate almost every
day, kept watch with the eye of a vulture over every
hand&#8217;s breadth of the land. They uttered admiring exclamations
and said: &#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s nothing to be done
with us devils by kindness, you know! There&#8217;s a master
for you! You couldn&#8217;t have one more just!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tikhon Ilitch dealt with them in the same spirit.
When he was in an amiable mood he read them their
lesson thus: &#8220;It&#8217;s all right to live&mdash;but not to squander.
I shall pluck you if I get the chance! I shall
bring you back. But I shall be just. I&#8217;m a Russian
man, brother.&#8221; When in an evil mood, he would say
curtly, with eyes blazing: &#8220;Pigs! There is not a
juster man in the world than I am!&#8221; &#8220;Pigs, all right&mdash;but
that&#8217;s not me,&#8221; the peasant would think, averting
his eyes from that gaze. And he would mumble submissively:
&#8220;Oh, Lord, don&#8217;t we know it?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, you
know it, but you have forgotten. I don&#8217;t want your
property gratis, but bear this in mind: I won&#8217;t give you
a scrap of what&#8217;s mine! There&#8217;s that brother of mine:
he&#8217;s a rascal, a toper, but I would help him if he came
and implored me. I call God as my witness that I
would help him! But coddle him&mdash;! No, take note
of that: I do no coddling. I&#8217;m no brainless Little
Russian, brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>And Nastasya Petrovna, who walked like a duck,
with her toes turned inward, and waddled, thanks to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
incessant pregnancies which always ended up with dead
girl-babies&mdash;Nastasya Petrovna, a yellow, puffy woman
with scanty whitish-blond hair, would groan and back
him up: &#8220;Okh, you are a simpleton, in my opinion!
Why do you bother with him, with that stupid man?
Is he a fit associate for you? You just knock some
sense into him; &#8217;twill do him no harm. Look at the
way he&#8217;s straddling with his legs&mdash;as if he were a bokhar
of emir!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> She was &#8220;terribly fond&#8221; of pigs and
fowls, and Tikhon Ilitch began to fatten sucking pigs,
turkey chicks, hens, and geese. But his ruling passion
was amassing grain. In autumn, alongside his house,
which stood with one side turned toward the highway
and the other toward the posting-station, the creaking
of wheels arose in a groan; the wagon trains turned in
from above and below. And in the farmyard horse-traders,
peddlers, chicken-vendors, cracknel peddlers,
scythe-vendors, and pilgrims passed the night. Every
moment a pulley was squeaking&mdash;now on the door of
the dram-shop, where Nastasya Petrovna bustled
about; now on the approach to the shop, a dark, dirty
place, reeking of soap, herrings, rank tobacco, gingerbread
flavoured with peppermint, horse-collars, and
kerosene. And incessantly there rang out in the dram-shop:</p>

<p>&#8220;U-ukh! Your vodka is strong, Petrovna! It has
knocked me in the head, devil take it!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&#8220;&#8217;Twill make your mouth water, my dear man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there snuff in your vodka?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, you fool yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the shop the crowd was even more dense.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ilitch, weigh me out a pound of ham.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This year, brother, I&#8217;m so well stocked with ham&mdash;so
well stocked, thank God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the price?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis cheap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, proprietor, have you good tar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better tar than your grandfather had at his wedding,
my good man!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the price?&#8221;</p>

<p>And it seemed as if, at the Krasoffs&#8217;, there were never
any other conversation than that about the prices of
things: What&#8217;s the price of ham, what&#8217;s the price
of boards, what&#8217;s the price of groats, what&#8217;s the price
of tar?</p>




<h3>III</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE abandonment of his hope of having children
and the closing of the dram-shops by the government
were great events. Tikhon visibly
aged when there no longer remained any doubt that he
was not to become a father. At first he jested about
it: &#8220;No sir, I&#8217;ll get my way. Without children a
man is not a man. He&#8217;s only so-so&mdash;a sort of spot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
missed in the sowing.&#8221; But later on he was assailed by
terror. What did it mean? one overlay her child, the
other bore only dead children.</p>

<p>And the period of Nastasya Petrovna&#8217;s last pregnancy
had been a difficult time. Tikhon Ilitch suffered
and raged: Nastasya Petrovna prayed in secret,
wept in secret, and was a pitiful sight when, of a night
by the light of the shrine-lamp, she slipped out of bed,
assuming that her husband was asleep, and began with
difficulty to kneel down, touch her brow to the floor as
she whispered her prayers, gaze with anguish at the
holy pictures, and rise from her knees painfully, like an
old woman. Hitherto, before going to bed, she had
donned slippers and dressing-gown, said her prayers indifferently,
and, as she prayed, taken pleasure in running
over the list of her acquaintances and abusing
them. Now there stood before the holy picture a
simple peasant woman in a short cotton petticoat, white
woolen stockings, and a chemise which did not cover
her neck and arms, fat like those of an old person.</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch had never, from his childhood, liked
shrine-lamps, although he had never been willing to
confess it, even to himself; nor did he like their uncertain
churchly light. All his life there had remained
impressed upon his mind that November night when,
in the tiny lop-sided hut in the Black Suburb, a shrine-lamp
had also burned, peaceful and sweetly-sad, the
shadows of its chains barely moving, while everything
around was deathly silent; and on the bench below the
holy pictures his father lay motionless with eyes closed,
his sharp nose raised, his big purplish-waxen hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
crossed on his breast; while by his side, just beyond the
tiny window curtained with its red rag, the conscripts
marched past with wildly mournful songs and shouts,
their accordions squealing discordantly.&mdash;Now the
shrine-lamp burned uninterruptedly, and Tikhon Ilitch
felt as if Nastasya Petrovna were carrying on some
sort of secret affair with uncanny powers.</p>

<p>A number of book-hawkers from the Vladimir government
halted by the posting-house to bait their
horses&mdash;with the result that there made its appearance
in the house a &#8220;New Complete Oracle and Magician,
which foretells the future in answer to questions; with
Supplement setting forth the easiest methods of telling
fortunes by cards, beans, and coffee.&#8221; And of an
evening Nastasya Petrovna would put on her spectacles,
mould a little ball of wax, and set to rolling it
over the circles of the &#8220;Oracle.&#8221; And Tikhon Ilitch
would look on, with sidelong glances. But all the
answers turned out to be either insulting, menacing, or
senseless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does my husband love me?&#8221; Nastasya Petrovna
would inquire.</p>

<p>And the &#8220;Oracle&#8221; replied: &#8220;He loves you as a dog
loves a stick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many children shall I have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are fated to die: the field must be cleared
of weeds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Tikhon Ilitch would say: &#8220;Give it here. I&#8217;11
have a try.&#8221; And he would propound the question:
&#8220;Ought I to start a law-suit with a person whose name
I won&#8217;t mention?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>But he, likewise, got nonsense for an answer:
&#8220;Count the teeth in your mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>One day Tikhon Ilitch, when he glanced into the
kitchen, saw his wife beside the cradle in which lay the
cook&#8217;s baby. A speckled chicken which was wandering
along the window ledge, pecking and catching flies,
tapped the glass with its beak; but she sat there on the
sleeping-board and, while she rocked the cradle, sang
in a pitiful quaver:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;Where lieth my little child?</div>
<div class="verse">Where is his tiny bed?</div>
<div class="verse">He is in the lofty chamber,</div>
<div class="verse">In the painted cradle gay.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Let no one come there to us,</div>
<div class="verse">Or knock at the chamber door!</div>
<div class="verse">He hath fallen asleep, he resteth</div>
<div class="verse">Beneath the canopy dark,</div>
<div class="verse">Covered with flowered silk....&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And Tikhon Ilitch&#8217;s face underwent such a change at
that moment that Nastasya Petrovna, as she glanced
at him, experienced no confusion, felt no fear, but only
fell a-weeping and, brushing away her tears, said
softly: &#8220;Take me away, for Christ&#8217;s dear sake, to the
Holy Man.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tikhon Ilitch took her to Zadonsk. But as he
went he was thinking in his heart that God would certainly
chastise him because, in the bustle and cares
of life, he went to church only for the service on Easter
Day, and otherwise lived as if he were a Tatar. Sacrilegious
thoughts also wormed their way into his head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
He kept comparing himself to the parents of the
Saints, who likewise had long remained childless. This
was not clever&mdash;but he had long since come to perceive
that there dwelt within him some one who was
more stupid than himself. Before his departure he
had received a letter from Mount Athos: &#8220;Most God-loving
Benefactor, Tikhon Ilitch! Peace be unto you,
and salvation, the blessing of the Lord and the honourable
Protection of the All-Sung Mother of God, from
her earthly portion, the holy Mount Athos! I have
had the happiness of hearing about your good works,
and that with love you apportion your mite for the
building and adornment of God&#8217;s temples and monastic
cells. With the years my hovel has reached such a
dilapidated condition....&#8221; And Tikhon Ilitch sent a
ten-ruble banknote to be used for repairing the hovel.
The time was long past when he had believed, with
ingenuous pride, that rumours concerning him had actually
reached as far as Mount Athos, and he knew
well enough that far too many hovels on Mount Athos
had become dilapidated. Nevertheless, he sent the
money.</p>

<p>But even that proved of no avail.</p>

<p>The government monopoly of the liquor trade acted
as salt on a raw wound. When the hope of children
failed him utterly, the thought occurred ever more frequently
to Tikhon Ilitch: &#8220;What&#8217;s the object of all
this convict hard labour, anyway? devil take it!&#8221; And
his hands began to tremble with rage, his brows to contract
and arch themselves, his upper lip to quiver&mdash;especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
when he uttered the phrase which was incessantly
in his mouth: &#8220;Bear in mind&mdash;!&#8221; He continued,
as before, to affect youthfulness&mdash;wore dandyfied
soft boots and an embroidered shirt fastened at
one side, Russian style, under a double-breasted short
coat. But his beard grew ever whiter, more sparse,
more tangled.</p>

<p>And that summer, as if with malicious intent, turned
out to be hot and dry. The rye was absolutely ruined.
It became a pleasure to whine to the buyers. &#8220;I&#8217;m
closing down my business&mdash;shutting up shop!&#8221; Tikhon
Ilitch said with satisfaction, referring to his liquor
trade. He enunciated every word clearly. &#8220;The
Minister has a fancy for going into trade on his own
account, to be sure!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okh, just look at you!&#8221; groaned Nastasya Petrovna.
&#8220;You&#8217;re calling down bad luck. You&#8217;ll be chased off
to a place so far that even the crows don&#8217;t drag their
bones there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; Tikhon Ilitch interrupted
her brusquely, with a frown. &#8220;No, ma&#8217;am!
You can&#8217;t gag every mouth with a kerchief!&#8221; And
again, enunciating even more sharply, he addressed the
customer: &#8220;And the rye, sir, is a joy to behold!
Bear that in mind&mdash;a joy to everybody! By night,
sir, if you&#8217;ll believe it&mdash;by night, sir, even then it can
be seen. You step out on the threshold and gaze at
the fields by the light of the moon: it&#8217;s as sparse as the
hair on a bald head. You go out and stare: the fields
are shining-naked!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">DURING the Fast of St. Peter Tikhon Ilitch spent
four days in the town at the Fair and got
still more out of tune, thanks to his worries,
the heat, and sleepless nights. Ordinarily he set out for
the Fair with great gusto. At twilight the carts were
greased and heaped with hay. Behind one, that in
which the manager of his farm rode, were hitched the
horses or cows destined for sale; in the other, in which
the master himself was to ride, were placed cushions
and a peasant overcoat. Making a late start, they
journeyed squeaking all night long until daybreak.
First of all they indulged in friendly discussion and
smoking. The men told each other frightful old tales
of merchants murdered on the road and at halting
places for the night. Then Tikhon Ilitch disposed himself
for sleep; and it was extremely pleasant to hear
through his dreams the voices of those whom they met,
to feel the vigorous swaying of the cart, as if it were
constantly descending a hill, and his cheeks slipping
deep into a pillow while his cap fell off and the night
chill cooled his head. It was agreeable, too, to wake
up before sunrise in the rosy, dewy morning, in the
midst of the dull-green grain, and to see, far away in
the blue lowlands, the town shining as a cheerful white
spot, and the gleam of its churches; to yawn mightily,
cross himself at the faint sound of the bells, and take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the reins from the hands of the half-slumbering old
man, who sat relaxed like a child in the morning chill
and was as white as chalk in the light of the dawn.</p>

<p>But on this occasion Tikhon Ilitch sent off the carts
with his head man and drove himself in a runabout.
The night was warm and bright; there was a rosy tone
in the moonlight. He drove fast, but became extremely
weary. The lights on the Fair buildings, the jail and
the hospital, were visible from the steppe at a distance
of ten versts as one approached the town, and it seemed
as if one would never reach them&mdash;those distant, sleepy
lights. And at the posting-house on the Ststchepnoy
Square it was so hot, and the fleas bit so viciously, and
voices rang out so frequently at the entrance-gate,
and the carts rattled so as they drove into the stone-paved
courtyard, and the cocks began to screech and
the pigeons to start their rumbling coo so early, and the
sky to grow white beyond the open windows, that he
never closed an eye. He slept little the second night,
too, which he tried to pass at the Fair in his cart. The
horses neighed, lights blazed in the stalls, people walked
and talked all around him; and at dawn, when his eyelids
were fairly sticking together with sleep, the bells on
the jail and the hospital began to ring. And right
over his head the horrible bellow of a cow boomed out.
&#8220;Might as well be a criminal condemned to hard labour
in prison!&#8221; was a thought which recurred incessantly
during those days and nights. &#8220;Struggling&mdash;getting all
snarled up&mdash;and going to destruction over trifles, absurdities!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Fair, scattered over the town pasture land for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
a whole verst, was, as usual, noisy and muddled.
Brooms, scythes, wooden tubs with handles, shovels,
wheels lay about in heaps. A dull, discordant roar
hung over it all&mdash;the neighing of horses, the shrilling
of children&#8217;s whistles, the polkas and marches thundered
out by the orchestrions of the merry-go-rounds.
An idle, chattering throng of peasant men and women
surged about in waves from morning till night on the
dusty, dung-strewn alleyways among the carts and
stalls, the horses and the cows, the amusement sheds
and the eating booths, whence were wafted fetid odours
of frying grease. As always, there was a huge throng
of horse-dealers, who injected a terrible irritability
into all discussion and barter. Blind men and paupers,
beggars, cripples on crutches and in carts, filed
past in endless bands, chanting their snuffling ballads.
The troika team of the rural police chief moved slowly
through the crowd, its bells jingling, restrained by a
coachman in a sleeveless velveteen coat and a hat
adorned with peacock feathers.</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch had many customers. But nothing beyond
empty chaffer resulted. Gipsies came, blue-black
of face; Jews from the south-west, grey of countenance,
red-haired, covered with dust, in long, wide coats of
canvas and boots down at the heel; sun-browned members
of the gentry class of small estates, in sleeveless
peasant over-jackets and caps; the commissary of rural
police and the village policeman; the wealthy merchant
Safonoff, an old man wearing a sort of overcoat affected
by the lower classes, fat, clean-shaven, and smoking
a cigar. The handsome hussar officer, Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Bakhtin, came also, accompanied by his wife in an
English walking suit, and Khvostoff, the decrepit hero
of the Sevastopol campaign, tall, bony, with large
features and a dark, wrinkled face, wearing a long uniform
coat, sagging trousers, broad-toed boots, and a
big uniform cap with a yellow band beneath which his
dyed locks, of a dead dark-brown shade, were combed
forward on his temples.</p>

<p>All these people gave themselves the air of being expert
judges, talked fluently about colours, paces, discoursed
about the horses they owned. The petty
landed gentry lied and boasted. Bakhtin did not condescend
to speak to Tikhon Ilitch, although the latter
rose respectfully at his approach and said: &#8220;&#8217;Tis a
suitable horse for Your Illustrious Highness, sir.&#8221;
Bakhtin merely fell back a pace as he inspected the
horse, smiled gravely into his moustache, which he wore
with side-supplements, and exchanged brief suggestions
with his wife as he wriggled his leg in his cherry-coloured
cavalry breeches.</p>

<p>But Khvostoff, shuffling up to the horse and casting
a sidelong fiery glance at it, came to a halt in such a
posture that it seemed as if he were on the point of
falling down, elevated his crutch, and for the tenth time
demanded in a dull, absolutely expressionless voice:
&#8220;How much do you ask for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tikhon Ilitch was obliged to answer them all.
Out of sheer boredom he bought a little book entitled
&#8220;Oï, Schmul and Rivke: Collection of fashionable
farces, puns, and stories, from the wanderings of our
worthy Hebrews&#8221;&mdash;and, as he sat in his cart, he dipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
into it frequently. But no sooner did he begin to read:
&#8220;Iveryboady knows, zhentelmen, zat vee, ze Zhews,
iss ferightfully foand of beezness,&#8221; than some one hailed
him. And Tikhon Ilitch raised his eyes and answered,
although with an effort and with clenched jaws.</p>

<p>He grew extremely thin, sunburned, yet pallid, flew
into bad tempers, and was conscious of being bored to
death and of feeling weak all over. He got his stomach
so badly out of order that he had cramps. He was
compelled to resort to the hospital; and there he waited
two hours for his turn, seated in a resounding corridor,
inhaling the repulsive odour of carbolic acid and
feeling as if he were not Tikhon Ilitch and a person of
consequence, but rather as if he were waiting humbly
in the ante-room of his master or of some official. And
when the doctor&mdash;who resembled a deacon, a red-faced,
bright-eyed man in a bob-tailed coat, redolent of soap,
with a sniff&mdash;applied his cold ear to his chest, he made
haste to say that his belly-ache was almost gone, and
did not refuse a dose of castor oil simply because he
was too timid to do so. When he returned to the Fair
ground he gulped down a glass of vodka flavoured with
pepper and salt, and began once more to eat sausage,
sour black rye bread made of second-rate flour, and
to drink tea, raw vodka, and sour cabbage soup&mdash;and
he was still unable to quench his thirst. His acquaintances
advised him to refresh himself with beer, and he
went for some. The lame kvas-dealer shouted:
&#8220;Here&#8217;s your fine kvas, the sort that makes your nose
sting! A kopek a glass&mdash;prime lemonade!&#8221; And
Tikhon Ilitch bade the kvas-peddler halt. &#8220;He-ere&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
your ices!&#8221; chanted in a tenor voice a bald, perspiring
vendor, a paunch-bellied old man in a red shirt. And
Tikhon Ilitch ate, with the little bone spoon, ices
which were hardly more than snow, and which made
his head ache cruelly.</p>

<p>Dusty, ground to powder by feet, wheels, and hoofs,
littered and covered with dung, the pasture was already
being deserted&mdash;the Fair was dispersing. But Tikhon
Ilitch, as if with deliberate intent to spite some one or
other, persisted in keeping his unsold horses there in
the heat, and sat on and on in his cart. It seemed as
if he were overwhelmed not so much by illness as by
the spectacle of the great poverty, the vast wretchedness
which, from time immemorial, had reigned over this
town and its whole county. Lord God, what a country!
Black-loam soil over three feet deep! But&mdash;what
of that? Never did five years pass without a
famine. The town was famous throughout all Russia
as a grain mart&mdash;but not more than a hundred persons
in the whole town ate their fill of the grain. And the
Fair? Beggars, idiots, blind men, cripples&mdash;a whole
regiment of them&mdash;and such monstrosities as it made
one frightened and sick at the stomach to behold!</p>




<h3>V</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">ON a hot, sunny morning Tikhon Ilitch started
homeward through the big Old Town. First
he drove through the town and the bazaar,
past the cathedral, across the shallow little river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
which reeked with the sourly fetid odour of the tanyards,
and beyond the river, up the hill, through the
Black Suburb. In the bazaar he and his brother had
once worked in Matorin&#8217;s shop. Now every one in
the bazaar bowed low before him. In the Black
Suburb his childhood had been passed. There, halfway
up the hill, among the mud huts embedded in the
ground, with their black and decaying roofs, in the
midst of dung which lay drying in the sun for use as
fuel, amid litter, ashes, and rags, it had been his great
delight to race, with shrill shouting and whistling,
after the poverty-stricken teacher of the county school&mdash;a
malicious, depraved old man, long since expelled
from his post, who wore felt boots summer and winter,
under-drawers, and a short overcoat with a beaver
collar which was peeling off. He had been known to
the town by the peculiar nickname of &#8220;the Dog&#8217;s
Pistol.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not a trace was now left of that mud hut in which
Tikhon Ilitch had been born and had grown up. On
its site stood a small new house of planking, with a
rusty sign over the entrance: &#8220;Ecclesiastical Tailor
Soboleff.&#8221; Everything else in the Suburb was precisely
as it had always been&mdash;pigs and hens in the
narrow alleys; tall poles at the gateways, and on each
pole a ram&#8217;s horn; the big pallid faces of the lace-makers
peering forth from behind the pots of flowers
in the tiny windows; bare-legged little urchins with
one suspender over a shoulder, launching a paper snake
with a tail of bast fibre; quiet flaxen-haired little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
girls engaged in their favourite play, burying a doll,
beside the mound of earth encircling the house.</p>

<p>On the plain at the crest of the hill, he crossed himself
before the cemetery, behind the fence of which,
among the trees, was the grave which had once been
such a source of terror to him&mdash;that of the rich miser
Zykoff, which had caved in at the very moment when
they were filling it. And, after a moment&#8217;s reflection,
he turned the horse in at the gate of the cemetery.</p>

<p>By the side of that large white gate had been wont
to sit uninterruptedly, jingling a little bell to which
were attached a handle and a small bag, a squint-eyed
monk garbed in a black cassock and boots red with
age&mdash;an extremely powerful, shaggy, and fierce fellow,
to judge by appearances; a drunkard, with a remarkable
command of abusive language. No monk
was there now. In his place sat an old woman, busy
knitting a stocking. She looked like the ancient crone
of a fairy tale, with spectacles, a beak, and sunken
lips. She was one of the widows who lived in the
asylum by the cemetery.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Morning, my good woman!&#8221; Tikhon Ilitch called
out pleasantly, as he hitched his horse to a post near
the gate. &#8220;Can you look after my horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old woman rose to her feet, made a deep reverence,
and mumbled: &#8220;Yes, batiushka.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Tikhon Ilitch removed his cap, crossed himself once
more, rolling his eyes upward as he did so before the
holy picture of the Assumption of the Mother of God
over the gateway, and added: &#8220;Are there many of
you nowadays?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve old women in all, batiushka.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and do you squabble often?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, often, batiushka.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch walked at a leisurely pace among the
trees and the crosses along the alley leading to the
ancient wooden church, once painted in ochre. During
the Fair he had had his hair cut close and his
beard trimmed and shortened, and he was looking
much younger. His leanness and sunburn also contributed
to the youthfulness of his appearance. The
delicate skin shone white on the recently clipped triangles
on his temples. The memories of his childhood
and youth made him younger; so did his new peaked
canvas cap. His face was thoughtful. He glanced
from side to side. How brief, how devoid of meaning,
was life! And what peace, what repose, was round
about, in that sunny stillness within the enclosure of
the ancient churchyard! A hot breeze drifted across
the crests of the bright trees which pierced the cloudless
sky, their foliage made scanty before its season by
the torrid heat, their light, transparent shadows cast in
waves athwart the stones and monuments. And when
it died away the sun once more heated up the flowers
and the grass; birds warbled sweetly in the languor;
sumptuously-hued butterflies sank motionless upon the
hot paths. On one cross Tikhon Ilitch read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;What terrible quit-rents</div>
<div class="verse">Doth Death collect from men!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But there was nothing awful about the spot. He
strolled on, even noticing with considerable satisfaction
that the cemetery was growing; that many new and excellent
mausoleums had made their appearance among
those ancient stones in the shapes of coffins on legs,
heavy cast-iron plates, and huge rough crosses, already
in process of decay, which now filled it. &#8220;Died in the
year 1819, on November 7, at five o&#8217;clock in the morning&#8221;&mdash;it
was painful to read such inscriptions: death
was repulsive at dawn of a stormy autumnal day, in
that old county town! But alongside it a marble
angel gleamed white through the trees, as he stood
there with eyes fixed upon the blue sky; and beneath
it, on the mirror-smooth black granite, were cut in gold
letters the words: &#8220;Blessed are the dead who die in
the Lord.&#8221; On the iron monument of some Collegiate
Assessor, tinted in rainbow hues by foul weather and
the hand of time, one could decipher the verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;His Tsar he honourably served,</div>
<div class="verse">His neighbour cordially loved,</div>
<div class="verse">And was revered of men.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And these verses struck Tikhon Ilitch as hypocritical.
But in this place even a lie was touching. For&mdash;where
is truth? Yonder in the bushes lies a human
jawbone, neglected, looking as if it were made of dirty
wax&mdash;all that remains of a man. But is it all?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Flowers, ribbons, crosses, coffins, and bones in the
earth decay&mdash;all is death and corruption. But Tikhon
Ilitch walked on further and read: &#8220;Thus it is in the
resurrection of the dead; it is sown in corruption, it is
raised in incorruption.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Our darling son, thy memory
will never die in our hearts to all eternity!&#8221;</p>

<p>His brow furrowed even more severely; he removed
his cap and made the sign of the cross. He was pale,
and still weak from his illness. He recalled his childhood&mdash;his
youth&mdash;Kuzma. He walked to the far corner
of the cemetery where all his relatives were buried&mdash;father,
mother, the sister who had died when a little
girl. The inscriptions spoke touchingly and peacefully
of rest, repose; of tenderness towards fathers,
mothers, husbands and wives; of a love which, apparently,
does not exist and never will exist on this earth;
of that devotion to one another and submission to God,
that fervent faith in a future life, that meeting once
more in another and blessed land, in which one believes
only here; and of that equality which death
alone confers&mdash;of those moments when folk bestow the
last kiss upon the lips of the dead beggar as on a
brother&#8217;s, compare him with kings and prelates, say
over him the loftiest and most solemn words.</p>

<p>And there in a distant corner of the enclosure,
among bushes of elder which dozed in the parching
heat&mdash;there where formerly had been graves, but now
were only mounds and hollows, overgrown with grass
and white flowers&mdash;Tikhon Ilitch saw a fresh little
grave, the grave of a child, and on the cross a couplet:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;Softly, leaves: do not rustle,</div>
<div class="verse">Do not wake my Kostya dear.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And as he recalled his own child, crushed in its sleep
by the dumb cook, he began to blink back the welling
tears.</p>




<h3>VI</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">NO one ever drove on the highway which ran past
the cemetery and lost itself among the rolling
fields. Now and then some light-footed tramp
straggled along it&mdash;some young fellow in a faded pink
shirt and drawers of parti-coloured patches. But people
drove on the country road alongside. Along that
country road drove Tikhon Ilitch also. His first encounter
was with a dilapidated public carriage which
approached at racing speed&mdash;provincial cabmen
drive wildly!&mdash;and in which sat a huntsman, an official
of the bank. At his feet lay a spotted setter dog; on
his knees rested a gun in its cover; his legs were encased
in tall wading-boots, though there had never
been any marshes in the county. Next, diving across
the dusty hummocks, came a young postman mounted
on a bicycle of an ancient model, with an enormous
front wheel and a tiny rear one. He frightened the
horse, and Tikhon Ilitch gritted his teeth with rage;
the rascal ought to be degraded to the ranks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
workingmen! The mid-day sun scorched; a hot
breeze was blowing; the cloudless sky became slate-coloured.
And, as he meditated upon the brevity and
senselessness of life, Tikhon Ilitch turned away with
ever-increasing irritation from the dust which whirled
along the road, and with ever-increasing anxiety cast
sidelong glances at the spindling, prematurely drying
stalks of the grain.</p>

<p>Throngs of pilgrims armed with long staffs, tortured
by fatigue and the heat, tramped on at a peaceful gait.
They made low, meek reverences to Tikhon Ilitch; but
their obeisances struck him as shams. &#8220;Those fellows
meek! I&#8217;ll bet they fight among themselves like cats
and dogs at their halting-places!&#8221; he muttered.
Drunken peasants returning from the Fair&mdash;red-headed,
black-haired, flaxen-haired, but all alike hideous
and tattered, and with about ten crowded into
each cart&mdash;raised clouds of dust as they whipped up
their wretched little horses. As he overtook their
rattling carts Tikhon Ilitch shook his head. &#8220;Ugh,
you roving beggars, may the devil fly away with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of them, in a print shirt torn to ribbons, lay
fast asleep and was bumped about like a corpse,
stretched supine with his head thrown back, his beard
blood-stained, his nose swollen and clotted with dried
blood. Another stumbled as he ran after his cap,
which had been blown off by the wind; and Tikhon
Ilitch, with malicious delight, lashed him with his whip.
Then came a cart filled with sieves, shovels, and peasant
women. They sat with their backs to the horses,
rattling and bumping about. One had a new child&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
cap on her head, worn wrong side before; another was
singing with her mouth full of bread; a third flourished
her arms and, laughing, shouted after Tikhon
Ilitch: &#8220;Hey there, uncle, you&#8217;ve lost your linch-pin!&#8221;
And Tikhon Ilitch reined in his horse, let them catch
up with him, and lashed this woman, too, with his
whip.</p>

<p>Beyond the toll-gate, where the highway turned off
to one side, and where the rattling peasant carts fell to
the rear, and silence, the wide space and sultriness of
the steppe reigned, he felt once more that, in spite of
everything, the chief item in the world was Business.
He thought with supreme scorn of the landed proprietors,
putting on swagger at the Fair&mdash;they, with their
wretched troika teams! Ekh, and the poverty on
every side! The peasants were utterly ruined, with
not a scrap left on their impoverished little farms
scattered about the country. A master was needed
here&mdash;a master!</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not the right master, my good fellow!&#8221;
he announced to himself with a spiteful grin. &#8220;You&#8217;re
a poor, crazy, landless stick yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Midway of his journey lay Rovnoe, a large village
in which the inhabitants were freeholders. A scorching
breeze coursed through the deserted streets and
across the heat-singed bushes. Fowls were ruffling up
their feathers and burying themselves in the ashes at
the thresholds. A church of crude hue reared itself
starkly, harshly on the bare common. Beyond the
church a tiny clayey pond gleamed in the sunlight below
a dam of manure, a sheet of thick yellow water in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
which stood a herd of cows, incessantly discharging according
to the demands of nature; and there a naked
peasant was soaping his head. He, too, had waded
into the water up to his waist; on his breast glistened
his brass baptismal cross; his neck and face were black
with sunburn, his body strikingly white, pallid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Unbridle my horse for me,&#8221; said Tikhon Ilitch,
driving into the pond, which reeked of the cattle.</p>

<p>The peasant tossed his fragment of blue-marbled
soap on the shore, black with cow-dung, and, his head
all grey, with a modest gesture as though to cover himself,
he made haste to comply with the command. The
mare bent greedily to the water, but it was so warm
and repulsive that she raised her muzzle and turned
away. Whistling to her, Tikhon Ilitch waved his
cap:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, nice water you have! Do you drink it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, and is yours sugar-water, I wonder?&#8221;
retorted the peasant, amiably and gaily. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been
drinking it these thousand years! But what&#8217;s water?&mdash;&#8217;tis
bread we&#8217;re lacking.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tikhon Ilitch was forced to hold his tongue; for
in Durnovka the water was no better, and there was no
bread there either. What was more, there would be
none.</p>

<p>Beyond Rovnoe the road ran again through fields of
rye&mdash;but what fields! The grain was spindling, weak,
almost wholly lacking in ears, and smothered in
corn-flowers. And near Vyselki, not far from Durnovka,
clouds of rooks perched on the gnarled, hollow
willow-trees with their silvery beaks wide open.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Nothing was left of Vyselki that day save its name&mdash;the
rest was only black skeletons of cottages in the
midst of rubbish! The rubbish was smoking, with a
milky-bluish emanation; there was a rank odour of
burning. And the thought of a conflagration from
lightning transfixed Tikhon Ilitch. &#8220;Calamity!&#8221; he
said to himself, turning pale. Nothing he owned was
insured: everything might be reduced to ashes in an
hour.</p>




<h3>VII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">FROM that Fast of St. Peter, that memorable trip
to the Fair, Tikhon Ilitch began to drink frequently&mdash;not
to the point of downright drunkenness,
but to the stage at which his face became passably
red. This did not, however, interfere in the
slightest degree with his business, and, according to
his own account, it did not interfere with his health.
&#8220;Vodka polishes the blood,&#8221; he was wont to remark;
and, truth to tell, to all appearances he became more
robust than ever. Not infrequently now he called his
life that of a galley-slave&mdash;the hangman&#8217;s noose&mdash;a
gilded cage. But he strode along his pathway with
ever-increasing confidence, paying no attention to the
condition of the weather or the road. Commonplace,
uneventful days ruled supreme in his house, and several
years passed in such monotonous fashion that
everything merged together into one long working-day.
But certain new, vast events which no one had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
looked for came to pass&mdash;the war with Japan and the
revolution.</p>

<p>The rumours concerning the war began, of course,
with bragging. &#8220;The kazaks will soon flay his yellow
skin off him, brother!&#8221; But it smouldered so very
short a time, this pale image of former boasts! A different
sort of talk speedily made itself heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have more land than we can manage!&#8221; said
Tikhon Ilitch, in the stern tone of an expert&mdash;probably
for the first time in the whole course of his life
not referring to his own land in Durnovka, but to the
whole expanse of Russia. &#8220;&#8217;Tis not war, sir, but
downright madness!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another thing made itself felt, the sort of thing
which has prevailed from time immemorial&mdash;the inclination
to take the winning side. And the news
about the frightful defeats of the Russian army excited
his enthusiasm: &#8220;Ukh, that&#8217;s fine. Curse them, the
brutes!&#8221; He waxed enthusiastic also over the conquests
of the revolution, over the assassinations:
&#8220;That Minister got a smashing blow!&#8221; said Tikhon
Ilitch occasionally, in the fire of his ecstasy. &#8220;He got
such a good one that not even his ashes were left!&#8221;</p>

<p>But his uneasiness increased, too. As soon as any
discussion connected with the land came up, his wrath
awoke. &#8220;&#8217;Tis all the work of the Jews! Of the Jews,
and of those frowzy long-haired fellows, the students!&#8221;
What irritated Tikhon Ilitch worst of all was, that the
son of the deacon in Ulianovka, a student in the Theological
Seminary who was hanging around without
work and living on his father, called himself a Social-Democrat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
And the whole situation was incomprehensible.
Everybody was talking about the revolution,
the Revolution, while round about everything was going
on the same as ever, in the ordinary everyday fashion:
the sun shone, the rye blossomed in the fields, the
carts wended their way to the station. The populace
were incomprehensible in their taciturnity, in the evasiveness
of their talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re an underhand lot, the populace! They
fairly scare one with their slyness!&#8221; said Tikhon Ilitch.
And, forgetting the Jews, he added: &#8220;Let us assume
that not all that music is craft. Changing the government
and evening up the shares of land&mdash;why, an infant
could understand that, sir. And, naturally,&#8217;tis
perfectly clear to whom they will pay court&mdash;that populace,
sir. But, of course, they hold their tongues.
And, of course, we must watch, and try to meet their
humour, so that they may go on holding their tongues.
We must put a spoke in their wheel! If you don&#8217;t,
look out for yourself: they&#8217;ll scent success, they&#8217;ll get
wind of the fact that they&#8217;ve got the breeching under
their tail&mdash;and they&#8217;ll smash things to smithereens,
sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>When he read or heard that land was to be taken
from only such as possessed more than five hundred
desyatini<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> he himself became an &#8220;agitator.&#8221; He even
entered into disputes with the Durnovka people. This
is the sort of thing that would happen:&mdash;</p>

<p>A peasant stood alongside Tikhon Ilitch&#8217;s shop; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
man had bought vodka at the railway station, dried
salt fish and cracknels at the shop, and had doffed his
cap; but he prolonged his enjoyment, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Tikhon Ilitch, &#8217;tis no use your explaining. It
can be taken, at a just price. But not the way you say&mdash;that&#8217;s
no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>An odour arose from the pine boards piled up near
the granary, opposite the yard. The dried fish and
the linden bast on which the cracknels were strung had
an irritating smell. The hot locomotive of the freight-train
could be heard hissing and getting up steam beyond
the trees, behind the buildings of the railway station.
Tikhon Ilitch stood bare-headed beside his shop,
screwing up his eyes and smiling slily. Smilingly he
made reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bosh! But what if he is not a master, but a
tramp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who? The noble owner, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;a low-born man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a different matter. &#8217;Tis no sin to take
it from such a man, with all his innards to boot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well now, that&#8217;s exactly the point!&#8221;</p>

<p>But another rumour reached them: the land would
be taken from those who owned less than five hundred
desyatini! And immediately his soul was assailed by
preoccupation, suspicion, irritability. Everything that
was done in the house began to seem abhorrent.</p>

<p>Egorka, the assistant, brought flour-sacks out of the
shop and began to shake them. And the man&#8217;s head
reminded him of the head of the town fool, &#8220;Duck-Headed
Matty.&#8221; The crown of his head ran up to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
point, his hair was harsh and thick&mdash;&#8220;Now, why is it
that fools have such thick hair?&#8221;&mdash;his forehead was
sunken, his face resembled an oblique egg, he had protruding
eyes, and his eyelids, with their calf-like
lashes, seemed drawn tightly over them; it looked as if
there were not enough skin&mdash;if he were to close his
eyes, his mouth would fly open of necessity, and if he
closed his mouth, he would be compelled to open his
eyes very wide. And Tikhon Ilitch shouted spitefully:
&#8220;Babbler! Blockhead! What are you shaking
your head at me for?&#8221;</p>

<p>The cook brought out a smallish box, opened it,
placed it upside down on the ground, and began to
thump the bottom with her fist. And, understanding
what that meant, Tikhon Ilitch slowly shook his head:
&#8220;Akh, you housewife, curse you! You&#8217;re knocking out
the cockroaches?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a regular cloud of them in there!&#8221; replied
the cook gaily. &#8220;When I peeped in&mdash;Lord, what a
sight!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, gritting his teeth, Tikhon Ilitch walked out to
the highway and gazed long at the rolling plain, in the
direction of Durnovka.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>




<h3>VIII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">HIS living-rooms, the kitchen, the shop, and the
granary, where formerly his liquor-trade had
been carried on, constituted a single mass under
one iron roof. On three sides the straw-thatched sheds
of the cattle-yard were closely connected with it, and
a pleasing quadrangle was thus obtained. The porch
and all the windows faced the south. But the view
was cut off by the grain-sheds, which stood opposite
the windows and across the road. To the right was
the railway station, to the left the highway. Beyond
the highway was a small grove of birches. And when
Tikhon Ilitch felt out of sorts, he went out on the
highway. It ran southward in a white winding ribbon
from hillock to hillock, ever following the fields
in their declivities and rising again toward the horizon
from the far-away watch-tower, where the railway,
coming from the south-east, intersected it. And if
any one of the Durnovka peasants chanced to be driving
to Ulianovka&mdash;one of the more energetic and
clever, that is, such as Yakoff, whom every one called
Yakoff Mikititch<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> because he was greedy, and held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
fast to his little store of grain a second year, and owned
three excellent horses&mdash;Tikhon Ilitch stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might buy yourself a cheap little cap with a
visor, at least!&#8221; he shouted to Yakoff, with a grin.</p>

<p>Yakoff, in a peakless cap, hemp-crash shirt, and
trousers of heavy striped linen, was sitting barefoot
on the side-rail of his springless cart.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Morning, Tikhon Ilitch,&#8221; he said, staidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Morning! I tell you, &#8217;tis time you sacrificed your
round cap for a jackdaw&#8217;s nest!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yakoff, grinning shrewdly earthwards, shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&mdash;how should it be expressed?&mdash;would not be
a bad idea. But, you see, my capital, so to speak, will
not permit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, stop your babbling. We know all about you
Kazan orphans!<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> You&#8217;ve married off your girl, and
got a wife for your lad, and you have plenty of money.
What more is there left for you to want from the
Lord God?&#8221;</p>

<p>This flattered Yakoff, but he became more uncommunicative
than ever. &#8220;O, Lord!&#8221; he muttered, with
a sigh, in a sort of chuckling tone. &#8220;Money&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know the sight of it, so to speak. And my lad&mdash;well,
what of him? The boy&#8217;s no comfort to me. No comfort
at all, to speak the plain truth! Young folks
are no comfort nowadays!&#8221;</p>

<p>Yakoff, like many peasants, was extremely nervous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
especially if his family or his affairs were in question.
He was remarkably secretive, but on such occasions
nervousness overpowered him, although only his disconnected,
trembling speech betrayed the fact. So, in
order to complete his disquiet, Tikhon Ilitch inquired
sympathetically: &#8220;So he isn&#8217;t a comfort? Tell me,
pray, is it all because of the woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yakoff, looking about him, scratched his breast with
his finger-nails. &#8220;Yes, because of the woman, his wife,
his father may go break his back with work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she jealous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she is. People set me down as the lover of my
daughter-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; ejaculated Tikhon Ilitch sympathetically, although
he knew full well that there is never smoke
without fire.</p>

<p>But Yakoff&#8217;s eyes were already wandering: &#8220;She
complained to her husband; how she complained!
And, just think, she wanted to poison me. Sometimes,
for example, a fellow catches cold and smokes a bit
to relieve his chest. Well, she noticed that&mdash;and stuck
a cigarette under my pillow. If I hadn&#8217;t happened to
see it&mdash;I&#8217;d have been done for!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a cigarette?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She had pounded up the bones of dead men, and
stuffed it with that in place of tobacco.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That boy of yours is a fool! He ought to teach
her a lesson, in Russian style&mdash;the damned hussy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you thinking of! He climbed on my
breast, so to speak. And he wriggled like a serpent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
I grabbed him by the head, but his head was shaved!
I grabbed hold of his stomach. I hated to tear his
shirt!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch shook his head, remained silent for a
minute, and at last reached a decision: &#8220;Well, and
how are things going with you over there? Are you
still expecting the rebellion?&#8221;</p>

<p>But thereupon Yakoff&#8217;s secrecy was restored instantaneously.
He grinned and waved his hand. &#8220;Well!&#8221;
he muttered volubly. &#8220;What would we do with a
rebellion? Our folks are peaceable. Yes, a peaceable
lot.&#8221; And he tightened the reins, as though his
horse were restive and would not stand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did you have a village assembly last
Sunday?&#8221; Tikhon Ilitch maliciously and abruptly
interjected.</p>

<p>&#8220;A village assembly, did you say? The plague only
knows! They started an awful row, so to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what the row was about! I know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what of it? I&#8217;m not making a secret of it.
They gabbled, so to speak, said orders had been issued&mdash;orders
had been issued&mdash;that no one was to work
any more at the former price.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was extremely mortifying to reflect that, because
of wretched little Durnovka, affairs were escaping from
his grasp. And there were only thirty homesteads
altogether in that same Durnovka. And it was situated
in a devil of a ravine: a broad gorge, with peasant
cottages on one side, and on the other the tiny manor.
And that manor exchanged glances with the cottages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and from day to day expected some &#8220;order.&#8221; Ekh,
he&#8217;d like to apply a few kazaks with their whips to
the situation!</p>




<h3>IX</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">BUT the &#8220;order&#8221; came, at last. One Sunday a
rumour began to circulate in Durnovka that the
village assembly had worked out a plan for an
attack upon the manor. With maliciously merry eyes,
a feeling of unusual strength and daring, and a readiness
to &#8220;break the horns of the devil himself,&#8221; Tikhon
Ilitch shouted orders to have the colt harnessed to
the runabout, and within ten minutes he was driving
him at high speed along the highway to Durnovka.
The sun was setting, after a rainy day, in greyish-red
clouds; the boles of the trees in the birch-grove were
crimson; the country dirt-road, which stood out as a
line of blackish-purple mud amid the fresh greenery,
afforded heavy going. Rose-hued foam dripped from
the haunches of the colt and from the breeching which
jerked about on them. But he was not considering the
colt. Slapping him stoutly with the reins, Tikhon
Ilitch turned aside from the railway, drove to the right
along the road across the fields, and, on coming within
sight of Durnovka, was inclined to doubt, for a moment,
the correctness of the rumours about a rebellion.
Peaceful stillness lay all about, the larks were warbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
their evening song in peace, the air was simply and
peacefully impregnated with an odour of damp earth
and with the fragrance of wild flowers. But all of
a sudden his glance fell upon the fallow-field alongside
the manor, thickly sown with sweet-clover. On that
fallow-field, a drove of horses belonging to the peasants
was grazing!</p>

<p>So it had begun. And, tugging at the reins, Tikhon
Ilitch flew past the drove, past the barns overgrown
with burdocks and nettles, past a low-growing cherry-orchard
filled with sparrows, past the stables and the
cottages of the domestics, and leaped with a bound
into the farmyard.</p>

<p>Then something incongruous happened. There, in
the twilight, in the middle of the field, sat Tikhon Ilitch
in his runabout, overwhelmed with wrath, mortification,
and terror. His heart beat violently, his hands
trembled, his face burned, his hearing was as acute
as that of a wild animal. There he sat, listening to
the shouts which were wafted from Durnovka, and recalled
how the crowd, which had seemed to him immense,
on catching sight of him from afar had swarmed
across the gorge to the manor and filled the yard with
uproar and abusive words, had massed themselves on
the porch and pinioned him against the door. All the
weapon he had had was the whip in his hand. And
he brandished it, now retreating, now hurling himself
in desperation against the crowd. But the harness-maker,
a vicious emaciated fellow with a sunken belly
and a sharp nose, wearing tall boots and a lavender
print shirt, advanced brandishing his stick even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
furiously. On behalf of the whole throng, he screeched
that an order had been issued to &#8220;make an end of that
outfit&#8221;&mdash;to make an end on one and the same day and
hour throughout the entire government. The hired
labourers from outside were to be chased out of all the
estates and replaced with local labourers&mdash;at a ruble
a day!&mdash;while the owners were to be expelled neck
and crop, in any direction, so that they would never
be seen again. And Tikhon Ilitch yelled still more
frantically, in the endeavour to drown out the harness-maker:
&#8220;A&mdash;a! So that&#8217;s it! Have you been whetting
yourself, you tramp, on the deacon&#8217;s son? Have
you lost your wits?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the harness-maker disputatiously caught his
words on the fly: &#8220;Tramp yourself!&#8221; he yelled until
he was hoarse, and his face was suffused with blood.
&#8220;You&#8217;re an old fool! Haven&#8217;t I managed to get along
all my life without the deacon&#8217;s son? Don&#8217;t I know
how much land you own? How much is it, you skinflint?
Two hundred desyatini? But I&mdash;damn it!&mdash;own,
in all, about as much ground as is covered by
your porch! And why? Who are you? Who are
you, anyway, I ask you? What&#8217;s your brew&mdash;any
better sort than the rest of us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to your senses, Mitka!&#8221; shouted Tikhon
Ilitch helplessly at last; and, conscious that his wits
were getting muddled, he made a dash through the
crowd to his runabout. &#8220;I&#8217;ll pay you off for this!&#8221;</p>

<p>But no one was afraid of his threats, and unanimous
laughter, yells, and whistling followed him. Then he
had made the round of the manor-estate, his heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
sinking within him, and listened. He drove out upon
the road to the cross-roads and halted with his face
to the darkening west, toward the railway station,
holding himself in readiness to whip up his horse at
any moment. It was very quiet, warm, damp, and
dark. The land, which rose toward the horizon, where
a faint reddish gleam still smouldered, was as black
as the nethermost abyss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sta-and still, you carrion!&#8221; Tikhon Ilitch whispered
through set teeth to his restive horse. &#8220;Sta-and
still!&#8221;</p>

<p>And, from afar, first shouts, then songs, were wafted
to him. And among all the voices the voice of Vanka
Krasny, who had already been twice in the mines of
the Donetz Basin, was distinguishable above the rest.
And then, suddenly, a dark-fiery column rose above
the manor-house: the peasants had shaken off all the
immature fruit in the orchard and set fire to the watchman&#8217;s
hut. A pistol which the gardener, a petty
burgher, had left behind him in the hut began to discharge
itself, out of the fire.</p>

<p>It became known, later on, that in truth a remarkable
thing had taken place. On one and the same
day, the peasants had risen through almost the entire
county. The inns in the town were crowded for a
long time thereafter with land-owners who had sought
protection of the authorities. Afterwards, Tikhon
Ilitch recalled with shame that he also had sought it&mdash;with
shame, because the whole uprising had been limited
to the Durnovka people&#8217;s shouting for a while,
doing a lot of damage, and then quieting down. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
harness-maker began, before long, to present himself
in the shop at Vorgol as though nothing whatever had
happened, and doffed his cap on the threshold as if he
did not perceive that Tikhon Ilitch&#8217;s face darkened
at his appearance. Nevertheless, rumours were still
in circulation to the effect that the Durnovka folk
intended to murder Tikhon Ilitch. And he, afraid
to be caught out after dark on the road from Durnovka,
fumbled in his pocket for his bulldog revolver,
which weighed down the pocket of his full trousers
in an annoying manner, and registered a vow that he
would burn Durnovka to the ground some fine night,
or poison the water in the Durnovka wells. Then even
these rumours died away. But Tikhon Ilitch began
to think seriously of ridding himself of Durnovka.
&#8220;Real money is the money in your pocket, not the
money you&#8217;re going to inherit from your grandmother!&#8221;
Moreover, the peasants had become impudent
in their manner to him, and they seemed peculiarly
well-informed. The Durnovka folks knew &#8220;all
the ins and outs of things,&#8221; and for that reason alone,
if for no other, it was stupid to entrust the oversight
and management of affairs at the manor to any of the
Durnovka labourers. More than that, Rodka was the
village Elder.</p>

<p>That year&mdash;the most alarming of all recent years&mdash;Tikhon
Ilitch reached the age of fifty. But he had
not abandoned his dream of becoming a father. And,
lo and behold, precisely that was what brought him
into collision with Rodka.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>




<h3>X</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">RODKA, a tall, thin, sullen young fellow from
Ulianovka, had gone two years previously to
live with Fedot, the brother of Yakoff; he had
married, and had buried Fedot, who had died from
over-drinking at the wedding; and he had then gone
away to do his military service. But the bride, a
young woman with fine figure, an extremely white,
soft skin faintly tinged with crimson, and eyelashes
for ever downcast, began to work for daily wages at
the farm. And those eyelashes perturbed Tikhon Ilitch
terribly. The peasant women of Durnovka wear
&#8220;horns&#8221; on their heads: immediately after the wedding
they coil their braided hair on the crown of the head
and cover it with a kerchief, which produces a queer
effect, similar to the horns of a cow. They wear dark-blue
skirts of the antique pattern, trimmed with galloon,
a white apron not unlike a sarafan<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in shape,
and bast-slippers. But the Bride&mdash;that name stuck
to her&mdash;was beautiful in that garb. And one evening
in the dark barn, where the Bride was alone and finishing
the clearing up of the rye-ears, Tikhon Ilitch,
after casting a precautionary glance around him, entered,
went up to her, and said hastily: &#8220;You shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
have pretty shoes and silk kerchiefs. I shall not begrudge
a twenty-five-ruble banknote!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the Bride remained silent as death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear what I say?&#8221; cried Tikhon Ilitch, in
a whisper.</p>

<p>But the Bride seemed turned to stone, and with
bowed head went on wielding her rake.</p>

<p>So he accomplished nothing at all. All of a sudden,
Rodka appeared&mdash;ahead of his time, and minus an
eye. That was soon after the rebellion of the Durnovka
peasants, and Tikhon Ilitch immediately hired
him and his wife for the Durnovka farm, on the ground
that &#8220;nowadays it won&#8217;t do to be without a soldier on
the place.&#8221; About St. Ilya&#8217;s Day, while Rodka had
gone off to the town, the Bride was scrubbing the
floors in the house. Picking his way among the puddles,
Tikhon Ilitch entered the room, cast a glance
at the Bride, who was bending over the floor&mdash;at her
white calves bespattered with dirty water&mdash;at the whole
of her plump body as it flattened out before him.
And, suddenly turning the key in the door, he strode
up to the Bride. She straightened up hastily, raised
her flushed, agitated face and, clutching in her hand
the dripping floor-rag, screamed at him in a strange
tone: &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a soaking, young fellow!&#8221;</p>

<p>An odour of hot soapsuds, heated body, perspiration,
pervaded the air. Seizing the Bride by the hand, he
squeezed it in a brutal grip, shaking it and making
her drop the rag. Tikhon Ilitch grasped the Bride
by the waist with his right arm&mdash;pressed her to him
with such force that her bones cracked&mdash;and bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
her off into another room where there was a bed. And
the Bride, with head thrown back and eyes staring
wide open, no longer struggled, no longer resisted.</p>

<p>After that incident it was painful to the point of
torment to see his wife, to see Rodka; to know that
Rodka slept with the Bride, that he beat her ferociously
every day and every night. But before long the situation
became alarming as well. Inscrutable are the
ways by which a jealous man arrives at the truth.
And Rodka found out. Lean, one-eyed, long-armed,
and strong as an ape, with a small closely-cropped
black head which he always carried bent forward as
he shot sidelong glances from his deep-set eyes, he
became downright terrifying. During his service as
a soldier he had acquired a stock of Little Russian
words and an accent. And if the Bride ventured to
make any reply to his curt, harsh speeches, he calmly
picked up his leather-strap knout, approached her with
a vicious grin, and calmly inquired, accenting the &#8220;re&#8221;:
&#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;re <i>re</i>marking?&#8221; Thereupon he gave
her such a flogging that everything turned black before
her eyes.</p>

<p>On one occasion Tikhon Ilitch himself happened
upon a thrashing of this sort and, unable to restrain
his indignation, shouted: &#8220;What are you doing, you
damned rascal?&#8221; But Rodka quietly seated himself
on the bench and merely looked at him. &#8220;What&#8217;s that
you&#8217;re <i>re</i>marking?&#8221; he inquired. And Tikhon Ilitch
made haste to retreat, slamming the door behind him.</p>

<p>Wild thoughts began to dart through his mind.
Should he poison his wife?&mdash;with stove-gas, for example?&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
should he arrange matters so that Rodka
would be crushed by a falling roof or earth? But
one month passed, then another&mdash;and hope, that hope
which had inspired in him these intoxicating thoughts,
was cruelly deceived. The Bride was not pregnant.
Every one in Durnovka was convinced that it was
Rodka&#8217;s fault. Tikhon Ilitch himself was convinced
of it, and cherished strong hopes. But one day in
September, when Rodka was absent at the railway station,
Tikhon Ilitch presented himself and fairly groaned
aloud at the sight of the face of the Bride, all its
feminine beauty distorted with terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you done for again?&#8221; he cried, as he ran up
the steps of the porch.</p>

<p>The Bride&#8217;s lips turned white, her nose became waxen
in hue, and her eyes opened very wide; yet again,
it appeared, she was not with child. She expected to
receive a deadly blow on the head, and involuntarily
recoiled from it. But Tikhon Ilitch controlled himself,
merely uttering a groan of pain and rage.</p>

<p>A moment later he took his departure&mdash;and from
that day forth Rodka had no reason for jealousy.
Conscious of that fact, Rodka began to feel timid in
the presence of Tikhon Ilitch. And the latter now
harboured, secretly, only one desire: to drive Rodka
out of his sight, and that as speedily as possible. But
whom could he find to take his place?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>




<h3>XI</h3>


<p class="drop-cap2">ACCIDENT came to the rescue of Tikhon Ilitch.
Quite unexpectedly he became reconciled to his
brother, and persuaded him to undertake the
management of Durnovka.</p>

<p>He had learned from an acquaintance in the town
that Kuzma had ceased to drink and for a long time
had been serving as clerk with a landed proprietor
named Kasatkin. And, what was most amazing of
all, he had become &#8220;an author.&#8221; Yes, it was said that
he had printed a whole little volume of his verses, and
on the cover was the inscription: &#8220;For sale by the
Author.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come no-ow!&#8221; drawled Tikhon Ilitch when he
heard this. &#8220;He&#8217;s the same old Kuzma, and that&#8217;s all
right! But let me ask one thing: Did he really
print it so&mdash;&#8216;The Works of Kuzma Krasoff&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give you my word he did,&#8221; replied the acquaintance,
being fully persuaded, nevertheless&mdash;as were
many others in the town&mdash;that Kuzma &#8220;skinned&#8221; his
verses from books and newspapers.</p>

<p>Thereupon Tikhon Ilitch, without quitting his seat
at the table of Daeff&#8217;s eating-house, wrote a brief, peremptory
letter to his brother: &#8217;twas high time for old
men to make peace, to repent. And there, in that
same eating-house, the reconciliation took place&mdash;swiftly,
almost without the utterance of a word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
And on the following day came the business talk.</p>

<p>It was morning; the eating-house was still almost
empty. The sun shone through the dusty windows,
lighted up the small tables covered with greyish-red
tablecloths, the floor newly washed with bran and
emitting an odour of the stable, and the waiters in
their white shirts and white trousers. In a cage a
canary was singing in all possible modulations, but
like a mechanical bird which had been wound up
rather than a live one. Next door, the bells of St.
Michael Archangel&#8217;s church were ringing for the Liturgy,
and the dense, sonorous peal shook the walls and
boomed quivering overhead. With nervous, serious
countenance, Tikhon Ilitch seated himself at a table,
ordered at first only tea for two, but became impatient
and reached for the bill-of-fare&mdash;a novelty which
had excited the mirth of all Daeff&#8217;s patrons. On the
card was printed: &#8220;A small carafe of vodka, with
snack, 25 kopeks. With tasty snack, 40 kopeks.&#8221;
Tikhon Ilitch ordered the carafe of vodka at forty
kopeks. He tossed off two glasses with avidity and
was on the point of drinking a third, when a long-familiar
voice resounded in his ear: &#8220;Well, good
morning once more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma was garbed in the same fashion as his
brother. He was shorter of stature, with larger bones,
more withered, and a trifle broader of shoulder. He
had the large thin face with prominent cheek-bones
of a shrewd old peasant shopkeeper, grey overhanging
eyebrows, and large greenish eyes. His manner of
beginning was not simple:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>&#8220;First of all, I must expound to you, Tikhon Ilitch,&#8221;
he began, as soon as Tikhon Ilitch had poured him a
cup of tea, &#8220;I must expound to you what sort of a
man I am, so that you may know&#8221;&mdash;he chuckled&mdash;&#8220;with
whom you are dealing.&#8221; He had a way of enunciating
his words very distinctly, elevating his brows,
unfastening and fastening the upper button of his short
coat while he talked. So, having buttoned it, he continued:
&#8220;I, you see, am an anarchist....&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid. I don&#8217;t meddle with politics. But
you can&#8217;t give a man orders how he is to think. It
won&#8217;t harm you in the least. I shall manage the estate
faithfully, but I tell you straight from the shoulder
that I will not skin the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, that can&#8217;t be done at the present time,&#8221;
sighed Tikhon Ilitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, times are the same as they always were. It
is still possible to fleece people. I&#8217;ll do my managing
properly, but my leisure I shall devote to self-development.
That is to say, to reading.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okh, bear in mind: Too much poking in books is
bad for the poke!&#8221; said Tikhon Ilitch, shaking his
head, and making a grimace. &#8220;However, that&#8217;s no
affair of ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s not the way I look at it,&#8221; retorted
Kuzma. &#8220;I, brother&mdash;how shall I put it to you?&mdash;I&#8217;m
a strange Russian type.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Russian man myself, bear that in mind,&#8221; interposed
Tikhon Ilitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;But another sort. I don&#8217;t mean to say that I&#8217;m better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
than you, but&mdash;I&#8217;m different. Now here are you,
I see, priding yourself on being a Russian, while I,
brother, okh! am very far from being a Slavophil!
It&#8217;s not proper to jabber much, but one thing I will
say: for God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t brag of being a Russian!
We&#8217;re an uncivilized people and an extremely unreliable
one&mdash;neither candle for God nor oven-fork for the
devil. But we will discuss this as time goes on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch contracted his brows, drummed on the
table with his fingers. &#8220;That&#8217;s right, probably,&#8221; he
said, and slowly filled his glass. &#8220;We&#8217;re a savage lot.
A crack-brained race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and that&#8217;s precisely the point. I have, I may
say, roamed about the world a good bit. Well, and
what then? Absolutely nowhere have I seen more tiresome
and lazy types. And those who are not lazy&#8221;&mdash;here
Kuzma shot a sidelong look at his brother&mdash;&#8220;have
no sense at all. They toil and strive and acquire a
nest for themselves; but where&#8217;s the sense in it, after
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that? What&#8217;s sense?&#8221; asked
Tikhon Ilitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what I say. One must use sense in making
one&#8217;s nest. I&#8217;ll weave me a nest, says the man, and
then I&#8217;ll live as a man should. In this way and in
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Kuzma tapped his breast and his brow with
his finger.</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch poured himself out another glass of
liquor. Kuzma, having donned a silver-framed pair
of eyeglasses, sipped the boiling-hot amber fluid from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
his saucer. Tikhon Ilitch gazed at him with beaming
eyes; and after turning something over in his mind, he
said: &#8220;Evidently, brother, that sort of thing is not
for the likes of us. If you live in the country, sup
your coarse cabbage-soup and wear wretched bast-shoes.
Do as your neighbours do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bast-shoes!&#8221; retorted Kuzma tartly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been
wearing them a couple of thousand years, brother&mdash;the
thrice-accursed things! For two thousand years we&#8217;ve
been living with our mouths agape. We&#8217;re doing the
devil&#8217;s work. And who is to blame? What I have to
say about it is this: &#8217;tis high time to get ashamed of
casting shame for everything on our neighbours&mdash;blaming
our neighbours instead of ourselves! The Tatars
oppressed us, you see! We&#8217;re a young nation, you see!
Just as if, over there in Europe, all sorts of Mongols
didn&#8217;t oppress folks a lot, too! As if the Germans
were any older than we are! Well, anyhow, that&#8217;s a
special subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct!&#8221; said Tikhon Ilitch. &#8220;Come on, we&#8217;d better
get down to business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma turned his empty glass upside down on the
saucer, lighted a cigarette, and resumed his exposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t go to church.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That signifies that you are a molokan?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> asked
Tikhon Ilitch, and said to himself: &#8220;I&#8217;m lost! Evidently,
I must get rid of Durnovka!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sort of molokan,&#8221; grinned Kuzma. &#8220;And do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
go to church? If it weren&#8217;t for fear and necessity,
one would forget all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not the first, neither am I the last,&#8221; retorted
Tikhon Ilitch, again contracting his brows in a
scowl. &#8220;We are all sinners. But &#8217;tis stated, you
know: One sigh buys forgiveness for everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re saying the usual things!&#8221; he remarked, severely.
&#8220;But if you will only pause and reflect, how
can that be so? You&#8217;ve been living on and on pig-fashion
all your life, and you utter a sigh&mdash;and everything
is wiped out without leaving a trace! Is there
any sense in that, or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation was becoming painful. &#8220;That&#8217;s
correct,&#8221; Tikhon Ilitch said to himself, as he stared at
the table with flashing eyes. But, as always, he
wanted to dodge thought, and discussion about God
and about life; and he said the first thing that came
to the tip of his tongue: &#8220;I&#8217;d be glad enough to go
to Paradise, but my sins won&#8217;t let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, there!&#8221; Kuzma caught him up,
tapping the table with his finger-nail. &#8220;The very
thing we love the best, our most pernicious characteristic,
is precisely that: words are one thing,
deeds are quite another! &#8217;Tis the genuine Russian
tune, brother: I live disgustingly, pig-fashion, but
nevertheless I am living, and I shall continue to live,
pig-fashion! You&#8217;re a type, brother! A type!&mdash;Well,
now talk business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pealing of the bells had ceased, the canary had
quieted down. People had assembled in the eating-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and conversation was increasing at the little
tables. A waiter opened a window, and chatter from
the bazaar also became audible. Somewhere in a shop
a quail was uttering his call, very clearly and melodiously.
And while the business talk was in progress
Kuzma kept listening to it, and from time to time interposed,
&#8220;That&#8217;s clever!&#8221; in an undertone. And when
all had been said he slapped the table with the palm
of his hand and said energetically: &#8220;Well, all right,
so be it&mdash;don&#8217;t let&#8217;s discuss it!&#8221; and thrusting his hand
into the side pocket of his short coat, he drew forth a
regular heap of papers and paper scraps, sorted out
from among them a small book in a grey-marbled
binding, and laid it in front of his brother. &#8220;There!&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I yield to your request and to my own weakness.
&#8217;Tis a wretched little book, casual verses, written
long ago. But &#8217;tis done, and it cannot be helped.
Here, take it and put it out of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>And once more Tikhon Ilitch, who had already become
extremely red in the face from the vodka, was
agitated by the consciousness that his brother was an
author; that upon that grey-marbled cover was printed:
&#8220;Poems by K. I. Krasoff.&#8221; He turned the book about
in his hands, and said diffidently: &#8220;Suppose you read
me something. Hey? Pray do, read me three or four
verses.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, with head bent low and in some confusion,
holding the book at a distance and gazing severely at
it through his glasses, Kuzma read the sort of thing
which the self-taught usually write: imitations of Koltzoff
and Nikitin, complaints against Fate and misery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
challenges to impending storm-clouds and bad weather.
It is true that he himself was conscious that all this
was old and false. But behind the alien, incongruous
form lay the truth&mdash;that which had been violently and
painfully experienced at some time or other. And
upon his thin cheek-bones patches of pink made their
appearance, and his voice trembled from time to time.
Tikhon Ilitch&#8217;s eyes gleamed, too. It was of no importance
whether the verses were good or bad&mdash;the
important point was that they had been composed by
his own brother, a poor man, a simple plain fellow
who reeked of cheap tobacco and old boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;But with us, Kuzma Ilitch,&#8221; he said when Kuzma
had finished and, removing his eyeglasses, dropped his
eyes, &#8220;but with us there is only one song.&#8221; And he
twisted his lips unpleasantly and bitterly: &#8220;The
only song we know is: &#8216;What&#8217;s the price of pig&#8217;s
bristles?&#8217;&#8221;</p>




<h3>XII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">NEVERTHELESS, after establishing his brother
at Durnovka he set about singing that song
with more gusto than ever. Before placing
Durnovka in his brother&#8217;s hands, he had picked a quarrel
with Rodka over some new harness-straps which
had been devoured by the dogs, and had discharged
him. Rodka smiled insolently by way of reply and
calmly strode off to his cottage to collect his belongings.
The Bride, also, listened with apparent composure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to the dismissal. On breaking with Tikhon Ilitch
she had resumed her habit of maintaining silence and
never looking him in the eye. But half an hour later,
when he had got everything together, Rodka came,
accompanied by her, to ask forgiveness. The Bride
remained standing on the threshold, pale, her eyes
swollen with weeping, and held her peace; Rodka
bowed his head, fumbled with his cap, and also made
an effort to weep,&mdash;it resulted in a repulsive grimace,&mdash;but
Tikhon Ilitch sat at the table with lowering
brows and rattled the balls on his abacus, shaking
his head the while. Not one of the three could raise
his eyes&mdash;especially the Bride, who felt herself the
most guilty of them all&mdash;and their entreaties were unavailing.
Tikhon Ilitch showed mercy on one point
only: he did not deduct the price of the straps from
their wages.</p>

<p>Now he was on a firm foundation. Having got rid
of Rodka and transferred his affairs to his brother&#8217;s
charge, he felt alert, at his ease. &#8220;My brother is unreliable,
a trifling fellow, apparently, but he&#8217;ll do for
the present!&#8221; And returning to Vorgol he bustled
about unweariedly through the whole month of October.
Nastasya Petrovna was ailing all the time&mdash;her
feet, hands, and face were swollen and yellow&mdash;and
Tikhon Ilitch now began to meditate at times on the
possibility of her dying, and bore himself with increasing
lenience to her weakness, to her uselessness in all
affairs connected with the house and the shop. And,
as though in harmony with his mood, magnificent
weather prevailed during the whole of October. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
suddenly it broke up and was followed by storms and
torrents of rain; and in Durnovka something utterly
unexpected came to pass.</p>

<p>During October Rodka had been working on the
railway line, and the Bride had been sitting, without
work, at home, enduring the reproaches of her mother
and only occasionally earning fifteen or twenty kopeks
in the garden of the manor. But her behaviour was
peculiar: at home she said never a word, but only
wept, and in the garden she was shrilly merry, shouted
with laughter, sang songs with Donka the Goat, an
extremely stupid and pretty little girl who resembled
an Egyptian. The Goat was living with a petty
burgher who had leased the garden, while the Bride,
who for some reason or other had struck up a friendship
with her, made bold eyes at her brother, an impudent
youth, and as she ogled him hinted in song
that she was wasting away with love for some one.
Whether anything occurred between them was not
known, but the whole affair ended in a great catastrophe.
When the petty burghers were departing for
the town just before the Feast of Our Lady of Kazan
they arranged an &#8220;evening party&#8221; in their watchman&#8217;s
hut, invited the Goat and the Bride, played all night
on two peasant pipes, fed their guests with crude delicacies,
and gave them tea and vodka for beverages.
And at dawn, when their cart was already harnessed,
they suddenly, with roars of laughter, flung the intoxicated
Bride on the ground, bound her arms, lifted
her petticoats, tied them in a knot over her head, and
began to fasten them securely there with a cord. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Goat started to run away, and made a headlong dive
in her fright into the tall, wet steppe-grass. When
she peeped out from that shelter, after the cart with
the petty burghers had rolled briskly away out of the
garden, she espied the Bride, naked to the waist, hanging
from a tree. The dawn was dreary and overcast;
a fine rain was whispering through the garden. The
Goat wept in streams, and her teeth chattered as she
untied the Bride from the tree, vowing by the memory
of her father and mother that lightning might kill her,
the Goat, but never should they discover in the village
what had taken place in the garden. Nevertheless, not
a week had elapsed before rumours concerning the
Bride&#8217;s disgrace became current in Durnovka.</p>

<p>It was impossible, of course, to verify these rumours:
&#8220;As for seeing it&mdash;why, nobody saw it. Well, and the
Goat&#8217;s tongue was hung in the middle when it came
to telling absurd tales.&#8221; The Bride herself, who had
aged five years in that one week, replied to them with
such insolent vituperation that even her own mother
was terrified by her face at such moments. But the
discussions provoked by the rumours did not cease, and
every one awaited with immense impatience the arrival
of Rodka and his chastisement of his wife.
Much agitated&mdash;once more jarred out of his rut&mdash;Tikhon
Ilitch also awaited that impending chastisement,
having heard from his own labourers of what had occurred
in the garden. Why, that scandal might end
in murder! But it ended in such a manner that it is
still a matter of doubt which would have startled the
Durnovka folks more powerfully&mdash;murder, or such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
termination. On the night before the Feast of St.
Michael, Rodka, who had returned home &#8220;to change
his shirt,&#8221; and who had not laid a finger on the Bride,
died suddenly of &#8220;stomach trouble&#8221;! This became
known in Vorgol late in the evening; but Tikhon
Ilitch instantly gave orders to harness his horse, and
drove at top speed, through the darkness and the rain,
to his brother. And after having gulped down, on
top of his tea, a whole bottle of fruit brandy, he made
confession to him, in his burning excitement, with passionate
expressions, and eyes wildly rolling: &#8220;&#8217;Tis
my fault, brother; the sin is mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>Having heard him out, Kuzma held his peace for a
long time, and for a long time paced up and down the
room plucking at his fingers, twisting them, cracking
their joints. At last he said: &#8220;Just think it over: is
there any nation more ferocious than ours? In town,
if a petty thief snatches from a hawker&#8217;s tray a pancake
worth a farthing, the whole population of the
eating-house section pursues him, and when they catch
him they force him to eat soap. The whole town turns
out for a fire, or a fight, and how sorry they are that
the fire or the fight is so soon ended! Don&#8217;t shake
your head, don&#8217;t do it: they <i>are</i> sorry! And how they
revel in it when some one beats his wife to death, or
thrashes a small boy within an inch of his life, or
jeers at him! That&#8217;s the most amusing thing in the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch inquired: &#8220;What&#8217;s your object in saying
that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&#8220;Just for the sake of talking!&#8221; replied Kuzma, angrily,
and went on: &#8220;Take that half-witted girl,
Fesha, who wanders about Durnovka, for example.
The young fellows squander their last coppers on her&mdash;put
her down on the village common and set to work
whacking her over her cropped head, at the rate of
ten whacks for a farthing! And is that done out of
ill-nature? Yes, out of ill-nature, certainly; and also
from a sort of stupidity, curse it! Well, and that&#8217;s
the case with the Bride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear in mind,&#8221; interrupted Tikhon Ilitch hotly,
&#8220;that there are always plenty of blackguards and blockheads
everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly so. And didn&#8217;t you yourself bring that&mdash;well,
what&#8217;s his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Duck-headed Motya, you mean?&#8221; asked Tikhon
Ilitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it. Didn&#8217;t you bring him here for your
own amusement?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tikhon Ilitch burst out laughing: he had done
that very thing. Once, even, Motya had been sent
to him by the railway in a sugar-cask. The town
was only about an arm&#8217;s length distant, and he knew
the officials&mdash;so they sent the man to him. And the
inscription on the cask ran: &#8220;With care. A complete
Fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And these same fools are taught vices, for amusement!&#8221;
Kuzma went on bitterly.&mdash;&#8220;The yard-gates of
poor brides are smeared with tar! Beggars are hunted
with dogs! For amusement, pigeons are knocked off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
roofs with stones! Yet, as you know, &#8217;tis a great sin
to eat those same pigeons. The Holy Spirit Himself
assumes the form of a dove, you see!&#8221;</p>




<h3>XIII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE samovar had long since grown cold, the
candle had guttered down, smoke hung over the
room in a dull blue cloud, the slop-basin was
filled to the very brim with soggy, reeking cigarette
butts. The ventilator&mdash;a tin pipe in the upper corner
of the window&mdash;was open, and once in a while a
squeaking and a whirling and a terribly tiresome wailing
proceeded from it&mdash;just like the one in the District
offices, Tikhon Ilitch said to himself. But the smoke
was so dense that ten ventilators would have been of
no avail. The rain rattled on the roof and Kuzma
strode from corner to corner and talked:</p>



<p>&#8220;Ye-es! a nice state of things, there&#8217;s no denying it!
Indescribable kindliness! If you read history, your
hair rises upright in horror: brother pitted against
brother, kinsman against kinsman, son against father&mdash;treachery
and murder, murder and treachery. The
Epic legends, too, are a sheer delight: &#8216;he slit his white
breast,&#8217; &#8216;he let his bowels out on the ground,&#8217; &#8216;Ilya did
not spare his own daughter; he stepped on her left foot,
and pulled her right foot.&#8217; And the songs? The same
thing, always the same: the stepmother is &#8216;wicked and
greedy&#8217;; the father-in-law, &#8216;harsh and quarrelsome,&#8217; sits
on the sleeping-shelf above the stove, &#8216;just like a dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
on a rope&#8217;; the mother-in-law, equally wicked, sits on
the stove &#8216;just like a bitch on a chain&#8217;; the sisters-in-law
are invariably &#8216;young dogs and tricksters&#8217;; the
brothers-in-law are &#8216;malicious scoffers&#8217;; the husband is
&#8216;either a fool or a drunkard&#8217;; the &#8216;old father-in-law
bids him beat his wife soundly, until her hide drops
off to her heels&#8217;; while the wife, having &#8216;scrubbed the
floor&#8217; for this same old man, &#8216;ladled out the sour cabbage-soup,
scraped the threshold clean, and baked
turnover-patties,&#8217; addresses this sort of a speech to
her husband: &#8216;Get up, you disgusting fellow, wake
up: here&#8217;s dish-water, wash yourself; here are your
leg-wrappers, wipe yourself; here&#8217;s a bit of rope, hang
yourself.&#8217; And our adages, Tikhon Ilitch! Could
anything more lewd and filthy be invented? And our
proverbs! &#8216;One man who has been soundly thrashed
is worth two who have not been.&#8217; &#8216;Simplicity is worse
than thieving.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, according to you, the best way for a man to
live is like an arrant fool?&#8221; inquired Tikhon Ilitch with
a sneer.</p>

<p>And Kuzma joyfully snapped up his words: &#8220;Well,
that&#8217;s right, that&#8217;s the idea! There&#8217;s nothing in the
whole world so beggar-bare as we are, and on the
other hand there&#8217;s nobody more insolent on the ground
of that same nakedness. What&#8217;s the vicious way to
insult a person? Accuse &#8217;em of poverty! Say:
&#8216;You devil! You haven&#8217;t a morsel to eat.&#8217; Here&#8217;s
an illustration: Deniska&mdash;well, I mean the son
of Syery, he&#8217;s a cobbler&mdash;said to me the other
day&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; interrupted Tikhon Ilitch. &#8220;How&#8217;s
Syery himself getting on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deniska says he&#8217;s &#8216;perishing with hunger.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good-for-nothing peasant!&#8221; said Tikhon Ilitch
with conviction. &#8220;Don&#8217;t sing any of your songs about
him to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not singing!&#8221; retorted Kuzma angrily. &#8220;But
I ought to do it. For his name is Krasoff. However,
that&#8217;s another story. You&#8217;d better listen to what I
have to say about Deniska. Well, he told me this:
&#8216;Sometimes, in a famine year, we foremen would go to
the neighbourhood of the cemetery in the Black Suburb;
and there those public women were&mdash;regular
troops of them. And they were hungry, the lean hags,
extremely hungry! If you gave one of them half a
pound of bread for her work she&#8217;d devour it to the last
crumb, there under you. It was downright ridiculous!&#8217;
Take note,&#8221; cried Kuzma sternly, pausing: &#8220;&#8216;It was
downright ridiculous&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, stop it, for Christ&#8217;s sake!&#8221; Tikhon Ilitch interrupted
again. &#8220;Give me a chance to say a word
about business!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma stopped short. &#8220;Well, talk away,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Only, what are you going to say? Tell him &#8216;You
ought to do thus and so&#8217;? Not a bit of it! If you
give him money&mdash;that&#8217;s the end of it. Just think it
over: they have no fuel, they have nothing to eat, nothing
to pay for a funeral. That means,&#8217;tis your most
sacred duty to give them some money&mdash;well, and
something more to boot: a few potatoes, a wagon-load<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
or two of straw. And hire the Bride. Send her here
as my cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>And immediately Tikhon Ilitch felt as though a
stone had been rolled off his breast. He hastily drew
out his purse, plucked out a ten-ruble banknote, joyfully
assented also to all the other suggestions. And
suddenly he asked once more, in a rapid distressed
voice: &#8220;But didn&#8217;t she poison him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma merely shrugged his shoulders by way of
reply.</p>

<p>Whether she had poisoned him or not, it was a terrible
matter to think about. And Tikhon Ilitch went
home as soon as it was light, through the chill, misty
morning, when the odour of damp threshing-floors and
smoke still hung in the air, while the cocks were crowing
sleepily in the haze-wrapped village, and the dogs
lay sleeping on the porches, and the old faded-yellow
turkey still snoozed roosting on the bough of an apple
tree half stripped of its discoloured dead autumn
leaves, by the side of a house. In the fields nothing
could be seen at a distance of two paces, thanks to the
dense white fog driven before the wind. Tikhon
Ilitch felt no desire to sleep, but he did feel exhausted,
and as usual whipped up his horse, a large brown mare
with her tail tied up; she was soaked with the moisture
and appeared leaner, more dandified, and blacker because
of it. He turned his head away from the wind
and raised the cold wet collar of his overcoat on the
right side, all glistening like silver under tiny pearls
of rain which covered it with a thick veil. He observed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
through the cold little drops which hung on
his eyelashes, how the sticky black loam was churned
up in ever-increasing density by his swiftly-revolving
wheels, and how clods of mud, spurting high in a
regular fountain, hung in the air and did not disperse;
how they already began to adhere to his boots and
knees. And he darted a glance at the heaving
haunches of his horse; at her ears laid flat back
against her head and darkened by the rain. And
when, at last, his face streaked with mud, he dashed
up to his own house, the first thing that met his eyes
was Yakoff&#8217;s horse at the hitching-bar. Hastily knotting
the reins on the fore-carriage, he sprang from the
runabout, ran to the open door of the shop&mdash;and halted
abruptly in terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blo-ockhead!&#8221; Nastasya Petrovna was saying
from her place behind the counter, in evident imitation
of himself, Tikhon Ilitch, but in an ailing, caressing
voice, as she bent lower and lower over the money-drawer
and fumbled along the jingling coppers, unable,
in the darkness, to find coins for change. &#8220;Blockhead!
Where could you get it any cheaper, at the
present time?&#8221; And, not finding the change, she
straightened up and looked at Yakoff, who stood before
her in cap and overcoat, but barefoot. She stared
at his slightly elevated face and scraggy beard of indeterminate
hue, and added: &#8220;But didn&#8217;t she poison
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Yakoff mumbled in haste: &#8220;That&#8217;s no affair
of ours, Petrovna. The devil only knows. It&#8217;s none
of our business. Our business, for example&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>And Tikhon Ilitch&#8217;s hands shook all day long as
that mumbling answer recurred to his mind. Everybody,
<i>everybody</i>, thought she had poisoned him!</p>

<p>Fortunately, the secret remained a secret. The
Sacrament was administered to Rodka before he died.
And the Bride wailed so sincerely as she followed the
coffin that it was positively indecent&mdash;for, of course,
that wailing should not be an expression of the feelings,
but the fulfilment of a rite. And little by little
Tikhon Ilitch&#8217;s perturbation subsided. But for a long
time still he continued to go about more gloomy than
a thunder-cloud.</p>




<h3>XIV</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">HE was immersed to the throat in business&mdash;as
usual&mdash;and he had no one to help him. Nastasya
Petrovna was of very little assistance.
Tikhon Ilitch never hired any labourers except &#8220;summer-workers&#8221;
who were taken on merely until the cattle
were driven home from pasturage, and they were
already dispersed. Only the servants by the year remained&mdash;the
cook, the old watchman nicknamed
&#8220;Chaff,&#8221; and Oska, a lad of seventeen who was both
lazy and ugly of disposition, &#8220;the Tsar of Heaven&#8217;s
dolt&#8221;&mdash;a most egregious fool. And how much attention
the cattle alone demanded! After the necessary
sheep were slaughtered and salted down, twenty remained
to be cared for over the winter. There were
six black boar-pigs in the sty, eternally sullen and discontented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
over something or other. In the barns stood
three cows, a young bull, and a red calf. In the yard
were eleven horses, and in a box-stall stood a grey
stallion, a vicious, heavy, full-maned, broad-chested
brute&mdash;a half-breed, but worth four hundred rubles:
his sire had a certificate, and was worth fifteen hundred.
And all these required constant and careful oversight.
But in his leisure moments Tikhon Ilitch was devoured
by melancholy and boredom.</p>

<p>The very sight of Nastasya Petrovna irritated him,
and he was constantly urging her to go away for a
visit with acquaintances in the town. And at last she
made her preparations and went. But after she was
gone, somehow, he found things more boresome than
ever. After seeing her off, Tikhon Ilitch wandered
aimlessly over the fields. Along the highway, gun over
shoulder, came the chief of the post-office at Ulianovka,
Sakharoff, famed because of his passion for ordering
by letter free price-lists&mdash;catalogues of guns,
seeds, musical instruments&mdash;and because of his manner
of treating the peasants, which was so savage that they
were wont to say: &#8220;When you pass in a letter, your
hands and feet fairly shake!&#8221; Tikhon Ilitch went to
the edge of the highway to meet him. Elevating his
brows, he gazed at the postmaster and said to himself:
&#8220;A fool of an old man. He slumps along through the
mud like an elephant.&#8221; But he called out, in friendly
tones:</p>

<p>&#8220;Been hunting, Anton Markitch?&#8221;</p>

<p>The postmaster halted. Tikhon Ilitch approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and gave him a formal greeting. &#8220;Had any luck, or
not, I say?&#8221; he inquired, mockingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hunting, indeed! Nothing to hunt!&#8221; gloomily replied
the postmaster, a huge, round-shouldered man
with thick grey hairs protruding from his ears and his
nostrils, huge eye-sockets, and deeply sunken eyes&mdash;a
regular gorilla. &#8220;I merely strolled out on account of
my hæmorrhoids,&#8221; he said, pronouncing the last word
with special care.</p>

<p>&#8220;But bear in mind,&#8221; retorted Tikhon Ilitch with unexpected
heat, stretching forth his hand with the fingers
outspread, &#8220;bear in mind that our countryside has been
completely devastated! Not so much as the name of
bird or beast is left, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The forests have all been cut down,&#8221; remarked the
postmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think they had been cut down, forsooth!
Shaved off close to the earth!&#8221; Tikhon Ilitch corroborated
him. And all of a sudden he added: &#8220;&#8217;Tis
moulting, sir! Everything is moulting, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>Why that word broke loose from his tongue, Tikhon
Ilitch himself did not know, but he felt that, nevertheless,
it had not been uttered without reason. &#8220;Everything&#8217;s
moulting,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;exactly like
the cattle after a long, hard winter.&#8221; And after he
had parted from the postmaster he stood long on the
highway, involuntarily gazing about him. The rain
had again begun to patter down; a disagreeable, damp
wind was blowing. Darkness was descending over
the rolling fields&mdash;the fields sown with winter-grain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the ploughed fields, the stubble-fields, and the light
brown groves of young trees.</p>

<p>The gloomy sky descended lower and lower over the
earth. The roads, flooded by the rain, gleamed with
a leaden sheen. The post-train from Moscow, which
was an hour and a half late every day, was due at the
station. Only from the signal-bells, the humming
sounds, the rumbling, and the odour of coal and samovars
in the yards, did Tikhon Ilitch know that it had
arrived and departed, for buildings screened the station
from view. The odour of samovars now remained,
and that aroused a dim longing for comfort, a warm
clean room, a family&mdash;or the desire to go away somewhere
or other.</p>

<p>But this feeling was suddenly replaced by amazement.
From the bare Ulianovka forest a man emerged
and directed his steps towards the highway&mdash;a man in
a round-topped hat and only a short roundabout coat.
On looking more closely, Tikhon Ilitch recognized
Zhikhareff, the son of a wealthy land-owner, who had
long since become a thoroughgoing drunkard. His
heart contracted with pain. &#8220;Well, it makes no difference,&#8221;
thought Tikhon Ilitch sadly. &#8220;&#8217;Twill be best
to chat a bit with him and, in case of need, give him
half a ruble. &#8217;Tis not worth while to anger the vagabond:
he&#8217;s a spiteful fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>But on this occasion Zhikhareff approached in a
decidedly arrogant frame of mind, bristling, but with
his head, in its beggar&#8217;s hat, thrown back, and chewing
between his clenched jaws the mouth end of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
cigarette, long since smoked out and extinct. His face
was blue with the cold, puffy with drunkenness; his
eyes were red, and his mustache disheveled. He had
turned up the collar of his short coat, which was buttoned
to the chin, and, with the tips of his fingers
thrust into the pockets, he was splashing along in a
spirited manner through the mud. His rusty, dilapidated
high boots projected below his short trousers,
which were tightly strained over his knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;A&mdash;ah!&#8221; he drawled through his teeth, as he chewed
his cigarette-butt. &#8220;Whom do I see? Tikhon Fomitch<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
is looking over his domains!&#8221; And he emitted a
hoarse laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-day, Lyeff Lvovitch,&#8221; replied Tikhon Ilitch.
&#8220;Are you waiting for the train?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am&mdash;and I never seem to hit it,&#8221; returned
Zhikhareff, shrugging his shoulders. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting
and waiting, and I got so bored that I&#8217;ve been
making the forester a little visit. We&#8217;ve been chattering
and smoking. But I&#8217;ve still a whole eternity to
wait! Shall we not meet at the station? I believe
you are fond of putting something behind your collar
yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God has been gracious,&#8221; replied Tikhon Ilitch, in
the same tone he had used before. &#8220;As for drinking&mdash;why
shouldn&#8217;t a man drink a bit? Only, he must pick
the proper time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;Fudge and nonsense!&#8221; said Zhikhareff hoarsely,
skipping across a puddle with considerable agility, and
he directed his course towards the railway station at a
leisurely pace.</p>

<p>His aspect was pitiful, and Tikhon Ilitch gazed long
and with disgust at his inadequate trousers, which hung
down like bags from beneath his short coat.</p>




<h3>XV</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">DURING the night the rain poured down again,
and it was so dark you could not see your hand
before your face. Tikhon Ilitch slept badly
and gritted his teeth in torture. He had a chill&mdash;evidently
he had taken cold by standing on the highway
in the evening&mdash;and the overcoat which he had
thrown over himself slid off upon the floor, and immediately
he dreamed the same thing he had always
dreamed ever since childhood, whenever his back was
cold: twilight, narrow alleys, a hurrying throng, firemen
galloping along in heavy carts drawn by vicious
black truck-horses. Once he woke up, struck a match,
looked at the ticking clock&mdash;it showed the hour of three&mdash;and
picked up the overcoat; and, as he fell asleep,
the thought of Zhikhareff once more recurred distressingly
to his mind. And athwart his slumbers a persistent
thought obsessed him: that the shop was being
looted and the horses driven away.</p>

<p>Sometimes it seemed to him that he was at the Dankova
posting-station, that the nocturnal rain was pattering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
on the pent-house over the gate, and that the
little bell above it was being pulled and was ringing
incessantly&mdash;thieves had come and had led thither,
through the impenetrable darkness, his splendid stallion,
and if they were to discover his presence there,
they would murder him. And again consciousness of
the reality would return to him. But even the reality
was alarming. The old watchman was walking about
under the windows with his mallet, but it seemed as if
he were far, far away; as if the sheep-dog, with choking
growls, were rending some one&mdash;had rushed off into
the fields with tempestuous barking, and suddenly had
presented himself again under the windows and was
trying to rouse him by standing on one spot and barking
violently. Then Tikhon Ilitch started to go out
and see what was the matter, whether everything were
as it should be. But as soon as he reached the point
of making up his mind to rise, the heavy slanting rain
began to rattle more thickly and densely than ever
against the small dark windows, driven by the wind
from the dark and boundless fields, and sleep seemed
to him the most precious thing in the world. At last
a door banged, a stream of damp, cold air entered, and
the watchman, Chaff, dragged a bundle of rustling
straw into the vestibule. Tikhon Ilitch opened his
eyes: it was six o&#8217;clock, the daylight was dull and wet,
the tiny windows were misted over with moisture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make a little fire, my good man, make a little fire,&#8221;
said Tikhon Ilitch, his voice still hoarse with sleep.
&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll go and feed the cattle, and you can go to
your place and sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>The old man, who had grown thin over night and all
blue with cold, the dampness, and fatigue, gazed at
him with sunken dead eyes. In his wet cap, his short
rain-drenched outer coat, and his ragged bast-slippers
soaked with mud and water, he growled out something
in a dull tone as he got down with difficulty on his
knees in front of the stove, stuffing it with the cold,
fragrant bundle of straw and blowing on the lighted
mass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, has the cow bitten your tongue off?&#8221; shouted
Tikhon Ilitch hoarsely, as he climbed out of bed and
picked up his coat from the floor. &#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;re
muttering there to yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been walking all night long, and now it&#8217;s &#8216;give
the cattle their fodder,&#8217;&#8221; mumbled the old man without
raising his head, as if talking to himself.</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch looked askance at him: &#8220;I saw the
way you walked about!&#8221;</p>

<p>He felt worn out; nevertheless he put on his coat
and, conquering a petty fit of shivering in his bowels,
went out on the porch, which was covered with the
footprints of the dogs, into the icy chill of the pale
stormy morning. Everywhere the ground was flooded
with lead-coloured puddles; all the walls had turned
dark with the rain.</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice lot; these workmen!&#8221; he said to himself angrily.</p>

<p>It was barely drizzling. &#8220;But surely it will be pouring
again by noon,&#8221; he said to himself. And he
glanced with surprise at shaggy Buyan, who dashed
toward him from under the granary. His paws were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
muddy, but he himself was boiling with excitement, his
eyes were sparkling, his tongue was fresh and red as
fire, his healthy hot breath fairly exuding the odour
of dog. And that after racing about and barking all
night long!</p>

<p>He took Buyan by the collar and, slopping through
the mud, made the rounds, inspecting all the locks.
Then he chained the dog under the granary, returned
to his ante-room, and glanced into the roomy kitchen,
the cottage proper. The cottage had a hot, repulsive
odour; the cook lay fast asleep on a bare box-bench,
beneath the holy pictures, her face covered with her
apron, her loins displayed, and her legs clad in huge
old felt boots, the soles thickly plastered with the dirt
from the earthen floors. Oska lay on the sleeping-board
face downward, fully dressed, in his short sheepskin
coat and his bast-slippers, his head buried in a
heavy, soiled pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;That devil has been at the lad!&#8221; thought Tikhon
Ilitch with disgust. &#8220;Just look at her&mdash;at her nasty
debauch all night long&mdash;and towards morning, off she
goes to the bench!&#8221;</p>

<p>And after a survey of the black walls, the tiny windows,
the tub filled with dirty dish-water, the huge
broad-shouldered stove, he shouted loudly and harshly:
&#8220;Hey, there! My noble lords! You ought to know
when you&#8217;ve had enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>While the cook, scratching herself and yawning,
heated the stove, boiled some potatoes for the pigs, and
got the samovar alight, Oska, minus his cap and stumbling
with sleep, dragged bran for the horses and cows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Tikhon Ilitch himself unlocked the creaking doors of
the stable and was the first to enter its warm, dirty
comfort, surrounded by sheds, enclosures, and styes.
The stable was ankle-deep in manure. Dung, urine,
and rain had all run together and formed a thick,
light-brown fluid. The horses, already darkening with
their velvety winter coats, were roaming about under
the pent-houses. The sheep, of a dirty-grey hue, were
huddled in an agitated mass in one corner. An old
brown gelding dozed in isolation alongside his empty
manger, smeared with dough. The drizzling rain fell
and fell interminably upon the square farmyard from
the unfriendly, stormy sky, but the gelding paid no
heed to anything. The pigs moaned and grunted in
an ailing, persistent way in their pen.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis deadly boresome!&#8221; thought Tikhon Ilitch,
and immediately emitted a fierce yell at the old man,
who was dragging along a bundle of grain-straw:
&#8220;Why are you dragging that through the mud, you
vile profligate?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man flung the bundle of straw on the
ground, looked him over, and all at once remarked
quietly: &#8220;I&#8217;m listening to a vile profligate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch cast a swift glance around, to see
whether the lad had gone out, and, on convincing himself
that he had, stepped up to the old man and with
apparent calmness gave him such a thwack in the teeth
that his head shook to and fro, seized him by the
collar, and hustled him to the gate with all his might.
&#8220;Begone!&#8221; he bawled, panting for breath and turning
as white as chalk. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let me ever catch so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
as the smell of you here in the future, you cursed tatterdemalion!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man flew through the gate, and five minutes
later, his bag on his shoulders and a stick in his hand,
he was striding along the highway to his home in Ulianovka.
Meanwhile Tikhon Ilitch, with shaking hands,
had watered the stallion, had himself given the animal
his portion of fresh oats&mdash;he had merely turned yesterday&#8217;s
oats over with his muzzle and slobbered on
them&mdash;and with long strides, through the liquid mess
and the manure, had betaken himself to his cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are things ready?&#8221; he inquired, opening the door
a crack.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no hurry!&#8221; snarled the cook.</p>

<p>The cottage was beclouded with a warm, sweetish
steam emanating from the pot where the potatoes were
boiling. The cook, assisted by the lad, was energetically
mashing them with a pestle, sprinkling in flour
the while, and Tikhon Ilitch did not hear the reply
because of the noise. Slamming the door, he went to
drink his tea.</p>




<h3>XVI</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the tiny ante-room he pushed aside with his foot
a heavy, dirty horsecloth which lay across the
threshold and went to one corner, where, over a
stool surmounted by a pewter basin, a brass washstand
was fastened, while on a small shelf lay a small,
clammy piece of cocoanut-oil soap. As he rattled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
water-tank, squinted, frowned, and puffed out his nostrils,
he was not able to refrain from a malicious fugitive
glance, and he remarked with peculiar distinctness:
&#8220;H&#8217;m! No, who ever saw the like of the labourers?
There&#8217;s no getting on with them at all nowadays!
Say one word to such a fellow, and he&#8217;ll come
back at you with ten words! Say a dozen to him,
and he&#8217;ll fling you back a hundred! They&#8217;re gone
dead crazy! Though it isn&#8217;t summer time, there&#8217;s
plenty of you to be had, you devils! You&#8217;ll want
something to eat for the winter, brother&mdash;you&#8217;ll come,
you son of a dog, you&#8217;ll co-ome, and bow lo-o-ow in
entreaty!&#8221;</p>

<p>The towel, which served for the master as well as
for the lodger-travellers, had been hanging beside the
water-tank since St. Michael&#8217;s Day. It was so filthy
that Tikhon Ilitch gritted his teeth when he looked at
it. &#8220;Okh!&#8221; he ejaculated, closing his eyes and
shaking his head. &#8220;Ugh! Holy Mother, Queen of
Heaven!&#8221; And hurling the towel on the floor, he
wiped himself on the embroidered skirt of his shirt,
which flapped outside his waistcoat.</p>

<p>Two doors opened from the ante-room. One, on the
left, led to the room assigned to travellers, which was
long, half-dark, and with tiny windows that looked out
on the barn; in it stood two large divans, hard as stone,
covered with black oilcloth, filled more than full with
living and with crushed and dried bugs, while on the
partition-wall hung the portrait of some general with
fierce beaver-like side whiskers. This portrait was
bordered with small portraits of heroes of the Russo-Turkish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
war, and underneath was an inscription:
&#8220;Long will our children and our dear Slavic brethren
remember the glorious deeds; how our father, the
courageous Suleiman Pasha, crushed and conquered the
treacherous foemen and marched with his lads along
such crags as only clouds and the feathered Kings of
the air were wont to scale.&#8221; The second door led into
the master&#8217;s room. There, on the right alongside the
door, glittered the glass of a cupboard, on the left a
stove-bench gleamed white; the stove had cracked at
some past day, and over the white it had been smeared
with clay, which had imparted to it the outline of
something resembling a thin, dislocated man, which
seriously displeased Tikhon Ilitch. Beyond the stove
rose aloft a double bed: above the bed was nailed
up a rug of dull-green and brick-coloured wool, bearing
the image of a tiger with whiskers and ears which
stood erect like those of a cat. Opposite the door,
against the wall, stood a chest of drawers covered with
a knitted tablecloth, and on the tablecloth Nastasya
Petrovna&#8217;s wedding-casket. In the casket lay contracts
with the labourers, phials containing medicines
long since spoiled with age, matches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wanted in the shop!&#8221; screamed the cook, opening
the door a crack.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no hurry&mdash;the goats in the bazaar can
wait!&#8221; replied Tikhon Ilitch wrathfully&mdash;but he hurried
out.</p>

<p>The distance was veiled by a watery mist; the effect
resembled that of twilight. The rain still drizzled on,
but the wind had veered round; it was now blowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
from the North, and the air had grown colder. The
freight train, which was just pulling out of the station,
rattled more cheerfully and resoundingly than it had
for many days past.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Morning, Ilitch,&#8221; said the hare-lipped peasant,
who was holding a wet piebald horse at the porch, as
he nodded his soaking fur cap, which was of the tall
Mandzhurian shape.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Morning,&#8221; nodded Tikhon Ilitch, casting a sidelong
glance at the strong white tooth which gleamed
through the peasant&#8217;s cleft lip. &#8220;What do you need?&#8221;
And, hastily providing the salt and kerosene required,
he hurried back to his chamber. &#8220;The dogs, they
don&#8217;t give a man time to make the sign of the cross on
his brow!&#8221; he grumbled as he went.</p>

<p>The samovar, which stood on a table against the
partition-wall, was bubbling and boiling hard; the
small mirror which hung above the table was enveloped
in a thin layer of white steam. The windows and the
chromo-lithograph which was nailed to the wall under
the mirror&mdash;it depicted a giant in a yellow kaftan and
red morocco boots, with a Russian banner in his hand,
from beneath which peeped the towers and domes of
the Moscow Kremlin&mdash;were also veiled in steam. Photographic
portraits framed in shell-work surrounded
this picture. In the place of honour hung the portrait
of a priest in a moiré cassock, with a small, sparse
beard, plump cheeks, and extremely small penetrating
eyes. And, with a glance at him, Tikhon Ilitch crossed
himself violently towards the holy pictures in the corner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Then he removed from the samovar a smoke-begrimed
teapot and poured out a cup of tea, which
smelled very much like a steamed bathroom.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t give a man a chance to cross himself,&#8221;
he said, wrinkling his face with the expression of a
person suffering martyrdom. &#8220;They fairly cut my
throat, curse them!&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed as if there were something which he ought
to call to mind, to take under consideration, or as if he
ought simply to go to bed and get a good sleep. He
longed for warmth, repose, clearness, firmness of
thought. He rose, went to the glass cupboard with its
rattling panes and cups and saucers, and took from one
of the shelves a bottle of liqueur flavoured with mountain-ash
berries and a cask-shaped glass on which was
inscribed: &#8220;Even monks take this.&#8221; &#8220;But perhaps I
oughtn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said aloud. However, he lacked firmness.
Through his mind, against his will, flashed the
old saw: &#8220;Drink and you&#8217;ll die, and don&#8217;t drink and
you&#8217;ll die just the same.&#8221; So he poured out a glassful
and tossed it off, poured out another and gulped
that down, also. And, munching at a thick cracknel,
he sat down at the table.</p>

<p>He became conscious of an agreeable burning sensation
inside, and eagerly sipped the boiling tea from
his saucer, sucking at a lump of sugar which he held
in his teeth. He felt better, so far as his body was
concerned. But his soul went on living its own life,
which was both gloomy and melancholy. Thoughts
followed thoughts, but there was no sense in them. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
he sipped his tea, he cast an abstracted and suspicious
glance sidelong at the partition-wall, at the man in
the yellow kaftan, at the photographs in the shell-work
frames, and even at the priest in his watered-silk
cassock. &#8220;Lerigion means nothing to us pigs!&#8221; he
said to himself; and, as though by way of justifying
himself to some one, he added roughly: &#8220;Just you
try living in the village, and drinking sparkling kvas,
like us!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he gazed askance at the priest he felt that
everything was dubious; even his habitual reverence
for that priest seemed doubtful, not founded
on reason. When one really came to think about
it....</p>

<p>But at this point he made haste to transfer his glance
to the Moscow Kremlin. &#8220;Shame on me!&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been in Moscow since I was born!&#8221;
No, he had not. And why? His pigs wouldn&#8217;t let
him! Now it was his petty trading which hindered,
now the posting-station, then the pot-house, then Durnovka.
And now he could not get away because of
the stallion and the boar-pigs. But why speak of
Moscow? For the last ten years he had been intending,
without success, to get as far as the little birch
grove that lay the other side of the highway. He had
kept on hoping that somehow or other he would manage
to tear himself free for an evening, carry a rug
and samovar with him, sit on the grass in the cool air,
in the greenery&mdash;and he simply had not been able to
get away. The days flowed past like water between
the fingers, and before one had time to gather one&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
wits together, one&#8217;s fiftieth year had knocked at the
door, and that meant the end of everything, and it
didn&#8217;t seem so very long ago that one was running
about without any breeches, did it? Just as if it had
been yesterday!</p>




<h3>XVII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE faces gazed out in complete immobility from
their shell-work frames. Here was a scene
which had never taken place and could not take
place: In the field, amid the thick-growing rye, lay
two persons&mdash;Tikhon Ilitch himself and a young merchant
named Rostovtzeff, holding in their hands glasses
exactly half filled with dark beer. What a close
friendship had sprung up between Rostovtzeff and Tikhon
Ilitch! How well he remembered that grey day
in Carnival Week when the picture was taken! But
in what year had that happened? What had become
of Rostovtzeff? Perhaps he had died in Voronezh&mdash;and
now no one knew for a certainty whether he were
still alive in this world or not. And yonder stood
three petty burghers, drawn up in military style and
perfectly wooden, with their hair parted in the middle
and very smooth, dressed in embroidered Russian
shirts opening at the side and long coats, with their
boots well polished&mdash;Butchneff, Vystavkin, and Bogomoloff.
Vystavkin, the one in the middle, was holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in front of his breast the bread and salt of hospitality
on a wooden platter, covered with a towel embroidered
with cocks, while Butchneff and Bogomoloff
each held a holy picture. They had been photographed
on a dusty, windy day, when the grain-elevator
had been blessed&mdash;when the Bishop and the Governor
had come for the ceremony, when Tikhon Ilitch
had felt so proud that he had been one of the crowd
appointed to greet the officials. But what had his
memory retained about that day? Merely this&mdash;that
they had waited beside the elevator for five hours, on
the new brown rails of the track, that the white dust
had been blown in clouds by the wind, that the railway
carriages and the trees were all covered with dust, that
the Governor, a long, lean man, exactly like a corpse
in white trousers with gold stripes, a uniform embroidered
in gold, and a three-cornered hat, walked
towards the deputation in a remarkably deliberate
manner&mdash;that it was very alarming when he began to
speak as he accepted the bread and salt, that every one
had been surprised at the thinness and whiteness of his
hands, and the skin on them, as delicate and gleaming
as the hide stripped from a snake, the brilliant,
polished gold rings and rings with gems on his dry,
slender fingers with their long transparent nails. Now
that Governor was no longer among the living, and
Vystavkin was dead, also. And in another five or
ten years people would be saying, in speaking of Tikhon
Ilitch, too: &#8220;The late Tikhon Ilitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The room had grown warmer and more cosy, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that the stove had got to going well; the little mirror
had cleared off; but nothing was to be seen through the
windows, which were white with a dull steam, indicating
that the weather had grown colder outside. The
insistent grunting of the hungry pigs made itself more
and more audible. And suddenly the grunt was transmuted
into a mighty unanimous roar: obviously the
pigs had heard the voices of the cook and Oska, who
were lugging to them the heavy tub with their mess.
And, without finishing his reflections on death, Tikhon
Ilitch flung his cigarette into the slop-basin, drew on
his overcoat, and hurried out to the barn. With long
strides, sinking deep in the sloppy manure, he opened
the door of the sty with his own hands, and for a long
time kept his greedy, melancholy eyes riveted on the
pigs, which hurled themselves on the trough into
which the steaming mess had been poured.</p>

<p>The thought of death had been interrupted by another:
&#8220;the late,&#8221; as applied to himself, was all right,
but possibly this particular dead man might serve as
an example. Who had he been? An orphan, a beggar,
who had often had no bread to eat for a couple
of days at a stretch. But now? &#8220;Your biography
ought to be written,&#8221; Kuzma had said one day, in
jest. But there was no occasion for jesting, if you
please. He must have had a noddle on his shoulders,
if the wretched little urchin who barely knew how
to read had turned out not Tishka, but Tikhon Ilitch:
that was what it meant.</p>

<p>But all of a sudden the cook, who had also been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
staring intently at the pigs as they jostled one another
and got their forefeet into the trough, hiccoughed
and remarked: &#8220;Okh, O Lord! I only hope some
calamity won&#8217;t happen to us today! Last night I had
a dream&mdash;I thought cattle were being driven into our
farmyard: sheep, cows, all sorts of pigs were being
driven to us. And they were all black, every last one
of them was black!&#8221;</p>

<p>And once more his heart sank within him. Yes,
there were those cattle! The cattle alone were enough
to drive a man to hang himself. Not three hours had
elapsed&mdash;and again you had to seize your keys, again
drag fodder for the whole farmyard. In the common
stall were three milch cows; in special stalls were the
red calf and the bull Bismarck: now they must be
supplied with hay. The horse and sheep got bran for
their dinner, but the stallion&mdash;the devil himself couldn&#8217;t
tell what that beast wanted! He was completely
spoiled. He thrust his muzzle against the grated top
of his door, sniffed at something, and made grimaces:
he curled back his upper lip, bared his rose-coloured
gums and white teeth, distorted his nostrils. And
Tikhon Ilitch, in a rage which surprised even himself,
suddenly yelled at him: &#8220;You spoiled pet, curse you,
may the lightning strike you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he had got his feet wet; he had a chill; it began
to sleet&mdash;and again he had recourse to the mountain-ash-berry
brandy. He ate some potatoes with sunflower-seed
oil, and salted cucumbers, sour cabbage
soup with mushrooms added to it, and wheat groats.
His face got red, his head grew heavy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>




<h3>XVIII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">HE began to feel drowsy, thanks to the vodka,
what he had eaten, and his incoherent thoughts.
Without undressing, merely pulling his muddy
boots off by the simple expedient of rubbing one foot
against the other, he threw himself on his bed. But he
was disturbed by the necessity of rising again almost
immediately: before night oat-straw must be given
to the horses, the cows, and the sheep, and also to
the stallion&mdash;or, no, it would be better to mix it with
hay and moisten and salt it well. Only, if he let himself
go he would certainly fall asleep. Tikhon Ilitch
reached out to the chest of drawers, grasped the alarm-clock,
and began to wind it up. And the alarm-clock
came to life and began to tick&mdash;and the atmosphere
in the chamber seemed to become more tranquil, more
cheerful, under the influence of its rapid, even ticking.
His thoughts began to get confused.</p>

<p>But no sooner had they become drowsily obscure
than a rough, loud sound of ecclesiastical chanting suddenly
made itself audible. Opening his eyes with a
start, Tikhon Ilitch at first could make out only one
thing: two peasants were roaring through their noses,
and a gust of cold air mingled with the odour of wet
great-coats penetrated from the ante-room. Then he
sprang up, sat on the side of his bed, and scrutinized
the peasants to see what sort of men they were, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
suddenly became conscious that his heart had started
beating. One was blind&mdash;a big pock-marked fellow
with a small nose, a long upper lip, and a large round
skull&mdash;and the second was none other than Makar
Ivanovitch!</p>

<p>Makar Ivanovitch had been known, once on a time,
as Makarka&mdash;everybody called him &#8220;Makar-the-Pilgrim&#8221;&mdash;and
one day he entered Tikhon Ilitch&#8217;s dram-shop.
He was roaming somewhither along the highway,
arrayed in bast-slippers, a pointed skull-cap of
ecclesiastical cut, and a dirty under-cassock&mdash;and he
had entered. In his hand was a long staff, painted the
hue of verdigris, with a cross on its upper extremity
and a spear-like point at its lower, a wallet and a
soldier&#8217;s canteen on his back; his face was broad and
the colour of cement, his nostrils were like two gun-barrels,
his nose was broken across the middle like a
saddle-tree, and his eyes were of the sort which often
goes with such noses, light-hued and sharply brilliant.
Shameless, shrewd, greedily smoking one cigarette
after another and emitting the smoke through his nostrils,
speaking in a rough, abrupt tone which completely
excluded any reply, he had made an extremely
pleasant impression on Tikhon Ilitch, in particular by
that tone, because it was immediately evident that he
was &#8220;a thoroughgoing rascal.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Tikon Ilitch kept him with him as his assistant.
He removed his tramp&#8217;s garb and kept him. But
Makarka turned out to be such a thief that it became
necessary to give him a severe thrashing and turn him
out. A year later Makarka rendered himself famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
throughout the entire county by his prophecies&mdash;prophecies
so ill-omened that people began to dread his
visits as they dreaded fire. He would walk up under
some one&#8217;s window and snufflingly strike up, &#8220;Give rest
with the Saints,&#8221; or would make a present of a fragment
of incense or a pinch of dust&mdash;and, infallibly,
that house soon had a corpse.</p>

<p>Now Makarka, in his original garb, staff in hand,
was standing on the threshold and chanting. The
blind man was chiming in, rolling his milky eyes up
under his lids the while, and Tikhon Ilitch, judging
merely from his ill-proportioned features, immediately
set him down as a runaway convict, a terrible and
ruthless wild beast. But what these vagabonds were
singing was even more terrible. The blind man,
gloomily twitching his uplifted brows, sang out boldly,
in a nasty, snuffling tenor voice. Makarka, his immovable
eyes flashing, boomed along in a savage
basso. The effect was immeasurably loud, roughly melodious,
antiquely ecclesiastical, powerful, and menacing:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Damp Mother-Earth is weeping heavily, is sobbing!&#8221;</p>

<p>sang the blind man.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Is Wee-p-i-i-ng hea-vi-ly, is sob-bing!&#8221;</p>

<p>Makarka repeated sharply, with conviction.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Before the Saviour, before His image&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>roared the blind man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Perchance the sinners will repent!&#8221;</p>

<p>threatened Makarka, inflating his insolent nostrils
And merging his basso with the blind man&#8217;s tenor, he
articulated distinctly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;They shall not escape God&#8217;s judgment!</div>
<div class="verse">They shall not escape the fires eternal!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And suddenly he broke off&mdash;in accord with the blind
man&mdash;cleared his throat, and simply, in his habitual
insolent tone, demanded: &#8220;Give us a contribution,
merchant, to warm us up.&#8221; Thereupon, without waiting
for a reply, he strode across the threshold, marched
up to the bed, and thrust a small picture into Tikhon
Ilitch&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>It was a simple clipping from an illustrated journal,
but, as he glanced at it, Tikhon Ilitch felt a sudden
pain in his lower breast. Beneath the picture, which
depicted trees bending before the tempest, a white zig-zag
athwart the storm-cloud, and a falling man, was
the inscription: &#8220;Jean-Paul Richter, killed by lightning.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tikhon Ilitch was dumbfounded.</p>

<p>But he immediately recovered himself. &#8220;Akh, the
scoundrel!&#8221; he said to himself, and he slowly tore the
picture into tiny bits. Then he got out of bed and,
drawing on his boots, said: &#8220;Go scare some one who
is a bigger fool than I am. I know you well, you see,
my good man! Here&mdash;take what&#8217;s right, and&mdash;God
be with you!&#8221; Then he went into the shop, carried
out to Makarka, who was standing with the blind man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
near the porch, a couple of pounds of cracknels and
a couple of herrings, and repeated once more, sternly:
&#8220;The Lord be with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how about some tobacco?&#8221; audaciously demanded
Makarka.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have only a scant supply of it on hand for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Makarka grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct!&#8221; said he. &#8220;That means&mdash;furnish your
own tobacco, I&#8217;ll give the paper&mdash;and let&#8217;s have a
smoke!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Behind the dram-shop in the town tobacco grows
on the bushes,&#8221; retorted Tikhon Ilitch curtly. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t outdo me in foul language, my good man!&#8221; And,
after a pause, he added: &#8220;Hanging&#8217;s too good for you,
Makarka, after the tricks you&#8217;ve played!&#8221;</p>

<p>Makarka surveyed the blind man, who was standing
erect, firmly planted with brows elevated, and asked
him: &#8220;Man of God, what ought we to do, think you?
Strangle him or shoot him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shooting&#8217;s surer,&#8221; replied the blind man gravely.
&#8220;At any rate, that&#8217;s the most direct road.&#8221;</p>




<h3>XIX</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">IT was growing dark, the thick layers of clouds were
turning blue and cold, and there was a touch of
winter in the air. The mud was congealing. Having
got rid of Makarka, Tikhon Ilitch stamped his
frost-bitten feet on the porch and entered the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
There, without removing his coat and cap, he seated
himself on a chair near the little window, began to
smoke, and again became immersed in thought. He
recalled to mind the summer, the rebellion, the Bride,
his brother, his wife&mdash;and that, so far, he had not paid
off his farmhands for their season&#8217;s work. It was his
custom to delay payment. The young girls and children
who came to him on daily wages stood for days
on end at his threshold, complained of their extreme
need, waxed angry, sometimes made insolent remarks.
But he was inexorable. He shouted and called upon
God to witness that he had only two coppers in his
house. &#8220;Search and see if you can find any more!&#8221;&mdash;and
he turned his pockets and his purse inside out
and spat in feigned wrath, as though amazed by the
distrust, the &#8220;dishonesty&#8221; of the suppliants. But now
that custom seemed to him the opposite of good. He
had been ruthlessly harsh with his wife, and cold, and
so complete a stranger to her that, at times, he utterly
forgot her existence. And now, all of a sudden, this
astonished him: good God, why, he had not even the
least idea what sort of person she was! If she were
to die that day, he would not be able to say two words
as to why she had lived, what she had thought, what
she had felt throughout all the long years she had lived
with him&mdash;those years which had merged themselves
into a single year, and had flashed past in ceaseless
cares and anxieties. And what had he to show for all
those worries? He threw away his cigarette, and
lighted a fresh one. Ugh, but that Makarka was a
clever beast! and, once granted that he was clever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
why wasn&#8217;t it possible that he might be able to foresee
things&mdash;when something was coming, and what it was,
and to whom? Something abominable was, indubitably,
awaiting him, Tikhon Ilitch. For one thing,
he was no longer a young man. How many of his contemporaries
were in the other world! And from death
and old age there is no escape! Not even children
would have saved him. And he would not have known
the children, and the children would have found him
as much of a stranger as he had been to all those, alive
or dead, who had been nearly connected with him.
There were as many people on the earth as there are
stars in the sky; but life is short, people come into
being, grow up, and die so rapidly, are so slightly
acquainted with one another, and so quickly forget all
that has happened to them, that it is enough to drive
a man crazy if he once sets about considering the
matter attentively! Only quite recently he had said
to himself: &#8220;My life ought to be written up....&#8221;
But what was there to write about? Nothing. Nothing
at all, or nothing of any consequence. Why, he
himself could recall scarcely anything of that life.
For example, he had completely forgotten his childhood:
once in a while, it is true, a fleeting memory
would flash across his mind of some summer day,
some incident, some playfellow. Once he had singed
somebody&#8217;s cat&mdash;and had been whipped for it. Some
one had given him a little whip with a bird-call whistle
in the handle, and it had made him indescribably
happy. His drunken father had a special way of calling
to him&mdash;caressingly, his voice laden with sadness:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
&#8220;Come to me, Tisha, come, dear lad!&#8221; Then, suddenly,
he would grab him by the hair....</p>

<p>If Ilya Mironoff, the huckster, had still been alive,
Tikhon Ilitch would have supported him out of kindness,
and would have known nothing about him, and
would barely have noticed his existence. It had been
the same way with his mother. Ask him now: &#8220;Do
you remember your mother?&#8221; and he would answer:
&#8220;I remember some crooked old woman who dried the
manure and kept the stove hot, tippled in secret, and
grumbled.&#8221; Nothing more. He had served nearly ten
years with Matorin, but that decade had melted together
into about a day or two: the fine April rain pattering
down and speckling the sheets of iron which,
rattling and clanging, were being loaded into a cart
alongside the neighbouring shop; a grey, frosty noonday,
the pigeons alighting in a noisy flock upon the
snow beside the shop of another neighbour who dealt
in flour, groats, and bran, crowding together, cooing
and flapping their wings, while he and his brother
whipped with an ox-tail a peg-top spinning on the
threshold. Matorin was young, then, and robust, and
purplish-red of complexion, with his chin cleanly
shaven and sandy side-whiskers cut down to half-length.
Now he was poor; he ambled about with the
walk of an old man, his great-coat faded by the sun,
and his capacious cap; ambled from shop to shop,
from one acquaintance to another, played checkers,
lounged in Daeff&#8217;s eating-house, drank a little, got
tipsy and loquacious: &#8220;We are pretty folks: we&#8217;ve
drunk, and eaten, and paid our score&mdash;and off we go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
home!&#8221; And, on encountering Tikhon Ilitch, he did
not immediately recognize him, but would smile woefully
and say: &#8220;Is that really you, Tisha?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Tikhon Ilitch himself had not recognized his
own brother when first they met that autumn:
&#8220;Can that be Kuzma, with whom I roamed for so
many years about the fields, the villages, and the bye-lanes?&#8221;</p>

<p>(&#8220;How old you have grown, brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have, a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how early!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a Russian. That happens
quickly with us.&#8221;)</p>

<p>And, great heavens, how everything had changed
since the days when they had been roving peddlers!
How dreadfully unlike was the present Tikhon Ilitch
to the half-gipsy huckster Tisha, swarthy as a black-beetle,
reckless, and merry!</p>

<p>As he lighted his third cigarette, Tikhon Ilitch stared
fixedly and questioningly out of the tiny window:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be like this in other lands?&#8221;</p>

<p>No, it could not be the same. Men of his acquaintance
had been abroad&mdash;there was merchant Rukavishnikoff,
for instance&mdash;and they had told him things.
And even aside from Rukavishnikoff, one could put
things together. Take the Germans of the towns,
or the Jews: all conduct themselves reasonably,
are punctual, all know one another, all are friends&mdash;and
that not alone in a state of intoxication&mdash;and
all are mutually helpful: if they are separated,
they write letters to one another all their lives long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and exchange portraits of fathers, mothers, acquaintances
from family to family; they teach their children,
love them, walk with them, talk with them as with
equals so that the child has something to remember.
But with us, all are enemies of one another, every
one envies and slanders every one else, goes to see acquaintances
once a year, sits apart, each in his kennel;
all bustle about like madmen when any one drops in
for a visit, and dash around to put the rooms in order.
But what&#8217;s the truth of the matter? They begrudge
the guest a spoonful of preserves! The guest will not
drink a second cup of tea without being specially invited.
Ugh, you slant-eyed Kirghizi! You yellow-haired
Mordvinians! You savages!</p>

<p>Some one&#8217;s troika-team drove past the windows.
Tikhon Ilitch scrutinized it attentively. The horses
were emaciated but obviously mettlesome. The tarantas
was in good condition. Whose could it be? No
one in the immediate neighbourhood owned such a
troika. The neighbouring landed proprietors were so
indignant that they sat for three days at a stretch without
bread, had sold the last scrap of vestments from
their holy pictures, had not a farthing wherewith to
replace broken glass or mend the roof; instead they
stuffed cushions into the window-frames and set bread-troughs
and buckets all over the floor when rain came
on&mdash;and it poured through the ceilings as through a
sieve. Then Deniska the cobbler passed. Where was
he going? And what was that he had with him? That
couldn&#8217;t be a valise he was carrying? Okh, there&#8217;s a
fool for you, forgive my sin, O Lord!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>




<h3>XX</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">MECHANICALLY Tikhon Ilitch threw his great-coat
on over his jacket, thrust his feet into
overshoes, and went out on the porch. On
emerging he inhaled a deep breath of fresh air in the
bluish early winter twilight, then halted once more
and sat down on the bench. Yes, there was another
nice family&mdash;the Grey Man, Syery, and his son! Tikhon
Ilitch traversed in thought the road which Deniska
had traversed in the mud, with that valise in his hand.
He descried Durnovka, his manor, the ravine, the
peasant cottages, the descending twilight, the light in
his brother&#8217;s room, the lights among the peasant dwellings.
Kuzma was probably sitting and reading. The
Bride was standing in the dark, cold ante-room near
the faintly-heated stove, warming her hands, her back,
waiting until she should be told &#8220;Bring the supper!&#8221;
and, with her dry lips, already grown old and pursed
up, was thinking&mdash;of what? Perchance of Rodka?
&#8217;Twas a lie, all that about her having poisoned Rodka&mdash;a
lie! But if she did poison him&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, Lord God! If she did poison him, what must
she be feeling? What a heavy tombstone lay upon
her strange, reticent soul! And how had that come
about upon which she had decided, crazed by hatred of
Rodka and of his brutal beatings&mdash;possibly, also, by
her outraged feelings toward him, Tikhon Ilitch, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
her disgrace, and the fear that Rodka would eventually
hear of that disgrace? Okh, and he had been in the
habit of beating her! And Tikhon Ilitch had played a
fine part, too. And God would surely punish him, too.</p>

<p>With his mind&#8217;s eye he cast a glance from the porch
of his Durnovka manor house, at Durnovka&mdash;a rebel,
also!&mdash;at the black cottages scattered over the declivity
beyond the ravine, at the threshing floors and bushes
in their back yards. Beyond the houses to the left,
on the horizon, stood a railway watch-tower. Past it,
in the twilight, a train was running, and with it ran
a chain of fiery eyes. Then eyes began to shine out
from the cottages. It grew darker; one began to feel
more comfortable&mdash;yet a disagreeable sensation stirred
every time one cast a glance at the cottages of the Bride
and the Grey Man, which stood almost in the centre
of Durnovka, separated only by three houses. There
was no light in either of them. And it was that way
nearly all winter long! The Grey Man&#8217;s small children
frolicked with joy and wonder when he managed,
on some lucky evening, to burn a light in the cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8217;tis sinful!&#8221; said Tikhon Ilitch firmly, and
rose from his seat. &#8220;Yes, &#8217;tis wicked! I must give
them at least a little help,&#8221; he said, as he wended his
way towards the station.</p>

<p>The air was frosty, and the odour of the samovar
which was wafted from the station was more fragrant
than it had been on the preceding day. The lights at
the gate were burning more brightly beyond the trees,
which had been smartly frost-bitten and were almost
bare, tinted by a little scanty foliage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>The sleighbells on the troika pealed more sonorously.
A capital team of horses, those three! On the
contrary, it was painful to look at the wretched nags
of the peasant cabmen, their tiny vehicles mounted on
half-crumbling, misshapen wheels, plastered with mud.
The door to the railway station was squeaking and
dully banging beyond the palisade. Making his way
around it, Tikhon Ilitch ascended the lofty stone platform,
on which a copper samovar of a couple of
buckets&#8217; capacity was hissing, its grating glowing red
like fiery teeth; and immediately came upon the person
of whom he was in search&mdash;that is, Deniska.</p>

<p>Deniska, his head bowed in thought, was standing on
the platform and holding in his right hand a cheap
grey valise, lavishly studded with tin nailheads and
bound about with a rope. Deniska was wearing an
under-jacket, an old and, evidently, a very heavy garment
with pendant shoulders and a very low waist-line,
a new peaked cap, and dilapidated boots. His figure
was badly built; his legs were extremely short in comparison
with his body: &#8220;I have nothing but a body,&#8221;
he sometimes said of himself, with a laugh. Now, with
that low waist-line and those broken boots, his legs
looked shorter than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denis?&#8221; shouted Tikhon Ilitch. &#8220;What are you
doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska, who was never surprised at anything, raised
his dark and languid eyes with their long lashes, looked
at him with a melancholy grin, and pulled the cap
from his hair. His hair was mouse-coloured and immeasurably
thick; his face was earthy in hue and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
bore the appearance of having been greased, but his
eyes were handsome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Morning, Tikhon Ilitch,&#8221; he replied, in a
sing-song citified tenor voice, and, as usual, rather
shyly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to&mdash;what d&#8217;ye call it?&mdash;to Tula.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why, if you permit me to ask?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe some sort of a job will turn up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch surveyed him. In his hand was the
valise; from the pocket of his long-skirted waistcoat
protruded sundry little books in green and red covers,
twisted into a roll. The waistcoat must belong to
some one else. &#8220;You&#8217;re no dandy to make an impression
in Tula!&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska also cast an appraising eye over himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The waistcoat, you mean?&#8221; he inquired modestly.
&#8220;Well, when I earn some money in Tula, I&#8217;ll buy myself
a hussar jacket. I did pretty well during the
summer. I sold newspapers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch nodded in the direction of the valise:
&#8220;What&#8217;s that contraption you have there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska lowered his eyelashes. &#8220;I bought myself
a volish, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t possibly go about in a hussar
jacket without a valise!&#8221; said Tikhon Ilitch scoffingly.
&#8220;And what&#8217;s that you&#8217;ve got in your pocket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much&mdash;just a lot of small stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me look at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska set down his valise on the platform and
pulled the little books out of his pocket. Tikhon
Ilitch took them and examined them attentively.
There was the song-book &#8220;Marusya,&#8221; &#8220;The Woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Debauchee,&#8221; &#8220;An Innocent Young Girl in the Clutches
of Violence,&#8221; &#8220;Congratulatory Verses to Parents,
Teachers, and Benefactors,&#8221; &#8220;The Rôle&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>At this point Tikhon Ilitch faltered, but Deniska,
who was watching closely, briskly and modestly
prompted him: &#8220;The Rôle of the Proletariat in
Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch shook his head. &#8220;Here&#8217;s something
new! Not a mouthful of food, but you buy yourself a
valise and nasty little books. Truly,&#8217;tis not for nothing
that folks call you an agitator. They say you are
constantly reviling the Tsar! Look out, brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, &#8217;tis not so costly as buying an estate,&#8221; replied
Deniska, with a melancholy grin. &#8220;They are
good little books. And I haven&#8217;t touched the Tsar.
They tell lies about me as if I were dead and couldn&#8217;t
defend myself. But I never had any such thing in my
thoughts. Am I a lunatic?&#8221;</p>

<p>The door-pulley creaked, and the station watchman
made his appearance&mdash;a discharged soldier, grey-haired,
afflicted with a hoarse, whistling asthma&mdash;also the
restaurant keeper, a fat man with puffy eyes and greasy
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Step aside, Messrs. Merchants, let me get the samovar.&#8221;
Deniska stepped aside and again grasped the
handle of his valise.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stole that somewhere, I suppose?&#8221; asked Tikhon
Ilitch, nodding towards the valise, and thinking of
the business upon which he had come to the station.</p>

<p>Deniska bent his head but made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s empty, of course?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>Deniska broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you turned out of your place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I left of my own accord.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch heaved a sigh. &#8220;The living image of
his father!&#8221; said he. &#8220;That one was always exactly
like that: Pitch him out of a place by the scruff of
his neck, and he&#8217;d tell you&mdash;&#8216;I left of my own accord.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I drop dead right before your eyes if I&#8217;m lying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all right, all right. Have you been at home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, two weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your father out of work again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he is out of work naow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naow!&#8221; Tikhon Ilitch mimicked him. &#8220;A wooden-headed
village! And a revolutionary to boot! You&#8217;re
trying to play the wolf, but your dog&#8217;s tail betrays
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather think you come from the same litter,&#8221; Deniska
said to himself, with a faint grin, keeping his
head down.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means, the Grey Man is sitting at home smoking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a worthless fellow!&#8221; said Deniska with conviction.</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch rapped him on the head with his
knuckles. &#8220;You might, at least, not exhibit your
stupidity! Who speaks of his father like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought to be called an old dog, not a daddy,&#8221;
replied Deniska calmly. &#8220;If he&#8217;s a father&mdash;then let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
him provide food. But he has fed me heartily, hasn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Tikhon Ilitch was not listening to him. He
chose a suitable moment for beginning a business-like
talk. And, paying no heed to him, he interrupted:
&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve turned out an empty-headed babbler.
Has Yakoff sold the mare?&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska suddenly broke out into a coarse, vociferous
guffaw. But he replied in the same sing-song
tenor voice as usual: &#8220;Yakoff Mikititch, you mean?
What are you talking about? He&#8217;s getting richer and
richer, and stingier and stingier. There was a great
joke on him yesterday!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there was! His colt died, and what sort of
a trick did he concoct? He made use of its legs and
hoofs. He hadn&#8217;t enough stakes for his wattled fence,
so&mdash;he took and wove in those same legs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s fit for a cabinet-minister, not a peasant!&#8221; said
Tikhon Ilitch. &#8220;You tatterdemalions are not in the
same class with him. I suppose you are travelling to
Tula on a wolf&#8217;s ticket?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what should I want of a ticket?&#8221; retorted
Deniska. &#8220;I get into the carriage and dive straight
under the seat&mdash;and may the Lord bless and protect!
All I want is to get to Uzlovskaya.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Uzlovskaya? Do you mean Uzslova?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, Uzslova; it&#8217;s the same thing. I&#8217;ll ride
there, and from there on &#8217;tis not far&mdash;I can go afoot.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>&#8220;And what were you thinking about doing with all
your little books? You can&#8217;t read them under the
seat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska thought that over. &#8220;Right you are!&#8221; said
he. &#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t stay under the bench all the time.
I&#8217;ll creep into the toilet&mdash;I can read there until daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch frowned. &#8220;Well, see here now,&#8221; he began.
&#8220;See here: &#8217;tis time for you to stop that sort of
talk. You&#8217;re not a small boy, you fool. Trot back
as fast as you can to Durnovka. &#8217;Tis time to buckle
down to business. Why, as you are, it makes one
sick at the stomach just to look at you. My
courtyard-councillors there live better than you do.
I&#8217;ll help you&mdash;that&#8217;s got to be done&mdash;at the start.
Well, I&#8217;ll help you to get some simple merchandise and
implements. Then you&#8217;ll be able to feed yourself and
give a little to your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he driving at with all this?&#8221; Deniska said
to himself.</p>

<p>But Tikhon Ilitch had come to a decision, and
wound up: &#8220;Yes, and &#8217;tis time you married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&mdash;oo, that&#8217;s it!&#8221; said Deniska to himself, and
began in a leisurely way to roll himself a cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; he responded, with a barely perceptible
trace of sadness, and without raising his eyelashes.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll not resist. I might marry. &#8217;Tis worse to go with
the public women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and that&#8217;s precisely the point,&#8221; put in Tikhon
Ilitch, perturbed. &#8220;Only, brother, bear in mind that
you must make a sensible marriage. &#8217;Tis a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
thing to have money on which to rear your children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you guffawing about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what you say, of course! Rear! As though
they were chickens or pigs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They require food, just as much as chickens and
pigs do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And whom shall I marry?&#8221; inquired Deniska, with
a melancholy smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom? Why, any one you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the Bride?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch flushed deeply. &#8220;Fool! What&#8217;s
wrong with the Bride? She&#8217;s a peaceable, hard-working
woman&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska remained silent, and picked with his finger-nail
at one of the tin nailheads on the valise. Then he
pretended to be stupid. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of them&mdash;of
young women,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know which one
you&#8217;re jabbering about. Do you happen to mean the
one with whom you lived?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Tikhon Ilitch had already recovered his composure.
&#8220;Whether I have lived with her or not is none
of your business, you pig,&#8221; he retorted, and that so
swiftly and peremptorily that Deniska submissively
muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, &#8217;tis all the same to me. I only said&mdash;&#8217;Twas
a chance remark&mdash;slipped off my tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, mind what you&#8217;re about, and don&#8217;t indulge
in idle chatter. I&#8217;ll make decent people of you.
Do you understand? I&#8217;ll give you a dowry. Understand
that?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>Deniska reflected. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go to Tula&mdash;&#8221;
he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cock has found a pearl! A priceless idea!
What are you going to do in Tula?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re too starved at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch unfastened his coat, thrust his hand
into the pocket of his sleeveless under-kaftan&mdash;he had
almost made up his mind to give Deniska a twenty-kopek
coin. But he came to his senses&mdash;&#8217;twas stupid
to squander his money, and, what was more, that dolt
would become conceited, would say he had been bribed.
So he pretended to be hunting for something. &#8220;Ah,
I&#8217;ve forgotten my cigarettes! Come, give me some
tobacco.&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska gave him his tobacco-pouch. The lantern
over the station entrance had already been lighted,
and by its dim light Tikhon Ilitch read aloud the
inscription embroidered in coarse white thread on
the bag: &#8220;To whoam I luv I giv I luv hartilie I giv
a poch foureaver.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s clever!&#8221; he said, when
he had finished reading.</p>

<p>Deniska modestly cast down his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have a lady-love already?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of them, the hussies, roaming about!&#8221;
replied Deniska, quite unembarrassed. &#8220;But as for
marrying&mdash;I don&#8217;t refuse. I&#8217;ll be back by the Meat-days,
and then, Lord bless our marriage!&#8221;</p>

<p>From behind the palisade thundered a peasant cart,
spattered all over with mud. It rolled up to the platform
with a peasant perched on the side-rail and the
deacon, Govoroff, from Ulianovka, seated on the straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
inside. &#8220;Has it gone?&#8221; shouted the deacon in agitated
tones, thrusting out of the straw one foot in a new
overshoe. Every individual hair of his frowsy,
reddish-sandy beard curled turbulently; his cap had
retreated to the nape of his neck: his face was fiery-red
from the wind and his excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;The train, you mean?&#8221; inquired Tikhon Ilitch.
&#8220;No, sir, it hasn&#8217;t even arrived yet. Good morning,
Father Deacon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha! Well then, thank God!&#8221; said the deacon joyfully
and hastily; but nevertheless he leaped from the
cart and rushed headlong to the door.</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch shook his head. &#8220;Oh, that long-maned
fellow came at the wrong time! Nothing will
come of my affair!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But as he grasped the handle
of the door he said, firmly and confidently: &#8220;Well,
so be it. It&#8217;s settled for the meat-season.&#8221;</p>




<h3>XXI</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE railway station was permeated with the
odours of wet sheepskin coats, the samovar,
cheap tobacco, and kerosene. The smoke was
so dense that it gripped one&#8217;s throat; the lamps hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
shone through the clouds of it, and of the semi-darkness,
dampness, and cold. The doors squeaked and
banged; peasants, whips in hand, jostled and yelled&mdash;cabmen
from Ulianovka, who sometimes waited a
whole week before they captured a passenger. In and
out among them, with brows elevated, perambulated
a Jew grain-dealer, wearing a round-topped hat and a
hooded overcoat and carrying an umbrella over his
shoulder. Near the ticket-seller&#8217;s window peasants
were dragging to the scales the trunks of some land-owners
and basket-hampers enveloped in oilcloth.
The telegraph clerk, who was discharging the duties
of assistant station agent, was shouting at the peasants.
He was a short-legged young fellow with a big head and
a curly yellow crest of hair, brought forth from beneath
his cap on the left temple, kazak fashion. A
pointer dog as spotted as a frog, with melancholy eyes
like those of a human being, was sitting on the dirty
floor and shivering violently.</p>

<p>Elbowing his way through the crowd of peasants,
Tikhon Ilitch approached the door of the first-class
waiting-room, beside which, on the wall, hung a
wooden frame containing letters, telegrams, and newspapers,
which sometimes lay on the floor. It turned
out that there were no letters for him. There was
nothing but three numbers of the &#8220;Orloff Messenger.&#8221;
Tikhon Ilitch was on the point of stepping over to the
counter to have a chat with the restaurant manager.
But on a stool by the counter sat a drunken man with
blue, glassy eyes and shiny purplish face, in a round
grey-peaked cap topped with a button&mdash;the cellarman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
from the whiskey distillery of Prince Lobanoff. So
Tikhon Ilitch hastily turned back. He knew that
cellarman only too well: if that man&#8217;s eye lighted on
him he wouldn&#8217;t be able to tear himself free for twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Deniska was still standing on the platform. &#8220;I want
to ask you something, Tikhon Ilitch,&#8221; he said with
even more timidity than was his wont.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; inquired Tikhon Ilitch angrily.
&#8220;Money? I won&#8217;t give you any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not money at all. I want you to read my
letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A letter? To whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To you. I wanted to give it to you a long time
ago, but I didn&#8217;t dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s it about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I have described my way of life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch took the scrap of paper from Deniska&#8217;s
hand, thrust it into his pocket, and strode swiftly
homeward through the springy mud, which was beginning
to congeal.</p>

<p>He was now in a resolute frame of mind. He craved
work, and reflected with pleasure that there was something
to be done&mdash;the cattle must be fed. After all,
&#8217;twas a pity he had lost his temper and discharged
Chaff; now he would have to lose his sleep at night.
Very little reliance could be placed on Oska. Probably
he was already asleep. If not, he was sitting with
the cook and reviling his master. And, passing by
the lighted windows of his cottage, Tikhon Ilitch crept
into the ante-room, stumbled in the darkness over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
cold, fragrant straw, and glued his ear to the door.
Laughter, and then the voice of Oska, were audible
on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;So now, here&#8217;s another story. In a village dwelt
a peasant, poor, the poorest of the poor; in all the village
there was none poorer than he. And one day,
my good people, this same peasant went out to till
his land. And a spotted cur dogged him. The peasant
ploughed along, and the cur nosed about all over
the field and kept digging at something. He dug and
dug, and how he ho-owled! What was the meaning
of that? The peasant ran to him, looked into the
hole, and there was&mdash;a kettle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A ket-tle?&#8221; asked the cook.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just listen to what comes next. The kettle was
only a kettle, but in the kettle was&mdash;gold! An immense
quantity. Well, and so the peasant became very
rich.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Akh, lies!&#8221; said Tikhon Ilitch to himself, and began
to listen eagerly to what was going to happen to the
peasant next.</p>

<p>&#8220;The peasant got rich, and lost his head, just like
any merchant&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly like our Stiff-Leg,&#8221; interposed the cook.</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch grinned: he knew that, for a long
time, he had been called &#8220;Stiff-leg.&#8221; Every man has
some nickname.</p>

<p>Oska went on: &#8220;Even richer than he. Yes. And
then the dog takes and dies. What was he to do? He
couldn&#8217;t bear it&mdash;he was sorry for the dog, and he
had to bury him decently&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>An explosion of laughter rang out. The story-teller
himself guffawed, and so did some one else&mdash;some
one with an old man&#8217;s cough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can it be Chaff?&#8221; thought Tikhon Ilitch, in perturbation.
&#8220;Well, glory to God! I told that fool
myself: &#8216;You&#8217;ll be coming back&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The peasant went to the priest,&#8221; pursued Oska&mdash;&#8220;he
went to the priest: &#8216;Thus and so, father, a dog
has died&mdash;he must be buried.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the cook could not control herself and shrieked
joyously: &#8220;Phew, you stick at nothing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me a chance to finish!&#8221; shouted Oska in his
turn, and once more dropped into the narrative tone,
depicting now the priest, now the peasant: &#8220;&#8216;Thus
and so, batiushka&mdash;the dog must be buried.&#8217; The
priest stamped his feet: &#8216;How is it to be buried?
Where is it to be buried? In the cemetery? I&#8217;ll
make you rot in prison, I&#8217;ll have you put in fetters!&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;Batiushka,
you see, this is no common dog:
when he was dying he bequeathed you five hundred
rubles!&#8217; The priest fairly leaped from his seat:
&#8216;Fool! Am I scolding you for burying the dog? I&#8217;m
scolding you about the place where he is to be buried.
He must be buried in the churchyard!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch coughed loudly and opened the door.
At the table beside the smoking lamp, the broken
chimney of which was patched on one side with a bit
of blackened paper, sat the cook, her head bent and her
face completely veiled by her wet hair. She was combing
it with a wooden comb and inspecting the comb
athwart her hair by the light of the lamp. Oska,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
with a cigarette in his teeth, was laughing vociferously,
his head thrown back, as he dangled his feet to
and fro in their bast-slippers. Near the stove, in
the semi-darkness, gleamed a red spark of flame&mdash;a
pipe. When Tikhon Ilitch jerked the door open and
made his appearance on the threshold, the laughter
came to an abrupt end, and the person who was smoking
the pipe rose timidly from his seat, removed the
pipe from his mouth, and thrust it into his pocket.
Yes, it was Chaff! But Tikhon Ilitch shouted, in an
alert and friendly way, as though nothing had happened
that morning: &#8220;Time to feed the cattle, my
lads!&#8221;</p>




<h3>XXII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THEY rambled about the stable with a lantern,
illuminating the coagulated manure, the straw
scattered all about, the mangers, the posts; casting
immense shadows, waking up the fowls on the
roosts under the sloping roofs. The chickens flew
down, tumbled down, and, with heads ducked forward,
fell asleep as they ran, fleeing as chance directed. The
large purplish eyes of the horses, which turned their
heads toward the light, gleamed and looked strange
and splendid. A mist rose from their breath, as if
all of them were smoking. And when Tikhon Ilitch
lowered the lantern and glanced upward, he beheld
with joy, above the square farmyard in the deep, pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sky, the brilliant vari-coloured stars. The north wind
could be heard crackling drily over the roofs and whistling
through the crevices with a frosty chill. Thank
the Lord, winter was come!</p>

<p>Having completed his task and ordered the samovar,
Tikhon Ilitch went with his lantern into the cold shop,
reeking with smells, and picked out the best pickled
herring he could find. That was all right, not a bad
idea: to cheer oneself up a bit before tea! And at
tea he ate it, drank several small glasses of bitter-sweet,
yellowish-red liqueur made of mountain-ash berries,
poured himself out a brimming cup of tea, and drew
towards him his large old counting-frame. But,
after some reflection, he hunted out Deniska&#8217;s letter
and set himself to the task of deciphering its scrawl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Denya reseved 40 rubles in munny, and than
kolected his thinges....&#8221; (&#8220;Forty!&#8221; said Tikhon
Ilitch to himself. &#8220;Akh, the poor beggar!&#8221;) &#8220;Denya
wint to Tula station and hee wos enstantly robbt they
tuk Evrything to the last kopak hee had nowere to
gow and sadness Sezed heem....&#8221;</p>

<p>This absurd scrawl was difficult and tiresome to decipher,
but the evening was long, and he had nothing
else to do. The samovar purred busily, the lamp
shone with a quiet light&mdash;and there was sadness in the
tranquillity and repose of the evening. The watchman&#8217;s
mallet was working away as he made his rounds
noisily, beating out a dance-tune upon the frosty air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aftr thot I hainkrd to goa hoam thoa fader wo
vairy brutl....&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>&#8220;Well, and there&#8217;s a fool for you, Lord forgive me!&#8221;
thought Tikhon Ilitch. &#8220;The Grey Man brutal, forsooth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wint Into the tik foarest to peck out the talest
fur-tre and taik a cord frum a shuger-loof and fixe
myselff in iternl laife in my nu briches but witaut
boots....&#8221;</p>

<p>(&#8220;Without his boots, he means, I suppose?&#8221; said
Tikhon Ilitch, holding the paper at a distance from
his tired eyes. &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right; that&#8217;s what he
means.&#8221;)</p>

<p>&#8220;Eftrwords come strung wind blu clauds and thunr-strum
and a kwik bige litul rayne poared the son kam
frum behain foarest the coard bend bend and asuden
brooke and Denya fall on the grond the ents krall
and bigin to bite and wurk on hem and thair crold
alzo a snaek and a green krawfish....&#8221;</p>

<p>Tossing the letter into the slop-bowl, Tikhon Ilitch
sipped his tea, planted his elbows on the table, and
stared at the lamp. What a queer nation! A soul
of many hues! Now a man is just a plain dog, then
again he is melancholy, pities himself, turns soft,
weeps over himself&mdash;after the fashion of Deniska,
or of himself, Tikhon Ilitch. The window-panes were
perspiring vigorously and clearly, as they do in winter;
the watchman&#8217;s mallet said something melodiously coherent.
Ekh, if he only had children! If&mdash;well, if
he only had a nice mistress instead of that bloated old
woman, who made his flesh crawl merely by what
she said; by her words about the Princess, and about
some pious nun or other named Polikarpia, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
called in the town &#8220;Polukarpia.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But it was too late,
too late.</p>

<p>Unfastening the embroidered collar of his shirt, Tikhon
Ilitch, with a bitter smile, felt of his throat behind
the ears. Those hollows were the first sign of old
age; his head was assuming the shape of a horse&#8217;s
head! But otherwise things were not so bad. He bent
his head, thrust his fingers into his beard. And his
beard was grey, dry, dishevelled. Yes, enough&mdash;enough,
Tikhon Ilitch!</p>

<p>He drank, grew intoxicated, set his jaws more and
more tightly, stared more intently than ever at the
wick of the lamp, burning with an even flame. Think
of it! You couldn&#8217;t go to see your own brother&mdash;the
pigs prevented, like the swine they were! And
if they would let him, there would still be small cause
for joy. Kuzma would read him a lecture, the Bride
would stand with lips pressed tight and drooping eyelashes.
Why, those lowered eyelids alone were enough
to make a man take to his heels!</p>

<p>His heart sank within him, ached; a pleasing mist
clouded his brain. Where had he heard that song?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;My tiresome evening&#8217;s come;</div>
<div class="indent">I know not what to do.</div>
<div class="verse">My friend belov&#8217;d is come,</div>
<div class="indent">He fondles me, loves me true.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Ah, yes, it was in Lebedyan, at the posting station.
The young girls, lace-makers, were sitting on a winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
evening and singing. There they sat, weaving their
lace and never raising their eyelashes; they sang in
deep, ringing voices:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;He kisses me, embraces me,</div>
<div class="verse">Then takes his leave of me....&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>His brain was clouded. Now it seemed as if everything
lay ahead of him&mdash;joy, liberty, freedom from
care&mdash;then his heart began to ache painfully, hopelessly.
Now he said: &#8220;If I only had a bit of money
in my pocket, I could buy anything&mdash;even an aunt&mdash;at
the market!&#8221; Again he cast a vicious glance at the
lamp, and muttered, alluding to his brother: &#8220;Teacher!
Preacher! Pitiful Philaret!<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Ragged devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>He drank the rest of the mountain-ash-berry cordial
and smoked until the room grew dark. With uncertain
steps he went out, across the shaking uneven floor,
clad only in his roundabout, into the dark ante-room.
He was sensible of the piercing coldness of the air,
the smell of straw, the odour of dogs, and he perceived
two greenish lights blinking on the threshold.
&#8220;Buyan!&#8221; he shouted. And he kicked Buyan over the
head with all his might.</p>

<p>Then he listened to the watchman&#8217;s mallet, keeping
time to it with his feet. He spat on the steps of the
porch, mentally accompanying the action with:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;Come straight to me,</div>
<div class="verse">Look straight at me.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>And as he set off in the direction of the highway he
shouted: &#8220;Blow on a squirrel&#8217;s tail&mdash;it will be all
the more downy for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>A death-like silence lay over the earth, which showed
softly black in the starlight. The highway shone
faintly white as it faded out in the gloom. Far away,
as if emanating from beneath the surface of the earth,
a rumbling sound became audible and grew louder
from moment to moment. And suddenly the orchestra
came to the surface with its droning: in the distance,
cutting across the highway, its chain of windows
lighted by electricity, gleaming whitely, trailing
smoke-wreaths as a flying witch trails her tresses,
redly illuminated from below, the express train dashed
past.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s passing Durnovka!&#8221; said Tikhon Ilitch, with a
hiccough. &#8220;Passing the Grey Man! Akh, the robbers,
curse them&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The drowsy cook entered the living-room, which was
dimly lighted by the burned-out lamp and stank of
tobacco. She was bringing in a greasy little kettle of
sour cabbage soup, which she held in rags black with
dirt and soot. Tikhon Ilitch cast a sidelong glance
at her and said: &#8220;Get out of here, this very minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cook wheeled round, pushed open the door with
her foot, and disappeared. Then he picked up Gatzuk&#8217;s
calendar, dipped a rusty pen into the rusty ink,
and began, with set teeth and leaden eyes staring
fixedly, to write endlessly on the calendar, up and
down and across:</p>

<p>&#8220;Gatzuk, Gatzuk, Gatzuk, Gatzuk ...&#8221;</p>

<h3>I</h3>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALMOST all his life long Kuzma had dreamed of
writing, of obtaining an education. Verses did
not count. He had dallied with verses as a mere
child. He longed to narrate how he had come to
naught; to depict, with unprecedented ruthlessness,
his poverty and that dreadful factor in his commonplace
life which had crippled him, made of him a barren
fig-tree.</p>

<p>When he reviewed his life in his own mind he both
condemned and acquitted himself. Yes, he was an indigent
petty townsman who, almost up to the age of
fifteen, had been able to read only by spelling out every
word. But his history was the history of all self-taught
Russians. He had been born in a country
which had more than a hundred million illiterate inhabitants.
He had grown up in the Black Suburb,
where down to the present day men fight to the death
with their fists. In his childhood he had seen dirt
and drunkenness, laziness and boredom. His childhood
had furnished only one poetical impression:
there had been the dark cemetery grove, and the pasture
on the hill behind the Suburb, and beyond that&mdash;space,
the hot mirage of the steppe, a white cottage
beneath a poplar-tree in the far distance. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
he had been taught to look upon even this cottage
with scorn: Little Russians dwelt there, and, of course,
they were so stupid that in reply to the question,
&#8220;Little Russians, where are your kettles?&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> they said:
&#8220;Do you need to be told that they are under the wagons?&#8221;
He and Tikhon had been taught the alphabet
and figures by a neighbour named Byelkin, whose
trade was to make rubber overshoes in moulds; but
he had taught them because he never had any work&mdash;for
what demand was there in the Suburb for overshoes?&mdash;and
because it was always agreeable to pull
some one&#8217;s hair, and because a man cannot sit for ever
on the earth wall alongside his hut absolutely idle,
with his frowsy head bent and exposed to the sun, doing
nothing but spit in the dust between his bare
feet.</p>

<p>In Matorin&#8217;s shop the brothers had speedily attained
to writing and reading, and Kuzma had begun to be
attracted by the little books which the accordeon-player,
old Balashkin, the eccentric free-thinker
of the bazaar, gave him. But what chance for reading
was there in the shop? Matorin very often
shouted: &#8220;I&#8217;ll box your ears for those books of yours,
you abominable little devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>That was an old story; but Kuzma wished to recall,
also, the morals of the bazaar. In the bazaar
he had picked up much that was opprobrious. There
he and his brother had been taught to sneer at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
poverty of their mother, at her having taken to drink,
abandoned as she was by her adolescent sons. There
they once played the following prank: Every day,
on his way from the library, the son of the tailor
Vitebsky passed the door of the shop&mdash;a Jew aged
sixteen, with a pallid greyish face; a terribly lean,
big-eared fellow who wore spectacles and industriously
read as he walked, his book held close up to his eyes.
So they threw some bricks and rubbish on the sidewalk&mdash;and
the Jew (&#8220;that learned man!&#8221;) stumbled so
successfully that he bruised his knees, elbows, and
teeth to the point of bleeding. Then Kuzma started
to write. He began a story about a merchant who,
driving by night in a fearful thunderstorm through
the Murom forests, came upon an encampment of
bandits and got his throat cut. Kuzma fervently set
forth his remarks and thoughts on the brink of death,
his grief over his iniquitous life, &#8220;so prematurely
cut short.&#8221; But the bazaar mercilessly threw cold
water on it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you are a queer one, Lord forgive us!&#8221;
it pronounced, merrily and insolently, through
Tikhon&#8217;s mouth. &#8220;&#8216;Prematurely&#8217;! That pot-bellied
devil ought to have been done for long before! Well,
and how did you know what he was thinking about?
They cut his throat, didn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Kuzma wrote, in the style of Koltzoff, a ballad
about an extremely ancient knight who bequeathed to
his son a faithful steed. &#8220;He carried me in my youth!&#8221;
exclaimed the hero in the ballad. But Tikhon merely
shook his head over that.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>&#8220;Really!&#8221; said he, &#8220;how old was that horse? Akh,
Kuzma! Kuzma! You&#8217;d better compose something
practical&mdash;well, about the war, for example.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Kuzma, catering to the taste of the market-place,
began with great zeal to write about what the
bazaar was discussing at the moment&mdash;the Russo-Turkish
war: about how&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<p>Later on it pained him to realize how much stupidity
and ignorance this doggerel contained, the servile
quality of its language, and its Russian scorn for
foreign headgear. With pain he recalled much else.
For example, Zadonsk. One day there he was overcome
by a passionate longing for repentance, a terror
lest his mother, who had died, practically, of starvation,
had bitterly reported in heaven her sorrowful life;
and he set forth on foot to the abode of a holy man.
Once there, he did nothing whatever except to read to
assembled admirers, with malicious joy, a &#8220;sheet&#8221;
which had made a special impression on him: how
a certain village scribe had taken it into his head to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
reject the authorities and the Church, and God had
waxed so wroth that &#8220;this aristocrat was laid low on
his bed of death,&#8221; his malady such that &#8220;he devoured
more than a pig, and shrieked that that was not
enough, and withered away until he was unrecognizable.&#8221;
And Kuzma&#8217;s entire youth was spent in just
such affairs! He thought and professed one thing&mdash;and
said and did something entirely different. Aspiring
to write and reckoning up the sum-total of his
life, Kuzma shook his head mournfully: &#8220;A genuine
Russian trait, sir! The sowing was half peas,
half thistles.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed as if he had been merry in his youth,
kind, tender, quick to understand, eager to learn. But
was it really so? He was not Tikhon, of course. But
why had he, equally with Tikhon, assimilated so
promptly the savagery of those who surrounded him?
Why had he, kind and tender as he was, so mercilessly
neglected his mother? Why had the bazaar so long
reigned supreme over his heart, which was toiling
so ardently over books? Why, why was he&mdash;a barren
fig-tree?</p>

<p>Tikhon had been in the habit of keeping most of
his earnings in one common money-box: they had
decided to set up in business for themselves. Kuzma
surrendered his money with a full, hearty confidence
which Tikhon never possessed. But his mother, his
mother! He groaned as he recalled how, poverty-stricken
as she was, she had bestowed her blessing on
him, had given him her sole treasure, a relic of her
better days, which had been preserved at the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
her chest&mdash;a small silver-mounted holy picture. And
the fact that he had groaned was good, also; but
all the same his money had gone to Tikhon.</p>




<h3>II</h3>


<p class="drop-cap2">ABANDONING the shop counter, and having
sold off what their mother had left, they had
begun to trade&mdash;had gone out among the Little
Russians, and to Voronezh. They were frequently in
their native town, and Kuzma kept up his friendship
with Balashkin as of yore, and read avidly the books
which Balashkin gave him or recommended to him.
This was not at all like Tikhon. Tikhon, when there
was nothing to do, was fond of reading, also; a year
might pass without his taking a book in his hand, but
if he did begin one, he read swiftly to the very last
line and, once he had finished that, instantly severed
all connection with the book; on one occasion he had
read through an entire volume of the &#8220;Contemporary&#8221;
in one night, had not understood much, had pronounced
what he had read extremely interesting&mdash;and
then had forgotten the &#8220;Contemporary&#8221; for ever.
Neither did Kuzma understand much of what he
read&mdash;even in the writings of Byelinsky, Gogol, and
Pushkin. But his comprehension increased, not by
days but by hours: he was able to grasp the gist of the
matter and rivet it in his heart to a positively amazing
degree. Why, then, when he comprehended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
words of Dobroliuboff, did he disfigure his speech in
the bazaar and say &#8220;khvakt&#8221; instead of &#8220;fact&#8221;? Why,
when conversing with Balashkin about Schiller, did he
passionately long to borrow his &#8220;ekordeon&#8221;? Waxing
enthusiastic over Turgenieff&#8217;s &#8220;Smoke,&#8221; he maintained
nevertheless that &#8220;he who is intelligent but not educated,
has much knowledge even without education.&#8221;
On visiting the grave of Koltzoff, in rapture he wrote
upon the gravestone an illiterate epitaph: &#8220;Binith
this munament is intered the boady of citazen alesei
vasilevitch Kaltzoff campoaser and poet of Voronezh
riworded by the munarch&#8217;s greciousnes <i>a lerningles
man enlitend by natur</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Balashkin explained the meaning of things to him
and impressed on Kuzma&#8217;s soul a profound stamp of
himself. Old, gigantic, lean, garbed summer and winter
alike in a peasant overcoat which had turned green
with age and a winter-weight peaked cap, huge-faced,
clean-shaven, and wry-mouthed, Balashkin was almost
terrifying with his malicious speeches, his deep,
senile bass voice, the prickly, silvery bristles on his
grey cheeks and lips, and his green left eye, bulging,
flashing, and squinting in the direction in which his
mouth was drawn awry. And he fairly took to barking
one day at Kuzma&#8217;s remark about &#8220;enlightenment
without education.&#8221; That eye of his blazed as he
hurled aside his cigarette, which he had filled with the
cheap tobacco on top of a tin which had contained
pilchards. &#8220;Jaw of an ass! What&#8217;s that you&#8217;re jabbering?
Have you ever considered what our &#8216;enlightenment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
without education&#8217; signifies? The death of
Zhadovskaya&mdash;that&#8217;s its devilish symbol!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about the death of Zhadovskaya?&#8221; inquired
Kuzma.</p>

<p>And Balashkin yelled in a rage: &#8220;You have forgotten?
The poetess, a wealthy woman, a noblewoman&mdash;but
she drowned herself. You have forgotten?&#8221;
And again he seized his cigarette and began to roar
dully: &#8220;Merciful God! They killed Pushkin, they
killed Lermontoff, they drowned Pisareff. They strangled
Rylyeeff, they condemned Polezhaeff to the ranks
as a soldier, they walled up Shevtchenko as a prisoner
for ten years, they dragged Dostoevsky out to
be shot, Gogol went mad&mdash;and how about Koltzoff,
Nikitin, Ryeshetnikoff? Okh, and is there any other
such country in the world, any other such nation?
thrice accursed may they be!&#8221;</p>

<p>Excitedly twisting the buttons of his long-tailed coat,
now buttoning, again unbuttoning them, frowning and
grimacing, Kuzma, perturbed, said in reply: &#8220;Such
a nation! &#8217;Tis the greatest of nations, and not &#8216;such&#8217;
a nation, permit me to remark to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you presume to confer prizes!&#8221; Balaskhin
shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I will presume! For those writers were
children of that same nation!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, curse you, they were&mdash;but George Sand was
no worse than your Zhadovskaya, and she did not
drown herself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Platon Karataeff&mdash;there&#8217;s an acknowledged type
of that nation!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8220;And why not Yeroshka, why not Lukashka? My
good man, if I take a notion to shake up literature I&#8217;ll
find boots to fit all the gods! Why Karataeff and not
Ruzuvaeff and Kolupaeff? why not a bloodsucker
spider, an extortioner priest, a venal deacon? some
Saltytchikha or other? Why not Karamazoff and
Oblomoff, Khlestyakoff and Nozdreff? or, not to go too
far afield, why not your good-for-nothing, nasty
brother, Tishka Krasoff?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Platon Karataeff&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lice have eaten your Karataeff! I don&#8217;t see
that he&#8217;s an ideal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Russian martyrs, saints, holy men, the
fools-for-Christ&#8217;s-sake, the Old Ritualists?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wha-at&#8217;s that? Well, how about the Coliseum,
the crusades, the religious wars, the countless sects?
And Luther, to wind up? No, nonsense! You can&#8217;t
beat me down with one blow, like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what, in your opinion, ought to be done?&#8221;
shouted Kuzma. &#8220;Blindfold our eyes and rush to the
ends of the world?&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this point Balashkin suddenly became extinguished.
He closed his eyes, and his huge grey
face portrayed advanced, painful old age. For a long
time with drooping head he turned over something in
his mind, and at last muttered: &#8220;What ought to be
done? I don&#8217;t know: we are ruined. Our last asset
was &#8216;Memoirs of the Fatherland,&#8217; and that has been
knocked in the head! And yet, you fool, you think
the only thing that is necessary is to educate oneself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, one thing was necessary&mdash;to acquire an education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
But when? And how? Five whole years he
had spent in peddling&mdash;and they were the best period
of his life! Even the arrival in a town seemed an immense
happiness. Rest, acquaintances, the odour of
bake-shops and iron roofs, the pavement on Trading
Street, fresh white rolls and the Persian March on
the mechanical organ of the &#8220;Kars&#8221; eating-house. The
floors in the shops watered from a teapot, the wood-notes
of a famous quail in front of Rudakoff&#8217;s door,
the smell of the fish shops in the bazaar, of fennel and
coarse tobacco. The kindly and terrible smile of Balashkin
at the sight of Kuzma approaching. Then&mdash;thunders
and curses on the Slavophils, Byelinsky and
vile abuse, incoherent and passionate interchange of
opprobrious names between the two, quotations. And,
to wind up, the most desperately absurd deductions.
&#8220;Well, now we&#8217;ve got to the end of our rope&mdash;and
we&#8217;re dashing back to Asia at full speed!&#8221; the old man
rumbled, and, abruptly lowering his voice, he cast a
glance around him: &#8220;Have you heard? They say that
Saltykoff is dying. He&#8217;s the last. &#8217;Tis said he was poisoned.&#8221;
And in the morning&mdash;again the springless
cart, the steppe, sultry heat or mud, strained and
painful reading to the accompaniment of jolts from
the swiftly revolving wheels. Protracted contemplation
of the steppe&#8217;s vast spaces, the sweetly melancholy
melody of verses within, interrupted by thoughts about
grains or of squabbles with Tikhon. The perturbing
odour of the road&mdash;of dust and tar. The odour of
gingerbread, flavoured with mint, and the suffocating
stench of cat hides, of dirty fleeces, of boots greased with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
train-oil. Those years had, in truth, been a drain
on his strength&mdash;the fatigue of not changing his shirt
for a fortnight, of food eaten without the relief of any
liquid, of lameness caused by heels bruised to the
point of bleeding, of nights passed in strange villages,
in strange cottages and sheds!</p>




<h3>III</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">KUZMA crossed himself with a grand flourish
when, at last, he escaped from that slavery.
But he was already nearly thirty years of age;
his hair was noticeably grey; he had become more
sober, more serious; he had abandoned his verses, had
abandoned reading; he had become accustomed to
eating-houses, to drinking-bouts. He served for a year
less a week with a drover near Eletz, went to Moscow
on his employer&#8217;s business&mdash;and left his service. Long
before that time he had begun a love affair in Voronezh,
with a married woman, and he longed to go
thither. So he knocked about in Voronezh for nearly
ten years, busying himself with the purchase of grain,
horse-trading, and writing articles about the grain
trade for the newspapers, bewildering&mdash;or, to speak
more correctly, poisoning&mdash;his mind with the articles
of Tolstoy and the satires of Saltykoff. And, all the
while, he was overwhelmed with the conviction that he
was wasting&mdash;had wasted&mdash;his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now,&#8221; he said, as he recalled those years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
&#8220;that&#8217;s what it signifies&mdash;that knowledge without education!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the early &#8217;nineties Balashkin died of hernia, and
Kuzma saw him, for the last time, not long before his
death. And what an interview it was!</p>

<p>&#8220;I must write,&#8221; complained one, gloomily and angrily.
&#8220;One withers away like a burdock in the
field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; boomed the other. The squint of his dying
eye was already drowsy, and his jaws moved with
difficulty, and the coarse tobacco did not fall as it
should have done on his cigarette paper. &#8220;As the
saying runs: learn every hour, think every hour, look
about you at all our poverty and wretchedness&mdash;&#8221;
Then, with a shame-faced grin, he laid aside his cigarette
and thrust his hand into the breast of his coat.
&#8220;Here,&#8221; he mumbled, rummaging in a package of tattered
papers and clippings from newspapers. &#8220;Here,
my friend, is a pile of stuff of some value. There was
a great famine, curse it. And I read everything
about it, and wrote it all down. When I die, &#8217;twill
be of some use to you, this devil&#8217;s material. Nothing
but scurvy and typhus, typhus and scurvy. In one
county all the small children died; in another all the
dogs were eaten up. God is my witness that I am
telling no lie! Here, wait a minute, I&#8217;ll find it for you
immediately&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But he rummaged and rummaged and did not find
it, hunted for his spectacles, began in alarm to search
through his pockets, to look under the counter, got
tired, and gave it up. And, as soon as he gave up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
search, he began to drowse and waggle his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;But no, no&mdash;don&#8217;t you dare to touch on that yet.
You are still uneducated, a weak-minded fellow.
Cut a tree to suit your powers. Have you written anything
on that subject I suggested to you&mdash;about Sukhonosy?
Not yet? Well, so you are an ass&#8217;s jaw, as I
said, after all. What a subject that was!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to write about the village, about the populace,&#8221;
said Kuzma. &#8220;For you yourself are always
saying: &#8216;Russia, Russia&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and isn&#8217;t Sukhonosy the populace? isn&#8217;t it
Russia? <i>All Russia is nothing but a village: get that
firmly fixed in your noddle!</i> Look about you: is this
a town, in your opinion? The flocks jam the streets
every evening&mdash;they kick up such a dust that you
can&#8217;t see your next-door neighbour. But you call it
a &#8216;town&#8217;! Ugh, you dull clodhopper&mdash;&#8217;tis plain that
one might drive a stake into your head, and still you
would never write anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Kuzma understood clearly and conclusively
that Balashkin had spoken the sacred truth: he was
not destined to write. There was Sukhonosy. For
many years that repulsive old man of the Suburb had
never been out of his mind&mdash;an old man whose sole
property consisted of a mattress infested with bugs and
a woman&#8217;s moth-eaten cloak which he had inherited
from his wife. He begged, fell ill, starved, roosted
for fifty kopeks a month in one corner of a cottage
occupied by a woman trader in the &#8220;gluttons&#8217; row,&#8221;
and, in her opinion, might very well set his affairs
straight by selling his inheritance. But he prized it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
as the apple of his eye&mdash;and, of course, not in the
least because of tender feelings toward the late lamented:
it afforded him the consciousness that he
owned incomparably more property than other folks.
It seemed to him that it was worth a devilishly high
price: &#8220;Nowadays such cloaks are not to be had at
all!&#8221; He was not disinclined, not in the least disinclined,
to sell it. But he asked such an outrageous
price that would-be purchasers were dazed. And
Kuzma understood this tragedy of the Suburb perfectly.
But when he began to consider how it should
be expressed, he began to live through the whole
complicated life of the Suburb, through recollections
of his childhood, of his youth&mdash;and he became confused,
drowned Sukhonosy in the abundance of the
pictures which besieged his memory, and dropped his
hands in despair, crushed by the necessity of expressing
his own soul, of setting forth everything which had
crippled his own life. And the most terrible thing
about that life was the fact that it was a simple, everyday
life, which broke up into petty details with incomprehensible
rapidity. Yes, and what was more,
he did not know how to write: he did not even know
how to think regularly or long; he suffered like a
puppy in a bed of straw when he took up a pen. And
Balashkin&#8217;s death-bed prophecy brought him to his
senses; &#8217;twas not for him to write stories! So the first
thought which flashed through his mind was, to write
&#8220;The Sum-Total,&#8221; a stern, harsh epitaph on himself
and&mdash;on Russia.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>




<h3>IV</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">BUT since that time twelve more barren years
had elapsed. He had plied the trade of horse-dealer
in Voronezh; then, when the woman with
whom he had been living died of puerperal fever, he
had carried on the same trade in Eletz, had worked in a
candle shop in Lipetzk, had been a clerk on Kasatkin&#8217;s
farm. And his life had flowed on smoothly, engrossed
in work, in everyday tasks&mdash;until his habit of tippling
had rather abruptly turned into hard drinking. He
had become a passionate follower of Tolstoy: for
about a year he did not smoke, never took a drop of
vodka, ate no meat, never parted with &#8220;My Confession&#8221;
and &#8220;The Gospels,&#8221; wanted to emigrate to the
Caucasus and join the Dukhobortzy.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But he was
sent to Kieff on a business matter. And as he set
forth, he felt something akin to a sickly joy, as if he
had suddenly been released, after prolonged imprisonment,
into complete freedom. It was clear weather
at the end of September, and everything seemed easy,
very beautiful&mdash;the pure air, the comfortable sun, and
the cadence of the train, the open windows, and the
flowering forests which flashed past them. All at once,
when the train halted at Nyezhin, Kuzma saw a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
crowd surrounding the door of the station. The crowd
was gathered round some one, and was shouting and
quarrelling in great agitation. Kuzma&#8217;s heart began to
beat violently, and he ran toward the crowd. Rapidly
elbowing his way through it, he caught sight of the
red cap of the station-master, the white, pyramidal cap
of a cook, resembling that of a Kazak Hetman, and the
grey overcoat of a sturdy gendarme, engaged in
roundly berating three Little Russians, who were standing
meekly erect in front of him, clad in short, thick
coats, indestructible boots, and caps of snuff-coloured
lambskin. These caps hung precariously on some
dreadful objects that proved to be round heads bandaged
with coarse muslin, stiff with dried serous fluid,
above swollen eyes and faces puffy and glassy with
greenish-yellow bruises, bearing wounds on which the
blood had coagulated and turned black. The men had
been bitten by a mad wolf, had been despatched to the
hospital in Kieff, and had been held up for days at a
stretch at almost every large station, without a morsel
of bread or a kopek of money. And, on learning that
they were not to be taken aboard now, because the
train was called an express train, Kuzma suddenly
flew into a rage and, to the accompaniment of approving
yells from the Jews in the throng, began to bawl
and stamp his feet at the gendarme. He was arrested,
an official report was drawn up, and, while awaiting
the next train, Kuzma, for the first time in his life, got
dead drunk.</p>

<p>The Little Russians were from the Tchernigoff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Government. This he had always thought of as a far-away
region with a sky of dim, gloomy blue above
the forests. These men, who had gone through a
hand-to-hand encounter with the mad wolf, reminded
him of the days of Vladimir, the life of long ago, of
ancient peasant life in the pine forests. And as he
proceeded to get drunk, pouring out glass after glass
of liquor with hands shaking after the row, Kuzma
became transported with delight: &#8220;Akh, that was a
great epoch!&#8221; He was choking with wrath at the
gendarme, and at those meek cattle in their long-tailed
coats. Stupid, savage, curse them! But&mdash;Russia,
ancient Russia! And tears of drunken joy and
fervour, which distorted every picture to supernatural
dimensions, obscured Kuzma&#8217;s vision. &#8220;But how about
non-resistance?&#8221; recurred to his mind at intervals, and
he shook his head with a grin. A trim young officer
was eating his dinner, with his back to him, at
the general table; and Kuzma gazed in an amicably
insolent manner at his white linen uniform blouse,
so short, so high-waisted, that he wanted to step up
to him and pull it down. &#8220;And I will do that!&#8221;
thought Kuzma. &#8220;But he would jump up and shout&mdash;and
slap my face! There&#8217;s non-resistance for you!&#8221;
Then he journeyed on to Kieff and, completely abandoning
his business, spent three days roaming about
the city and on the bluffs above the Dnyepr, in the
joyous excitement induced by his intoxication.</p>

<p>In the Cathedral of St. Sophia, at the Liturgy, many
persons stared in amazement at the thin, broad-shouldered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
katzap<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> who stood in front of Yaroslaff&#8217;s<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
tomb. He was neatly dressed, held in his hand a new
peaked cap, stood with decorum; but there was something
queer in his general appearance. The service
came to an end: the congregation departed, and the
doors were opened; the verger extinguished the candles.
Through the upper windows, athwart the blue smoke,
filtered golden streaks of the hot noonday sun; but he,
with set teeth, his sparse greying beard drooping on
his breast and his deeply sunken eyes closed in a sort
of happy pain, remained there listening to the pealing
of the bells, carolling and dully booming above the
cathedral&mdash;that ancient peal which had, in days of
yore, accompanied the campaigns against the Petchenyegi.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
And, toward evening, Kuzma was seen at the
Lavra.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He was sitting opposite its gate beneath a
withered acacia, alongside a crippled lad, gazing with a
troubled, melancholy smile at its white walls and enclosures,
at the gold of its little cupolas shining against
the pure autumnal sky. The lad had no cap, a sack of
coarse linen hung over his shoulder, and on his body
hung dirty, ragged old garments; in one hand he held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
a wooden cup, with a kopek in the bottom, while with
the other he incessantly changed the position of his deformed
leg&mdash;which was bare to the knee, withered and
unnaturally thin, burned black by the sun, and covered
with a thick growth of golden-hued hair&mdash;as if it
did not belong to him, as if it were a mere object.
There was no one in their vicinity; but the lad, with
his close-cropped head thrown back, stiff from the effects
of the sun and the dust, displaying his thin, childish
collar-bones, and paying no heed to the flies which
settled on the excretions of his nostrils, drawled
drowsily, painfully, and without ceasing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;Take a look, ye mammas,</div>
<div class="verse">See how unhappy, how miserable we are!</div>
<div class="verse">Akh, God grant you, mammas,</div>
<div class="verse">Never to suffer so!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And Kuzma confirmed him: &#8220;That&#8217;s so, that&#8217;s
right!&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had conquered his intoxication and come
to his senses, Kuzma felt that he was already an old
man. Since that trip to Kieff three years had elapsed.
And, during that space of time, something extremely
important had indubitably been effected within him.
How it had been effected, he himself did not even attempt
to define. Life during those three years had
been too abnormal&mdash;his own life and the life of the
community. Of course, he had understood while still
in Kieff that he would not remain long with Kasatkin,
and that ahead of him lay poverty, the loss of even
the semblance of manhood. And so it came to pass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
He managed to scrape along through two more jobs,
but under very humiliating and oppressive conditions:
eternally half-drunk, slovenly, with voice turned
hoarse, permeated through and through with the reek
of cheap, strong tobacco, making herculean efforts to
conceal his unfitness for business. Then he fell lower
still; he returned to his native town, and ran through
his last kopeks; he spent his nights all winter long in
the general room of the lodging-house of Khodoff,
whiled away the days in Avdyeef&#8217;s eating-house in
the Women&#8217;s Bazaar. Out of these last kopeks
many went for a stupid caprice, the publication of a
little volume of verses&mdash;after which he had to stroll
about among the patrons of Avdyeef&#8217;s establishment
and force his booklet on them at half-price.</p>

<p>But even that was not all: he came near turning
into a buffoon! Once, on a frosty, sunny morning, he
was standing in the bazaar near the flour shops and
gazing at a barefoot beggar cutting up antics before
Mozzhukin the merchant, who had come out on his
threshold. Mozzhukin, drowsily derisive, with a face
resembling the reflection in a samovar, was chiefly interested
in a cat which was licking his polished boot.
But the beggar did not stop. He thumped his breast
with his fists and, humping his shoulders, began in a
hoarse voice to declaim:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;He who drinks when he is already drunk,</div>
<div class="verse">Plays the part of a wise man....&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And Kuzma, his swollen eyes beaming, suddenly cut in:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;Then long live jollity,</div>
<div class="verse">Long life to good liquor!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And an old woman of the petty burgher class, who
was passing by&mdash;she had a face like that of an aged
lioness&mdash;halted, cast a sidelong glance at him, and,
elevating her crutch, remarked distinctly and maliciously:
&#8220;&#8217;Tis likely you don&#8217;t know your prayers
as well as that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Lower than that there was no place to fall. But
precisely that was what saved him. He survived several
attacks of heart disease&mdash;and immediately stopped
getting drunk, firmly resolving to undertake the simplest,
most laborious sort of life; to hire, for example,
an orchard, a vegetable-garden; to purchase, somewhere
in his native county, a bee-farm. Fortunately, he
still had a hundred and fifty rubles left.</p>

<p>At first this idea delighted him. &#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s capital,&#8221;
he said to himself with that mournful ironical
smile which he had acquired so long ago. &#8220;&#8217;Tis time
to go home!&#8221; And, of a truth, he needed a rest. It
was not very long since that vast agitation had begun,
both within him and round about him. But it
had already done its work. He had become something
very different from what he had been previously.
His beard had turned completely grey; his hair, which
he wore parted in the middle, and which curled at the
ends, had grown thin and acquired a rusty hue; his
broad face, with its high cheek-bones, had grown
darker and leaner than ever. His observing, sceptical
mind had grown more keen. His soul had been purified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
had become more unhealthily sensitive, although
he was able to conceal the fact behind the serious and,
at times, even severe look of the little eyes under
brows which almost met across his nose. He had completely
pulled himself together, and had begun to
think less of himself, more of those round about him.
Nevertheless, he longed to go &#8220;home&#8221; and rest: he
craved work to his liking.</p>




<h3>V</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the spring, several months before the reconciliation
with Tikhon, Kuzma heard that a garden
in the village of Kazakoff, in his native district,
was to be leased, and he hastened thither. It was
a remote spot, with black loam soil, not far from the
place where the Krasoffs had first taken root.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of May; cold weather and rain
had returned after a hot spell; gloomy autumnal
storm-clouds sailed over the town. Kuzma, in an old
overcoat and without goloshes over his broken calfskin
boots, was trudging to the railway station beyond
the Cannon-makers&#8217; Suburb, and, shaking his
head and screwing up his face from the effects of the
cigarette held in his teeth, with hands clasped behind
his back under his overcoat, he was smiling to himself.
A dirty little barefoot boy ran up to him with a pile
of newspapers and, as he ran, shouted briskly the
customary phrase: &#8220;Giniral strike!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re behind the times, my lad,&#8221; said Kuzma.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there anything newer?&#8221;</p>

<p>The small boy came to a halt, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;The policeman has carried the news off to the
station,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;All hail to the constitution!&#8221; said Kuzma caustically,
and pursued his course, skipping along through
the mud, past fences darkened by the rain, past the
branches of dripping gardens and the windows of lop-sided
hovels which were sliding down hill, to the end
of the town street. &#8220;Wonders will never cease!&#8221; he
said to himself as he went leaping along. &#8220;In former
days, with such weather, people would have been yawning,
hardly exchanging a word, in all the shops and
eating-houses. But now, all over the town, they do
nothing but discuss the Duma, riots and conflagrations,
and how &#8216;Murontzeff<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> has given the prime-minister
a sound rating.&#8217; Well, a frog does not keep
its tail very long!&#8221; The fireman&#8217;s band was already
playing in the town park. A whole company of kazaks
had been sent. And the day before yesterday, on
Trading Street, one of them, when drunk, went up to
the window of the public library and made an insulting
gesture to the young lady librarian. An elderly
cabman, who was standing near by, began to reprove
him, but the kazak jerked out his sabre from its scabbard,
slashed the cabman&#8217;s shoulder, and, cursing violently,
rushed down the street in pursuit of the people
who were walking and driving past, and, crazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
with fear, were flying to the first shelter which presented
itself.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;The catskin man, the catskin man,</div>
<div class="verse">He fell down beneath a fence!&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>piped up some naughty little girls, in their thin voices,
after Kuzma, as they hopped from stone to stone,
across the shallow stream of the Suburb.</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;When he skins cats, he gets the paws!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh, you little wretches!&#8221; a railway conductor
growled at them. In an overcoat that was dreadfully
heavy even to look at, he was walking in front of
Kuzma, and he shook a small iron box at them.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you pick on some one of your own age?&#8221;</p>

<p>But one could judge from his voice that he was
restraining his laughter. The conductor&#8217;s old, deep
goloshes were crusted with dried mud; the belt of his
coat hung by a single button. The small bridge of
planks along which he was walking lay askew. Further
on, alongside the ditches flooded by the spring
freshets, grew stunted bushes. And Kuzma gazed
cheerlessly at them, and at the straw-thatched roofs
on the hill of the Suburb; at the smoky and bluish
clouds which hung over them, and at the reddish-yellow
cur which was gnawing a bone in the ditch.
In the bottom of the ditch, his legs straddled far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
apart, sat a petty burgher, in a waistcoat over a
cotton-print Russian shirt. His widely opened eyes
looked white in his face, which, scarlet with effort,
stared upward in an awkward, stupid grin. When
Kuzma came opposite him, he said, out of sheer clumsiness:
&#8220;Is it you our little girls are taunting? Why,
those little imps learn effrontery in their infancy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis you yourselves who teach them,&#8221; replied
Kuzma, with a frown. &#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; he said to himself,
as he ascended the hill, &#8220;a frog does not keep his
tail long!&#8221; On reaching the crest of the hill, inhaling
the damp wind from the plain and catching sight of
the red buildings of the railway station in the midst
of the empty green fields, he again began to smile
faintly. Parliament, deputies! Last night he had returned
from the public park, where, in honour of a
holiday, there had been an illumination, rockets had
soared aloft, and the firemen had played &#8220;Le Toreador&#8221;
and &#8220;Beside the brook, beside the bridge,&#8221; &#8220;The
Maxixe&#8221; and &#8220;The Troika,&#8221; shouting in the middle of
the galop, &#8220;Hey, de-ear one!&#8221; He had returned home
and had started to pull the bell at the gate of his
lodging-house. He had pulled and pulled the rattling
wire&mdash;not a soul. Not a soul anywhere around,
either&mdash;only silence, darkness, the cold greenish sky
in the West, beyond the square at the end of the street,
and, overhead, storm-clouds. At last, some one
crawled forward behind the gate, clearing his throat.
He rattled his keys and grumbled: &#8220;I&#8217;m lame in my
underpinning&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the cause of it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>&#8220;A horse kicked me,&#8221; replied the man; and, as he
unlocked and opened the gate, he added: &#8220;Well, now
there are still two left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The men from the court, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you know why the judge came?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To try the deputy. They say he tried to poison
the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, the deputy? You fool, do deputies meddle
with such things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil only knows what they&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the Suburb, beside the threshold
of a clay hut, stood a tall old man wearing leg-cloths.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
In the old man&#8217;s hand was a long staff of walnut wood.
On catching sight of a passer-by, he made haste to
pretend that he was much older than he really was.
He grasped the staff in both hands, hunched up his
shoulders, and imparted to his countenance a weary,
melancholy expression. The damp, cold wind which
was blowing from the fields agitated the shaggy locks
of his grey hair. And Kuzma recalled his own father,
his own childhood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Russia, Russia! Whither art thou dashing?&#8221; Gogol&#8217;s
exclamation recurred to his mind. &#8220;Russia,
Russia! Akh, vain babblers, you stick at nothing!
That&#8217;s the best answer you can make: &#8216;The deputy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
tried to poison the river.&#8217; Yes, but who is responsible?
First of all, the unhappy populace&mdash;and unhappy
they are!&#8221; And tears welled up in Kuzma&#8217;s little
green eyes&mdash;welled up suddenly, as had often happened
with him of late. Not long ago he had strolled into
Avdyeeff&#8217;s eating-house, in the Woman&#8217;s Bazaar. He
had entered the courtyard, ankle deep in mud, and
from the courtyard ascended to the first storey&mdash;&#8220;the
Gentry&#8217;s Department&#8221;&mdash;by a wooden staircase so stinking,
so rotten through and through, that it turned even
his stomach&mdash;the stomach of a man who had seen sights
in his day. With difficulty he had opened the heavy,
greasy door, covered with scraps of felt and tattered
rags in place of a proper casing, and provided with
a pulley-weight fashioned from a brick and a bit of
rope. He was fairly blinded by the charcoal vapour,
the smoke, the glare of the tin reflectors behind the
little wall-lamps, and deafened by the crash of the
dishes on the counter; by the talking, the clatter of the
waiters running about in all directions, and the repulsive
uproar of the gramophone. Then he passed on to
the most distant room, where there were fewer people,
ate at a small table, ordered a bottle of mead. Underfoot,
on a floor soiled with the trampling of feet and
with spittle, lay slices of lemon, eggshells, butts of
cigarettes. And near the wall opposite sat a long-limbed
peasant in bast-slippers, smiling beatifically,
shaking his frowsy head, and listening to the shrieking
gramophone. On his small table were a small
measure of vodka, a small glass, and cracknels. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the peasant was not drinking: only wagging his head
and staring at his bast-shoes.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, becoming conscious of Kuzma&#8217;s
gaze riveted upon him, he opened his eyes wide with
joy, raised his wonderfully kind face with its waving
reddish beard. &#8220;Well, so you&#8217;ve flown in!&#8221; he exclaimed,
in delight and surprise. And he hastened to
add, by way of justifying himself: &#8220;Sir, I have a
brother who serves here&mdash;my own brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Blinking away his tears, Kuzma clenched his teeth.
Ugh, damn it, to what a point had the people been
trampled upon, beaten down! &#8220;You&#8217;ve flown in!&#8221;
That in connection with Avdyeeff&#8217;s establishment!
And that was not all: when Kuzma rose to his feet
and said: &#8220;Well, goodbye!&#8221; the peasant hurriedly
rose to his feet also, and out of the fulness of a
happy heart, with profound gratitude for the light and
luxury of the surroundings, and because he had been
addressed in a human manner, quickly answered:
&#8220;No offence meant!&#8221;</p>




<h3>VI</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">IN former days conversation in the railway carriages
had turned exclusively on the rain and the
drought, on the fact that &#8220;God fixes the price for
grain.&#8221; Now, the sheets of newspapers rustled in the
hands of many passengers, and discussion busied itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
with the Duma, the rights of the people, the expropriation
of the land. No one even noticed the
pouring rain which pattered on the roof, although
the travellers belonged to the class which was always
greedy for spring rains&mdash;grain dealers, peasants,
petty burghers from the farms. A young soldier who
had lost his leg passed along: he was suffering from
jaundice, his black eyes were mournful, he hobbled
and clattered his wooden leg as he doffed his tall Mandzhurian
fur cap and, like a beggar, made the sign of
the cross every time he received an alms. A noisy,
angry discussion started up on the subject of the Government,
the Minister Durnovo, and some governmental
oats. They referred, jeeringly, to that which
formerly had evoked their naif enthusiasm: how
&#8220;Vitya,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> with the object of frightening the Japanese
at Portsmouth, had ordered his trunks to be packed.</p>

<p>A young man, with his hair cut close like beaver
fur, who sat opposite Kuzma, reddened, grew embarrassed,
and made haste to interpose: &#8220;Excuse me,
gentlemen! You are talking about liberty. I serve
in the office of the tax inspector, and I write articles
for the city newspapers. Do you think that is any
business of his? He asserts that he, too, believes in
liberty, but when he found out that I had written
about the abnormal condition of our fire department,
he sent for me and said: &#8216;Damn you, if you write
any more pieces like that I&#8217;ll wring your neck!&#8217; Permit
me: if my views are more on the left than his&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>&#8220;Views?&#8221; suddenly shouted the alto voice of a
dwarf, the young man&#8217;s neighbour, a fat skopetz<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
in bottle-shaped boots&mdash;miller Tchernyaeff, who had
been casting sidelong glances at him all the while
from his pig-like little eyes. And, without giving
him a chance to reply, he roared: &#8220;Views? You
mean to say you have views? And you&#8217;re more of
a Left? Why, I&#8217;ve known you ever since you were
running around without breeches in your childhood!
And you were perishing with hunger, along with your
father&mdash;you mendicants! You ought to be washing
the inspector&#8217;s feet and drinking the dirty water!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Con-sti-tu-u-tion,&#8221; interjected Kuzma in a
shrill tone, interrupting the eunuch; and rising from
his seat and jostling the knees of the sitting passengers,
he went down the carriage to the door.</p>

<p>The eunuch&#8217;s feet were small, plump, and repulsive,
like those of some aged housekeeper; his face, also, was
feminine, large, yellow, solid, like gutta-percha; his
lips were thin. And Polozoff was another nice one&mdash;the
teacher at the pro-gymnasium, the man who had
been nodding his head so amiably, and leaning on his
stick, as he listened to the eunuch; a squat, well-nourished
man of thirty, in high shoes with the tops
tucked under grey trousers, a grey hat, and a grey
coat with sleeve-flaps; a clear-eyed fellow with a round
nose and a luxuriant sandy beard spreading all over
his chest. A teacher, but he wore a heavy gold seal
ring on his forefinger. And he already owned a small
house&mdash;the dowry he had acquired along with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Archpriest&#8217;s daughter.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> His feet also were small, his
hands were short, his fingers mere stumps; he was neat,
groomed to a surprising nicety, and he took a bath
every day. He was said to be an execrable man; the
Lord forbid! Yes, decidedly peasants and petty citizens
were not fit for such as he. Kuzma, as he opened
the door to the platform, inhaled a deep breath of the
cold and fragrant rain-drenched air. The rain droned
dully on the roof over the platform, poured
off it in streams, and spurts of it spattered over
Kuzma. After the town the air of the fields, mingled
with the exciting odour of the smoke from the locomotive,
intoxicated him. The carriages, as they
swayed, rattled louder than the noise of the rain; rising
and falling as they approached, the telegraph
wires floated past; on both sides ran the dense vividly-green
borders of a hazel copse. A motley-hued gang
of small boys suddenly sprang out from under the
foot of the embankment and shouted something or
other shrilly in chorus. Kuzma burst out laughing
from sheer pleasure, and his whole face was covered
with tiny wrinkles. But when he raised his eyes, he
saw on the opposite platform a pilgrim; a kindly,
jaded peasant face, a grey beard, a broad-brimmed hat,
a cloth coat girt with a rope, a pouch and a tin tea-kettle
hanging on his back, and, on his skinny feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
bast-shoes. The pilgrim was smiling, too. And
Kuzma shouted to him, athwart the rumbling and
the noise: &#8220;What&#8217;s your name, grandfather?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anton. Anton Bezpalykh,&#8221; replied the old man
with amiable readiness, in a thin voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just back from a pilgrimage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Voronezh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they burning out the landed proprietors
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they are....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s fine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say &#8217;tis fine!&#8221; shouted Kuzma. And, turning
aside and blinking away the welling tears, he began
with trembling hands to roll himself a cigarette. But
his thoughts had already grown confused. &#8220;The pilgrim
is one of the people, but do not the eunuch and
the teacher belong to the people? &#8217;Tis only forty-five
years since serfdom was abolished&mdash;so what can
be expected of the people? Yes, but who is to blame
for it? The people themselves. Russia under the
Russian yoke; the Little Brothers<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of divers sorts
under the Turkish; the Galicians under the Austrians&mdash;and
&#8217;tis useless to say anything about the Poles.
Hey there, thou great Slavonic family!&#8221; And
Kuzma&#8217;s face once more lightened. Darting oblique
glances about him on all sides, he began to twiddle
his fingers, wring them, and crack their joints.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>



<h3>VII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">HE alighted at the fourth station and hired a conveyance.
At first the peasant drivers demanded
seven rubles&mdash;it was twelve versts to Kazakovo&mdash;then
they came down to five and a half. At last
one of them said: &#8220;Give me a three-ruble note and
I&#8217;ll drive you; otherwise, &#8217;tis not worth wagging your
tongue about. Times nowadays are not what they
used to be.&#8221; But he was unable to maintain that tone,
and added the customary phrase: &#8220;And, besides, fodder
is dear.&#8221; And he drove, after all, for a ruble and
a half. The mud was fathomless, impassable, the cart
was tiny, the wretched little nag, barely alive, was as
long-eared as an ass and extremely weak. When they
had slowly emerged from the courtyard of the station,
the peasant, seated on the side-rail, began to get impatient
and jerked the rope reins as if he longed with
his whole being to aid the horse. At the station he
had bragged &#8220;She can&#8217;t be held back,&#8221; and now he
evidently felt ashamed. But the worst part of it all
was&mdash;the man himself. Young, huge of build, fairly
plump, he was clad in bast-shoes and white leg-wrappers,
a short kazak coat girt with a strip of cloth,
and an old peaked cap on his straight yellow hair.
He emitted the smoky odour out of a chimneyless hut
and of hemp&mdash;a regular husbandman of olden times,
with a white beardless face, a swollen throat and a
hoarse voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; inquired Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m called Akhvanasiy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Akhvanasiy!&#8221; said Kuzma angrily to himself.
&#8220;And what else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Menshoff.&mdash;Ho, get up there, antichrist!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it the evil malady?&#8221; And Kuzma indicated his
throat with a nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, it is,&#8221; mumbled Menshoff, turning his
eyes aside. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been drinking cold kvas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it hurt you to swallow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To swallow?&mdash;no, it doesn&#8217;t hurt&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, don&#8217;t talk unnecessarily,&#8221; said
Kuzma sternly. &#8220;You&#8217;d better go to the hospital as
soon as you can. Married, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m married....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there, now, you see. You&#8217;ll have children,
and you&#8217;ll be making them all a famous present!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as sure as giving them a drink,&#8221; assented
Menshoff. And, waxing impatient, he began to jerk
the reins again. &#8220;Ho, get up there. You&#8217;re an unmanageable
brute, antichrist!&#8221; At last he abandoned
this futile effort and calmed down. For a long time
he maintained silence, then suddenly inquired: &#8220;Have
they assembled that Duma yet, merchant?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they do say that Makaroff is still alive, only
they don&#8217;t want it known.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma merely shrugged his shoulders: the devil only
knew what these steppe men had in their heads! &#8220;But
what wealth is here!&#8221; he said to himself, as he sat
miserably on a tuft of straw, his knees drawn up on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the bare floor of the springless cart, covered with a
coarse cloth used for wrapping grain. He surveyed
the road. The weather had grown still colder; still
more gloomily the storm-clouds from the northwest
came sailing over this black loam region, saturated
with rains. The mud on the roads was bluish, greasy;
the green of the trees, of the grass, of the vegetable
gardens was dark and dense; and over everything lay
that bluish tint of the black loam and the storm-clouds.
But the cottages were of clay, tiny, with roofs of manure.
Alongside them stood dried-up water casks.
Of course, the water in them contained tadpoles.</p>

<p>Here was a well-to-do farmstead. In the vegetable
garden, behind old bushes, an apiary, and a tiny
orchard of three or four wild apple-trees, rose an old,
dark-hued grain rick. The stable, the gate, and the
cottage were all under one roof, thatched with hackled
straw. The cottage was of brick, in two sections, the
dividing line marked out with chalk: on one side was
a pole surmounted by a forked branch, a fir-tree; on
the other was something resembling a cock. The small
windows were also rimmed with chalk in a toothed
pattern. &#8220;There&#8217;s creative genius for you!&#8221; grinned
Kuzma. &#8220;The stone age, God forgive me&mdash;the times
of the cave men!&#8221; On the doors of the detached sheds
were crosses sketched in charcoal; by the porch stood
a large tombstone, obviously prepared in anticipation
of death by grandfather or grandmother. Yes, truly,
a well-to-do farmstead. But the mud round about was
knee deep; a pig was reclining on the porch, and on
top of him, balancing itself and flapping its wings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a yellow chicken was parading. The windows were
tiny, and in the part of the cottage appropriated to
human occupation, darkness and eternally cramped
conditions must inevitably reign&mdash;the sleeping shelf
on top of the oven, the loom for weaving, a good-sized
oven, a trough filled with slops. And the family would
be large, with many children, and in winter time there
would be lambs and calves as well. And the dampness
and the charcoal fumes would be such that a
green vapour must hang over all. The children would
whimper and howl when slapped on the nape of the
neck; the sisters-in-law would revile one another
(&#8220;May the lightning smite you, you roving, homeless
cur!&#8221;) and each express the hope that the other
might &#8220;choke on a bite on the Great Day&#8221;;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the aged
mother-in-law would be incessantly hurling something&mdash;the
oven-fork, the bowls&mdash;and rushing at her daughters-in-law,
her sleeves tucked up on her dark, sinewy
arms, and wearing herself out with shrill scolding, besprinkling
now one of them, now another with saliva
and curses. The old man, ugly-tempered and ailing,
would wear them all to exhaustion with his exhortations,
would drag his married sons by the hair; and
sometimes they would weep, in the repulsive peasant
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose farm is this?&#8221; asked Kuzma. &#8220;The Krasnoffs&#8217;,&#8221;
answered Menshoff, adding, &#8220;All of them are
sick with it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beyond the Krasnoff farm they drove out on to the
pasturage. The village was large, and so was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
common for pasture. The annual Fair was being arranged
on it. The framework of booths already rose
aloft here and there, and there were piles of wheels
and pottery; a hastily constructed oven was smoking,
and a smell of fritters hung in the air; the travelling
caravan-wagon of some gypsies loomed grey on the
plain, and close to its wheels sat sheep-dogs, fastened to
them by chains. On the left, peasant cottages were
visible; on the right lay a lumber-yard, two town
shops, and a bakery. Farther away, alongside the
governmental dram-shop, stood a dense cluster of
young girls and peasant men, from which shouts rang
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;The people are making holiday,&#8221; remarked Menshoff
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the cause of their joy?&#8221; inquired Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are hoping for&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody knows for what. The house-sprite!&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was true. On that bare pasture-common,
that overcast, chilly day, those squeals of delight and
the sounds of two accordions played in perfect unison
seemed pitiful, were swallowed in an atmosphere of
commonplaceness, of boredom and age. The people
were experiencing something new, were celebrating
something, but did they believe in their festival?
&#8220;Oh, hardly!&#8221; said Kuzma to himself, as he drove
close and surveyed the white, pink, and green petticoats
of the girls, the indifferent, coarsely painted
faces, the orange-coloured, golden-hued, and crimson
kerchiefs. The cart drove up to the crowd and halted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Menshoff stared boldly at the throng and broke into
a grin. At that close range the sounds no longer
seemed pitiful&mdash;the accordions eagerly played up to
each other, and in harmony with them, amid the approving
hubbub of the drunken men, quaint adages
flew briskly about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho-o,&#8221; some one shouted, to an accompaniment of
dull but lusty stamping of feet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;Plough not, reap not,</div>
<div class="verse">But bring fritters to the maidens!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And a peasant, short of stature, who was standing
behind the crowd, suddenly began to flourish his arms.
Everything about him was prosperous, clean, substantial&mdash;his
bast-shoes, his leg-wrappers, his new trousers
of heavy plaided home-made linen, and the pleated
skirts of his undercoat, made of appallingly thick
grey cloth and cut very short, with a bob-tailed effect.
It is probable that he had never danced before in his
life, but now he began, softly and skilfully, to stamp
with his bast-shoes, to wave his arms, and to shout
in a tenor voice: &#8220;Stand aside, let the merchant have
a peep!&#8221; and, leaping into the circle, which parted before
him, he began to kick his legs about wildly in front
of a tall young fellow, who, tossing away his peaked
cap, twisted his boots about in devilish fashion and, as
he did so, flung aside his black jacket and danced on
in his new cotton print shirt. The face of the young
man was pale and perspiring and wore a concentrated,
gloomy expression which made his piercing yells seem
all the more violent and unexpected.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>&#8220;Son! Dear one!&#8221; shrieked an old crone in a
plaided wool skirt of South Russian fashion, stretching
out her hands. &#8220;Stop, for Christ&#8217;s sake! Dear boy,
stop it&mdash;you&#8217;ll kill yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>And her dear son suddenly threw back his head,
clenched his fists and his teeth, and, with fury in his
countenance and his trampling, screeched through his
teeth:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tztzytz, good woman, shut your mouth with that
cuckoo song.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she has just sold the last bit of her home-made
linen for him,&#8221; remarked Menshoff, as they crawled
slowly across the pasture land. &#8220;She loves him passionately.
She&#8217;s a widow. He raps her over the
mouth when he is drunk. Of course, she deserves
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that&mdash;&#8216;she deserves it.&#8217;?&#8221;
inquired Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because she does. You shouldn&#8217;t be too indulgent&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, in the town, in the railway carriages, in the
hamlets, in the villages, everywhere, one could feel
the presence of something unusual, the echoes of some
great festival, some great victory, great expectations.
But back there in the suburb Kuzma had already realized
that the farther one went into those limitless
fields, beneath that cold, gloomy sky, the duller, the
more irrational, the more melancholy would those
echoes become. Now they had driven away, and the
shouts in the crowd about the dram-shop had again
become pitiful. There they were keeping festival and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
trying to &#8220;celebrate,&#8221; but ahead lay boredom, remote
wilds, an empty street, smoky chimneyless hovels,
water-casks with putrid pond water, and then more
fields, the blue mist of the chilly distance, the dark
forest on the horizon, low-hanging storm-clouds.</p>

<p>At one cottage&mdash;it had a broken window and a wheel
on the rotten roof&mdash;a long-legged, ailing peasant sat
on a bench. People look handsomer in their coffins
than he looked in life. He resembled the poet Nekrasoff.
Over his shoulders, above a long and soiled
shirt of hemp crash, was thrown an old short sheepskin
coat; his stick-like legs stood in felt boots; his
huge dead-looking hands lay evenly spaced on his
sharp knees, upon his ragged trousers. His cap was
pulled far down on his forehead, after the fashion of
old men; his eyes were suffering, entreating; his superhumanly
meagre and emaciated face was drawn down,
his ashen lips half open.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Tchutchen,&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> said Menshoff, nodding in the
direction of the sick man. &#8220;He&#8217;s been dying these
two years from trouble with his stomach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tchutchen? What&#8217;s that&mdash;a nickname?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a nickname.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stupid!&#8221; said Kuzma. And he turned his head
away, in order to avoid seeing the horrid little girl
by the neighbouring cottage. She was leaning back
and holding in her arms an infant in a cap, and, as
she stared intently at the passers-by and stuck out her
tongue at them, she chewed on a bit of black bread,
which she was preparing as a sucking-piece for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
child. And in the last yard and threshing-floor the
bushes hummed in the breezes, and a scarecrow, all
awry, fluttered its empty sleeves. The threshing-floor,
which adjoins the steppe, is always uncomfortable,
dreary; and there were the scarecrow, the autumnal
storm-clouds, the wind humming across the fields,
ruffling up the tails of the fowls which roved about the
threshing-floor, overgrown with pigweed and mugwort,
alongside the grain-rick with its uncovered crest,
alongside the threshing machine of Ryazan make,
painted blue....</p>




<h3>VIII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE small forest which lay blue against the horizon
consisted of two long ravines thickly overgrown
with oak-trees. It was known by the
name of Portotchka. Near this Portotchka Kuzma
was overtaken by a driving downpour of rain mingled
with hail, which accompanied him the whole way to
Kazakovo. Menshoff whipped up his sorry nag into
a gallop as they neared the village, while Kuzma sat
with eyes tightly screwed up beneath the wet grain-cloth.
His hands were stiff with cold; icy rivulets
trickled down the collar of his great-coat; the coarse
cloth, heavy with the rain, stank of the sour grain-kiln.
The hailstones rattled on his head, cakes of
mud flew up into his face, the water in the ruts beneath
the wheels splashed noisily; lambs were bleating
somewhere or other. At last Kuzma became so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
stifled that he flung the cloth from his head and greedily
gulped in the fresh air. The rain lessened in intensity.
Evening drew on; the flocks dashed past the
cart, across the green pasture land, on their way to the
cottages. A thin-legged black sheep had got astray
from the flock, and a bare-legged peasant woman,
garbed in a rain-drenched short petticoat, darted after
it, her white calves gleaming. In the west, beyond the
village, the sky was growing brighter; to the east, on
a background of dusty-bluish storm-clouds, two
greenish-violet rainbows hung over the grain fields. A
dense, damp odour of verdure arose from the fields,
and of warmth from the dwellings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the manor-house of the proprietor?&#8221;
Kuzma shouted to a broad-shouldered woman in a
white chemise and a red petticoat.</p>

<p>The woman was standing on a stone beside the cottage
of the village policeman, holding by the hand a
little girl about two years of age. The little girl was
vociferating so lustily that his question was inaudible.</p>

<p>&#8220;The homestead?&#8221; repeated the woman. &#8220;Whose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The manor-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose? I can&#8217;t hear anything you say.&mdash;Ah, may
you choke! I hope the fits will get you!&#8221; shrieked the
woman, jerking the little girl so violently by the hand
that she executed a complete turn and, flying off the
stone, hung suspended.</p>

<p>They made inquiries at another cottage. Driving
along the broad street, they turned to the left, then to
the right, and, passing some one&#8217;s old-fashioned manor-house,
hermetically boarded up, they began to descend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
a steep declivity to a bridge across a small stream.
Water trickled from Menshoff&#8217;s face, his hands, his
coat. His fat face with its long white eyelashes, thus
washed, looked more stupid than ever. He was gazing
off into space ahead with an expression of curiosity.
Kuzma gazed, also. In that direction, on the sloping
pasture land, lay the dark manor-park of Kazakovo,
the spacious courtyard surrounded by decaying
outbuildings and the ruins of a stone wall; in the
centre of the courtyard, behind three withered fir-trees,
stood the house, sheathed in grey boards, with a rusty-red
roof. Below, at the bridge, was a cluster of peasants.
And, coming to meet them up the steep road,
which was washed into gullies, a troika-team of lean
work-horses, harnessed to a tarantas, was struggling
through the mud and straining up the hill. A tattered
but handsome labourer, tall, pale, with a small reddish
beard and clever eyes, was standing beside the vehicle,
jerking at the reins, exerting his utmost efforts, and
shouting: &#8220;Ge-et up there! G-g-et up there!&#8221; The
peasants, meanwhile, with shouts and whistling, were
chiming in: &#8220;Whoa! Who-oa!&#8221; A young woman
dressed in mourning, large tears hanging on her long
eyelashes and her face distorted with fear, who was
seated in the carriage, was throwing out her hands
despairingly before her. Fear, suspense, lay in the
turquoise-blue eyes of the stout, sandy-mustached
young man who sat beside her. His wedding ring
gleamed on his right hand, which clutched a revolver;
he kept waving his left hand, and, without doubt,
he must have felt very warm in his camel&#8217;s hair waistcoat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and his gentleman&#8217;s peaked cap, which had slipped
over on the back of his head. The children, a small
boy and a girl, pallid with hunger and fatigue, wrapped
in shawls, looked on with gentle curiosity from
the little bench opposite the main seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Mishka Siversky,&#8221; said Menshoff in a loud,
hoarse voice, as he drove around the troika and stared
indifferently at the children. &#8220;They turned him out
yesterday. Evidently, he deserved it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The affairs of the Kazakovo gentry were managed
by a superintendent, a retired soldier of the cavalry, a
tall, rough man. Kuzma was told that he must apply
to him in the servants&#8217; quarters, by a workman who
drove into the farmyard in a cart heaped with freshly
cut coarse wet green grass. But the superintendent
had had two catastrophes that day&mdash;his baby had
died and a cow had perished&mdash;so Kuzma did not
meet with an amiable reception. When, leaving Menshoff
outside the gate, he approached the servants&#8217;
quarters, the superintendent&#8217;s wife, her face all tear-stained,
was bringing in a speckled hen, which sat
peaceably under her arm. Among the columns on the
dilapidated porch stood a tall young man in full
trousers, high boots, and a Russian shirt of cotton
print, who, on catching sight of the superintendent&#8217;s
wife, shouted: &#8220;Agafya, where are you taking it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To kill,&#8221; replied the superintendent&#8217;s wife, seriously
and sadly, coming to a halt beside the ice-house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it here and I&#8217;ll kill it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon the young man directed his steps to the
ice-house, paying no attention to the rain, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
beginning to drizzle down again from the drowning
sky. Opening the door of the ice-house, he took from
the threshold a hatchet. A minute later a brief tap
resounded, and the headless chicken, with a red stump
of a neck, went running across the grass, stumbling
and whirling about, flapping its wings and scattering
in all directions feathers and spatters of blood. The
young man tossed aside the hatchet and went off to
the orchard, while the superintendent&#8217;s wife, after she
had caught the chicken, stepped up to Kuzma. &#8220;What
do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came about the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait for Fedor Ivanitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be here immediately, from the fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Kuzma began to wait at the window of the servants&#8217;
quarters. He glanced inside and descried in
the semi-darkness an oven, sleeping boards, a table,
a small trough on the bench near the window, and a
little coffin made from such another trough, in which
lay the dead baby with a large, nearly naked head and
a little bluish face. At the table sat a fat blind young
girl, fishing with a wooden spoon for the bits of bread
in a bowl of milk. The flies were buzzing around
her like bees in a hive, but the blind girl, sitting as
erect as a stuffed figure, with her white eyeballs staring
into the darkness, went on eating and eating.
She made a terrible impression on Kuzma, and he
turned away. A cold wind was blowing in gusts, and
the clouds made it darker and darker.</p>

<p>In the centre of the farmyard rose two pillars with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a cross-bar, and from the cross-bar hung, as if it were
a holy picture, a large sheet of iron; upon this they
rapped when they were alarmed at night. About the
farmyard lay thin wolf hounds. A small boy about
eight years of age was running around among them,
dragging in a small cart his flaxen-haired, chubby-faced
younger brother, who wore a large black peaked
cap. The little cart was squeaking wildly. The
manor-house was grey, heavy-looking, and, assuredly,
devilishly dreary in this twilight. &#8220;If they would
only light up!&#8221; Kuzma said to himself. He was
deadly weary, and it seemed to him as if he had left
the town almost a year ago. Suddenly a sound of
roaring and barking became audible, and through the
gate of the orchard madly leaped a pair of dogs,
a greyhound and a watchdog, dragging each other
sidewise, any way as chance decreed, colliding, staring
wildly about, and trying to tear each other to
pieces, their heads in different directions. After them,
shouting something or other, raced the young gentleman.</p>




<h3>IX</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">KUZMA spent the evening and the night in the
garden, in the old bath-house. The superintendent,
on arriving from the fields on horseback,
had remarked angrily that the garden had been
&#8220;leased long ago,&#8221; and in reply to a request for lodging
over-night had expressed insolent amazement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
&#8220;Well, but you are a sensible fellow!&#8221; he had shouted,
without either rhyme or reason. &#8220;A nice posting-station
you&#8217;ve picked out! Are there many of your
stamp roving about at present?&#8221; But he took pity
on Kuzma in the end, and gave him permission to go
into the bath-house. Kuzma paid off Menshoff and
walked past the manor-house to the gate into the linden
avenue. Through the unlighted open windows,
from beyond the wire fly-screens, thundered a grand
piano, drowned by a magnificent baritone-tenor voice,
lifted in intricate vocalizations which were completely
out of harmony with both the evening and the manor.
Along the muddy sand of the sloping avenue, at the
end of which, as if at the end of the world, the cloud-flecked
sky gleamed dully white, there advanced toward
Kuzma a poor-looking peasant, short of stature, with
dark reddish hair, his shirt minus a belt; he was capless,
wore heavy boots, and was carrying a bucket
in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oho, ho!&#8221; he said, jeeringly, as he listened to the
singing while he walked on. &#8220;Oho, he&#8217;s going it
strong, may his belly burst!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is going it strong?&#8221; inquired Kuzma.</p>

<p>The peasant raised his head and halted. &#8220;Why,
that young gentleman of ours,&#8221; he said, merrily, making
havoc with his consonants. &#8220;They say he has been
doing that these seven years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which one&mdash;the one who was chasing the dogs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no, another one. But that&#8217;s not all! Sometimes
he takes to screeching, &#8216;To-day &#8217;tis your turn,
to-morrow &#8217;twill be mine&#8217;&mdash;regular calamity!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;s taking lessons, of course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice lessons they must be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that other one&mdash;what does he do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow?&#8221; The peasant drew a long breath,
smiling in a discreetly jeering manner the while.
&#8220;Why, nothing. Why should he? he has good victuals
and amusement: Fedka tosses bottles, and he shoots
at them; sometimes he buys a peasant&#8217;s beard, cuts
it off, and stuffs it into his gun, for fun. Then again,
there are the dogs: we have an immense number of
them. On Sundays, when the church bells begin to
peal, the whole pack of them sets to howling; &#8217;tis an
awful row they make! Day before yesterday they
chewed up a peasant&#8217;s dog, and the peasants went to
the courtyard of the manor. &#8216;Give us enough to buy
a vedro<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> of liquor, and we&#8217;ll call it quits. Otherwise,
we&#8217;ll go on strike at once.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, did he give the money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he didn&#8217;t! Gi-ive, indeed, brother!&mdash;There
is a miller here. He came straight out on the
porch and said: &#8216;The wind is blowing from the fields,
gentlemen-nobles!&#8217; Catch him napping, forsooth!
The young gentleman started to bully them: &#8216;What
sort of a wind is that you&#8217;re talking about?&#8217; &#8216;Just
a certain sort,&#8217; says he. &#8216;I&#8217;ve propounded a riddle
to you; now you just think it over!&#8217; That brought
him to a dead standstill, brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>All this was uttered in a careless sort of way,
passed over lightly, with intervening pauses, but accompanied
by such a malignant smile and such torturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of his consonants that Kuzma began to look
more attentively at the man whom he had thus casually
encountered. In appearance he resembled a fool.
His hair was straight, cut in a round crop, and long.
His face was small, insignificant, of ancient Russian
type, like the holy pictures of the Suzdal school. His
boots were huge, his body lean and somehow wooden.
His eyes, beneath large, sleepy lids, were like those of
a hawk, with a golden ring around the iris. When he
lowered his lids he was a lisping idiot; when he raised
them one felt a certain fear of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you live in the garden?&#8221; asked Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Where else should I live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name? Akim. And who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to lease the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now&mdash;that is an idea!&#8221; And Akim, wagging
his head scoffingly, went on his way.</p>

<p>The wind blew with ever increasing vehemence, scattering
showers of rain from the brilliantly green trees;
beyond the park, in some low-lying region, the thunder
rumbled dully, pale blue flashes of aurora borealis
lighted up the avenue, and nightingales were singing
everywhere about. It was utterly incomprehensible
how they were able so sedulously, in such complete
disregard of surrounding conditions, to warble, trill,
and scatter their notes broadcast so sweetly and vigorously
beneath that heavy sky, veiled in leaden clouds,
amid the trees bending in the wind, as they perched
in the dense, wet bushes. But still more incomprehensible
was it how the watchmen managed to pass the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
night in such a gale, how they could sleep on damp
straw beneath the sloping roof of the rotten hut.</p>

<p>There were three watchmen. And all of them were
sick men. One, young, emaciated, sympathetic, formerly
a baker by trade, but dismissed the preceding
autumn for taking part in a strike, was now a beggar.
He had not as yet lost the peasant look, and
he complained of fever. The second, also a beggar,
but already middle-aged, had tuberculosis, although
he declared that there was nothing the matter with him
except that he felt &#8220;cold between his shoulders.&#8221;
Akim was afflicted with night-blindness&mdash;he could not
see well in the half-light of twilight. When Kuzma
approached, the baker, pale and amiable of manner,
was squatting on his heels near the hut. With the
sleeves of a woman&#8217;s wadded dressing gown tucked
up on his thin, weak arms, he was engaged in washing
millet in a wooden bowl. Consumptive Mitrofan,
a man of medium size, broad and dark complexioned,
who resembled a native of Dahomey, garbed entirely
in wet rags and leg-wrappers which were worn out and
stiff as an old horse&#8217;s hoof, was standing beside
the baker and, with hunched-up shoulders, staring at
the latter&#8217;s work with brilliant brown eyes, strained
wide open but devoid of all expression. Akim had
brought a bucket of water and was making a fire in
a little clay oven-niche opposite the hut; he was blowing
the fire into life. He entered the hut, selected the
driest tufts of straw he could find, and again approached
the fire, which was now fragrantly smoking
beneath the iron kettle, muttering to himself the while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
breathing with a whistling sound, smiling in a mockingly
mysterious way at the bantering of his comrades,
and occasionally bringing them up short with
a venomous and clever remark. Kuzma shut his eyes
and listened now to the conversation, now to the
nightingales, as he sat on a wet bench beside the hut,
besprinkled with icy spatterings of rain whenever the
damp wind rushed through the avenue beneath the
gloomy sky, which quivered with pale flashes of lightning,
while the thunder rumbled. He felt a pain in
his stomach, from hunger and tobacco. It seemed as if
the porridge would never be cooked, and he could not
banish from his mind the thought that perhaps he himself
would be obliged to live just such a wild beast&#8217;s
life as that of these watchmen, and that ahead of him
lay nothing but old age, sickness, loneliness, and poverty.
His body ached, and the gusts of wind, the far-away
monotonous grumbling of the thunder, the nightingales,
and the leisurely, carelessly malicious lisping
of Akim and his squeaking voice, all irritated him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to buy yourself at least a belt, Akimushka,&#8221;
said the baker with affected simplicity, as he
lighted a cigarette. He kept casting glances at Kuzma,
by way of inviting him to listen to Akim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you wait,&#8221; replied Akim in an absent-minded,
scoffing tone, as he poured the fluid porridge from the
boiling kettle into a cup. &#8220;When we&#8217;ve lived here
with the proprietor through the summer, I&#8217;ll buy you
boots with a squeak in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;With a skvvvveak&#8217;! Well, I&#8217;m not asking you to
do anything of the sort.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;re wearing leg-wrappers now.&#8221; And Akim began
anxiously to take a test sip of the porridge from
the spoon.</p>

<p>The baker was disconcerted, and heaved a sigh:
&#8220;Why should the likes of us wear boots?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, stop that,&#8221; said Kuzma. &#8220;You had better tell
me whether you have this porridge day in and day
out, for ever and ever, as I think you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and what would you like&mdash;fish, and ham?&#8221;
inquired Akim, without turning round, as he licked
the spoon. &#8220;That really wouldn&#8217;t be so bad: a dram
of vodka, about three pounds of sturgeon, a knuckle
of ham, a little glass of fruit cordial. But this isn&#8217;t
porridge: it&#8217;s called thin gruel. The porridge is for
the appetizer snack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But do you make cabbage soup, or any other sort
of soup?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have had that, brother&mdash;cabbage soup; and
what soup it was! If you were to spill it on the dog
his hair would peel off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you might make a little soup.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where would we get the potatoes? You can&#8217;t
buy any from a peasant, any more than from the
devil, brother! You couldn&#8217;t wheedle even snow out
of a peasant in the middle of winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably &#8217;tis your illness that makes you so bitter!
You ought to get a little treatment&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Akim, without replying, squatted down on his heels
in front of the fire. The fire had already died down;
only a little heap of thin coals glowed red under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
kettle; the garden grew darker and darker, and the
blue aurora had already begun faintly to illuminate
their faces, as the gusts of wind inflated Akim&#8217;s shirt.
Mitrofan was sitting beside Kuzma, leaning on his
stick; the baker sat on a stump under a linden tree.
On hearing Kuzma&#8217;s last words, he grew serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the way I look at it,&#8221; he said submissively
and sadly: &#8220;that nothing can be otherwise than as
the Lord decrees. If the Lord does not grant health,
then all the doctors cannot help. Akim, yonder,
speaks the truth: no one can die before his death-hour
comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctors!&#8221; interposed Akim, staring at the coals and
pronouncing the word in a specially vicious way&mdash;&#8220;doktogga!&#8221;
&#8220;Doctors, brother, have an eye on their
pockets. I&#8217;d let out his guts for him, for such a
doctor, so I would!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all of them are thinking of their pockets,&#8221;
said Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen all of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, don&#8217;t chatter nonsense about what you
haven&#8217;t seen,&#8221; said Mitrofan severely, and turned to
the baker: &#8220;Yes, and you&#8217;re a nice one, too: making
yourself out a hopeless beggar! Perchance, if you
didn&#8217;t wallow round on the ground, dog-fashion, you
wouldn&#8217;t have that acute pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you see, I&mdash;&#8221; the baker began.</p>

<p>But at this point Akim&#8217;s scoffing composure deserted
him of a sudden. And, rolling his stupid hawk-like
eyes, he abruptly leaped to his feet and began
to yell, with the irascibility of an idiot: &#8220;What? So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
I&#8217;m chattering nonsense, am I? Have you been in the
hospital? Have you? And I have been there! I
spent seven days there&mdash;and did he give me any
white-bread rolls, that doctor of yours? Did he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re a fool,&#8221; interposed Mitrofan: &#8220;white
rolls are not given to every sick person: it depends
on their disease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! It depends on their disease! Well, let him
go burst with his disease, devil take him!&#8221; shouted
Akim.</p>

<p>And, casting furious glances about him, he flung
his spoon into the &#8220;thin gruel&#8221; and strode off into the
hut.</p>




<h3>X</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE, breathing with his whistling breath, he
lighted the lamp, and the hut assumed a cosy
air. Then he fished out spoons from some niche
close under the roof, threw them on the table, and
shouted: &#8220;Bring on that porridge, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; The
baker rose and stepped over to the kettle. &#8220;Pray be
our guest,&#8221; he said, as he passed Kuzma. But Kuzma
found it unpleasant to eat with Akim. He asked for a
bit of bread, salted it heavily, and, chewing it with
delight, returned to his seat on the bench. It had
become completely dark. The pale blue light illuminated
the trees more and more extensively, swiftly,
and clearly, as if blown into life by the wind, and at
each flash of the aurora the foliage, in its death-like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
green, became for a moment as distinctly visible as in
the daytime; then everything was again inundated by
blackness as of the tomb. The nightingales had
ceased their song&mdash;only one, directly above the hut,
continued to warble sweetly and powerfully. In the
hut, around the lamp, a peaceably ironical conversation
was flowing on once more. &#8220;They did not even
ask who I am, whence I come,&#8221; said Kuzma to himself.
&#8220;What a people, may the devil take it.&#8221; And he
shouted, jestingly, into the hut: &#8220;Akim! You haven&#8217;t
even asked who I am, and whence I come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why should I want to know?&#8221; replied Akim
indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to ask him about something else,&#8221;
said the baker&#8217;s voice&mdash;&#8220;how much land he expects to
receive from the Duma. What think you, Akimushka?
Hey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no clever one at interpreting writing,&#8221; said
Akim. &#8220;You can see it better from the dung-heap.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the baker must have been disconcerted once
more: silence ensued, for a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is referring to us, the likes of himself,&#8221; remarked
Mitrofan. &#8220;I happened to mention that in
Rostoff the poor folks&mdash;the proletariat, that is to say&mdash;save
themselves in winter time in the manure&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They go outside the town,&#8221; cut in Akim cheerfully,
&#8220;and&mdash;into the manure with them! They burrow in
exactly like the pigs&mdash;and there&#8217;s no harm done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fool!&#8221; Mitrofan snapped him up, and so sternly
that Kuzma turned round. &#8220;What are you gobbling
about? You stupid fool, you rickety bandy-legs!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
When poverty overtakes you, you&#8217;ll burrow too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Akim, dropping his spoon, gazed sleepily at him
and, with the same sudden irascibility which he had
recently exhibited, opened wide his empty hawk-like
eyes and yelled furiously: &#8220;A&mdash;ah! Poverty! Did
you want to work at so much the hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; angrily shouted Mitrofan, inflating his
Dahomey-like nostrils and staring point-blank at
Akim with blazing eyes. &#8220;Twenty hours for twenty
kopeks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A&mdash;ah! But you wanted a ruble an hour? You&#8217;re
a greedy one, devil take you!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the wrangle subsided as quickly as it had
flared up. A minute later Mitrofan was talking
quietly and scalding himself with the porridge: &#8220;As
if he weren&#8217;t greedy himself! Why, he, that blind
devil, would strangle himself in the sanctuary for the
sake of a kopek. If you&#8217;ll believe it, he sold his wife
for fifteen kopeks! God is my witness that I am not
jesting. Off yonder in our village of Lipetzk there&#8217;s
a little old man, Pankoff by name, who also used to
work as gardener&mdash;well, and now he has retired and
is very fond of that sort of affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, doesn&#8217;t Akim come from over Lipetzk way?&#8221;
interrupted Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Studenko, from the village,&#8221; said Akim indifferently,
exactly as if they were not discussing him
at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, right,&#8221; Mitrofan confirmed his statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;A peasant from the roots up. He lives with his
brother, controls the land and the farmyard in common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
with him, but nevertheless somewhat in the position
of a fool; and, of course, his wife has already
run away from him. But we learned the reason why
she ran away, from the man himself: he made a bargain
with Pankoff, for fifteen kopeks, to admit him of
a night, instead of himself, into the chamber&mdash;and
he did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Akim remained silent, tapping the table with his
spoon and staring at the lamp. He had already eaten
his fill, wiped his mouth, and was now engaged in
thinking over something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jabbering is not working, young man,&#8221; he said at
last. &#8220;And what if I did admit him: my wife is
withering, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; And as he listened to hear
what they would say to that, he bared his teeth in a
grin, elevated his eyebrows, and his tiny face, which
was like a Suzdal holy picture, assumed a joyously
sad expression and became covered with large wooden
wrinkles. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to get that fellow with a gun!&#8221;
he said with a specially strong squeak and twisting
of his consonants. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t he go head over heels!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of whom are you speaking?&#8221; inquired Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that nightingale&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma set his teeth and, after reflection, said:
&#8220;Well, you are a putrid peasant. A wild beast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and who cares for what you think?&#8221; retorted
Akim. And, giving vent to a hiccough, he rose
to his feet. &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the use of burning the lamp
for nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mitrofan began to roll a cigarette. The baker
gathered up the spoons. Crawling from under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
table, he turned his back on the lamp and, hurriedly
crossing himself thrice, with a flourish he bent low to
the holy picture, in the direction of the dark corner of
the hut, shook back his straight hair, which resembled
bast, and, raising his face, murmured a prayer. His
large shadow fell upon some chests made of boards
and broke across them, while he himself seemed to
Kuzma even smaller than a short time previously.
Kuzma remembered how he had once been called for
conscription. Five hundred men had been summoned,
only one hundred and twenty being wanted. He had
drawn Number 492: yet he had almost been obliged to
undress, so many of those naked youths&mdash;they resembled
sparrows, with arms as thin as whiplashes and
huge, solid bellies&mdash;had been rejected. Akim hastily
crossed himself once more, and once more made a
flourishing reverence&mdash;and Kuzma gazed at him with a
feeling akin to hatred. There was Akim praying&mdash;but
just try asking him whether he believed in God!
His hawk eyes would leap out of their sockets! Evidently
he had the idea that no one in all the world
believed as he did. He was convinced to the very
bottom of his soul that, in order to please God and
avoid the condemnation of men, it was necessary to
comply in the strictest possible manner with even the
smallest fraction of what was appointed in regard to
the Church, fasts, feasts, good deeds; that for the salvation
of his soul&mdash;not out of good feeling, naturally!&mdash;those
acts must be fulfilled punctually; candles
must be placed before the holy pictures, he must eat
fish, and oil instead of butter; and on feast-days he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
must celebrate, and conciliate the priest with patties
and chickens. And every one was firmly convinced
that Akim was a profound believer, although Akim
himself had never in the whole course of his life
wondered what his God was actually like, just as he
had never pondered upon either heaven or earth, birth
or death. Why should he think? His thinking had
been done for him! He knew all the answers&mdash;calm
answers, prepared a thousand years ago. Didn&#8217;t he
know that in heaven were paradise, angels, the saints;
in hell, devils and sinners; on earth, men who cultivate
the earth, and build houses, and trade, and accumulate
money, and marry, and live for their pleasure?
Not all of them, certainly&mdash;far from all&mdash;but
what was to be done about that? All the same, people
ought to strive toward that&mdash;and when the right time
arrived, Akim, too, would show of what he was capable!
So said Kuzma to himself, recalling, as always,
with amazement and fear, the massacres. Well, and
the mystery of birth and death&mdash;that did not concern
him. After one was born, it was necessary to be
baptized, and to live according to our own manner,
the Russian manner, not after the manner of dogs&mdash;that
is, like Turks and Frenchmen. When one
died, it was indispensable to receive the Sacrament&mdash;otherwise
one could not escape hell&mdash;and the best of
all was to receive the Holy Unction with Oil.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
was all. There are also on the earth insects, flowers,
birds, animals. But Akim did not condescend to
think about flowers and insects&mdash;he simply crushed
them. Among plants he noticed only those which bore
fruit or berries or furnished food. Birds fly, sing&mdash;and
&#8217;tis a most gallant thing to shoot for food those
which are fit for such use, but those which are not
fit should be shot for amusement. All wild beasts, to
the very last one, must be exterminated, but procedure
with regard to animals varies: one&#8217;s own should
be kept in good condition, that they may be of service
to the owner, but old animals and animals which belong
to other people should have their eyes lashed out
with a whip, and their legs should be broken.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what does he care,&#8221; thought Kuzma sadly,
&#8220;what is it to him, seeing that he has no establishment
of his own, that it rains or hails, or that the
thunder rumbles for a week, that the lightnings flash;
that perchance at this very moment they are lighting
up a dead, blue little face in the dark fly-filled
hut where that blind girl lies sleeping?&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed as if he had set out from the town a
year ago; as if, now, he should never be able to
drag himself back to it. His wet cap weighed heavily;
his cold feet ached, cramped in his muddy boots. In
that one day his face had become weather-beaten and
burned. His body had been lamed by the springless
cart, by discomfort, by the longing for rest. But
sleep&mdash;no, one could not get to sleep yet. Rising
from the bench, Kuzma went out against the damp
gale, to the gate which led into the fields, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
waste spaces of the long-abandoned cemetery. A
faint light from the hut fell upon the mud; but as
soon as Kuzma had taken his departure, Akim blew
out the lamp, the light vanished, and night immediately
closed in. The bluish lightning flashed out still
more vividly and unexpectedly, laid bare the whole
sky, the extreme recesses of the orchard to the most
distant apple trees, where stood the bath-house, and
suddenly inundated everything with such blackness
that one&#8217;s head swam. And once more, somewhere low
down, the dull, far-away thunder began to rumble;
and from behind the rustling of the trees and the
droning of the rain came the abrupt whining, barking,
and snarling of the dogs, feasting outside the orchard
on a cow which had died. After standing still
for a while, until he made out the dim light which
filtered under the gate, Kuzma emerged into the road
which ran past the earth wall, past rustling ancient
lindens and maple trees, and began to stroll slowly
to and fro. The rain began to patter down once more
on his cap and his hands. But he wanted to think
out what he had begun. Suddenly the black darkness
was again deeply rent; the raindrops glistened; and
on the waste land, in a corpse-like blue light, the
figure of a dripping, thin-necked horse stood out in
sharp lines. A field of oats, of a pallid, metallic green
hue, flashed into momentary sight beyond the waste
land, against an inky black background; and the horse
raised his head. Dread overpowered Kuzma. The
horse was promptly swallowed up in the darkness.
But&mdash;to whom did he belong? why was he not hobbled?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
why was he thus roaming about without oversight?
And Kuzma turned back toward the gate. In
the ditch alongside the earthen wall, among the dock-weeds
and nettles, some one was half growling, half
snoring. Stumbling along with his hands outstretched,
as if he were a blind man, Kuzma approached the
ditch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>But the snore was that of a person dead drunk,
powerful and choking. Everything else round about
was wrapped in profound slumber. The lightning
flashes had ceased; the trees, invisible in the darkness,
rustled dully and gloomily under the increasing downpour.
And when, at last, Kuzma had found his way
to the bath-house by the sense of feeling alone, the
rain was pouring down upon the earth with such force
that he began to be assailed, as he had been in his
childhood, by terrible thoughts about the Flood. He
struck a match, and beheld a broad sleeping-ledge
near the tiny window. Rolling up his overcoat, he
threw it on the head end. In the darkness he crawled
upon the ledge and with a deep sigh stretched himself
out on it; he lay, after the fashion of old people, on
his back, and shut his weary eyes. Great God, what
a stupid and toilsome journey! And how had he
chanced to come hither? In the manor-house also
darkness now reigned, and the flashes of lightning
were fleetingly, stealthily reflected in the mirrors. In
the hut, beneath the heavy downpour of the rain,
Akim was sleeping. Here in this bath-house devils
had frequently been seen, as a matter of course: did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Akim possess a proper faith in devils? No. People
had so believed a thousand years ago, and Akim had
merely accepted his heritage mechanically. But, even
though he did not believe, he could nevertheless narrate
how, once on a time, his deceased grandfather
had gone to the grain crib for some bran and had
found the devil, as shaggy as a dog, sitting, his legs
twisted into a knot, on one of the girders.</p>

<p>Crooking one knee, Kuzma laid his wrist on his
forehead and began to doze, sighing and grieving the
while.</p>




<h3>XI</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">HE had passed the summer waiting for a place.
That night, in the orchard at Kazakovo, it
became clear to him that his dreams of orchards
were foolish. On his return to the town, after
carefully thinking over his situation he began to hunt
for a position as a shop or counting-house clerk;
then he began to reconcile himself to anything that
offered, provided only that it furnished him a morsel
of bread. But his searches, efforts, and entreaties
were vain. Despair seized upon him. How was it
he had failed to see that he had nothing to hope
for? In the town he had long borne the reputation
of being a very eccentric person. Drunkenness and
lack of employment had converted him into a laughing-stock.
In the beginning his manner of life had
amazed the town; later on, it had come to seem suspicious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
And, of a truth, who had ever heard of such
a thing as a petty burgher at his age living in a
lodging-house, being unmarried and poor as an organ-grinder?
All his property consisted of a chest and a
ponderous old umbrella! Kuzma began to look at
himself in the mirror: really, now, what sort of man
was the one he beheld before him? He slept in the
&#8220;common room,&#8221; among strangers, chance people who
came and went; in the morning he crawled in the heat
about the bazaar and to the eating-houses, where he
picked up rumours concerning jobs; after dinner, he
took a nap, then seated himself at the window and
read Kostomaroff&#8217;s History, gazed at the dusty, glaring
white street and at the sky, pale blue with sultriness.
For whom and for what was he living in the
world&mdash;that petty burgher, broad of bone though lean,
and already grey-haired from hunger and austere
thinking; who called himself an anarchist and was not
able to explain intelligently what an anarchist is? He
sat and read; he sighed and paced to and fro in the
room; he squatted down on his heels and unlocked his
small chest; he arranged in more orderly fashion his
tattered little books and manuscripts, two or three faded
shirts, an old long-skirted great-coat, a waistcoat, the
much worn certificates of his birth and his baptism.
And he dropped his hands forlornly. What meaning
was there to all this? Such poverty, such loneliness!
And he shuddered at the thought of what lay
ahead of him. Tikhon was childless, and rich&mdash;but
Tikhon wouldn&#8217;t give so much as a copper coin to
bury him....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>The summer stretched out in endless length. The
Duma was dissolved, but that did not break the monotony
of the long, hot days. A vast revolt in the
country districts was expected, but no one so much as
lifted an eyebrow so long as absolutely nothing of
any magnitude took place. Fresh and savage attacks
on the Jews were contrived; day after day executions
and shootings took place; but the town ceased to
take the slightest interest in them. In the country, at
the manor-houses, terror reigned&mdash;especially after that
famous day when the peasants rose in rebellion at
the &#8220;order&#8221; of some one or other. But what cared
the town for the country districts? Kazakoff sent
an extra company of kazaks. The local newspaper
was closed down three times, and at last they made an
end of the whole business by prohibiting the sale of
the newspapers from the capitals. Once more poster
advertisements began to bear the inscription: &#8220;By
permission of the Authorities, temporarily in this
Town,&#8221; and the posters themselves again became
abominable. Little Russians arrived, attracted by the
presentation of &#8220;the famous historical drama &#8216;Taras
Bulba, the murderer of his own son,&#8217;&#8221; and by the announcement
that &#8220;the entire company will take part&#8221;
in the national dance, the Hopak, &#8220;in sumptuous costumes,&#8221;
and that there would be &#8220;free presents&#8221;&mdash;a
milch cow and a tea set &#8220;worth seventy-five rubles.&#8221;
Swift runners and fortune-tellers reappeared, as well
as certain knaves who exhibited human monstrosities&mdash;twins,
a bearded lady, a young girl who weighed
five hundred and seventy-six pounds, &#8220;the marvel of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the XX century&mdash;a live freak captured in the Red
Sea,&#8221; which lay dead in a zinc bathtub behind a cotton
print curtain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cursed be the day I was born into this thrice-accursed
country!&#8221; Kuzma said at times, as he
hurled his newspaper on to the table, closed his eyes,
and gritted his teeth. &#8220;People ought now to be shouting
so that it could be heard throughout the whole
world: &#8216;To arms, ye who believe in God.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll go on shouting until you make yourself
heard,&#8221; some one quietly answered him.</p>

<p>Then he turned the conversation to the crops, the
drought. And Kuzma relapsed into silence: the events
which were taking place were so atrocious that the
human mind was unable to grasp them.</p>

<p>Rain fell now and then in the countryside, but
in town, day after day from May until August, an
infernal drought held uninterrupted sway. The
lodging-house, a corner building, baked in the sun.
At night one&#8217;s blood hammered in one&#8217;s head from
the stifling heat, and every noise which came through
the open windows wakened one with a start. It was
impossible to sleep in the hayloft because of the
fleas, the crowing of the young cocks, and the odour
of the manure-yard. Moreover, smoking was prohibited
there: the landlord was fat, weak, and nervous
as an old woman. All summer long Kuzma
never abandoned the hope of getting to Voronezh.
Akh, how little he had prized the days of his youth!
If now he might only saunter between trains through
the streets of Voronezh, gaze at the familiar poplar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
trees, at the tiny blue house outside the town&mdash;! But
what was the use? Should he spend ten or fifteen
rubles, and then have to deny himself a candle or
a roll of white bread? More than that, it was shameful
for an old man to surrender himself to memories
of love. And how about Klasha? Was she really
his daughter? He had seen her a couple of years
ago: she was sitting at the window, weaving lace; she
had a charming, modest face, but resembled only her
mother. What could he say to her, even if he should
make up his mind to go? How could he look old
Ivan Semyonitch in the face?</p>

<p>Time flowed on in intolerable boredom. There
were not even any visitors at the inn. During the
whole of July the only person who put up there was
a youthful deacon, rather a queer fellow, after the
pattern of seminary queer sticks. A relative of his
came to see him, but the visit ended in nothing: the
deacon was absent in the bazaar, and his name,
Krasnobaeff, was written up on the board after the
Latin fashion: Benedictoff.</p>

<p>As autumn drew near, Kuzma persuaded himself
that it was indispensable for him to make a pilgrimage
to the holy places, to some monastery, or&mdash;to give
up the struggle for good and all and take to drinking
again in order to spite some one or other. One
day, having unlocked his chest, he found Tolstoy&#8217;s
&#8220;Confession,&#8221; opened it, and read the pencilled inscription
which he had written while in a state of intoxication,
during his services with Kasatkin: &#8220;It is impossible
to wean all men from vodka.&#8221; A couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of months earlier he would merely have contracted
his brows in a frown&mdash;what a stupid inscription!&mdash;but
now he grinned and said to himself: &#8220;Why not
consign everything to the devil&#8217;s mother, burn everything
to the last thread, and draw a razor across my
throat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Autumn set in. In the bazaar there was a fragrance
of apples and plums. The schoolboys were
brought back to the gymnasium from their vacation
in the country. The horse races began. The sun began
to set behind Chips Square. If one emerged from
the gate in the evening and crossed the intersection
of the streets, one was blinded: to the left the whole
street, ending at the square in the distance, was
flooded with a low, mournful light. The gardens, behind
their fences, were full of dust and spiders&#8217; webs.
Polozoff came to meet one, wearing a coat with sleeve-flaps,
but he had already exchanged his hat for a
peaked cap with military insignia. There was not a
soul in the town park. The band-stand for the musicians
was boarded up; so was the kiosk where, in
summer, kumys and lemonade were sold; the wooden
refreshment counter was closed. And one day, as
he sat near the band-stand, Kuzma was so overwhelmed
with depression that he seriously meditated committing
suicide. The sun had set; its light was reddish; thin,
rose-hued foliage was drifting along the alley; a cold
wind was blowing. The cathedral bells were ringing
the summons to the All-Night Vigil Service, and one&#8217;s
soul ached unbearably at this closely set, methodical
peal, executed in countrified Saturday fashion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>All at once, from under the band-stand, a cough
became audible, and a clearing of the throat.
&#8220;Motka,&#8221; Kuzma said to himself. And sure enough,
from under the stairs crawled Duck-Headed Matty.
He wore rusty soldier&#8217;s boots, an extremely long uniform
from the shoulders of a second-school boy, besprinkled
with flour&mdash;evidently the bazaar had been
making merry&mdash;and a straw hat which had once been
run over by wheels. With his eyes still closed, spitting
and staggering with intoxication, he stalked past,
without so much as asking for a smoke. Kuzma, repressing
his tears, shouted to him: &#8220;Mot! Come,
let&#8217;s have a chat, and a smoke&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And Motka turned, seated himself on the bench,
began drowsily, with twitching brows, to roll himself
a cigarette. But apparently he had only a dim idea
as to the identity of the person who was sitting by
his side&mdash;who it was that was complaining to him
about his fate....</p>

<p>On the following day that same Motka brought
Tikhon&#8217;s note to Kuzma. And, once more, the noose
which had come near strangling Kuzma broke.</p>

<p>At the end of September he went to Durnovka.</p>

<h3>I</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE estate at Durnovka was arranged after the
plan of a farm. In fact, it had originally
borne precisely that title. Durnovo had owned
several estates and had occupied the chief of them,
the one at Zusha. Afanasiy Ilitch, who had hunted
the Gipsy with dogs, came only occasionally to Durnovka,
on his way from a hunting expedition. Nil
Afansaievitch, the Marshal of the Nobility, had no
taste for farms: he had spent his whole life in organizing
dinners, drinking sherry at his club, glorying in
his fat, his appetite, his ringing whisper&mdash;he had a
silver throat&mdash;in his lavishness, his witticisms, and
his absence of mind. And his son, also, the Uhlan,
who bore the name of his grandfather, rarely looked
in at Durnovka. The Uhlan still considered himself
a great landed proprietor. On retiring from the service
he decided to accumulate millions, to show how
an estate ought to be managed. But the Uhlan was
not fond of being in the fields, and his passion for
making purchases helped to ruin him: he bought almost
everything his eye fell upon. His trips to Moscow
and his amorous constitution likewise contributed
to his ruin. His son, who did not finish at the
Lyceum, received as his heritage only two farms&mdash;Laukhino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and Durnovka. And the Lyceum student
ruined these to such a point that, during the last
year he spent at Durnovka, the duties of watchman
were discharged by an old scullery-maid, who went
about at night with her mallet, garbed in a rusty raccoon
cloak. &#8220;Well, never mind,&#8221; Kuzma said to himself,
rejoiced to the verge of tears by Tikhon&#8217;s proposal,
and profoundly concealing his joy. &#8220;If &#8217;tis a
farm, call it a farm! A good thing, too: &#8217;tis a regular
end-of-nowhere, savage as in the Tatar times!&#8221;</p>

<p>At one period Ilya Mironoff had lived in Durnovka
for a couple of years. At the time Kuzma had been
a mere child, and all he retained of it in his memory
was, first, the fragrant hemp-fields, which drowned
Durnovka, as it were, in a dark-green sea, and, secondly,
one dark summer night. There had been not a
single light in the village on that night. Past their
cottage had filed, their chemises gleaming white in the
darkness, &#8220;nine maidens, nine women, and the tenth a
widow,&#8221; all barefoot, with hair flowing free, armed
with brooms, oaken cudgels, and pitchforks. A deafening
ringing of bells had arisen, and a thumping of
oven-covers and frying pans, high above which soared
a wild choral chant. The widow dragged a plough;
alongside her walked a maiden carrying a large holy
picture; while the rest rang bells, and thumped, and
when the widow led off in a low tone,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;Thou cow-death,</div>
<div class="verse">Enter not our village!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>the chorus repeated in long-drawn tones, with funereal
intonations:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;We plough&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>and mournfully, in throaty tones, took up the refrain,</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;With incense, with the cross ...&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the aspect of the Durnovka fields was commonplace.
The hemp plantations had vanished, and, even
if they had not, the fields would have been bare in
autumn, as well as the vegetable patches and the back
yards. Kuzma set forth from Vorgol in a cheerful
and slightly intoxicated state. Tikhon Ilitch had
treated him to liqueur cordial at dinner, and at tea,
after dinner, Nastasya Petrovna had treated him to
two kinds of preserves. Tikhon Ilitch was very kindly
disposed on that day. He recalled his youth, his childhood;
how they had eaten buckwheat cakes together,
how they had shouted &#8220;Tallyho!&#8221; after the Dog&#8217;s
Pistol, and had studied with Byelkin; he called
his wife &#8220;auntie&#8221; and ridiculed her trips to the nun
Polukarpia for the good of her soul; he said, with
regard to Kuzma&#8217;s salary: &#8220;We&#8217;ll square that, dear
brother, we&#8217;ll make that right&mdash;I&#8217;ll not wrong you!&#8221;
He referred briefly to the revolution: &#8220;That little
bird started singing too early&mdash;look out, or the cat will
eat it!&#8221; Kuzma rode a dark brown gelding, and
around him lay outspread a sea of dark brown ploughed
fields. The sun, almost like that of summer, the transparent
air, the clear pale-blue sky, all gladdened him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and gave promise of prolonged repose. The grey,
crooked wormwood, turned up roots and all by the
plough, was so plentiful that it was being carried off
by the carload. Close to the farm itself, in the
ploughed field, stood a wretched little nag, with burdocks
in his forelock, and a springless cart, piled high
with wormwood; and beside it lay Yakoff, bare-legged,
in dusty breeches and a long hempen shirt, his side
squeezed against a large grey dog which he was holding
by the ear. The dog was growling and darting angry
sidelong glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he bite?&#8221; shouted Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s savage&mdash;there&#8217;s no taming him!&#8221; Yakoff
made haste to reply, as he raised his slanting beard.
&#8220;He jumps at the horses&#8217; muzzles.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Kuzma burst out laughing with pleasure. The
peasant was a regular peasant&mdash;and the steppe was a
genuine steppe!</p>

<p>The road ran down a hill, and the horizon became
narrower. In front the new iron roof of a grain-kiln
gleamed green, seeming drowned in the dense low
growths of the park. Beyond the park, on the opposite
slope, stood a long row of cottages constructed of bricks
moulded from clay, and roofed with straw. On the
right, beyond the ploughed fields, stretched a large
ravine, merging into the one which separated the farm
from the village. At the point where the ravines came
together, a pond lay sparkling in the sunlight. On the
promontory between them the wings of two unsheathed
windmills reared themselves aloft, surrounded by
several cottages belonging to one-homestead owners&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Mysoffs,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> as Oska had dubbed them&mdash;and the
whitewashed schoolhouse gleamed white on the pasture
land.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and do the children get schooling?&#8221; inquired
Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis obligatory,&#8221; said Oska. &#8220;They have a scholar
who is a terror!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What scholar are you talking about? Do you
mean a teacher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, teacher, it&#8217;s all the same. The way
he has educated those brats&mdash;I tell you, &#8217;tis fine. He&#8217;s
a soldier. He beats them unmercifully, but on the
other hand he has them well trained in all sorts of
ways. Tikhon Ilitch and I happened to drop in one
day&mdash;and if they didn&#8217;t all leap to their feet and bark
out: &#8216;We wish you health!&#8217; just as well as if they
were soldiers!&#8221;</p>

<p>And once more Kuzma broke into a laugh.</p>

<p>But when he had passed the threshing-floor, had
descended by the defective road past the cherry orchard
and turned to the left, to the long farmyard,
lying well dried and golden-hued in the sun, his
heart actually began to beat violently. Here he was,
at home, at last. And as he mounted the porch and
stepped across the threshold, Kuzma gave vent to a
sigh, and, making the sign of the cross on brow and
breast, he bowed low before the dark holy picture
in the corner of the ante-room....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>And for a long time he cared not whether the Russian
people had a future or not. He roamed about
the manor estate, the village; he sat for hours at a
time on the doorsteps of the cottages, on the threshing-floors&mdash;watching
the inhabitants of Durnovka, enjoying
the possibility of breathing pure air, of chatting
with his new neighbours.</p>




<h3>II</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">OPPOSITE the house, with their rear to Durnovka,
to the wide ravine, stood the storehouses.
From the porch, half of the village was visible,
and beyond the storehouses the pond and a part of
the promontory&mdash;one windmill and the schoolhouse.
The sun rose to the left, beyond the fields, beyond the
railway line on the horizon. In the morning the pond
glittered with a bright, fresh exhalation, and from the
park behind the house was wafted an odour of foliage
from evergreens and leaf trees, steppe grass, apples, and
dew. The rooms were small and empty. In the study,
papered with old music sheets, rye was stored; in
the hall and the drawing-room no furniture was left
save a few Viennese chairs with broken seats and a
large extension table. The windows of the drawing-room
overlooked the park, and during almost the entire
autumn Kuzma passed the night in it, on a broken-down
couch, without closing the windows. The floor
was never swept: the widow Odnodvorka lived there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
temporarily, in the capacity of cook; she had been
the mistress of young Durnovo, and was obliged to
run after her small children and prepare food, after
a fashion, for herself, Kuzma, and the labourer.
Kuzma himself prepared the samovar in the morning,
after which he sat at the window in the hall and
drank tea and ate apples.</p>

<p>Through the early glitter, beyond the brilliant mist
over the ploughed fields, the railway train dashed past
in the morning; and, above, rose-coloured wreaths
floated behind it. Dense smoke hung over the roofs
of the village. The garden was freshly fragrant; silvery
hoar-frost lay upon the storehouses. At noon
the sun stood over the village; it was hot out of
doors; in the park the maples and lindens grew thin,
quietly dropping their leaves; the vast spaces and
the transparent dry air of the fields were filled with
silence and with peace. The doves, warmed up by
the sun, dozed all day long on the sloping roof of the
kitchen, whose new straw roof gleamed yellow against
the clear blue sky. The labourer rested after his
dinner. Odnodvorka went off to her own home.</p>

<p>But Kuzma roamed about. He went to the
threshing-floor, rejoicing in the sun, the firm road,
the withered steppe grass, the beet-tops which had
turned dark brown, the charming late flower of the
blue chicory, and the down of the cotton thistle floating
quietly through the air. The ploughed spaces in
the fields gleamed in the sunlight with the silken
threads of barely visible spiders&#8217; webs, which extended
to an immense distance. In the vegetable garden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
goldfinches perched on the dry stalks of the burdocks.
Upon the threshing-floor, amid the profound stillness
in the sultry heat, grasshoppers diligently emitted
their hoarse cry.</p>

<p>From the threshing-floor Kuzma climbed across the
earthen well and returned to the manor-house through
the orchard and the fir plantation. In the orchard he
chatted with the petty burghers, the lessees of the orchard,
with the Bride and the Goat, who were gathering
up the windfalls, and forced his way, in their
company, into the nettle patch where lay the ripest
fruit of all. Sometimes he wandered to the village,
to the schoolhouse. He became freshened up, sunburned;
he felt himself almost happy.</p>

<p>The Goat amazed him by her health, her cheery
stupidity, her senselessly brilliant Egyptian eyes.
The Bride was handsome and strange. With him, as
with Tikhon, she remained silent; not a word was to
be got out of her. But when one went away she gave
vent to a harsh laugh, indulged in bawling conversations
with the petty burghers, and would suddenly
strike up:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;Let them thrash me, curse me&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">My pretty eyes will twinkle more ...&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The soldier-teacher, born stupid, had lost in the
service what small wits he had ever possessed. In appearance
he was the most commonplace sort of peasant,
about forty years of age. But he always spoke
in such an extraordinary manner, and uttered such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
nonsense, that all one could do was to throw up one&#8217;s
hands in despair. He was for ever smiling with the
greatest appearance of slyness at something or other;
he looked down upon his interlocutor condescendingly,
with his eyes screwed up, and never replied to any
question immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;How am I to address you?&#8221; Kuzma asked him the
first time he visited the school.</p>

<p>The soldier blinked and considered the matter.
&#8220;The sheep without a name might be a ram,&#8221; he said
at last, at his leisure. &#8220;But I will ask you something
also. Is Adam a name, or is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. And about how many people, for example,
have died since then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Kuzma. &#8220;Why do you inquire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply because that&#8217;s one of the things we never
were born to understand. Now, take any busybody
you like. Do you indulge in revolt? Do it, my dear
man: perhaps you will become a <i>fit</i>-marshal! Only,
at best, that they may stretch you out without your
breeches for a flogging. Are you a peasant? Till
the soil. Are you a cooper? In that case, equally,
attend to your business. I, for example, am a soldier
and a veterinary. Not long ago I was passing
through the Fair, and what should I see but a horse
with the glanders? I went at once to the policeman:
&#8216;Thus and so,&#8217; says I, &#8216;Your High Well-born.&#8217; &#8216;But
can you kill that horse with a feather?&#8217; &#8216;With the
greatest pleasure!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>&#8220;With what sort of a feather?&#8221; inquired Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, a goose feather. I took it, sharpened it,
jabbed it into his spinal cord, blew a little&mdash;into the
feather, I mean&mdash;and the thing was done. &#8217;Tis a
simple matter, to all appearance, but just try to do it!&#8221;
And the soldier winked craftily and tapped his brow
with his finger: &#8220;Understanding is needed here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma shrugged his shoulders and made no reply.
And as he passed Odnodvorka&#8217;s cottage he found out
from her boy Senka what the soldier&#8217;s name was. It
turned out to be Parmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s your task for to-morrow?&#8221; added
Kuzma, gazing with curiosity at Senka&#8217;s fiery red
mop of hair, his lively green eyes, his pock-marked
face, his rickety little body, and his hands and feet
all cracked with mud and chaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tasks are verses,&#8221; said Senka, grasping his uplifted
foot in his right hand and hopping up and down
on one spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of tasks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Counting the geese. A flock of geese has flown
past&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I know,&#8221; said Kuzma. &#8220;And what else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Also mice&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are to be counted too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Six mice were walking along carrying six
copper coins,&#8221; mumbled Senka rapidly, casting a sidelong
glance at Kuzma&#8217;s silver watch chain. &#8220;One
mouse, which was bigger, carried two coins. How
many does that make in all&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid. And what are the verses?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>Senka released his foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;The verses are &#8216;Who is he?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you learned them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, say them.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Senka muttered still more rapidly about a
horseman who was riding above the Neva through the
forests, where there were only&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;&#8216;Firs, pine-trees, and green moss....&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grey,&#8221; said Kuzma, &#8220;not green.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, grey,&#8221; assented Senka.</p>

<p>&#8220;And who was that horseman?&#8221;</p>

<p>Senka considered the matter. &#8220;Why, a sorcerer,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. Now, tell your mother that she ought to
cut your hair, on your temples at least. &#8217;Tis all the
worse for you as it is, when the teacher pulls it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;ll find my ears,&#8221; said Senka unconcernedly,
again grasping his foot, and off he hopped on the
pasture common.</p>




<h3>III</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE promontory and Durnovka lived in a state
of perpetual enmity and mutual disdain, as adjoining
villages always do. The promontory
dwellers regarded the Durnovka folk in the light of
bandits and beggars, while the Durnovka people returned
the compliment precisely and in full measure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Durnovka was &#8220;gentry property,&#8221; while on the promontory
dwelt &#8220;boors,&#8221; one-farm petty owners&mdash;more
properly speaking, the remains of the one-farm people
who had emigrated to the Tomsk Government. Odnodvorka
was the only person who was not included
in this enmity, these quarrels. Small, thin, dependable,
she was lively, even-tempered, and agreeable in
intercourse; and she was observant. She knew every
family on the promontory and in Durnovka as well
as if it were her own; she was the first to inform
the manor-house of every smallest happening in the
life of the village. And every one was also thoroughly
well acquainted with her life.</p>

<p>She never concealed anything from anybody; she
talked calmly and simply about her husband and
Durnovo and stated that she had become a procuress
when he went away. &#8220;What could I do?&#8221; she said,
with a faint sigh. &#8220;I was dreadfully poor; I had
not enough bread even after the new harvest. My
good husband loved me, to speak the plain truth, but
one has to submit, you know. The master gave three
whole carloads of rye for me. &#8216;What can I do?&#8217;
I said to my husband. &#8217;Twas plain, I must go, he
said. He went for the rye, dragged home measure
after measure, and his tears drip-dripped, drip-dripped
all the while.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, after a moment&#8217;s thought, she added:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and later on, when the master went away,
and my husband went to Rostoff, I began to bring
people together, as chance occurred. You&#8217;re immoral
dogs, the Lord forgive you!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>By day she toiled, never pausing for a moment; by
night she mended, sewed, stole snow-screens from the
railway. Once late at night, when Kuzma was driving
to Tikhon Ilitch, he ascended a hillock and halted
paralyzed with fright: across the ploughed land, half
deluged in darkness, on a faintly smouldering strip of
the sunset, something black, huge, sprang up and
bore down smoothly on Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; he shouted feebly, tugging at his
reins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oï!&#8221; feebly and in affright shouted that which had
so swiftly and smoothly sprung up against the sky;
and it disappeared with a crash.</p>

<p>Kuzma recovered himself&mdash;and instantly recognized,
in the darkness, Odnodvorka. She had been running
toward him on her light, unshod feet, all bent together
with the weight of two screens a fathom long&mdash;the
sort that are set up, in winter, along the railway
line, to protect it from snowdrifts. And, having rearranged
herself, she whispered, with a quiet laugh:</p>

<p>&#8220;You frightened me to death. When one runs off
somewhere of a night, one is all a-tremble, but what
can one do? The whole village uses these for firewood,
and that&#8217;s the only way we save ourselves
from freezing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farm-hand Koshel, on the other hand, was a
man not devoid of interest. There was nothing one
could talk about with him, and he was not loquacious
by nature. Like the majority of the Durnovka people,
he merely repeated antiquated, insignificant apophthegms,
reasserted that which had been known for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
many a long year. If the weather turned bad he cast
an eye at the sky: &#8220;The weather&#8217;s spoiling. Rain
is what the growing green things most need at the
present moment.&#8221; The fields were ploughed a second
time, and he remarked: &#8220;If you won&#8217;t give a second
ploughing you&#8217;ll be left without bread. That&#8217;s what
the old people have always said.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been a soldier in his day&mdash;had been in the
Caucasus&mdash;but the military life had left no traces on
him. He was unable to pronounce the word &#8220;post-office&#8221;
properly: he called it &#8220;spost-office.&#8221; He could
tell absolutely nothing whatsoever about the Caucasus,
with the exception of the facts that mountain followed
mountain there, and that terribly hot and strange
waters spurted out of the ground. If you placed a
piece of mutton in them, it was boiled in one minute,
and if you didn&#8217;t take it out at the proper time, it
got raw again. And he was not in the least proud of
the fact that he had seen the world; he even bore
himself with scorn toward people who knew the world.
It is well understood that people only &#8220;rove about&#8221;
because they are forced to do so, or through poverty.
He never believed a single rumour&mdash;&#8220;all lies!&#8221;&mdash;but
he did believe, and swore to it as a fact, that not
long ago a witch had rolled in the form of a wheel
through the twilight shades near Basovka, and that
one peasant, who was no fool, had taken and caught
hold of that wheel and thrust his belt through the
hub and tied it fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and what happened next?&#8221; asked Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; replied Koshel. &#8220;That witch waked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
early in the morning, and, lo and behold, that belt
was sticking out her mouth and behind, and was
tied fast over her stomach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t she untie it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Evidently, the knot had had the sign of the cross
made over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And aren&#8217;t you ashamed to believe such nonsense?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is there for me to be ashamed of? People
lie, and I let them talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Kuzma only liked to hear the man&#8217;s songs. As
he sat in the darkness at the open window, without
a light anywhere, with the village barely discernible
like a black spot on the other side of the ravine, it
was so quiet round about that the apples could be
heard falling from the wild apple trees beyond the
corner of the house. And Koshel walked slowly
about the farmyard with his mallet, and with a serene
melancholy hummed to himself in his falsetto voice:
&#8220;Cease your song, canary, little bird.&#8221; He kept watch
over the manor until morning and slept by day. He
had hardly anything to do: Tikhon Ilitch had made
haste to settle up Durnovka affairs betimes that year,
and out of all the cattle only one horse and a cow
remained. So things were quiet, even rather boresome,
at the manor-house. The clear days were followed
by colder days, bluish-grey, soundless. The
goldfinches and tomtits began to whistle in the bare
park, the cross-bills to pipe in the fir trees, the cedar-birds
made their appearance, bullfinches, and some sort
of leisurely tiny birds which hopped in flocks from
place to place on the threshing-floor, whose supports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
were already sprouting with bright green new growths;
sometimes a very silent, light little bird of that sort
perched all alone on a spear of grass in the field. In
the vegetable gardens behind Durnovka, the last potatoes
were being dug among the sheaves. And at
times, as evening drew on, some one of the peasants
would stand there for a long space, absorbed in
thought and gazing at the fields, as he bore on his
back a plaited basket filled with ears of grain. Darkness
began to fall early, and at the manor-house they
said: &#8220;How late the train passes by nowadays!&#8221; although
there had been no change in the schedule of the
trains. Kuzma sat near the window and read newspapers
all day long; he had written down his spring
trip to Kazakovo and his conversations with Akim;
he had jotted down remarks in an old account book&mdash;all
he had seen and heard in the village. What
occupied his attention most of all was Syery, the
Grey Man.</p>




<h3>IV</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE village was deserted. Many had gone
away to work on the clover. Trifon had died
in mid-August, at Assumption-tide&mdash;he had
choked himself, as he broke the fast, on a bit of raw
ham. At the beginning of September Komar, one of
the chief rioters, renowned for his strength, his cleverness,
and his daring in his dealings with the members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the gentry class, had entered a distillery near Eletz,
fallen into the malt-kiln while in a state of intoxication,
and been suffocated. No one had known that
he was there, and the door had been bolted. Komar
had bent the door in his efforts to escape into the air,
but evidently such a death had been written in his
fate. Another rebel, Vanka Krasny, had again betaken
himself to the Donetz mines. The harness-maker
was working about on different estates. Rodka
was working on the railway. Deniska had disappeared
somewhere. And everybody hypocritically
pitied Syery, taking advantage of the opportunity to
ridicule both son and father. Yakoff&#8217;s hands trembled
when he began to talk about Syery. And what could
they do but tremble? What had that Syery done
with the land which Yakoff was ready to &#8220;devour
in handfuls&#8221;? No one in all Durnovka suffered the
hundredth part of what Yakoff suffered when rumours
became current about rebellions, cases of arson, and
the expropriation of land. He merely held his peace&mdash;thanks
to that subterranean secretiveness which
thousands of his forebears had sucked in with their
mothers&#8217; milk. And, indeed, his breath would have
failed him had he tried to speak. Now, when the
rumours became more and more desperate, he even
became reconciled to his son Vaska, for the sake of
the land. His son was a pock-marked, rough, thickset
young fellow, all overgrown with a beard at the
age of twenty, broad-shouldered, curly-haired, and so
strong that even pincers could not have pulled out
a single one of his hairs. The son, with that beard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
his head closely clipped, garbed in a red shirt, resembled
a convict, but he dressed his wife in the style
of a petty citizen of the towns. He had turned out
the image of his father so far as greed was concerned,
and had already begun to trade secretly in vodka,
coarse tobacco, soap, and kerosene. And Yakoff became
reconciled, in the hope of satisfying his land-hunger
by the aid of his son&mdash;in the hope that he
might become rich and begin to lease it. Why did
Syery make peace with Deniska, who had repeatedly
given him &#8220;a healthy drubbing&#8221;? What was he
hoping for, that he thus altered his course, like the
poorest beggar? He had leased his land, he did not
live out on jobs. He sat at home cold and hungry and
had no thought for anything save how he might procure
the wherewithal for a smoke: he could not get
through the day without his pipe. He attended all
the village assemblies, but always arrived just as they
were coming to an end. He never missed a single
wedding or baptism or funeral, although he huddled
up against the door; and when he extended his hand
to the host, who was serving refreshments to his
guests, he not infrequently received nothing but rough
denunciations. Syery did not care greatly for liquor,
but no drinking to seal a bargain ever passed off without
his presence: he intruded himself not only into
all the community drinking-bouts, but also into all
those of his neighbours&mdash;after purchases, sales, and
exchanges. And his neighbours had grown so accustomed
to this that they were not even surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
when Syery presented himself. And he really was
entertaining to listen to.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is valiant, so far as words go,&#8221; people said of
Syery. And it was true: if he were at ease in his
mind&mdash;and he was at ease when his pouch was filled
with tobacco&mdash;what an active, serious peasant Syery
could appear to be!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, &#8217;tis time to marry off my son,&#8221; he
argued in leisurely fashion, as he held his pipe between
his teeth and ground the stalks of the coarse tobacco
by strong rubbing in his palms. &#8220;If he gets married,
he&#8217;ll bring every kopek home, he will become eager
for work, he&#8217;ll take to digging round about the house
as a beetle burrows in a dung-heap. And we&#8217;re not
afraid of work, brother! Only give us a chance!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Syery almost never had either peace of mind or
work. His appearance justified his nickname: he was
grey, lean, of medium stature, with sloping shoulders;
his short coat was extremely short, tattered, and
dirty; his felt boots were broken and their soles were
made of rope; as for his cap, it is not worth mentioning
at all. As he sat in his cottage, with this
cap eternally on his head, his pipe never removed
from his mouth, and anxiously meditated upon something
or other, he had the appearance of living in
imminent vague expectation. But, according to his
own statement, he had devilish bad luck. Nothing
worth while ever came his way. Well, and he didn&#8217;t
care about playing jackstraws&mdash;taking chances.
Every one was on the watch to condemn a man, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
course. &#8220;&#8217;Tis well known that the tongue can
break bones, though it has none itself,&#8221; Syery was
wont to remark. &#8220;Do you first place the job in my
hand, and then you can jabber.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had a fairly large amount of land&mdash;three desyatini.
But he was taxed for ten. And Syery no
longer put a hand to his land: &#8220;You simply have to
give it up, that land: dear heart, it ought to be kept
in proper order, but where&#8217;s the order here?&#8221; He
himself planted no more than half a field, and even
the grain in that he sold standing&mdash;he &#8220;got rid of the
unwelcome for the welcome.&#8221; And again he had a
reason ready: &#8220;Only wait to see what comes of it&mdash;just
you try it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis always better, for example, to await the upshot
of anything,&#8221; muttered Yakoff with a sidelong
glance and a malicious laugh.</p>

<p>But Syery laughed also, sadly and scornfully. &#8220;Yes,
&#8217;tis better!&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;It&#8217;s all well enough for you
to chatter nonsense: you&#8217;ve got a husband for your
girl, and married off your son. But just look at me
and the lot of small children who sit in the corner at
my house. They don&#8217;t belong to other folks, you see.
And I keep a goat for them, and I&#8217;m fattening a young
pig. They have to have food and drink, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, but a goat is nothing new, for example, in
such cases,&#8221; retorted Yakoff, getting angry. &#8220;The
trouble with you is, for example, that you think of
nothing but vodka and tobacco, tobacco and vodka.&#8221;
And, in order to avoid a senseless quarrel with his
neighbour, he hastened to get away from Syery.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>But Syery calmly and practically shouted after him:
&#8220;A drunkard will come to his senses, brother, but a
fool never will.&#8221;</p>

<p>After sharing his property with his brother, Syery
had wandered about for a long time, living in hired
lodgings, and had got jobs in the town and on divers
estates. He also went to work on the clover. And,
on that job, luck one day came his way. An organized
gang of workmen which Syery had joined engaged
themselves to get in a large crop at eighty kopeks a
pud,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but behold, the crop turned out twice as heavy
as had been calculated. They winnowed it, and Syery
was hired to run the machine. He drove some of the
grain out through the waste-spout and bought it. And
he grew rich: that same autumn he built a brick cottage.
But his calculations had been faulty: it turned
out that the cottage must be heated. And where was
the money to come from? that was the question. Why,
there was not even enough to provide food. So it
became necessary to burn the top of the cottage; and
there it stood, roofless, for a year, and turned completely
black. And the chimney went for the price
of a horse-collar. There were no horses as yet, it
is true; but, naturally, one must begin to fit oneself
out some time or other. And Syery let his arms fall
by his side in despair: he decided to sell the cottage,
to build a cheaper one of beaten clay. His argument
ran as follows: There must be in the cottage&mdash;well,
at the very least, ten thousand bricks; he could sell
them for five or even six rubles a thousand; the sum-total,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of course, would be about one hundred and
fifty rubles. But it turned out that there were only
three thousand five hundred bricks, and he was forced
to accept two rubles and a half for each girder, instead
of five rubles. And for a long time a bare
mound of rubbish occupied the site of the splendid
cottage, solidifying under the rain: there was no
money available for clearing it away, and one&#8217;s hands
simply refused to undertake the task. Yakoff harangued
on the subject: &#8220;Matters ought, for example,
to have been more cheaply managed from the start.&#8221;
&#8220;But, devil take it,&#8221; Syery said to himself, &#8220;a cheap
thing doesn&#8217;t last long, does it?&#8221; And, much troubled
in mind, he proceeded to look up a new cottage&mdash;and
spent a whole year in bargaining for precisely those
which were beyond his means. He had reconciled
himself to his present domicile merely in the firm
expectation of a future cottage which should be strong,
spacious, and warm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I simply don&#8217;t intend to live on here!&#8221; he snapped
one day.</p>

<p>Yakoff stared at him attentively and shook his cap.
&#8220;Exactly so. That means you are expecting your
ships to come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll come, all right,&#8221; replied Syery mysteriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oï, drop your nonsense,&#8221; said Yakoff. &#8220;Get yourself
a place somewhere&mdash;anywhere you can&mdash;and keep
your teeth, for example, in their proper place.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the thought of a fine farmstead, good order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
some suitable, real work, poisoned Syery&#8217;s entire life.
He got bored when working in a place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Evidently, working at home isn&#8217;t as sweet as
honey, either,&#8221; said his neighbours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind, it might be honey-sweet if the
house were managed sensibly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so. And will you take a place by the month,
or until the working season?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get one, never fear. Oversight is needed at
home, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But all you do is to sit in the house and smoke
your pipe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I to do, then? can&#8217;t I even smoke?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Syery, suddenly becoming animated, jerked the
cold pipe out of his mouth and began his favourite
story: how, while still a bachelor, he had lived two
full years honestly and nobly at the house of a priest
near Eletz. &#8220;Yes, and if I were to go there this minute,
they would fairly tear me to pieces with joy!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;I need say only one word: &#8216;I&#8217;ve come,
papa, to work for you&mdash;will you take me or not?&#8217;
&#8216;But why do you ask that, light of my life? Don&#8217;t I
know you? Yes, good Lord, live here with us for
ever and ever, if you will&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and you might go there, for example&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might go there! Look at them&mdash;all those brats
in the corner! We know all about that; &#8217;tis another
man&#8217;s grief, I&#8217;ll not meddle. But a man is being
wasted here, in vain.&#8221;</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<h3>V</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">SYERY was being wasted, in vain, this year
also. He had sat at home all winter long,
with care-worn countenance, without light,
cold and hungry. During the Great Fast (Lent), he
had managed somehow or other to get a place with
Rusanoff, near Tula: no one in his own neighbourhood
would any longer give him a place. But before the
month was out, Rusanoff&#8217;s establishment had become
more repulsive to him than a bitter radish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oï, young fellow!&#8221; the manager once remarked to
him. &#8220;I can see right through you: you are picking
a quarrel so that you can take to your heels. Here,
you dog, here&#8217;s your money in advance, and now be
off with you into the bushes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps some sort of vagabond might take himself
off, but not me,&#8221; retorted Syery sharply.</p>

<p>But the manager did not understand the hint. And
it became necessary to adopt more decisive means.
One day Syery was set to hauling in some husks for
the cattle. He went to the threshing-floor and began
to load a cart with straw. The manager came along:</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you, in good plain Russian, to load
up with husks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not the right time to load them,&#8221; replied Syery
firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sensible farmers give husks for dinner, not at
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how do you come to be a teacher?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to starve the cattle. That&#8217;s all there is
to my being a teacher.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you are hauling straw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One must know the proper time for everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop loading this very minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Syery turned pale. &#8220;No, I won&#8217;t stop my work. I
can&#8217;t stop my work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hand me over that fork, you dog, and get out, lest
worse happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no dog, but a baptized Christian man. When
I&#8217;ve driven in this load, I&#8217;ll get out. And I&#8217;ll go for
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, brother, that&#8217;s not likely! You&#8217;ll go away,
and pretty soon you&#8217;ll be back again&mdash;and get locked
up in the county jail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Syery leaped from the cart and hurled his pitchfork
into the straw: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be locked up, am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, young fellow, see that you don&#8217;t get locked
up yourself! As if we didn&#8217;t know something about
you! The master has nothing good to say about you,
either, brother&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The manager&#8217;s fat cheeks became suffused with dark
blood, his eyeballs protruded until they seemed all
whites. With the back of his wrist he thrust his peaked
cap over on the nape of his neck and, drawing a deep
breath, he rapidly ejaculated: &#8220;A&mdash;ah! So that&#8217;s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
way of it! Hasn&#8217;t a good word to say of me? Tell
me, if that&#8217;s the case&mdash;why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to say,&#8221; mumbled Syery, feeling his
legs instantaneously grow cold with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you have, brother: you&#8217;re talking nonsense&mdash;you&#8217;ll
tell!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and what became of the flour?&#8221; suddenly
shouted Syery.</p>

<p>&#8220;The flour? What flour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The stolen flour. From the mill.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manager seized Syery by the collar in a death-like
grip, fit to suffocate him, and for the space of a
moment the two stood stock still.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by it&mdash;grabbing a man like
that, by his shirt?&#8221; calmly inquired Syery. &#8220;Do you
want to choke me?&#8221; Then, all of a sudden, he began
to squeak furiously: &#8220;Come on, thrash me, thrash
while your heart is hot!&#8221; And with a jerk he wrenched
himself free and seized his pitchfork.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, men!&#8221; the manager yelled, although
there was no one anywhere in the vicinity. &#8220;Help the
manager! Hearken to this: he tried to stab me to
death, the dog!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come near me, or I&#8217;ll break your nose,&#8221; said
Syery, balancing his pitchfork. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget, times
are not what they used to be!&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this point the manager made a wide sweep
with his arm, and Syery flew headlong into the straw.</p>

<p>The melancholy which had once more begun to take
powerful effect on Kuzma along with the change in
weather, went on constantly increasing in force in proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
to his closer acquaintance with Dumovka, with
Syery. At first the latter was merely sad and ridiculous:
what a stupid man! Then he became irritating
and repulsive: a degenerate! All summer long he had
sat on the doorstep of his cottage smoking, waiting
for favours from the Duma. All the autumn he had
roamed from farmstead to farmstead, in the hope of
attaching himself to some one who was bound for the
clover work. On a hot, sunny day a new grain-rick
on the edge of the village took fire. Syery was the
first person to present himself at the conflagration,
where he shouted himself hoarse, singed his eyelashes
off, and got drenched to the skin directing the water-carriers
and the men who, pitchforks in hand, flung
themselves into the huge rosy-golden flame, dragging
out in all directions the blazing thatches, and those
who merely dashed about in the midst of the fire, the
crackling flames, the gushing water, the uproar, the
holy pictures, casks, and spinning-wheels heaped up
near the cottages, the sobbing women, and the showers
of blackened leaves scattered abroad from the burnt
bushes. But what did he do that was practical? In
October, when, after inundating rains and an icy storm,
the pond froze over and a neighbour&#8217;s boar-pig slipped
from an ice-clad mound, broke through the ice, and
began to drown, Syery was the first to arrive at full
speed, leap into the water, and save it. But why? In
order that he might be the hero of the day, that he
might have the right to rush from the pond into the
servants&#8217; hall, demand vodka, tobacco, and a bite to
eat. At first he was all purple; his teeth were chattering;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
he could barely move his white lips as he dressed
himself from head to foot in some one else&#8217;s clothes&mdash;Koshel&#8217;s.
Then he became animated, got intoxicated,
began to brag&mdash;and once more narrated how he had
served honestly, nobly, at a priest&#8217;s, and how cleverly
he had married off his daughter several years previously.
He sat at the table greedily devouring chunks
of raw ham and announcing in self-satisfied wise:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Matriushka, my girl, you see, had been
making up to that Yegor. Well, she made eyes at
him and made up to him. Nothing happened. One
evening I was sitting, so, near the window, when I saw
Yegor walk past the cottage once, then again&mdash;and
that daughter of mine keeps diving, diving toward the
window. That signifies, says I to myself, that they&#8217;ve
settled matters. And I said to my wife: &#8216;Do you go
give the cattle their fodder: I&#8217;m off, summoned to the
village assembly.&#8217; I set myself down on the straw behind
the cottage, and there I sat and waited. And
the first snow began to fall. And I saw Yegorka come
sneaking along again. And she was on hand too.
They went behind the cellar-house; then&mdash;they whisked
into the cottage, the new empty one alongside. I
waited a bit&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A nice story!&#8221; remarked Kuzma, with an embarrassed
laugh.</p>

<p>But Syery took that for praise, for enthusiasm over
his cleverness and craft. And, feeling himself a hero,
he went on, now raising his voice, now viciously lowering
it: &#8220;So there I sat and listened, and waited to
find out what would happen next. So, as I was saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
I waited a bit&mdash;then after them I went. I leaped
over the threshold&mdash;and straight at her, and seized
her! Weren&#8217;t they frightened, though&mdash;horribly! He
tumbled flat on the floor, as limp as a sack&mdash;helpless
enough for any one to cut his throat&mdash;while she went
off in a faint&mdash;lay there like a dead duck. &#8216;Well,&#8217;
says he, &#8216;now thrash me.&#8217; That was what he said.
&#8216;I don&#8217;t ne-ed to thrash you,&#8217; says I. I took his coat,
and I took his waistcoat, too&mdash;left him in his drawers
only&mdash;pretty nearly in the condition when his mother
gave him birth. &#8216;Now,&#8217; says I, &#8216;get out, go wherever
you please.&#8217; And I myself set out for my house. I
looked round&mdash;and he was behind me. The snow was
white, and he was white, and he was sniffling. He had
no place to go&mdash;whither could he run? But my
Matryona Mikolavna rushes off to the fields the minute
I am out of the cottage! She went at a lively pace&mdash;a
woman neighbour had difficulty in grabbing her by
the sleeve when she had got almost to Basovka, and
brought her to me. I let her rest a while, then I said:
&#8216;We are poor folks, ain&#8217;t we?&#8217; She said never a word.
&#8216;And your mother&mdash;is she a poor wretch, or is she a
decent woman?&#8217; No answer. &#8216;You&#8217;ve put us to shame.
Hey, haven&#8217;t you? What do you mean by it&mdash;are
you thinking you&#8217;ll fill my house with that sort, with
your bastards&mdash;and I&#8217;m to shut my eyes to what&#8217;s going
on? Seeing how poor we are, you ought to watch
what you&#8217;re about, and not make us a laughing-stock,
dragging your maiden braids all over the place&mdash;you
trash!&#8217; Then I began to tan her hide&mdash;I had a fine
suitable little whip on hand. Well, to say it simply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
I cut up her whole body to such a degree that she slid
down at my feet and kissed my felt boots, while he sat
up on the bench and yelled. Then I began on him,
the dear man&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did he marry her?&#8221; inquired Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say he did!&#8221; exclaimed Syery; and, conscious
that intoxication was getting the better of him,
he began to scrape up the fragments of ham from the
platter and stuff them into the pockets of his breeches.
&#8220;And what a wedding we made of it! As for the expense,
I don&#8217;t have to blink my eyes over that,
brother!&#8221;</p>




<h3>VI</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WELL, that was a fine tale!&#8221; Kuzma meditated
within himself, for a long time after
that evening. And the weather turned
bad, to boot. He did not feel like writing; his melancholy
increased in strength. The poverty and lack of
practical common sense on the part of Syery and Deniska
amazed him: the village was rotting! The beastly
tale of the Bride&#8217;s experience in the orchard, the death
of Rodka, stupefied him. The life of Tikhon Ilitch
astonished him. And it certainly took a good deal to
astonish him! Didn&#8217;t he know his country, his people?
With grief and anger he poured out his heart
to Tikhon Ilitch, exhorted him, stung him. But if
Tikhon Ilitch had only known with what joy Kuzma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
rushed to the window when he espied on the porch
his overcoat, his peaked cap, and his grey beard!
How afraid he was lest his brother would not spend
the night with him, how he tried to detain him as long
as possible, dragged him into discussions, reminiscences!
Kuzma found the situation tiresome late in
the autumn; ugh, how boresome! The sole joy he had
was when some one presented himself with a petition.
Gololoby from Baskova came several times&mdash;a peasant
with a perfectly bald head and a huge cap&mdash;to write
a complaint against his daughter&#8217;s father-in-law for
breaking his collar-bone. The widow Butylotchka
came from the promontory to have a letter written to
her son; and she was a mass of rags, wet through and
icy cold with the rain. She was tearful when she began
to dictate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Town of Serpukhoff, at the Nobility Bath-Zheltukhin
house&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here she burst out weeping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what next?&#8221; asked Kuzma, sorrowfully gazing
sidewise at Butylotchka, after the fashion of old
people, over his eyeglasses. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve written that.
What more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What more?&#8221; inquired Butylotchka in a whisper,
and, making an effort to control her voice, she went
on: &#8220;Write further, my dear, in your very best style:
To be given to Mikhail Nazarytch Khlusoff&mdash;into his
own hands, you understand&mdash;&#8221; Then she began&mdash;now
with pauses, now entirely without: &#8220;A letter to our
dear and beloved son, Misha, why have you forgotten
us, Misha, we haven&#8217;t had a word from you. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
know yourself that we are living in lodgings, and now
they are turning us out, and where are we to go now.
Our dear little son Misha, we beg you, for the Lord
God&#8217;s sake, that you will come home as fast as you
can&mdash;&#8221; And once more, through her tears, in a
whisper: &#8220;Then you and we will dig out an earthen
hut, and so we shall be in a home of our own....&#8221;</p>

<p>The storms and icy downpours of rain, the days that
seemed all twilight, the mud at the manor-farm, all besprinkled
with the fine yellow foliage of the acacias,
the boundless ploughed fields and fields of winter
grain round about Durnovka, and the dark clouds
which endlessly hung over them&mdash;all began once more
to oppress him with a fierce hatred for this accursed
country where there were eight months of snow-storms
and four of rain-storms; where for the commonest
needs of nature one was forced to go to the barn or
the cherry-shed. When the bad weather set in it became
necessary to board up the drawing-room closely
and move into the hall, so as to sleep all winter long
there, and dine, and smoke, and pass the long evenings
by the light of a dim kitchen lamp, pacing from corner
to corner, muffled up in overcoat and cap, which barely
protected one from the cold and the wind that blew
in through the crevices. Sometimes it happened that
they forgot to renew the supply of kerosene, and
Kuzma passed the twilight hours wholly without a
light; and at times, of an evening, he lighted a candle
end merely for the purpose of supping off potato soup
and warm wheat groats, which the Bride served in
silence and with a stern countenance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>&#8220;Whither can I go?&#8221; Kuzma said to himself, once
in a while.</p>

<p>There were only three neighbours in the immediate
vicinity: old Princess Shakova, who did not receive
even the Marshal of Nobility, because she regarded
him as ill-bred; the retired gendarme Zakrzhevsky, a
hæmorrhoidally vicious and self-conceitedly stupid man
who would not have permitted Kuzma to cross his
threshold; and, finally, a member of the gentry, Basoff,
a petty landed proprietor who lived in a peasant cottage,
had married the dissipated widow of a soldier,
and could talk of nothing but horse-collars and cattle.
Father Petr, the priest from Kolodeza, of which
Durnovka was a parish, called once upon Kuzma. But
neither the one nor the other cared to continue the
acquaintance. Kuzma entertained the priest with
nothing stronger than tea&mdash;and the priest laughed
harshly and awkwardly when he saw the samovar on
the table. &#8220;A samovar-man! Capital! You, I see,
are no match for your good brother&mdash;you&#8217;re not lavish
in your entertainment!&#8221; Kuzma announced frankly
that he never went to church, out of conviction. The
priest began to shout with laughter in more amazement
than ever, and still more harshly and loudly:
&#8220;A&mdash;ah! Those nice little new ideas! Capital! And
it&#8217;s cheaper, too!&#8221; Laughter was not in the least becoming
to him: it was as if some one else were laughing
for that tall, lean man with the big cheek-bones
and coarse black hair, the furtive greedy eyes&mdash;anxiously
absent-minded eyes, for ever meditating something
offensive and tactlessly free of manner. &#8220;But at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
night, surely, at night you cross yourself, nevertheless&mdash;you
get scared?&#8221; he said, loudly and hurriedly,
as he put on his coat and overshoes in the ante-room,
amazing Kuzma by his queries concerning the management
of the farm, and suddenly beginning to address
him as &#8220;thou.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I make the sign of the cross,&#8221; admitted Kuzma,
with a melancholy smile. &#8220;But, you know, fear is not
faith, and I don&#8217;t cross myself to your God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma did not go often to visit his brother. And
the latter came to him only when he was perturbed
over something. Altogether, the loneliness was so
desperate that at times Kuzma called himself Dreyfus
on Devil&#8217;s Island. He compared himself to Syery.
Ah, and he too, like Syery, was poor, weak of will,
forced out of his proper course, and all his life had
been waiting for some happy days, for work.</p>

<p>An unpleasant memory lingered of drunken Syery&#8217;s
bravery, his story, his boastfulness. But, ordinarily,
Syery was not like that, even when he was intoxicated:
he was merely loquacious, troubled by something, and
merry in a timid way. Moreover, he did not have an
opportunity to get drunk more than five times in the
course of a year. He was not eager for liquor&mdash;not at all
as he was for tobacco. For the sake of tobacco he was
ready to endure any and all humiliations; ready to
sit for hours by the side of a man who was smoking,
agree with everything he said, flatter him, do anything
in order that he might, after awaiting a favourable
moment, say as if quite accidentally: &#8220;Pray, gossip,
give me a filling for my pipe.&#8221; He was passionately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
fond, also, of cards, long conversations, evening reunions
in the cottages&mdash;in those cottages where there
were large families, where it was warm, and where a
light was burning; where itinerant wool-carders prepared
the wool, and roving tailors made winter coats.
But people were not, as yet, assembling thus in the
cottages, and Syery sat at home. After Kuzma had
been to see him a few times he felt that it was not
right to bear malice toward Syery or to make fun of
him. Syery lived on what was earned by day-labour
during the working season&mdash;by his wife, a peaceable,
silent, rather crack-brained woman&mdash;and on what he
managed to beg from Deniska (who now and then
made his appearance in Durnovka with his valise,
white bread, and sausage, of which he was inordinately
fond, cursing the Tsar and the gentry without the
slightest restraint). At the first snowfall Syery went
away somewhere and was gone for a week. He returned
home in a gloomy mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been at Rusanoff&#8217;s again?&#8221; the neighbours
inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have,&#8221; replied Syery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was urging me to hire with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so. You did not consent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More stupid than he I have never been and never
shall be, for ever and a day. You don&#8217;t suppose I
signed the contract with my own blood?&#8221;</p>

<p>And Syery sat there on the bench for a long time,
without removing his cap. And the mere sight of his
cottage in the twilight made one sad at heart. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
twilight, beyond the broad snow-covered ravine, Durnovka
lay in melancholy blackness, with its grain-ricks
and bushes in the back yards. But when darkness
fully descended, and the little lights began to
twinkle, it seemed as if all were peaceful and cosy in
the cottages. Syery&#8217;s hut alone remained disagreeably
black. It was dull, dead. Kuzma knew all about
it: if you entered its half-open ante-room, you felt almost
as if you were on the threshold of some wild
beast&#8217;s lair. There was an odour of snow; through the
holes in the roof the gloomy sky was visible; the wind
rustled the manure and the dry branches which had
been tossed at haphazard upon the rafters; if, by feeling
about, you found the slanting wall and opened door,
you would encounter cold, darkness, a frost-covered
little window barely discernible through the gloom.
No one was to be seen, but one could guess how things
were: the master of the house was sitting on the bench&mdash;his
pipe glowed with a tiny fire; the housewife was
quietly rocking a squeaking cradle in which a pale
child with the rickets, and drowsy with hunger, was
jolting about. The brood of small children had taken
refuge on top of the oven, which was barely warm,
and were vivaciously narrating something to one another
in a whisper. In the rotten straw beneath the
sleeping-board, the goat and the suckling pig, which
were great chums, were rustling about. It was necessary
to bend down terribly, in order to avoid knocking
one&#8217;s head on the ceiling. Then, too, you could
not turn about without taking precautions: the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
between the threshold and the opposite wall was not
more than five paces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; a low voice resounded from the
darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be Kuzma Ilitch, can it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis he himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Syery moves aside, makes room on the bench.
Kuzma sits down and lights his pipe. Oppressed by
the darkness, Syery is simple, sad, confesses to his weaknesses.
Now and then his voice quivers.</p>




<h3>VII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE long, snowy winter set in.</p>

<p>The plain, gleaming palely white beneath a
bluish lowering sky, appeared broader, more
spacious, and even more deserted than ever. The cottages,
sheds, bushes, grain-ricks stood out sharply
against the new-fallen snow. Then the blizzards began
and swept the country, burying it under so much
snow that the village assumed a bleak northern aspect
and began to show as its black points only the doors
and tiny windows, which hardly peeped out from beneath
white snow caps pulled well down, from amid
the white masses of the earthen banks around the
houses. Following the blizzards, across the concealed
grey surface of the frozen crust on the fields swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
cruel winds which tore away the last remaining light-brown
foliage from the unsheltered oak scrub in the
ravines. And then the one-farm owner, Taras Milyaeff,
who resembled a native Siberian and was as
keen on hunting as a real Siberian, set forth, plunging
deep into the impenetrable snowdrifts, all dotted
with the footprints of hares, and the water barrels were
converted into frozen blocks, and slippery ice-coated
hillocks formed around the water-holes; the roads
wound among snowdrifts&mdash;and the ordinary winter
conditions reigned. Epidemic diseases broke out in
the villages: smallpox, typhus, scarlet fever, croup.
But those maladies had existed uninterruptedly in the
countryside since time immemorial, during the winter
season, and people had become so used to them that
they made no more mention of them than they did of
changes in the weather. Around the holes cut in the
ice, at which all Durnovka drank, over the fetid dark
bottle-green water, the peasant women stood for days
at a time, bent low, with their petticoats tucked up
higher than their bare blue knees: they were in wet
bast-slippers, and their heads were hugely muffled.
Out of their iron kettles of ashes they dragged their
own grey hempen chemises, patched to the waist with
calico; their husbands&#8217; heavy breeches; their children&#8217;s
soiled swaddling-cloths&mdash;rinsed them out, beat
them with clothes-mallets, and screamed at one
another, imparting the information that their hands
were &#8220;numbed from the steam,&#8221; that at Makaroff&#8217;s
homestead his wife was dying of the typhus, that
Yakoff&#8217;s daughter-in-law had got her throat stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
up. The little girls capered out of the cottages,
straight from the stoves, with nothing on but their tiny
chemises, and round the corner on the mounds of
hardened snow. The little boys, dressed in their
fathers&#8217; old clothes, slid down the hills on their rude
sleds, flew head over heels, screeched, were racked with
terrible coughs, and returned home at evening in a
state of fever, with heavy, bewildered heads. They
were so chilled that they could barely move their lips
as they begged for a drink, and, after drinking, they
crept tearfully upon the oven. But even the mothers
paid no attention to those who were ill. And darkness
settled down at three o&#8217;clock, and the shaggy dogs
sat on the roofs, almost on a level with the snowdrifts.
Not a soul knew on what food those dogs existed.
Nevertheless they were lively, even ferocious.</p>

<p>People woke early in the manor-house. At daybreak
in the blue darkness, when the lights began to
twinkle from the cottages, they made the fires in the
stoves, and through the crevices under the eaves slowly
poured the thick milky smoke. In the wing, with its
frozen grey window, it became as cold as in the vestibule.
Kuzma was awakened by the banging of doors
and the rustling of frozen, snow-coated straw which
Koshel was dragging from the truck-sledge. His low,
hoarse voice became audible&mdash;the voice of a man who
had risen earlier than any one else, working on an
empty stomach, and chilled through. The pipe of the
samovar began to rattle, and the Bride conversed with
Koshel in a stern whisper. She did not sleep in the
servants&#8217; quarters, where the roaches bit arms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
legs until they drew blood, but in the ante-room&mdash;and
the whole village was convinced that there was a good
reason for this. The village knew well what the Bride
had undergone in the autumn: how she had been overwhelmed
with disgrace&mdash;Rodka&#8217;s death&mdash;how her
mother had gone away on a begging expedition, having
locked up the empty cottage. Silent, crushed by
the burden of her sorrow, the Bride was more severe
and mournful than a cloistered nun. But what cared
the village for other people&#8217;s woes? Kuzma had
already heard, from Odnodvorka, what was being
said in the village, and, as he woke, he always recalled
it with shame and disgust. He pounded on the wall
with his fist and, clearing his throat, began to smoke
a cigarette: this quieted his heart and relieved his
chest. He slept under his sheepskin coat, and, loath
to part with the warmth, he continued to smoke, and
said to himself: &#8220;A shameless people! Why, I have
a daughter almost as old as she is....&#8221; The fact that
a young woman slept on the other side of the partition
wall excited only paternal tenderness in him.
By day she was taciturn and serious, niggardly of
words, shy with the modesty of a young maiden. And
when she was asleep, there was even something childlike,
sad, and lonely about her. One day she fell
asleep after dinner on her chest in the ante-room, her
head wrapped in a hempen shawl, her legs drawn
up and one knee revealed. Her feet, in their bark
shoes, lay in womanly wise, and the chilled knee
gleamed white like that of a little girl. And Kuzma,
as he passed her, turned away and called to her, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
that she woke up and covered it. But would the
village believe that? Even Tikhon Ilitch did not believe
it: he laughed in a very peculiar way, at times.
Indeed, he always had been distrustful, suspicious,
coarse in his suspicions; and now he had completely
lost his head. Say what you would to him, he had
one answer for everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard, Tikhon Ilitch? They say that
Zakrzhevsky is dying of catarrh: they have taken
him to Orel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuff and nonsense. We know what that catarrh
really is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the medical man told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe him if it suits you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to subscribe to a newspaper,&#8221; you would
say to him. &#8220;Please let me have ten rubles of my
wages on account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm! Why does a man want to stuff his head with
lies? Well, and to tell the truth, I haven&#8217;t more than
fifteen or twenty kopeks in my pocket&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bride would enter the room, with downcast
eyes: &#8220;We have hardly any flour on hand, Tikhon
Ilitch&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How comes that? Hardly any? Oï, you&#8217;re talking
nonsense, woman!&#8221; And he would contract his
brows in a frown. And while he was proving that
the flour ought to last for another three days, at
least, he kept darting swift glances now at Kuzma,
now at the Bride. Once he even inquired, with a
grin: &#8220;And how do you sleep&mdash;all right? are you
warm?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>And the Bride, who was embarrassed already by his
visits, blushed deeply and, bowing her head, left the
room, while Kuzma&#8217;s fingers turned cold with shame
and wrath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame on you, brother Tikhon Ilitch,&#8221; he blurted
out, turning away to the window. &#8220;And especially
after what you told me yourself&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But then why did she blush?&#8221; inquired Tikhon
Ilitch maliciously, with a perturbed and awkward
smile.</p>




<h3>VIII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">THE most unpleasant thing in the morning was&mdash;washing
oneself. A frosty atmosphere was
brought into the ante-room with the straw; ice
that was like broken glass floated in the wash-basin.
Kuzma sometimes began to drink his tea after having
washed only his hands and, thus fresh from his
slumbers, appeared truly an old man. Thanks to lack
of cleanliness and the cold, he had grown extremely
thin and grey since the autumn. His hands had grown
thinner, and the skin on them had become more delicate,
shiny, and covered with certain tiny purplish
spots.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old grey horse has gone down a steep hill,&#8221; he
said to himself.</p>

<p>It was a grey morning. Beneath the crusted grey
snow the village also had become quite grey in hue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
by St. Philip&#8217;s Day. The frozen household linen hung
like grey boards from the rafters under the roofs of
the sheds. Everything round about the cottages was
frozen&mdash;they poured out the slops and threw out the
ashes. Tattered little urchins hurried through the
streets between the cottages and sheds to school, ran
up the snowdrifts and slid down them on their bark
slippers; all of them had heavy crash bags containing
slates and bread. From the opposite direction came
aged, ailing dark-faced Tohugunok,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> with not a
trace of his former agility remaining, clad in his thin
little overcoat, and bowed beneath the weight of his
yoke, from which hung two buckets; stumbling along
in his hideous felt boots, which had turned stiff as
oaken boards, and were bound with pigskin. From
drift to drift a horse dragged the water-cask, plugged
with straw, rocking and splashing as it went; and behind
it ran white-eyed Kobylyai&mdash;the stammerer.
Women passed, on their way to borrow from one another
salt, millet, a scoop of flour for griddlecakes, or
a hasty pudding. The threshing-floors were deserted.
Only at Yakoff&#8217;s place was smoke issuing from the gate
of the kiln: in imitation of the rich peasants, he
threshed during the winter. And beyond the threshing-floors,
beyond the bare bushes in the back yards,
beneath a low-hanging whitish sky, stretched the grey
snow-covered plain, a waste of snow-crust frozen in
the semblance of waves. It was in truth more cosy
in the village, but the place seemed infected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
plague: almost every household had a case of smallpox
or spotted typhus.</p>

<p>Occasionally Kuzma went to eat luncheon with
Koshel in the servants&#8217; quarters&mdash;potatoes as hot as
fire itself, or the remains of the sour cabbage soup
left over from the previous day. He recalled the town
where he had lived all his life, and was amazed to find
that he had no longing whatsoever to go back there.
The town was Tikhon&#8217;s cherished dream; he scorned
and hated the country with all his soul. Kuzma only
tried to hate it. He now reviewed his existence with
more terror than ever. He had grown thoroughly
wild and unsociable in Durnovka; he did nothing, was
bored, was distressed by his own idleness; frequently
he omitted to wash himself; he did not take off his
undercoat; he ate greedily out of one bowl with Koshel.
But the worst of it all was that, while alarmed at his
mode of existence, which was aging him not merely
from day to day but actually from hour to hour, he
was conscious that it was nevertheless agreeable to
him; that he seemed to have got back into precisely
that rut which, possibly, had rightly belonged to him
from the day of his birth. Not for nothing, apparently,
did the Durnovka blood flow in his veins!
Nevertheless, that interminable Durnovka winter oppressed
him to the point of pain&mdash;those cottages, the
holes in the ice of the pond, the horrid little boys, the
dogs on the roofs, the cold, the dirt, the sickness, the
animal-like laziness of the peasant men. Nearly
every day he called to mind Menshoff, Akim,
Syery....</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>After luncheon he sometimes took a stroll over the
manor-farm or in the village. He went also to Yakoff&#8217;s
threshing-floor, or dropped in at the cottage of
Syery or that of Koshel, whose old woman lived alone,
was reputed to be a witch, was tall and frightfully
emaciated, and had teeth as intrusively conspicuous as
those of a skull. She spoke roughly and decisively,
like a man, and smoked a pipe: she would make a fire
in the stove, seat herself on the sleeping-board, and
set to smoking, all by herself, swinging back and forth
as she did so her long, thin leg in its heavy black bark
shoe. During the entire Fast Kuzma went away from
the farm only twice&mdash;once to the post-office, and once
to see his brother. And those little trips were pleasant,
but painful; Kuzma got so thoroughly chilled that he
could not feel whether he had any feet or not. At
the beginning of the autumn he had still possessed a
firm glance, a tidy appearance. But the firmness of
the glance had vanished, and his clothing had grown
dilapidated. The collar of his shirt was reduced to
a fringe, and the elbows of his coat wore through; his
calfskin boots had become fairly red with rust, thin,
and, in places, gaping. His sheepskin coat had served
him so long that it was dotted all over with bald spots.
And the wind on the plain was savage. After sitting
in the house so long at Durnovka he was not able to
endure the strong, fresh winter air. After prolonged
inspection of the village the snowy grey expanse came
as a surprise; the far distance, enveloped in blue tints
of winter, seemed as a picture so beautiful that one
could never gaze one&#8217;s fill. The horse dashed along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
smartly in the face of the harsh wind, snorting as he
went; frozen lumps of snow flew from beneath his shod
hoofs against the dashboard of the sledge. Koshel,
with a blackish-purple frost-bitten cheek, briskly clearing
his throat, sprang from the box at the slopes and
leaped back into the sledge sidewise, on the run. But
the wind pierced straight through him; his feet, tucked
into straw that was all mixed with snow, ached and
stiffened; his forehead and cheek-bones were racked
with rheumatic pains. And it was so boresome in the
low-ceiled post-office at Ulianovka&mdash;boresome as it can
be only in official offices in the wilds. There was an
odour of mildew, of sealing-wax. The ragged postman
was pounding with his stamp. Grumpy Sakharoff,
who resembled a gorilla, was roaring at the peasants,
raging because it had not occurred to Kuzma to
send him half a dozen fowls or, at least, a pud of
flour; and he inquired: &#8220;What&#8217;s your name, and your
family name?&#8221;&mdash;and, after rummaging in the closet,
he announced with decision: &#8220;Nothing for you.&#8221; In
the vicinity of Tikhon Ilitch&#8217;s house Kuzma was upset
by the stench of manure fumes, which reminded
him that in the world exist towns, people, newspapers,
news. It was agreeable, also, to chat with his brother,
to rest at his house and get warm.</p>

<p>But the chat never was a success. His brother was
called off every minute to the shop, or about some
detail of domestic management, and, besides, he could
talk of nothing but his property matters, the lies,
craftiness, and malice of the peasants&mdash;about the sheer
necessity of getting rid of the estate as speedily as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
possible. Nastasya Petrovna was pitiable. Evidently
she had come to fear her husband most terribly; she
burst into the conversation at unseasonable moments,
at equally unseasonable moments she praised him&mdash;his
intelligence, his keen managerial eye, the fact that
he entered into everything, every minute detail of the
business, himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s so accessible to every one, so approachable!&#8221;
she said&mdash;and Tikhon Ilitch roughly cut her
short, while Kuzma did not know what to say, fearing
to get mixed up in a quarrel. They had exchanged
roles: now it was not he who suggested alarm, but his
brother who frightened and exhorted him; it was not
he but his brother who demonstrated that it was impossible
to live in Russia. After an hour of that sort
of conversation, Kuzma began to long to get home, to
get back to the manor. &#8220;What is to become of me?&#8221;
he thought in alarm, as he listened to his brother discussing
the sale of the estate. And was it possible that
that dreadful marriage between Deniska and the Bride
would come off? And why did Tikhon so obstinately
insist that the marriage must take place? &#8220;He has
gone mad, he certainly has gone mad!&#8221; muttered
Kuzma on his way home, as he called to mind Tikhon&#8217;s
surly and malevolent face, his uncommunicativeness,
his suspiciousness, and his wearisome repetition of one
and the same thing over and over. He began to shout
at Koshel, at the horse, feeling in a hurry to hide in
his little house his sadness, his old, cold clothing, his
loneliness, and his tenderness at the thought of the
Bride&#8217;s sweet, sorrowful face, her womanliness and&mdash;her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
taciturnity. &#8220;Ekh, and how could she fail to go
to ruin here!&#8221; he said sadly to himself, as he gazed
through the twilight gloom at the meagre lights in
Durnovka.</p>




<h3>IX</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">DURING the Christmas holidays Ivanushka,
from Basovka, dropped in to see Kuzma. He
was an old-fashioned peasant who had grown
foolish from old age, although once on a time he had
been renowned for his bear-like strength. Thickset,
bent into a bow, he never lifted his shaggy dark brown
head. He always walked with his toes turned inward.
And he amazed Kuzma even more than had Menshoff,
Akim, and Syery. In the cholera year of &#8217;ninety-two,
the whole of Ivanushka&#8217;s huge family had died. All
he had left was a son, a soldier, who was now working
for the railway as a line-guard, about five versts from
Durnovka. Ivanushka might have passed his declining
days with his son, but he preferred to roam about
and ask alms. He strode lightly, in his bandy-legged
way, across the farmyard, with his cap and his staff in
his left hand, a bag in his right, and his head, on which
the snow shone white, uncovered&mdash;and for some reason
or other the sheep dogs did not growl at him. He
entered the house, mumbled &#8220;May God bless this house
and the master of this house,&#8221; and seated himself on
the floor against the wall. Kuzma dropped his book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and in amazement stared timidly at him over his eyeglasses,
as if he had been some wild beast from the
steppe, whose presence inside a house was a prodigy.</p>

<p>Silently, with downcast lashes and a slight amiable
smile, the Bride made her appearance, walking lightly
in her bark-slippers, gave Ivanushka a bowl of boiled
potatoes and the entire corner crust of a loaf, all grey
with salt, and remained standing at the door-jamb.
She wore bark-slippers; she was broad and robust in
the shoulders; and her handsome, faded face was so
simple and old-fashioned, in the peasant style, that
it seemed as if she could not possibly address Ivanushka
otherwise than as &#8220;grandfather.&#8221; And, smiling
for him and him alone, she did indeed say softly:
&#8220;Eat, eat, grandfather.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he, without raising his head, and recognizing
her kindliness from her voice alone, quietly wailed in
reply, at times mumbling: &#8220;The Lord save ye, granddaughter!&#8221;
then crossed himself broadly and awkwardly,
as if his hand had been a paw, and eagerly
fell to on the food. The snow melted on his dark
brown hair, supernaturally thick and coarse. The
water streamed down from his bark-shoes on to the
floor. From his ancient dark brown fitted coat, worn
over a dirty hemp-crash shirt, emanated the smoky
odour of a chimneyless hovel. His hands were deformed
by long toil, and his horny unbending fingers
fished up the potatoes with difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must feel cold in that thin coat, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
inquired Kuzma, in a loud tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey?&#8221; answered Ivanushka in a faint wail, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
his hand to his ear, which was all overgrown with
hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are cold, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ivanushka thought it over. &#8220;Why cold?&#8221; he replied,
pausing between his words. &#8220;Not a bit cold. &#8217;Twas
a lot colder in days gone by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lift up your head; put your hair in order!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ivanushka slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t raise it now, brother. It drags earthward.&#8221;
And with a dim smile he made an effort to lift his
dreadful face, all overgrown with hair, and his tiny
screwed-up eyes.</p>

<p>When he had finished eating he heaved a sigh,
made the sign of the cross, collected the crumbs from
his knees and chewed them up; then he felt about at
his sides, in search of his bag, stick, and cap, and,
having found them, and recovered his equanimity, he
began a leisurely conversation. He was capable of sitting
silent for the whole day, but Kuzma and the
Bride plied him with questions, and he answered, as
if asleep and from a far distance. He narrated in his
clumsy, ancient language that the Tsar was made entirely
of gold; that the Tsar could not eat fish&mdash;&#8217;twas
exceeding salt&mdash;that once on a time the Prophet Elijah
broke through the sky and tumbled down on the earth&mdash;&#8220;he
was exceedingly heavy&#8221;&mdash;that John the Baptist
was as shaggy as a ram when he was born, and that
at his baptism he beat his godfather over the head
with his iron crutch, in order that the man might
&#8220;come to his senses&#8221;; that every horse, once a year, on
St. Flor and St. Lavr&#8217;s Day, seeks an opportunity to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
kill a man. He told how in days of yore the rye
had grown up so densely that it was impossible for
a snake to crawl through it; how in those times they
reaped at the rate of two desyatini a day for each man;
how he himself had owned a gelding which was kept
&#8220;on a chain,&#8221; so powerful and terrible was it; how
one day sixty years agone he, Ivanushka, had had a
shaft arch stolen from him for which he would not
have accepted two rubles. He was firmly convinced
that his family had died, not of cholera, but because
after a fire they had gone to a new cottage and had
passed the night in it without having first let a cock
pass the night there, and that he and his son had been
saved solely by accident: he had slept on the grain-rick.</p>

<p>Toward evening Ivanushka rose and walked away,
without paying the slightest heed to what the weather
was like and without yielding to all their admonitions
to remain until the morrow. And he caught his death
cold, and on Epiphany Day he died in his son&#8217;s guard-box.
His son urged him to receive the Sacrament.
Ivanushka would not consent; he said that once you
received the Communion you would surely die, whereas
he was firmly determined not to &#8220;yield to death.&#8221;
For whole days at a time he lay unconscious; but even
in his delirium he begged his daughter-in-law to say
that he was not at home if Death should knock at the
door. Once, at night, he came to himself, collected
his forces, crept down from the top of the oven, and
knelt down in front of the holy picture, illuminated by
a shrine-lamp. He sighed heavily, mumbled for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
time, kept repeating: &#8220;O Lord&mdash;Dear Little Father&mdash;forgive
my sins.&#8221; Then he became thoughtful and
remained silent for a long time, with his head bowed
on the floor. Then, all of a sudden, he rose to his
feet and said firmly: &#8220;No. I will not yield!&#8221; But
the next morning he noticed that his daughter-in-law
was rolling out the dough for patties and heating the
oven hot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you preparing for my funeral?&#8221; he asked, in
a quavering voice.</p>

<p>His daughter-in-law made no reply. Again he collected
his forces, again crawled down from the oven,
and went out into the vestibule. Yes, it was true:
there, upright against the wall, stood a huge purple
coffin, adorned with white eight-pointed crosses. Then
he remembered what had happened thirty years before,
to his neighbour old Lukyan: Lukyan had fallen
ill, and they had bought a coffin for him&mdash;it, too, was
a fine, expensive coffin&mdash;and brought from the town
flour, vodka, salted striped bass; but Lukyan went and
got well. What was to be done with the coffin? How
were they to justify the outlay? They cursed Lukyan
about it for the space of five years thereafter, made
life unendurable with their reproaches, tortured him
with hunger, drove him frantic with lice and dirt.
Ivanushka, recalling this, bowed his head and submissively
went back into the cottage. And that night, as
he lay on his back, unconscious, he began, in a trembling,
plaintive voice, to sing, ever more and more softly.
And suddenly he shook his knees, hiccoughed, raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
his chest high with a sigh, and, with foam on his
parted lips, grew cold in death....</p>




<h3>X</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">KUZMA lay in his bed for almost a month, because
of Ivanushka. On Epiphany morning
people declared that a bird would freeze
stiff as it flew, and Kuzma did not even possess
felt boots. Nevertheless, he went to take a last look
at the dead man. His hands, folded and rigid below
his vast chest on a clean hempen shirt, deformed by
calloused growths in the course of full eighty years of
rudimentarily heavy toil, were so coarse and dreadful
that Kuzma hastily turned his eyes away. And he
was unable to cast even so much as a sidelong glance
at Ivanushka&#8217;s hair and his dead wild-beast face. He
drew the white calico up over him as speedily as possible.
And from beneath the calico there suddenly
was wafted a suffocatingly repulsive sweetish
odour....</p>

<p>With a view to warming himself up, Kuzma drank
some vodka and seated himself in front of the hotly
flaming oven. It was warm there in the guardsman&#8217;s
box, and neat as for a festival. Over the head of the
spacious purple coffin, covered with calico, twinkled
the golden flame of a small wax candle affixed to the
dark holy picture in the corner; and a cheap wood-cut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
manufactured by the Josif Brothers, glared forth
in vivid colours. The soldier&#8217;s courteous wife easily
lifted on her oven-fork and thrust into the oven
kettles weighing at least a pud, chatted cheerfully about
government, supplied fuel, and kept entreating him to
remain until her husband should return from the
village. But Kuzma was shaking with fever; his
face burned from the vodka, which, coursing like
poison through his chilled body, began to induce causeless
tears to well up in his eyes. And without having
got warm, he drove away across the white, strong
billows of the plain, to Tikhon Ilitch. Covered with
hoar-frost, the whitish-curly gelding trotted swiftly
along, emitting roaring and quacking sounds, like a
drake, ejecting from his nostrils columns of grey
vapour. The sledge squeaked; its iron runners
screeched sonorously over the hard snow. Behind
Kuzma, in frozen circles, the low-hanging sun shone
yellow; in front, from the North, came a wind which
scorched one and cut short one&#8217;s breath. The
branches which marked out the road bent under a
thick, curly coating of rime; the big grey gold-hammers
flew in flocks ahead of the horse, scattered over
the glistening road, pecked at the frozen manure,
again took flight, and again dispersed. Kuzma gazed
at them through his heavy white eyelashes, feeling
that his face had turned to wood, and that, with his
beard and mustache like white curls, he had come to
resemble a Christmastide mask. The sun was setting;
the snowy billows gleamed with a death-like green in
the orange glow, and blue shadows extended from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
their crests and crenellations. Kuzma turned his
horse sharply about and drove it back, in the direction
of home. The sun had set; a faint light glimmered
in the house with its grey, neglected panes; the
blue twilight hung over it, and it looked cold and unsociable.
The bullfinch which had hung in a cage
near the window, overlooking the orchard, had died&mdash;in
all probability from the coarse, strong tobacco&mdash;and
lay with its legs sticking up, its feathers ruffled,
and its crimson beak agape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done for!&#8221; said Kuzma, and picked up the bullfinch
to throw out.</p>

<p>Durnovka, overwhelmed with frozen snow, was so
far from all the world on that mournful evening, in
the heart of the steppe winter, that he suddenly felt
frightened by it. All was over! His burning head
was confused and heavy. He would take to his bed
at once, and never rise from it again.</p>

<p>The Bride, her bark-shoes screeching on the snow
as she walked, approached the porch, carrying a pail
in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ill, Duniushka!&#8221; said Kuzma caressingly, in
the hope of hearing from her lips a caressing word.</p>

<p>But the Bride replied indifferently, drily: &#8220;Shall
I bring in the samovar?&#8221; And she did not even inquire
what was the matter with him. Neither did
she ask anything about Ivanushka.</p>

<p>Kuzma returned to the dark house and, shivering
all over and wondering with alarm where he could
now go when need compelled, lay down on the divan.
And the evenings slipped into nights and the nights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
slipped into days, and he lost all count of them.</p>

<p>About three o&#8217;clock on the first night he woke up and
pounded on the wall with his fist, in order to ask for a
drink: he had been tormented in his sleep by thirst and
the thought, had they thrown out the bullfinch? No
one answered his knocking: the Bride had gone off to
the servants&#8217; quarters to pass the night. And Kuzma,
conscious now, remembered that he was sick unto death,
and he was overpowered by such melancholy as would
have seized him in a tomb. Obviously the vestibule,
which smelled of snow and straw and horse-collars,
was empty! Obviously he, sick and helpless, was
utterly alone in that dark, ice-cold little house, where
the windows gleamed dim and grey amid the winter
night, with that useless cage hanging beside them!</p>

<p>&#8220;O Lord, save and have mercy; O Lord, help in some
way,&#8221; he murmured, pulling himself up and fumbling
with trembling hands through his pockets.</p>

<p>He wanted to strike a match. But his whisper was
feverish; something rustled and reverberated in his
burning head; his hands and feet were icy cold. Klasha
came, quickly threw open the door, placed his head on
the pillow, and sat down on a chair by the side of the
couch. She was dressed like a young lady, in a velvet
cloak and a little cap and muff of white fur; her hands
were scented with perfume, her eyes shone, her cheeks
had turned crimson with the frost. &#8220;Ah, how well
everything has come out!&#8221; some one whispered. But
what was not nice was that Klasha, for some reason, had
not lighted the lamp; that she had come, not to see him,
but to go to Ivanushka&#8217;s funeral; that she suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
began to sing, accompanying herself on a guitar:
&#8220;Haz-Bulat, the dauntless, thy mountain hut is poor.&#8221;...
Then, all at once, the whole thing vanished; he
opened his eyes&mdash;and not a trace remained of that
mysterious, agitating, and alarming affair which had
filled his head with nonsense. Again he beheld the
dark, cold room, the grey gleaming windows; he comprehended
that everything around him was plain and
simple, too simple&mdash;that he was ill and quite, quite
alone....</p>

<p>In the deadly melancholy which poisoned his soul
at the beginning of his illness, Kuzma had raved about
the bullfinch, Klasha, Voronezh. But even in his
delirium the thought had never left him that he must
tell some one that they must show pity on him in one
respect&mdash;they must not bury him in Kolodezy. But,
my God! was it not madness to hope for pity in Durnovka?
Once he came to himself in the morning, when
the fire was being made in the stove&mdash;and the simple,
quiet voices of Koshel and the Bride seemed to him
pitiless, alien, and strange, as the life of well people
always appears pitiless, alien, strange to a sick person.
He tried to call out, to ask for the samovar&mdash;but remained
dumb and almost fell to weeping. The angry
whisper of Koshel became audible&mdash;discussing him, the
sick man, of course&mdash;and the Bride&#8217;s abrupt reply:
&#8220;Well, all&#8217;s up with him! He&#8217;ll die&mdash;and be buried....&#8221;</p>

<p>Then his melancholy began to abate. The sun,
declining to the west, shone through the windows,
athwart the bare branches of the acacias. The tobacco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
smoke hung in a blue cloud. Beside the bed sat the
aged medical man, redolent of drugs and frosty freshness,
pulling icicles from his mustache. On the table
the samovar was bubbling, and Tikhon Ilitch, tall,
grey, severe, was brewing aromatic tea as he stood by
it. The medical man drank eight or ten glasses, talked
about his cows, the price of flour and butter; Tikhon
Ilitch described how wonderful, how expensive, Nastasya
Petrovna&#8217;s funeral had been, and how glad he
was that at last he had found a purchaser for Durnovka.
Kuzma understood that Tikhon Ilitch had just
come from the town, that Nastasya Petrovna had died
there suddenly, on her way to a railway station; he
understood that the funeral had cost Tikhon Ilitch
frightfully dear, and that he had already taken
earnest-money for Durnovka&mdash;and he was completely
indifferent.</p>




<h3>XI</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE day he awakened very late and, feeling
neither weakness nor trembling in his legs, sat
up to drink his tea. The day was overcast,
warm, and much snow had fallen. Syery passed the
window, making on the new snow imprints of his bark-shoes,
sprinkled with tiny crosses. The sheep dogs were
running beside him, sniffing at his tattered coattails.
And he was leading by the bridle a tall horse of a
dirty light bay colour, hideously old and skinny, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
shoulders abraded by the collar; it had an in-curving
back and a thin, unclean tail. The horse was limping
on three legs and dragging the fourth, which was
broken below the knee. Then Kuzma recalled that two
days previously Tikhon Ilitch had been there, and had
said that he had ordered Syery to give the dogs a
treat&mdash;to find and kill an old horse; that Syery had in
former days been engaged in that occupation at times&mdash;the
purchase of dead or worthless cattle for their hides.
A terrible thing had recently happened to Syery,
Tikhon Ilitch had said: in making ready to kill a mare,
Syery had forgotten to hobble her&mdash;he had merely
bound her and turned her muzzle to one side&mdash;and the
mare, as soon as, crossing himself, he had plunged the
thin small knife into her jugular vein, had uttered a
scream and, screaming, had hurled herself upon her
assassin, her yellow teeth laid bare in pain and rage,
streams of black blood spurting out upon the snow, and
had pursued him for a long time, exactly as if she had
been a man&mdash;and would have caught him but that,
&#8220;luckily, the snow was deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma had been so deeply impressed by this incident
that now, as he glanced through the window, he felt the
heaviness returning in his legs. He began to gulp
down the boiling hot tea, and gradually recovered himself.
He lighted his cigarette and sat for a while
smoking. At last he rose, went into the ante-room, and
looked out at the bare, sparse orchard through the
window, which had thawed. In the orchard, on the
snow-white pall of the meadow, a high-ribbed, bloody
carcass with a long neck and a crushed head stood out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
redly. The dogs, their backs all hunched up and their
paws braced on the meat, were greedily tearing out
and dragging away the entrails. Two aged blackish-grey
crows were hopping sidewise toward the head, and
had started to fly thither, when the dogs, snarling,
darted upon them; and once more they alighted on the
virginally pure snow. &#8220;Ivanushka, Syery, the
crows&mdash;&#8221; Kuzma said to himself. &#8220;Perhaps those
crows can recall the times of Ivan the Terrible. O
Lord, save and show mercy&mdash;take me away from here!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma&#8217;s indisposition did not leave him for another
fortnight. The thought of spring affected him
both mournfully and joyfully; he longed to get away
from Durnovka as speedily as possible. He knew
that the end of winter was not yet in sight; but the
thaw had already set in. The first week of February
was dark and foggy. The fog covered the plain and
devoured the snow. The village turned black; water
stood between the dirty snowdrifts; the village policeman
drove through the village one day, his horses
hitched tandem, all spattered with horse droppings.
The cocks took to crowing; through the ventilators
penetrated a disturbing spring-like dampness. He
wanted to go on living; to go on living and wait for the
spring, his removal to the town; to live on, submitting
to fate, and to do any sort of work whatsoever, if only
to earn a single bit of bread. And to work, of course,
for his brother&mdash;regardless of what he was like. Why,
his brother had proposed to him while he was ill that
they should move over to Vorgol. &#8220;Why should I
turn you out of doors?&#8221; he had said after pondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the matter.&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m giving up the shop and the homestead
on the first of March: let&#8217;s go to the town,
brother, as far as possible from these cutthroats.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was true: cutthroats they were. Odnodvorka
had come in and imparted the particulars of a recent
encounter with Syery. Deniska had returned from
Tula, and had been knocking about without work,
gabbling about the village that he wanted to marry;
that he had no money, but would soon earn some of
first-class quality. At first the village had pronounced
these tales absurd nonsense; then, following Deniska&#8217;s
hints, it had come to understand the drift of the matter
and had believed him. Syery, too, had believed him,
and began to curry favour with his son. But after
slaying the horse and receiving a ruble from Tikhon
Ilitch and securing half a ruble for the skin, he had
begun to chatter incautiously and had gone on a spree.
He drank for two days, and lost his pipe, and lay down
on the oven to recover. His head ached, and he had
nothing in which to put tobacco for a smoke. So,
to make cigarettes, he began to peel the ceiling, which
Deniska had pasted over with newspapers and divers
pictures. He did his peeling on the sly, of course; but
nevertheless, one day, Deniska caught him at it. He
caught him and began to roar at him. Syery, being
intoxicated, began to roar in return. Thereupon,
Deniska pulled him off the oven and thrashed him
within an inch of his life, until the neighbors rushed in.
Peace was concluded on the evening of the following
day, it is true, over cracknels and vodka; but, as
Kuzma said to himself, was not Tikhon Ilitch a cut-throat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
also when he insisted, with the obstinacy of a
crazy man, on the marriage of the Bride to one of these
cutthroats?</p>

<p>When Kuzma first heard about that marriage, he
firmly made up his mind that he would not permit it.
What a horror, what folly! But later on, when he
recovered consciousness during his illness, he actually
rejoiced over this foolish idea. He had been surprised
and impressed by the indifference which the Bride had
displayed toward him, a sick man. &#8220;A beast, a savage!&#8221;
he had said to himself; and, calling to mind the
wedding, he had added spitefully: &#8220;And that&#8217;s capital!
That&#8217;s exactly what she deserves!&#8221; Now, after
his illness, both his decision and his wrath disappeared.
He managed to get into conversation with the Bride
about Tikhon Ilitch&#8217;s intentions; and she replied
calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes, I did have some talk about that affair
with Tikhon Ilitch. God grant him good health for
such a fine idea!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fine idea?&#8221; said Kuzma in amazement.</p>

<p>The Bride looked at him and shook her head.
&#8220;Well, and why isn&#8217;t it fine? Great heavens, but you
are queer, Kuzma Ilitch! He offers money, and takes
the expense of the wedding on himself. Then again,
he has not picked out some widower or other, but a
young, unmarried man, without vices&mdash;neither rotten
nor a drunkard&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s a sluggard, a bully, a downright fool,&#8221;
added Kuzma.</p>

<p>The Bride dropped her eyes and made no reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Heaving a sigh, she turned and went toward the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you like,&#8221; she said, her voice trembling. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
your affair. Break it off&mdash;God help you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma opened his eyes very wide and shouted:
&#8220;Stop! have you lost your senses? Do you think I
wish you ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bride turned round and halted. &#8220;And isn&#8217;t it
wishing me ill?&#8221; she said hotly and roughly, her cheeks
flushing and her eyes blazing. &#8220;What is to become of
me, according to your idea? Am I to go on for ever
as an outcast, at the thresholds of other people&#8217;s
houses? Eating the crusts of strangers? Wandering
about, a homeless beggar? Or am I to hunt up some
old widower? Haven&#8217;t I swallowed tears enough
already?&#8221;</p>

<p>And her voice broke. She fell to weeping and left
the room. In the evening Kuzma tried to convince her
that he had no intention of breaking up the affair, and
at last she believed him and smiled a friendly, reserved
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, thank you,&#8221; she said in the pleasant tone
which she used to Ivanushka.</p>

<p>But at this point the tears began to quiver on her
eyelashes, and once more Kuzma gave up in despair.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>And the Bride answered softly: &#8220;Well, perhaps
Deniska is not much of a joy&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Koshel brought from the post-office a newspaper
nearly six weeks old. The days were dark and foggy,
and Kuzma read from morning till night, seated at
the window.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>And when he had finished and had made himself
dizzy with the number of fresh executions, he was benumbed.
Heretofore he had been suffocated with rage
when he read the newspapers&mdash;futile rage, because human
receptivity was unequal to taking in what one
read there. Now his fingers grew cold&mdash;nothing more.
Yes, yes, there was nothing to get excited about.
Everything went as if according to programme.
Everything fitted together perfectly. He raised his
head: the sleet was driving in white slanting lines, falling
upon the black, miserable little village, on the
muddy roads with their hillocks and hollows, on the
horse-dung, the ice, and the pools of water. A twilight
mist concealed the boundless plain&mdash;all that vast
empty space with its snows, forests, settlements,
towns&mdash;the kingdom of cold and of death.</p>

<p>&#8220;Avdotya!&#8221; shouted Kuzma, as he rose to his feet.
&#8220;Tell Koshel to harness the horse to the sledge. I&#8217;m
going to my brother&#8217;s....&#8221;</p>




<h3>XII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">TIKHON ILITCH was at home. In a Russian
shirt of cotton print, huge and powerful,
swarthy of countenance, with white beard and
grey frowning brows, he was sitting with the samovar
and brewing himself some tea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! how are you, brother?&#8221; he exclaimed in welcome,
but with his brows still contracted. &#8220;So you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
have crawled out through God&#8217;s snow? Look out:
isn&#8217;t it rather early?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so deadly bored, brother,&#8221; replied Kuzma, as
they kissed each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you were bored, come and warm yourself
and we&#8217;ll have a chat....&#8221;</p>

<p>After questioning each other as to whether there
were any news, they began in silence to drink tea, after
which they started to smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are growing very thin, dear brother!&#8221; remarked
Tikhon Ilitch as he inhaled his smoke and scrutinized
Kuzma with a sidelong glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;One does get thin,&#8221; replied Kuzma quietly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you read the newspapers?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch smiled. &#8220;That nonsense? No, God
preserve me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you only knew how many executions there are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Executions? That&#8217;s all right. Haven&#8217;t you heard
what happened near Eletz? At the farm of the Bykoff
brothers? Probably you remember&mdash;those fellows who
can&#8217;t pronounce their letters right? Well, those Bykoffs
were sitting, just as you and I are sitting together
now, playing checkers one evening. Suddenly&mdash;what
was it? There was a stamping on the porch and a
shout of &#8216;Open the door!&#8217; Well, brother, and before
those Bykoffs had time to blink an eye, in rolls their
labourer, a peasant after the pattern of Syery, and
behind him two scalawags of some breed or other&mdash;hooligan
adventurers, in a word. And all of them
armed with crowbars. They brandished their crowbars
and began to yell: &#8216;Put up your hands, curse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
your mother&#8217;s memory!&#8217; Of course, the Bykoffs were
thoroughly scared&mdash;scared to death&mdash;and they leaped
to their feet and shouted: &#8216;What&#8217;s the meaning of
this?&#8217; And their nice little peasant yells, &#8216;Put &#8217;em oop,
put &#8217;em oop!&#8217;&#8221; Here Tikhon Ilitch smiled, became
thoughtful, and stopped talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, tell the rest of it,&#8221; said Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more to tell. They stuck up their
hands, as a matter of course, and asked: &#8216;What do
you want?&#8217; &#8216;Give us some ham! Where are your
keys?&#8217; &#8216;Damn you! As if you didn&#8217;t know! There
they are yonder, on the door lintel, hanging on the
nail.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they said that with their hands raised?&#8221; interrupted
Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they had their hands raised. And those
men are going to pay heavily for those upraised hands!
They&#8217;ll be hanged, naturally. They are already in
jail, the dear creatures&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they going to hang them on account of the
ham?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! for the fun of it, Lord forgive me for my sin,&#8221;
retorted Tikhon Ilitch, half angrily, half in jest. &#8220;For
the love of God, do stop talking balderdash and trying
to pretend you&#8217;re a Balashkin! &#8217;Tis time to drop
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma pulled at his grey beard. His haggard,
emaciated face, his mournful eyes, his left brow, which
slanted upward, all were reflected in the mirror, and
as he looked at himself he silently assented.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>&#8220;Talking balderdash? Truly it is time&mdash;I ought to
have dropped that long ago....&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Tikhon Ilitch turned the conversation to
business. Evidently he had been thinking things over
a little while previously, during the story, merely because
something far more important than executions
had occurred to him&mdash;a bit of business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here now, I&#8217;ve already told Deniska that he is to
finish off that music as soon as possible,&#8221; he began
firmly, clearly, and sternly, sifting tea into the teapot
from his fist. &#8220;And I beg you, brother, to take a
hand in it also&mdash;in that music. It is awkward for me,
you understand. And after it is over, you can move
over here. &#8217;Twill be comfortable, brother! Once we
have made up our mind to change our entire investment,
down to the last scrap, there&#8217;s no sense in your
stopping on there with nothing to do. It only doubles
the expense. And once we have removed elsewhere,
why, get into harness alongside me. Once we have
shifted the burden from our shoulders, we&#8217;ll go off to
the town, God willing, to amass grain, and we&#8217;ll get
into real business. And then we&#8217;ll never come back
to this hole of a place again. We&#8217;ll shake the dust of
it from our feet, and it may go to hell for all I care.
I don&#8217;t propose to rot in it! Bear in mind,&#8221; he said,
contracting his brows in a frown, stretching out his
arms, and clenching his fists, &#8220;you can&#8217;t wrest things
out of my grasp yet a while. &#8217;Tis too early for me to
take to lying on top of the oven! I&#8217;m still capable of
ripping the horns off the devil himself!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>Kuzma listened, staring almost in terror at his fixed,
fairly crazed eyes, at his mouth set awry, at his words
distinctly uttered in a rapacious sort of way&mdash;listened
and held his peace. Later on he inquired: &#8220;Brother,
tell me, for Christ&#8217;s sake, what profit to you is there
in this marriage? I don&#8217;t understand; God is my
witness, I don&#8217;t understand it. I can&#8217;t bear even the
sight of that Deniska of yours. That&#8217;s a new type&mdash;new
Russia will be worse than all the old types. Don&#8217;t
you make any mistake, thinking he is bashful and
sentimental and only pretends to be a fool: he&#8217;s an extremely
cynical beast. People are saying of me that
I am living with the Bride&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t know moderation in anything,&#8221;
interrupted Tikhon Ilitch with a frown. &#8220;You&#8217;re for
ever hammering away at the same thing: &#8216;an unhappy
nation, an unhappy nation!&#8217; And now&mdash;you call them
brutes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do hammer at that idea, and I shall go on
hammering at it!&#8221; Kuzma broke in hotly. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ve lost my wits completely! Nowadays I don&#8217;t understand
at all: whether it is an unhappy nation, or&mdash; Come
now, listen to me. You know you hate that man
yourself, that Deniska! You both hate each other!
He never speaks of you except to call you a &#8216;bloodsucker
who has gnawed himself into the very vitals of
the people,&#8217; and here you are calling <i>him</i> a bloodsucker!
He is boasting insolently about the village
that now he is the equal of the king!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know that,&#8221; Tikhon Ilitch again interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;But do you know what he is saying about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Bride?&#8221; went on Kuzma, not listening to him. &#8220;She&#8217;s
handsome&mdash;she has, you know, such a white, delicate
complexion&mdash;but he, the stupid animal&mdash;do you know
what he is saying about her? &#8216;She&#8217;s all enameled, the
trollop!&#8217; And, by this time, you must understand
one thing: he certainly will not live in the village. You
couldn&#8217;t keep that vagabond in the country now with
a lasso. What sort of a farmer and what sort of a
family man do you suppose he&#8217;ll be? Yesterday, I
heard, he was roaming about the village and singing
in a lewd voice: &#8216;She&#8217;s beautiful as an angel from
heaven, as sly as a damon from hell.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it!&#8221; yelled Tikhon Ilitch. &#8220;He won&#8217;t live
in the country&mdash;not for any consideration on earth,
he won&#8217;t! Well, and devil take him! And as for his
being no sort of a farmer, you and I are nice farmers
ourselves, ain&#8217;t we? I remember how I was talking
to you about business&mdash;in the eating-house, do you
remember?&mdash;and all the while you were listening to
that quail. Well, go on; what comes next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? What has the quail to do
with it?&#8221; inquired Kuzma.</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch began to drum on the table with his
fingers and said sternly, uttering each word with great
distinctness: &#8220;Bear in mind: if you grind water,
you&#8217;ll be left with just water as the result. My word
is sacred to ages of ages. Once I have said I&#8217;ll do a
thing&mdash;I&#8217;ll do it. I won&#8217;t set a candle before the holy
picture in atonement for my sin, but I&#8217;ll do a good
deed instead. Although I may give only a mite, the
Lord will remember me for that mite.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>Kuzma sprang from his seat. &#8220;The Lord, the
Lord!&#8221; he cried, in a falsetto tone. &#8220;What has the
Lord to do with that affair of yours? What can the
Lord mean to Deniska, to Akimka, to Menshoff, to
Syery, to you, or to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; inquired Tikhon Ilitch severely. &#8220;What
Akimka is that you&#8217;re talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I lay there dying,&#8221; pursued Kuzma, paying
no heed to him, &#8220;did I think very much about Him?
I thought just one thing: &#8216;I don&#8217;t know anything
about Him, and I don&#8217;t know how to think&#8217;!&#8221; shouted
Kuzma. &#8220;I&#8217;m an ignorant man!&#8221;</p>

<p>And glancing about him with roving, suffering eyes,
as he buttoned and unbuttoned his coat, he strode
across the room and halted directly in front of Tikhon
Ilitch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember this, brother,&#8221; he said, his cheek-bones
reddening. &#8220;Remember this: your life and mine are
finished. And no candles on earth will save us. Do
you hear? We are&mdash;Durnovka folk. We&#8217;re neither
candle for God nor oven-fork for the devil.&#8221; And,
unable to find words in his agitation, he fell silent.</p>

<p>But Tikhon Ilitch had again thought of something,
and suddenly assented: &#8220;Correct. &#8217;Tis a good-for-nothing
people! Just you consider&mdash;&#8221; And, animated,
carried away by his new idea:</p>

<p>&#8220;Just you consider: they&#8217;ve been tilling the soil for
a whole thousand years&mdash;what am I saying? for longer
than that!&mdash;but how to till the soil properly not a
soul of them understands! They don&#8217;t know how to
do their one and only business! They don&#8217;t know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
proper time to begin field work! Nor when to sow,
nor when to reap! &#8216;As the people always have done,
so will we always do&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s the whole story. Note
that!&#8221; Contracting his brows, he shouted sternly, as
Kuzma had recently shouted at him. &#8220;&#8216;As the people
always have done, so will we always do!&#8217; Not a
single peasant woman knows how to bake bread&mdash;the
top crust is burned as black as the devil and falls off,
and underneath that crust&mdash;there&#8217;s nothing but sour
water!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma was dumbfounded. His thoughts were reduced
to a jumble. &#8220;He has lost his senses!&#8221; he said
to himself, with uncomprehending eyes watching his
brother, who was lighting the lamp.</p>

<p>But Tikhon Ilitch, giving him no time to recover
himself, continued wrathfully: &#8220;The people! Lewd,
lazy, liars, and so shameless that not one of them believes
another! Note this,&#8221; he roared, not perceiving
that the lighted wick was smoking and the soot billowing
up almost to the ceiling. &#8220;&#8217;Tis not us they refuse
to trust, but one another! And they are all like that&mdash;every
one of them!&#8221; he shouted in a tearful voice,
as he jammed the chimney on the lamp with a crash.</p>

<p>The outdoor light was beginning to filter blue
through the windows. New, fresh snow was fluttering
down on the pools of water and the snowdrifts.
Kuzma gazed at it and held his peace. The conversation
had taken such an unexpected turn that even
Kuzma&#8217;s eagerness had vanished. Not knowing what
to say, unable to bring himself to look at his brother&#8217;s
furious eyes, he began to roll himself a cigarette.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>&#8220;He has gone crazy!&#8221; he said to himself despairingly.
&#8220;Well, so be it! It makes no difference!
Nothing&mdash;nothing makes any difference. Enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to smoke, and Tikhon Ilitch also began to
calm down. He seated himself and, staring at the
lamp, muttered softly: &#8220;You were talking about
&#8216;Deniska.&#8217; Have you heard what Makar Ivanovitch,
that pilgrim fellow, has been up to? He and that
friend of his caught a peasant woman on the road and
dragged her to the sentry-box at Kliutchiki, and kept
her there for four days, visiting her in turn. Well,
and now they are in jail&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tikhon Ilitch,&#8221; said Kuzma amiably, &#8220;why do you
talk nonsense? What&#8217;s the object? You must be feeling
ill. You keep jumping from one thing to another;
now you assert one thing, a minute later you assert
something different. Are you drinking too much, perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tikhon Ilitch remained silent for a while. He
merely waved his hand, and tears trembled in his eyes,
which were riveted on the flame of the lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you drinking?&#8221; repeated Kuzma quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am,&#8221; quietly replied Tikhon Ilitch. &#8220;And
&#8217;tis enough to make any one take to drink! Has it
been easy for me to acquire this golden cage, think
you? Do you imagine that it has been easy for me
to live like a chained hound all my life, and with my
old woman into the bargain? I have never shown any
pity to any one, brother. Well, and has any one
shown the least pity on me? Do you think I don&#8217;t
know how I am hated? Do you think they wouldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
have murdered me in some fashion if those peasants
had once got the breeching under their tail in proper
style? If they had had luck in that revolution? Wait
a bit, wait&mdash; There&#8217;ll be something doing; it&#8217;s coming!
We have cut their throats!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they are to be hanged&mdash;on account of a little
ham?&#8221; asked Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as for the hanging,&#8221; replied Tikhon Ilitch
in agonized tones, &#8220;why, I just said the first thing that
came to my tongue&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they certainly will hang them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;and that&#8217;s no affair of ours. They must
answer for that to the Most High.&#8221; And, frowning,
he fell into thought and closed his eyes. &#8220;Ah!&#8221; he
said contritely, with a profound sigh. &#8220;Ah, my dear
brother! Soon, very soon, we also must appear before
His throne for judgment! I read the Trebnik<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
of an evening, and I weep and I wail over that same
book. I am greatly amazed; how was it possible to
invent such sweet words? But here, wait a minute&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And he rose hastily, drew from behind the mirror a
thick book in ecclesiastical binding, with trembling
hands donned his spectacles, and with tears in his
voice began to read, hurriedly, as if he feared to be
interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I weep and I wail when I think upon death, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
behold our beauty, fashioned after the image of God,
lying in the tomb disfigured, dishonoured, bereft of
form....</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Of a truth, all things are vanity, and life is but a
shadow and a dream. For in vain doth every one who
is born of earth disquiet himself, as saith the Scriptures:
when we have acquired the world, then do we
take up our abode in the grave, where kings and beggars
lie down together....&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Kings and beggars!&#8217;&#8221; repeated Tikhon Ilitch with
ecstatic melancholy, and shook his head. &#8220;Life is
over, dear brother! I had, you understand, a dumb
cook; I gave her, the stupid thing, a kerchief from
foreign parts; and what does she do but <i>take and wear
it completely to rags, wrong side out</i>! Do you understand?
Out of stupidity and greed. She begrudged
wearing it right side out on ordinary days&mdash;and when
a feast-day came along nothing was left of it but
rags. And that&#8217;s exactly the way it is with me and
with my life. &#8217;Tis truly so!&#8221;</p>

<p>On returning to Durnovka Kuzma was conscious of
only one feeling&mdash;a certain dull agony. And all the
last days of his stay at Durnovka were passed in that
dull agony.</p>




<h3>XIII</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">DURING those days snow fell, and they were
only waiting for that snow at Syery&#8217;s farmstead,
so that the road might be in order for
the celebration of the wedding.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>On the twelfth of February, towards evening, in the
gloom of the cold entrance lobby, a low-toned conversation
was in progress. Beside the stove stood the
Bride, a yellow kerchief besprinkled with black polka-dots
pulled well down on her forehead, staring at her
bark-shoes. By the door stood short-legged Deniska,
hatless, in a heavy undercoat, with drooping shoulders.
He, too, was gazing downward, at some women&#8217;s high
shoes with metal tips, which he was twisting about in
his hands. The boots belonged to the Bride. Deniska
had mended them, and had come to receive five kopeks
for his work.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t got it,&#8221; the Bride was saying, &#8220;and
I think Kuzma Ilitch is taking a nap. Just you wait
until to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t possibly wait,&#8221; replied Deniska in a sing-song,
meditative voice, as he picked at the metal tip
with his finger nail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what are we going to do about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska reflected, sighed, and, shaking back his thick
hair, suddenly raised his head. &#8220;Well, and what&#8217;s the
good of wagging one&#8217;s tongue for nothing?&#8221; he said
loudly and decisively, without glancing at the Bride,
and mastering his shyness. &#8220;Has Tikhon Ilitch said
anything to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he has,&#8221; replied the Bride. &#8220;He has downright
bored me with his talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case I will come at once with my father.
It won&#8217;t hurt Kuzma Ilitch to get up immediately and
drink tea&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bride thought it over. &#8220;That&#8217;s as you like&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>Deniska set the shoes on the window-sill and went
away, without making any further mention of money.
And half an hour later the knocking of bark-shoes
coated with snow became audible on the porch. Deniska
had returned with Syery&mdash;and Syery, for some
unknown reason, was girt about the hips, over his
kazak coat, with a red belt. Kuzma came out to
receive them. Deniska and Syery crossed themselves
for a long time toward the dark corner, then tossed
back their hair and raised their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Matchmaker or not, yet a fine man!&#8221; began Syery
without haste, in an unusually easy and pleasant tone.
&#8220;You have an adopted daughter to marry off. I have
a son who wants a wife. In good agreement, for their
happiness, let us discuss the matter between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she has a mother, you know,&#8221; said Kuzma.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her mother is no housewife; she&#8217;s a homeless
widow, her cottage is dilapidated, and no one knows
where she is,&#8221; replied Syery, still maintaining his tone.
&#8220;Consider her as an orphan!&#8221; And he made a low,
stately reverence.</p>

<p>Repressing a sickly smile, Kuzma ordered the Bride
to be summoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run, hunt her up,&#8221; Syery commanded Deniska,
speaking in a whisper as if they were in church.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am,&#8221; said the Bride, emerging from behind
the door in back of the stove and bowing to Syery.</p>

<p>Silence ensued. The samovar, which stood on the
floor, its grating glowing red through the darkness,
boiled and bubbled. Their faces were not visible, but
it could be felt that all of them were perturbed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>&#8220;Well, daughter, how is it to be? decide,&#8221; said
Kuzma.</p>

<p>The Bride reflected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing against the young man&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how about you, Deniska?&#8221;</p>

<p>Deniska also remained silent. &#8220;Well, anyhow, I&#8217;ve
got to marry some time or other. Possibly, with God&#8217;s
aid, this will go all right&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereupon the two matchmakers exchanged congratulations
on the affair&#8217;s having been begun. The samovar
was carried away to the servants&#8217; hall.
Odnodvorka, who had learned the news earlier than
all the rest and had run over from the promontory,
lighted the small lamp in the servants&#8217; hall, sent
Koshel off for vodka and sunflower seeds, seated the
bride and the bridegroom beneath the holy pictures,
poured them out tea, sat down herself alongside Syery,
and, in order to banish the awkwardness, started to
sing in a high, sharp voice, glancing the while at
Deniska and his long eyelashes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;When in our little garden,</div>
<div class="verse">Amid our grape vines green,</div>
<div class="verse">There walked and roamed a gallant youth,</div>
<div class="verse">Comely of face, and white, so white....&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>But Kuzma wandered to and fro from corner to
corner in the dark hall, shaking his head, wrinkling up
his face and muttering: &#8220;Aï, great heavens! Aï,
what a shame, what folly, what a wretched affair!&#8221;</p>

<p>On the following day, every one who had heard from
Syery about this festival grinned and offered him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
advice: &#8220;You might help the young couple a bit!&#8221;
Koshel said the same: &#8220;They are a young couple
starting life, and young people ought to be helped!&#8221;
Syery went off home in silence. Presently he brought
to the Bride, who was ironing in the ante-room, two
iron kettles and a hank of black bread. &#8220;Here, dear
little daughter-in-law,&#8221; he said in confusion, &#8220;take
these; your mother-in-law sends them. Perhaps they
may be of use. I haven&#8217;t anything else&mdash;if I had had,
I would have jumped out of my shirt with joy!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bride bowed and thanked him. She was ironing
a curtain, sent by Tikhon Ilitch &#8220;in lieu of a veil,&#8221;
and her eyes were wet and red. Syery tried to comfort
her, saying that things weren&#8217;t honey-sweet with him,
either; but he hesitated, sighed, and, placing the
kettles on the window-sill, went away. &#8220;I have put
the thread in the littlest kettle,&#8221; he mumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, batiushka,&#8221; the Bride thanked him once
more, in that same kindly and special tone which she
had used only toward Ivanushka; and the moment
Syery was gone she suddenly indulged in a faint
ironic smile and began to sing:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;When in our little garden ...&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma thrust his head out of the hall and looked
sternly at her over the top of his eyeglasses. She
subsided into silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; said Kuzma. &#8220;Perhaps you would
like to drop this whole business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late, now,&#8221; replied the Bride in a low voice.
&#8220;As it is, one can&#8217;t get rid of the disgrace. Doesn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
everybody know whose money will pay for the feast?
And we have already begun to spend it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuzma shrugged his shoulders. It was true: Tikhon
Ilitch, along with the window-curtain, had sent
twenty-five rubles, a sack of fine wheaten flour, millet,
a skinny pig. But there was no reason why she should
ruin her life simply because they had already killed
the pig!</p>

<p>&#8220;Okh!&#8221; said Kuzma. &#8220;How you have tortured me!
&#8216;Disgraced&#8217;! &#8216;we&#8217;ve spent it&#8217;&mdash; Are you cheaper than
the pig?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether I&#8217;m cheaper or not, what is done is done&mdash;the
dead are not brought back from the cemetery,&#8221;
firmly and simply replied the Bride; and, sighing, she
folded the warm, freshly-ironed curtain neatly. &#8220;Will
you have your dinner immediately?&#8221; Her face was
calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that settles it! You can do nothing with
her!&#8221; thought Kuzma, and he said: &#8220;Well, manage
your affairs as you see fit&mdash;&#8221;</p>




<h3>XIV</h3>


<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER he had dined he smoked and looked out
of the window. It had grown dark. He knew
that in the servants&#8217; wing they were already
baking the twisted buns of rye flour&mdash;the &#8220;ceremonial
patties.&#8221; They were making ready to boil two kettles
of fish in jelly, a kettle of vermicelli-paste, a kettle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
sour cabbage soup, a kettle of buckwheat groats&mdash;all
fresh from the slaughter-house. And Syery was making
himself very busy on a hillock of snow between
the storehouses and the shed. On the snow-mound, in
the bluish shades of twilight, there blazed with an
orange-coloured flame the straw with which they had
surrounded the slaughtered pig. Around the fire,
awaiting their prey, sat the sheep dogs. Their muzzles
shone white; their breasts were of a silky rose hue.
Syery, stamping through the snow, ran hither and
thither, mending the fire, swinging his arms at the
dogs. He had tucked up high the tails of his coat,
thrusting them into his belt, and kept pushing his cap
to the back of his head with the wrists of his right
hand, in which glittered a knife. Fleetingly and brilliantly
illuminated, now from this side, now from that,
Syery cast a huge, dancing shadow on the snow&mdash;the
shadow of a pagan. Then, past the storehouse along
the footpath leading to the village, ran Odnodvorka,
and disappeared beneath the snow-mound&mdash;to summon
the women for the ceremonial rites and to ask Domashka
for the fir-tree, carefully preserved in her cellar and
passed on from one bride&#8217;s party to another on the
eve of the wedding. And when Kuzma, after brushing
his hair and changing his round jacket with the
ragged elbows for the conventional long-tailed frock
coat, had donned his overcoat and emerged upon the
porch, all white with the falling snow in the soft grey
gloom, a large crowd of children, little girls and
boys, were still outlined blackly against the lighted
windows; they were screaming and talking, and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
accordions were being played simultaneously, and all
playing different tunes. Kuzma, his shoulders
hunched, picking at his fingers and cracking them,
stepped up to the crowd, pushed his way through it,
and, bending low, disappeared into the darkness of the
ante-room. It was full of people, crowded even, in that
entry-way. Small urchins darted about between
people&#8217;s legs, were seized by the scruff of the neck and
thrust outside&mdash;whereupon they promptly crawled
back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come now, let me in, for God&#8217;s sake!&#8221; said Kuzma,
who was squeezed tightly in the doorway.</p>

<p>They squeezed him all the harder&mdash;and some one
jerked open the door. Surrounded by jets of vapour,
he crossed the threshold and came to a halt at the
jamb. At that point the better-class people were congregated&mdash;maidens
in flowered shawls, children in
complete new outfits. There was an odour of woven
goods, fur coats, kerosene, cheap tobacco, and evergreens.
A small green tree, decorated with scraps of
red cotton cloth, stood on the table, its branches outstretched
above the dim tin lamp. Around the table
beneath the moist little windows, which had thawed
out, along the damp blackened walls, sat the ceremonial
women, festively adorned, their faces coarsely
painted red and white. Their eyes flashed. All wore
silk and woolen kerchiefs on their heads, with drooping
rainbow-tinted feathers from the tail of a drake
stuck into their hair at the temples. Just as Kuzma
entered, Domashka, a lame girl with a dark, malicious,
and intelligent face, sharp black eyes, and black eyebrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
which met over her nose, had struck up in a
rough, hoarse voice the ancient &#8220;exaltation&#8221; song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;At our house in the evening, fully evening,</div>
<div class="verse">At the very last end of the evening,</div>
<div class="verse">At Avdotya&#8217;s betrothal feast....&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>In a dense, discordant chorus the maidens repeated
her last words. And all turned toward the Bride. She
was sitting, in accordance with custom, by the stove,
her hair flowing loose, her head covered with a large
dark shawl; and she was bound to answer the song
with loud weeping and wailing: &#8220;My own dear father,
my own mother dear, how am I to live forevermore
thus grieving with woe in marriage?&#8221; But the Bride
uttered never a word. And the maidens, having finished
their song, involuntarily regarded her askance.
They began to whisper among themselves, and,
frowning, they slowly, in a drawling tone, struck up
the &#8220;orphan&#8217;s song&#8221;:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;Heat yourself hot, you little bath,</div>
<div class="verse">Ring out, you sonorous bell!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And Kuzma&#8217;s tightly clenched jaws began to quiver;
a chill darted through his head and his legs; his cheek-bones
ached agreeably, and his eyes were filled and
dimmed with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that, you girls!&#8221; some one shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it, my dear, stop it!&#8221; cried Odnodvorka, slipping
down from the bench. &#8220;&#8217;Tis unseemly.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the girls did not obey:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="firstline">&#8220;Ring out, you sonorous bell,</div>
<div class="verse">Awaken my father dear....&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And the Bride began, with a groan, to fall face down
on her knees, on her arms, and choked with tears.
She was led away at last, trembling, staggering, and
shrieking, to the cold summer half of the cottage, to
be dressed.</p>

<p>After that was done, Kuzma bestowed the blessing
on her. The bridegroom arrived with Vaska, Yakoff&#8217;s
son. The bridegroom had donned the latter&#8217;s boots;
his hair had been freshly clipped short; his neck, encircled
by the collar of a blue shirt with lace, had been
shaved to redness. He had washed himself with soap,
and appeared much younger; he was even not at all
ill looking, and, conscious of that fact, he had drooped
his dark eyelashes in dignified and modest fashion.</p>

<p>Vaska, his best man, in red shirt and knee-length
fur coat worn unbuttoned, with his hair close-cut, pock-marked,
robust, resembled a convict, as usual. He
entered, frowned, and darted a sidelong look at the
ceremonial girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that yowling!&#8221; he said roughly and peremptorily.
&#8220;Get out of here. Begone!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls answered him in chorus: &#8220;Without the
Trinity a house cannot be built, without four corners
the cottage cannot be roofed. Place a ruble at each
corner, a fifth ruble in the middle, and a bottle of
vodka.&#8221; Vaska pulled a bottle out of his pocket and
set it on the table. The girls took it and rose to their
feet. The crowd had become more dense than ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Once more the door flew open, once more there were
steam and cold. Odnodvorka entered, carrying a tinsel-adorned
holy picture and thrusting the people out
of her way, followed by the Bride in a blue dress with
a basque. Every one uttered an exclamation of
admiration, she was so pale, gentle, quiet, and lovely.
Vaska, with the back of his fist, administered a resounding
blow on the forehead of a broad-shouldered,
big-headed urchin whose legs were as crooked as those
of a dachshund; then he flung upon the straw in the
centre of the cottage some one&#8217;s old short fur coat.
Upon it the bride and groom were placed. Kuzma,
without lifting his head, took the holy picture from the
hands of Odnodvorka. It became so quiet that the
whistling breath of the inquisitive big-headed lad was
audible. Bride and bridegroom fell on their knees
simultaneously and bowed down to Kuzma&#8217;s feet.
They rose, and once more knelt down. Kuzma glanced
at the Bride; and in their eyes, which met for an instant,
there was a flash of horror. Kuzma turned
pale, said to himself in terror: &#8220;In another minute
I shall throw this holy picture on the floor.&#8221; But
his hands mechanically made the sign of the cross with
the ikona in the air; and the Bride, barely touching
her lips to it, fastened them on his hand and timidly
reached up to his lips. He thrust the holy picture
into the hands of some one beside him, grasped the
Bride&#8217;s head with paternal pain and tenderness, and,
as he kissed her new, fragrant headkerchief, burst into
sweet tears. Then, seeing nothing because of his tears,
he turned away and, thrusting the people out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
path, strode into the vestibule. It was already deserted.
The snow-laden wind beat in his face. The
snow-covered threshold shone white through the darkness.
The roof was humming. Beyond the threshold
an impenetrable blizzard was raging; and the snow,
falling out of the tiny window recesses from the sheer
weight of the drifts, hung like columns of smoke in
the air.</p>




<h3>XV</h3>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN morning came the blizzard was still
raging. In that grey whirling tempest
neither Durnovka nor the windmill on the
promontory was visible. Once in a while it grew
brighter, once in a while the light became like that at
nightfall. The orchard was all white, and its roar
mingled with the roar of the wind, in which one kept
imagining the peal of bells. The sharp-pointed
apexes of the snowdrifts were smoking. From the
porch, on which, with eyes screwed up, scenting athwart
the chill of the blizzard the savoury aroma from the
chimney of the servant&#8217;s wing, sat the watchdogs, all
coated with snow. Kuzma was barely able to make
out the dark, misty forms of the peasants, their horses,
sledges, the jingling of the sleighbells. Two horses
had been hitched to the bridegroom&#8217;s sledge; one horse
was allotted to that of the bride. The sledges were
covered with kazan felt lap robes with black patterns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
on the ends. The participants in the ceremonial procession
had girt themselves with sashes of divers hues.
The women, who had donned wadded coats and
wrapped their heads in shawls, walked to the sledges
circumspectly, taking tiny steps, ceremoniously remarking:
&#8220;Heavens, God&#8217;s daylight is not visible!&#8221;
Rarely was a woman garbed in her own clothes: everything
had been collected among the neighbours.
Accordingly, special caution was needed not to fall,
and they lifted their long skirts as high as possible.
The bride&#8217;s fur coat and her blue gown had been
turned up over her head, and she sat in the sledge
protected only by her white petticoat. Her head,
adorned with a small wreath of paper flowers, was
enveloped in undershawls. She had become so weak
from her weeping that she saw as in a dream the dark
figures through the blizzard, heard its roar, the conversation,
and the festive pealing of the small bells. The
horses laid their ears flat and tossed their muzzles from
side to side to escape the snow-laden gale; and it bore
away the chatter and the shouts of command, glued
eyes tightly together, whitened mustaches, beards, and
caps, and the groomsmen had difficulty in recognizing
one another in the darkness and gloom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh, damn it all!&#8221; exclaimed Vaska as he ducked
his head, gathered up the reins, and took his seat beside
the bridegroom. And he shouted roughly, indifferently,
into the teeth of the storm: &#8220;Messrs. boyars,
bestow your blessing on the bridegroom, that he may
go in search of his bride!&#8221;</p>

<p>Some one made answer: &#8220;May God bless him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>Then the sleighbells began to wail, the runners to
screech; the snowdrifts, as the runners cut through
them, turned to smoke and small whirlwinds; the forelocks,
manes, and tails of the horses were blown to
one side....</p>

<p>At the church-warden&#8217;s house in the village, where
they warmed themselves up while waiting for the priest,
all became well suffocated. In the church, also, there
was the odour of fire-gas, cold, and gloom, thanks to
the blizzard, the low ceilings, and the gratings in the
windows. Lighted candles were held only by the
bridegroom and the bride and in the hand of the
swarthy priest. He had big cheek-bones, and he bent
low over his book, which was all bespattered with wax-droppings,
and read hurriedly through his spectacles.
On the floor stood pools of water&mdash;much snow had
been brought in on their boots and bark-shoes. The
wind from the open door blew on their backs. The
priest glanced sternly now at the door, again at the
groom and bride&mdash;at their tense forms, prepared for
anything that might present itself; at their faces, congealed,
as it were, in obedience and submission,
illuminated from below by the golden gleam of
candles. From habit, he pronounced some words as
if he felt them, making them stand out apart from the
touching prayers; but in reality he was thinking not
at all of the words or of those to whom they were
applied.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;O God most pure, the Creator of every living
thing,&#8217;&#8221; he said hastily, now lowering, now raising
his voice. &#8220;&#8216;Thou who didst bless Thy servant Abraham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and, opening the womb of Sarah ... who didst
give Isaac unto Rebecca ... who didst join Jacob
unto Rachel ... vouchsafe unto these Thy servants....&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Name&mdash;?&#8221; he interrupted himself in a stern whisper,
without altering the expression of his countenance,
addressing the lay reader. And, having caught the
answer, &#8220;Denis, Avdotya,&#8221; he continued, with feeling:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Vouchsafe unto these Thy servants, Denis and
Evdokhia, a peaceful life, length of days, chastity ...
grant that they may behold their children&#8217;s children
... and give them of the dew of heaven from
on high.... Fill their houses with wheat and wine
and oil ... exhalt thou them like unto the cedars of
Lebanon....&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>But even if those who were present had listened
to him and understood, they would have been thinking
of the blizzard, the strange horses, the return home
through the twilight to Durnovka, Syery&#8217;s house&mdash;and
not of Abraham and Isaac. And they would have
grinned at comparing Deniska to a cedar of Lebanon.
And it was awkward for Deniska himself, his short
legs encased in borrowed boots, his body clad in an
old undercoat, to admit that the bride was taller than
he; it was awkward and terrible to bear on his motionless
head the imperial crown<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>&mdash;a huge brass crown
with a cross on top, resting far down on his very ears.
And the hand of the Bride, who looked more beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
and more lifeless than ever in her crown, trembled, and
the wax of the melting candle dripped down on the
flounce of her blue gown....</p>

<p>The return home was more comfortable. The
blizzard was even more terrible in the twilight, but
they were cheered by the consciousness that a burden
had been removed from their shoulders: whether for
good or for evil, the deed had been done. So they
whipped up their horses smartly, dashing ahead at
random, trusting solely to the ill-defined forms of
the small trees which marked out the road. And the
loud-mouthed wife of Vanka Krasny stood upright in
the leading sledge and danced, flourishing her handkerchief
and screeching to the gale, through the dark,
raging turmoil, through the snow which whipped
against her lips and drowned her wolf&#8217;s voice:</p>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
