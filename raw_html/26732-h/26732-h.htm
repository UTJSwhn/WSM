<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
MISS BOLTWOOD OF BROOKLYN IS LOST IN THE MUD</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When</span> the windshield was closed it became so
filmed with rain that Claire fancied she was
piloting a drowned car in dim spaces under the sea.
When it was open, drops jabbed into her eyes and
chilled her cheeks. She was excited and thoroughly
miserable. She realized that these Minnesota country
roads had no respect for her polite experience on Long
Island parkways. She felt like a woman, not like a
driver.</p>

<p>But the Gomez-Dep roadster had seventy horsepower,
and sang songs. Since she had left Minneapolis
nothing had passed her. Back yonder a truck
had tried to crowd her, and she had dropped into a
ditch, climbed a bank, returned to the road, and after
that the truck was not. Now she was regarding a
view more splendid than mountains above a garden
by the sea&mdash;a stretch of good road. To her passenger,
her father, Claire chanted:</p>

<p>"Heavenly! There's some gravel. We can make
time. We'll hustle on to the next town and get dry."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>"Yes. But don't mind me. You're doing very
well," her father sighed.</p>

<p>Instantly, the dismay of it rushing at her, she saw
the end of the patch of gravel. The road ahead was
a wet black smear, criss-crossed with ruts. The car
shot into a morass of prairie gumbo&mdash;which is mud
mixed with tar, fly-paper, fish glue, and well-chewed,
chocolate-covered caramels. When cattle get into
gumbo, the farmers send for the stump-dynamite and
try blasting.</p>

<p>It was her first really bad stretch of road. She
was frightened. Then she was too appallingly busy
to be frightened, or to be Miss Claire Boltwood, or
to comfort her uneasy father. She had to drive.
Her frail graceful arms put into it a vicious vigor
that was genius.</p>

<p>When the wheels struck the slime, they slid, they
wallowed. The car skidded. It was terrifyingly out
of control. It began majestically to turn toward the
ditch. She fought the steering wheel as though she
were shadow-boxing, but the car kept contemptuously
staggering till it was sideways, straight across the
road. Somehow, it was back again, eating into a
rut, going ahead. She didn't know how she had
done it, but she had got it back. She longed to take
time to retrace her own cleverness in steering. She
didn't. She kept going.</p>

<p>The car backfired, slowed. She yanked the gear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>from third into first. She sped up. The motor ran
like a terrified pounding heart, while the car crept
on by inches through filthy mud that stretched ahead
of her without relief.</p>

<p>She was battling to hold the car in the principal
rut. She snatched the windshield open, and concentrated
on that left rut. She felt that she was keeping
the wheel from climbing those high sides of the rut,
those six-inch walls of mud, sparkling with tiny grits.
Her mind snarled at her arms, "Let the ruts do the
steering. You're just fighting against them." It
worked. Once she let the wheels alone they comfortably
followed the furrows, and for three seconds
she had that delightful belief of every motorist after
every mishap, "Now that this particular disagreeableness
is over, I'll never, never have any trouble again!"</p>

<p>But suppose the engine overheated, ran out of
water? Anxiety twanged at her nerves. And the deep
distinctive ruts were changing to a complex pattern,
like the rails in a city switchyard. She picked out
the track of the one motor car that had been through
here recently. It was marked with the swastika tread
of the rear tires. That track was her friend; she
knew and loved the driver of a car she had never seen
in her life.</p>

<p>She was very tired. She wondered if she might
not stop for a moment. Then she came to an upslope.
The car faltered; felt indecisive beneath her. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
jabbed down the accelerator. Her hands pushed at
the steering wheel as though she were pushing the
car. The engine picked up, sulkily kept going. To
the eye, there was merely a rise in the rolling ground,
but to her anxiety it was a mountain up which she&mdash;not
the engine, but herself&mdash;pulled this bulky mass,
till she had reached the top, and was safe again&mdash;for a
second. Still there was no visible end of the mud.</p>

<p>In alarm she thought, "How long does it last? I
can't keep this up. I&mdash;Oh!"</p>

<p>The guiding tread of the previous car was suddenly
lost in a mass of heaving, bubble-scattered mud, like
a batter of black dough. She fairly picked up the car,
and flung it into that welter, through it, and back into
the reappearing swastika-marked trail.</p>

<p>Her father spoke: "You're biting your lips. They'll
bleed, if you don't look out. Better stop and rest."</p>

<p>"Can't! No bottom to this mud. Once stop and
lose momentum&mdash;stuck for keeps!"</p>

<p>She had ten more minutes of it before she reached
a combination of bridge and culvert, with a plank platform
above a big tile drain. With this solid plank
bottom, she could stop. Silence came roaring down as
she turned the switch. The bubbling water in the
radiator steamed about the cap. Claire was conscious
of tautness of the cords of her neck in front; of a pain
at the base of her brain. Her father glanced at her
curiously. "I must be a wreck. I'm sure my hair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
is frightful," she thought, but forgot it as she looked
at him. His face was unusually pale. In the tumult
of activity he had been betrayed into letting the old
despondent look blur his eyes and sag his mouth.
"Must get on," she determined.</p>

<p>Claire was dainty of habit. She detested untwisted
hair, ripped gloves, muddy shoes. Hesitant as a cat
by a puddle, she stepped down on the bridge. Even on
these planks, the mud was three inches thick. It
squidged about her low, spatted shoes. "Eeh!" she
squeaked.</p>

<p>She tiptoed to the tool-box and took out a folding
canvas bucket. She edged down to the trickling stream
below. She was miserably conscious of a pastoral
scene all gone to mildew&mdash;cows beneath willows by
the creek, milkweeds dripping, dried mullein weed
stalks no longer dry. The bank of the stream was so
slippery that she shot down two feet, and nearly went
sprawling. Her knee did touch the bank, and the
skirt of her gray sports-suit showed a smear of yellow
earth.</p>

<p>In less than two miles the racing motor had used
up so much water that she had to make four trips to
the creek before she had filled the radiator. When she
had climbed back on the running-board she glared
down at spats and shoes turned into gray lumps. She
was not tearful. She was angry.</p>

<p>"Idiot! Ought to have put on my rubbers. Well&mdash;too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
late now," she observed, as she started the
engine.</p>

<p>She again followed the swastika tread. To avoid
a hole in the road ahead, the unknown driver had
swung over to the side of the road, and taken to the
intensely black earth of the edge of an unfenced cornfield.
Flashing at Claire came the sight of a deep,
water-filled hole, scattered straw and brush, d&eacute;bris of
a battlefield, which made her gaspingly realize that her
swastikaed leader had been stuck and&mdash;</p>

<p>And instantly her own car was stuck.</p>

<p>She had had to put the car at that hole. It dropped,
far down, and it stayed down. The engine stalled.
She started it, but the back wheels spun merrily round
and round, without traction. She did not make one
inch. When she again killed the blatting motor, she
let it stay dead. She peered at her father.</p>

<p>He was not a father, just now, but a passenger trying
not to irritate the driver. He smiled in a waxy
way, and said, "Hard luck! Well, you did the best
you could. The other hole, there in the road, would
have been just as bad. You're a fine driver, dolly."</p>

<p>Her smile was warm and real. "No. I'm a fool.
You told me to put on chains. I didn't. I deserve it."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, most men would be cussing. You
acquire merit by not beating me. I believe that's
done, in moments like this. If you'd like, I'll get out
and crawl around in the mud, and play turtle for you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>"No. I'm quite all right. I did feel frightfully
strong-minded as long as there was any use of it. It
kept me going. But now I might just as well be
cheerful, because we're stuck, and we're probably going
to stay stuck for the rest of this care-free summer
day."</p>

<p>The weariness of the long strain caught her, all at
once. She slipped forward, sat huddled, her knees
crossed under the edge of the steering wheel, her
hands falling beside her, one of them making a faint
brushing sound as it slid down the upholstery. Her
eyes closed; as her head drooped farther, she fancied
she could hear the vertebrae click in her tense neck.</p>

<p>Her father was silent, a misty figure in a lap-robe.
The rain streaked the mica lights in the side-curtains.
A distant train whistled desolately across the sodden
fields. The inside of the car smelled musty. The
quiet was like a blanket over the ears. Claire was in
a hazy drowse. She felt that she could never drive
again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
CLAIRE ESCAPES FROM RESPECTABILITY</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Claire Boltwood</span> lived on the Heights,
Brooklyn. Persons from New York and other
parts of the Middlewest have been known to believe
that Brooklyn is somehow humorous. In newspaper
jokes and vaudeville it is so presented that people
who are willing to take their philosophy from those
sources believe that the leading citizens of Brooklyn
are all deacons, undertakers, and obstetricians. The
fact is that North Washington Square, at its reddest
and whitest and fanlightedest, Gramercy Park at its
most ivied, are not so aristocratic as the section of
Brooklyn called the Heights. Here preached Henry
Ward Beecher. Here, in mansions like mausoleums,
on the ridge above docks where the good ships came
sailing in from Sourabaya and Singapore, ruled the
lords of a thousand sails. And still is it a place of
wealth too solid to emulate the nimble self-advertising
of Fifth Avenue. Here dwell the fifth-generation
possessors of blocks of foundries and shipyards.
Here, in a big brick house of much dignity, much
ugliness, and much conservatory, lived Claire Boltwood,
with her widower father.</p>

<p>Henry B. Boltwood was vice-president of a firm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
dealing in railway supplies. He was neither wealthy
nor at all poor. Every summer, despite Claire's delicate
hints, they took the same cottage on the Jersey
Coast, and Mr. Boltwood came down for Sunday.
Claire had gone to a good school out of Philadelphia,
on the Main Line. She was used to gracious leisure,
attractive uselessness, nut-center chocolates, and a
certain wonder as to why she was alive.</p>

<p>She wanted to travel, but her father could not get
away. He consistently spent his days in overworking,
and his evenings in wishing he hadn't overworked.
He was attractive, fresh, pink-cheeked, white-mustached,
and nerve-twitching with years of detail.</p>

<p>Claire's ambition had once been babies and a solid
husband, but as various young males of the species
appeared before her, sang their mating songs and
preened their newly dry-cleaned plumage, she found
that the trouble with solid young men was that they
were solid. Though she liked to dance, the "dancing
men" bored her. And she did not understand the
district's quota of intellectuals very well; she was
good at listening to symphony concerts, but she never
had much luck in discussing the cleverness of the
wood winds in taking up the main motif. It is history
that she refused a master of arts with an old violin,
a good taste in ties, and an income of eight thousand.</p>

<p>The only man who disturbed her was Geoffrey
Saxton, known throughout the interwoven sets of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Brooklyn Heights as "Jeff." Jeff Saxton was thirty-nine
to Claire's twenty-three. He was clean and
busy; he had no signs of vice or humor. Especially
for Jeff must have been invented the symbolic morning
coat, the unwrinkable gray trousers, and the moral
rimless spectacles. He was a graduate of a nice college,
and he had a nice tenor and a nice family and
nice hands and he was nicely successful in New York
copper dealing. When he was asked questions by
people who were impertinent, clever, or poor, Jeff
looked them over coldly before he answered, and often
they felt so uncomfortable that he didn't have to
answer.</p>

<p>The boys of Claire's own age, not long out of Yale
and Princeton, doing well in business and jumping for
their evening clothes daily at six-thirty, light o' loves
and admirers of athletic heroes, these lads Claire
found pleasant, but hard to tell apart. She didn't
have to tell Jeff Saxton apart. He did his own telling.
Jeff called&mdash;not too often. He sang&mdash;not too sentimentally.
He took her father and herself to the
theater&mdash;not too lavishly. He told Claire&mdash;in a voice
not too serious&mdash;that she was his helmed Athena, his
rose of all the world. He informed her of his substantial
position&mdash;not too obviously. And he was so
everlastingly, firmly, quietly, politely, immovably
always there.</p>

<p>She watched the hulk of marriage drifting down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
on her frail speed-boat of aspiration, and steered in
desperate circles.</p>

<p>Then her father got the nervous prostration he had
richly earned. The doctor ordered rest. Claire took
him in charge. He didn't want to travel. Certainly
he didn't want the shore or the Adirondacks. As
there was a branch of his company in Minneapolis, she
lured him that far away.</p>

<p>Being rootedly of Brooklyn Heights, Claire didn't
know much about the West. She thought that Milwaukee
was the capital of Minnesota. She was not so
uninformed as some of her friends, however. She had
heard that in Dakota wheat was to be viewed in vast
tracts&mdash;maybe a hundred acres.</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood could not be coaxed to play with the
people to whom his Minneapolis representative introduced
him. He was overworking again, and perfectly
happy. He was hoping to find something wrong with
the branch house. Claire tried to tempt him out to
the lakes. She failed. His nerve-fuse burnt out the
second time, with much fireworks.</p>

<p>Claire had often managed her circle of girls, but it
had never occurred to her to manage her executive
father save by indirect and pretty teasing. Now, in
conspiracy with the doctor, she bullied her father.
He saw gray death waiting as alternative, and he was
meek. He agreed to everything. He consented to
drive with her across two thousand miles of plains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and mountains to Seattle, to drop in for a call on their
cousins, the Eugene Gilsons.</p>

<p>Back East they had a chauffeur and two cars&mdash;the
limousine, and the Gomez-Deperdussin roadster,
Claire's beloved. It would, she believed, be more of a
change from everything that might whisper to Mr.
Boltwood of the control of men, not to take a chauffeur.
Her father never drove, but she could, she insisted.
His easy agreeing was pathetic. He watched
her with spaniel eyes. They had the Gomez roadster
shipped to them from New York.</p>

<p>On a July morning, they started out of Minneapolis
in a mist, and as it has been hinted, they stopped sixty
miles northward, in a rain, also in much gumbo. Apparently
their nearest approach to the Pacific Ocean
would be this oceanically moist edge of a cornfield,
between Schoenstrom and Gopher Prairie, Minnesota.</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>Claire roused from her damp doze and sighed,
"Well, I must get busy and get the car out of this."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you'd better get somebody to
help us?"</p>

<p>"But get who?"</p>

<p>"Whom!"</p>

<p>"No! It's just 'who,' when you're in the mud.
No. One of the good things about an adventure like
this is that I must do things for myself. I've always
had people to do things for me. Maids and nice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
teachers and you, old darling! I suppose it's made
me soft. Soft&mdash;I would like a soft davenport and
a novel and a pound of almond-brittle, and get all sick,
and not feel so beastly virile as I do just now.
But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned up the collar of her gray tweed coat,
painfully climbed out&mdash;the muscles of her back racking&mdash;and
examined the state of the rear wheels.
They were buried to the axle; in front of them the
mud bulked in solid, shiny blackness. She took out
her jack and chains. It was too late. There was no
room to get the jack under the axle. She remembered
from the narratives of motoring friends that brush
in mud gave a firmer surface for the wheels to climb
upon.</p>

<p>She also remembered how jolly and agreeably
heroic the accounts of their mishaps had sounded&mdash;a
week after they were over.</p>

<p>She waded down the road toward an old wood-lot.
At first she tried to keep dry, but she gave it up, and
there was pleasure in being defiantly dirty. She
tramped straight through puddles; she wallowed in
mud. In the wood-lot was long grass which soaked
her stockings till her ankles felt itchy. Claire had
never expected to be so very intimate with a brush-pile.
She became so. As though she were a pioneer
woman who had been toiling here for years, she came
to know the brush stick by stick&mdash;the long valuable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
branch that she could never quite get out from under
the others; the thorny bough that pricked her hands
every time she tried to reach the curious bundle of
switches.</p>

<p>Seven trips she made, carrying armfuls of twigs
and solemnly dragging large boughs behind her. She
patted them down in front of all four wheels. Her
crisp hands looked like the paws of a three-year-old
boy making a mud fort. Her nails hurt from the mud
wedged beneath them. Her mud-caked shoes were
heavy to lift. It was with exquisite self-approval that
she sat on the running-board, scraped a car-load of
lignite off her soles, climbed back into the car, punched
the starter.</p>

<p>The car stirred, crept forward one inch, and settled
back&mdash;one inch. The second time it heaved encouragingly
but did not make quite so much headway.
Then Claire did sob.</p>

<p>She rubbed her cheek against the comfortable,
rough, heather-smelling shoulder of her father's coat,
while he patted her and smiled, "Good girl! I better
get out and help."</p>

<p>She sat straight, shook her head. "Nope. I'll do
it. And I'm not going to insist on being heroic any
longer. I'll get a farmer to pull us out."</p>

<p>As she let herself down into the ooze, she reflected
that all farmers have hearts of gold, anatomical
phenomena never found among the snobs and hirelings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of New York. The nearest heart of gold was presumably
beating warmly in the house a quarter of a
mile ahead.</p>

<p>She came up a muddy lane to a muddy farmyard,
with a muddy cur yapping at her wet legs, and geese
hissing in a pool of purest mud serene. The house
was small and rather old. It may have been painted
once. The barn was large and new. It had been
painted very much, and in a blinding red with white
trimmings. There was no brass plate on the house,
but on the barn, in huge white letters, was the legend,
"Adolph Zolzac, 1913."</p>

<p>She climbed by log steps to a narrow frame back
porch littered with parts of a broken cream-separator.
She told herself that she was simple and friendly in
going to the back door instead of the front, and it was
with gaiety that she knocked on the ill-jointed screen
door, which flapped dismally in response.</p>

<p>"<i>Ja?</i>" from within.</p>

<p>She rapped again.</p>

<p>"<i>Hinein!</i>"</p>

<p>She opened the door on a kitchen, the highlight of
which was a table heaped with dishes of dumplings
and salt pork. A shirt-sleeved man, all covered with
mustache and calm, sat by the table, and he kept right
on sitting as he inquired:</p>

<p>"Vell?"</p>

<p>"My car&mdash;my automobile&mdash;has been stuck in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mud. A bad driver, I'm afraid! I wonder if you
would be so good as to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I usually get t'ree dollars, but I dunno as I vant
to do it for less than four. Today I ain'd feelin' very
goot," grumbled the golden-hearted.</p>

<p>Claire was aware that a woman whom she had not
noticed&mdash;so much smaller than the dumplings, so much
less vigorous than the salt pork was she&mdash;was speaking:
"<i>Aber</i>, papa, dot's a shame you sharge de poor
young lady dot, when she drive by <i>sei</i> self. Vot she
t'ink of de Sherman people?"</p>

<p>The farmer merely grunted. To Claire, "Yuh,
four dollars. Dot's what I usually charge sometimes."</p>

<p>"Usually? Do you mean to say that you leave
that hole there in the road right along&mdash;that people
keep on trying to avoid it and get stuck as I was?
Oh! If I were an official&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vell, I dunno, I don't guess I run my place to
suit you smart alecks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Papa! How you talk on the young lady! Make
shame!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;from the city. If you don't like it, you stay
<i>bei</i> Mineapolis! I haul you out for t'ree dollars and
a half. Everybody pay dot. Last mont' I make forty-five
dollars. They vos all glad to pay. They say I
help them fine. I don't see vot you're kickin' about!
Oh, these vimmins!"</p>

<p>"It's blackmail! I wouldn't pay it, if it weren't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
for my father sitting waiting out there. But&mdash;go
ahead. Hurry!"</p>

<p>She sat tapping her toe while Zolzac completed the
stertorous task of hogging the dumplings, then
stretched, yawned, scratched, and covered his merely
dirty garments with overalls that were apparently
woven of processed mud. When he had gone to the
barn for his team, his wife came to Claire. On her
drained face were the easy tears of the slave women.</p>

<p>"Oh, miss, I don't know vot I should do. My boys
go on the public school, and they speak American just
so goot as you. Oh, I vant man lets me luff America.
But papa he says it is an <i>Unsinn</i>; you got the money,
he says, nobody should care if you are American or
Old Country people. I should vish I could ride once
in an automobile! But&mdash;I am so 'shamed, so 'shamed
that I must sit and see my <i>Mann</i> make this. Forty
years I been married to him, and pretty soon I
die&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Claire patted her hand. There was nothing to say
to tragedy that had outlived hope.</p>

<p>Adolph Zolzac clumped out to the highroad behind
his vast, rolling-flanked horses&mdash;so much cleaner and
better fed than his wisp of a wife. Claire followed
him, and in her heart she committed murder and was
glad of it. While Mr. Boltwood looked out with mild
wonder at Claire's new friend, Zolzac hitched his team
to the axle. It did not seem possible that two horses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
could pull out the car where seventy horsepower had
fainted. But, easily, yawning and thinking about dinner,
the horses drew the wheels up on the mud-bank,
out of the hole and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The harness broke, with a flying mess of straps and
rope, and the car plumped with perfect exactness back
into its bed.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
A YOUNG MAN IN A RAINCOAT</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Huh</span>! Such an auto! Look, it break my harness
a'ready! Two dollar that cost you to
mend it. De auto iss too heavy!" stormed Zolzac.</p>

<p>"All right! All right! Only for heaven's sake&mdash;go
get another harness!" Claire shrieked.</p>

<p>"Fife-fifty dot will be, in all." Zolzac grinned.</p>

<p>Claire was standing in front of him. She was
thinking of other drivers, poor people, in old cars,
who had been at the mercy of this golden-hearted one.
She stared past him, in the direction from which she
had come. Another motor was in sight.</p>

<p>It was a tin beetle of a car; that agile, cheerful, rut-jumping
model known as a "bug"; with a home-tacked,
home-painted tin cowl and tail covering the
stripped chassis of a little cheap Teal car. The lone
driver wore an old black raincoat with an atrocious
corduroy collar, and a new plaid cap in the Harry
Lauder tartan. The bug skipped through mud where
the Boltwoods' Gomez had slogged and rolled. Its
pilot drove up behind her car, and leaped out. He
trotted forward to Claire and Zolzac. His eyes were
twenty-seven or eight, but his pink cheeks were twenty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and when he smiled&mdash;shyly, radiantly&mdash;he was no age
at all, but eternal boy. Claire had a blurred impression
that she had seen him before, some place along
the road.</p>

<p>"Stuck?" he inquired, not very intelligently.
"How much is Adolph charging you?"</p>

<p>"He wants three-fifty, and his harness broke, and
he wants two dollars&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! So he's still working that old gag! I've
heard all about Adolph. He keeps that harness for
pulling out cars, and it always busts. The last time,
though, he only charged six bits to get it mended.
Now let me reason with him."</p>

<p>The young man turned with vicious quickness, and
for the first time Claire heard pidgin German&mdash;German
as it is spoken between Americans who have
never learned it, and Germans who have forgotten it:</p>

<p>"<i>Schon sex</i> hundred times <i>Ich h&ouml;re</i> all about the
way you been doing autos, Zolzac, you <i>verfluchter
Schweinhund</i>, and I'll set the sheriff on you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dot ain'd true, maybe <i>einmal die Woche kommt</i>
somebody and <i>Ich muss die Arbeit immer lassen und
in die Regen ausgehen, und seh' mal</i> how <i>die</i> boots
<i>sint mit</i> mud covered, two dollars it don't pay for <i>die</i>
boots&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now that's enough-plenty out of you, <i>seien die</i>
boots <i>verdammt</i>, and <i>mach' dass du fort gehst</i>&mdash;muddy
boots, hell!&mdash;put <i>mal ein</i> egg in <i>die</i> boots and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
beat it, <i>verleicht</i> maybe I'll by golly arrest you myself,
<i>weiss du</i>! I'm a special deputy sheriff."</p>

<p>The young man stood stockily. He seemed to
swell as his somewhat muddy hand was shaken directly
at, under, and about the circumference of, Adolph
Zolzac's hairy nose. The farmer was stronger, but
he retreated. He took up the reins. He whined,
"Don't I get nothing I break de harness?"</p>

<p>"Sure. You get ten&mdash;years! And you get out!"</p>

<p>From thirty yards up the road, Zolzac flung back,
"You t'ink you're pretty damn smart!" That was
his last serious reprisal.</p>

<p>Clumsily, as one not used to it, the young man
lifted his cap to Claire, showing straight, wiry, rope-colored
hair, brushed straight back from a rather fine
forehead. "Gee, I was sorry to have to swear and
holler like that, but it's all Adolph understands.
Please don't think there's many of the folks around
here like him. They say he's the meanest man in the
county."</p>

<p>"I'm immensely grateful to you, but&mdash;do you know
much about motors? How can I get out of this
mud?"</p>

<p>She was surprised to see the youngster blush. His
clear skin flooded. His engaging smile came again,
and he hesitated, "Let me pull you out."</p>

<p>She looked from her hulking car to his mechanical
flea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>He answered the look: "I can do it all right. I'm
used to the gumbo&mdash;regular mud-hen. Just add my
power to yours. Have you a tow-rope?"</p>

<p>"No. I never thought of bringing one."</p>

<p>"I'll get mine."</p>

<p>She walked with him back toward his bug. It
lacked not only top and side-curtains, but even windshield
and running-board. It was a toy&mdash;a card-board
box on toothpick axles. Strapped to the bulging back
was a wicker suitcase partly covered by tarpaulin.
From the seat peered a little furry face.</p>

<p>"A cat?" she exclaimed, as he came up with a
wire rope, extracted from the tin back.</p>

<p>"Yes. She's the captain of the boat. I'm just the
engineer."</p>

<p>"What is her name?"</p>

<p>Before he answered the young man strode ahead to
the front of her car, Claire obediently trotting after
him. He stooped to look at her front axle. He
raised his head, glanced at her, and he was blushing again.</p>

<p>"Her name is Vere de Vere!" he confessed. Then
he fled back to his bug. He drove it in front of the
Gomez-Dep. The hole in the road itself was as deep
as the one on the edge of the cornfield, where she
was stuck, but he charged it. She was fascinated by
his skill. Where she would for a tenth of a second
have hesitated while choosing the best course, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hurled the bug straight at the hole, plunged through
with sheets of glassy black water arching on either
side, then viciously twisted the car to the right, to
the left, and straight again, as he followed the tracks
with the solidest bottoms.</p>

<p>Strapped above the tiny angle-iron step which replaced
his running-board was an old spade. He dug
channels in front of the four wheels of her car, so
that they might go up inclines, instead of pushing
against the straight walls of mud they had thrown up.
On these inclines he strewed the brush she had brought,
halting to ask, with head alertly lifted from his
stooped huddle in the mud, "Did you have to get this
brush yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Horrid wet!"</p>

<p>He merely shook his head in commiseration.</p>

<p>He fastened the tow-rope to the rear axle of his
car, to the front of hers. "Now will you be ready to
put on all your power as I begin to pull?" he said
casually, rather respectfully.</p>

<p>When the struggling bug had pulled the wire rope
taut, she opened the throttle. The rope trembled. Her
car seemed to draw sullenly back. Then it came out&mdash;out&mdash;really
out, which is the most joyous sensation
any motorist shall ever know. In excitement over
actually moving again, as fast as any healthy young
snail, she drove on, on, the young man ahead grinning
back at her. Nor did she stop, nor he, till both cars<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
were safe on merely thick mud, a quarter of a mile
away.</p>

<p>She switched off the power&mdash;and suddenly she was
in a whirlwind of dizzy sickening tiredness. Even
in her abandonment to exhaustion she noticed that the
young man did not stare at her but, keeping his back
to her, removed the tow-rope, and stowed it away in
his bug. She wondered whether it was tact or yokelish
indifference.</p>

<p>Her father spoke for the first time since the Galahad
of the tin bug had come: "How much do you think
we ought to give this fellow?"</p>

<p>Now of all the cosmic problems yet unsolved, not
cancer nor the future of poverty are the flustering
questions, but these twain: Which is worse, not to
wear evening clothes at a party at which you find
every one else dressed, or to come in evening clothes
to a house where, it proves, they are never worn?
And: Which is worse, not to tip when a tip has been
expected; or to tip, when the tip is an insult?</p>

<p>In discomfort of spirit and wetness of ankles Claire
shuddered, "Oh dear, I don't believe he expects us
to pay him. He seems like an awfully independent
person. Maybe we'd offend him if we offered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The only reasonable thing to be offended at in this
vale of tears is not being offered money!"</p>

<p>"Just the same&mdash;&mdash; Oh dear, I'm so tired. But
good little Claire will climb out and be diplomatic."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>She pinched her forehead, to hold in her cracking
brain, and wabbled out into new scenes of mud and
wetness, but she came up to the young man with the
most rain-washed and careless of smiles. "Won't
you come back and meet my father? He's terribly
grateful to you&mdash;as I am. And may we&mdash;&mdash; You've
worked so hard, and about saved our lives. May I
pay you for that labor? We're really much indebted&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't anything. Tickled to death if I
could help you."</p>

<p>He heartily shook hands with her father, and he
droned, "Pleased to meet you, Mr. Uh."</p>

<p>"Boltwood."</p>

<p>"Mr. Boltwood. My name is Milt&mdash;Milton Daggett.
See you have a New York license on your car.
We don't see but mighty few of those through here.
Glad I could help you."</p>

<p>"Ah yes, Mr. Daggett." Mr. Boltwood was uninterestedly
fumbling in his money pocket. Behind
Milt Daggett, Claire shook her head wildly, rattling
her hands as though she were playing castanets. Mr.
Boltwood shrugged. He did not understand. His
relations with young men in cheap raincoats were
entirely monetary. They did something for you, and
you paid them&mdash;preferably not too much&mdash;and they
ceased to be. Whereas Milt Daggett respectfully but
stolidly continued to be, and Mr. Henry Boltwood's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
own daughter was halting the march of affairs by asking
irrelevant questions:</p>

<p>"Didn't we see you back in&mdash;what was that village
we came through back about twelve miles?"</p>

<p>"Schoenstrom?" suggested Milt.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that was it. Didn't we pass you or
something? We stopped at a garage there, to change
a tire."</p>

<p>"I don't think so. I was in town, though, this
morning. Say, uh, did you and your father grab any
eats&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean, did you get dinner there?"</p>

<p>"No. I wish we had!"</p>

<p>"Well say, I didn't either, and&mdash;I'd be awfully glad
if you folks would have something to eat with me
now."</p>

<p>Claire tried to give him a smile, but the best she
could do was to lend him one. She could not associate
interesting food with Milt and his mud-slobbered, tin-covered,
dun-painted Teal bug. He seemed satisfied
with her dubious grimace. By his suggestion they
drove ahead to a spot where the cars could be parked
on firm grass beneath oaks. On the way, Mr. Boltwood
lifted his voice in dismay. His touch of nervous
prostration had not made him queer or violent; he
retained a touching faith in good food.</p>

<p>"We might find some good little hotel and have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
some chops and just some mushrooms and peas,"
insisted the man from Brooklyn Heights.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't suppose the country hotels are really
so awfully good," she speculated. "And look&mdash;that
nice funny boy. We couldn't hurt his feelings. He's
having so much fun out of being a Good Samaritan."</p>

<p>From the mysterious rounded back of his car Milt
Daggett drew a tiny stove, to be heated by a can of
solidified alcohol, a frying pan that was rather large
for dolls but rather small for square-fingered hands,
a jar of bacon, eggs in a bag, a coffee pot, a can of
condensed milk, and a litter of unsorted tin plates
and china cups. While, by his request, Claire scoured
the plates and cups, he made bacon and eggs and coffee,
the little stove in the bottom of his car sheltered
by the cook's bending over it. The smell of food made
Claire forgiving toward the fact that she was wet
through; that the rain continued to drizzle down her
neck.</p>

<p>He lifted his hand and demanded, "Take your
shoes off!"</p>

<p>"Uh?"</p>

<p>He gulped. He stammered, "I mean&mdash;I mean your
shoes are soaked through. If you'll sit in the car, I'll
put your shoes up by the engine. It's pretty well
heated from racing it in the mud. You can get your
stockings dry under the cowl."</p>

<p>She was amused by the elaborateness with which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
didn't glance at her while she took off her low shoes
and slipped her quite too thin black stockings under
the protecting tin cowl. She reflected, "He has such
a nice, awkward gentleness. But such bad taste!
They're really quite good ankles. Apparently ankles
are not done, in Teal bug circles. His sisters don't
even have limbs. But do fairies have sisters? He is
a fairy. When I'm out of the mud he'll turn his raincoat
into a pair of lordly white wings, and vanish.
But what will become of the cat?"</p>

<p>Thus her tired brain, like a squirrel in a revolving
cage, while she sat primly and scraped at a clot of rust
on a tin plate and watched him put on the bacon and
eggs. Wondering if cats were used for this purpose
in the Daggett family, she put soaked, unhappy Vere
de Vere on her feet, to her own great comfort and the
cat's delight. It was an open car, and the rain still
rained, and a strange young man was a foot from her
tending the not very crackly fire, but rarely had Claire
felt so domestic.</p>

<p>Milt was apparently struggling to say something.
After several bobs of his head he ventured, "You're
so wet! I'd like for you to take my raincoat."</p>

<p>"No! Really! I'm already soaked through. You
keep dry."</p>

<p>He was unhappy about it. He plucked at a button
of the coat. She turned him from the subject. "I
hope Lady Vere de Vere is getting warm, too."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>"Seems to be. She's kind of demanding. She
wanted a little car of her own, but I didn't think
she could keep up with me, not on a long
hike."</p>

<p>"A little car? With her paws on the tiny wheel?
Oh&mdash;sweet! Are you going far, Mr. Daggett?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite a ways. To Seattle, Washington."</p>

<p>"Oh, really? Extraordinary. We're going there,
too."</p>

<p>"Honest? You driving all the way? Oh, no, of
course your father&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, he doesn't drive. By the way, I hope he isn't
too miserable back there."</p>

<p>"I'll be darned. Both of us going to Seattle.
That's what they call a coincidence, isn't it! Hope
I'll see you on the road, some time. But I don't suppose
I will. Once you're out of the mud, your Gomez
will simply lose my Teal."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. You're the better driver. And
I shall take it easy. Are you going to stay long in
Seattle?" It was not merely a polite dinner-payment
question. She wondered; she could not place this
fresh-cheeked, unworldly young man so far from his
home.</p>

<p>"Why, I kind of hope&mdash;&mdash; Government railroad,
Alaska. I'm going to try to get in on that, somehow.
I've never been out of Minnesota in my life, but there's
couple mountains and oceans and things I thought I'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
like to see, so I just put my suitcase and Vere de Vere
in the machine, and started out. I burn distillate
instead of gas, so it doesn't cost much. If I ever happen
to have five whole dollars, why, I might go on to
Japan!"</p>

<p>"That would be jolly."</p>

<p>"Though I s'pose I'd have to eat&mdash;what is it?&mdash;pickled
fish? There's a woman from near my town
went to the Orient as a missionary. From what she
says, I guess all you need in Japan to make a house
is a bottle of mucilage and a couple of old newspapers
and some two-by-fours. And you can have the house
on a purple mountain, with cherry trees down below,
and&mdash;&mdash;" He put his clenched hand to his lips. His
head was bowed. "And the ocean! Lord! The
ocean! And we'll see it at Seattle. Bay, anyway.
And steamers there&mdash;just come from India! Huh!
Getting pretty darn poetic here! Eggs are done."</p>

<p>The young man did not again wander into visions.
He was all briskness as he served her bacon and eggs,
took a plate of them to Mr. Boltwood in the Gomez,
gouged into his own. Having herself scoured the tin
plates, Claire was not repulsed by their naked tinniness;
and the coffee in the broken-handled china cup
was tolerable. Milt drank from the top of a vacuum
bottle. He was silent. Immediately after the lunch
he stowed the things away. Claire expected a drawn-out,
tact-demanding farewell, but he climbed into his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
bug, said "Good-by, Miss Boltwood. Good luck!"
and was gone.</p>

<p>The rainy road was bleakly empty without him.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible that Claire's body could be
nagged into going on any longer. Her muscles were
relaxed, her nerves frayed. But the moment the
Gomez started, she discovered that magic change
which every long-distance motorist knows. Instantly
she was alert, seemingly able to drive forever. The
pilot's instinct ruled her; gave her tireless eyes and
sturdy hands. Surely she had never been weary;
never would be, so long as it was hers to keep the car
going.</p>

<p>She had driven perhaps six miles when she reached
a hamlet called St. Klopstock. On the bedraggled
mud-and-shanty main street a man was loading
crushed rock into a truck. By him was a large person
in a prosperous raincoat, who stepped out, held up his
hand. Claire stopped.</p>

<p>"You the young lady that got stuck in that hole by
Adolph Zolzac's?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And Mr. Zolzac wasn't very nice about it."</p>

<p>"He's going to be just elegant about it, now, and
there ain't going to be any more hole. I think Adolph
has been keeping it muddy&mdash;throwing in soft dirt&mdash;and
he made a good and plenty lot out of pulling out
tourists. Bill and I are going down right now and
fill it up with stone. Milt Daggett come through here&mdash;he's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
got a nerve, that fellow, but I did have to laugh&mdash;he
says to me, 'Barney&mdash;&mdash;' This was just now.
He hasn't more than just drove out of town. He
said to me, 'Barney,' he says, 'you're the richest
man in this township, and the banker, and you got
a big car y'self, and you think you're one whale of
a political boss,' he says, 'and yet you let that Zolzac
maintain a private ocean, against the peace and damn
horrible inconvenience of the Commonwealth of Minnesota&mdash;&mdash;'
He's got a great line of talk, that fellow.
He told me how you got stuck&mdash;made me so ashamed&mdash;I
been to New York myself&mdash;and right away I got
Bill, and we're going down and hold a donation and
surprise party on Adolph and fill that hole."</p>

<p>"But won't Adolph dig it out again?"</p>

<p>The banker was puffy, but his eyes were of stone.
From the truck he took a shotgun. He drawled, "In
that case, the surprise party will include an elegant
wake."</p>

<p>"But how did&mdash;&mdash; Who is this extraordinary Milt
Daggett?"</p>

<p>"Him? Oh, nobody 'specially. He's just a fellow
down here at Schoenstrom. But we all know him.
Goes to all the dances, thirty miles around. Thing
about him is: if he sees something wrong, he picks out
some poor fellow like me, and says what he thinks."</p>

<p>Claire drove on. She was aware that she was looking
for Milt's bug. It was not in sight.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>"Father," she exclaimed, "do you realize that this
lad didn't tell us he was going to have the hole filled?
Just did it. He frightens me. I'm afraid that when
we reach Gopher Prairie for the night, we'll find he
has engaged for us the suite that Prince Collars and
Cuffs once slept in."</p>

<p>"Hhhhmm," yawned her father.</p>

<p>"Curious young man. He said, 'Pleased to meet
you.'"</p>

<p>"Huuuuhhm! Fresh air makes me so sleepy."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;&mdash; Fooled you! Got through that mudhole,
anyway! And he said&mdash;&mdash; Look! Fields stretch out
so here, and not a tree except the willow-groves round
those farmhouses. And he said 'Gee' so many times,
and 'dinner' for the noon meal. And his nails&mdash;&mdash; No,
I suppose he really is just a farm youngster."</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood did not answer. His machine-finish
smile indicated an enormous lack of interest in young
men in Teal bugs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
A ROOM WITHOUT</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Gopher Prairie</span> has all of five thousand
people. Its commercial club asserts that it has
at least a thousand more population and an infinitely
better band than the ridiculously envious neighboring
town of Joralemon. But there were few signs that
a suite had been engaged for the Boltwoods, or that
Prince Collars and Cuffs had on his royal tour of
America spent much time in Gopher Prairie. Claire
reached it somewhat before seven. She gaped at it in
a hazy way. Though this was her first prairie town
for a considerable stay, she could not pump up interest.</p>

<p>The state of mind of the touring motorist entering
a strange place at night is as peculiar and definite as
that of a prospector. It is compounded of gratitude
at having got safely in; of perception of a new town,
yet with all eagerness about new things dulled by
weariness; of hope that there is going to be a good
hotel, but small expectation&mdash;and absolutely no probability&mdash;that
there really will be one.</p>

<p>Claire had only a blotched impression of peaked
wooden buildings and squatty brick stores with faded
awnings; of a red grain elevator and a crouching station
and a lumberyard; then of the hopelessly muddy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
road leading on again into the country. She felt that
if she didn't stop at once, she would miss the town
entirely. The driving-instinct sustained her, made
her take corners sharply, spot a garage, send the
Gomez whirling in on the cement floor.</p>

<p>The garage attendant looked at her and yawned.</p>

<p>"Where do you want the car?" Claire asked
sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, stick it in that stall," grunted the man, and
turned his back.</p>

<p>Claire glowered at him. She thought of a good
line about rudeness. But&mdash;oh, she was too tired to
fuss. She tried to run the car into the empty stall,
which was not a stall, but a space, like a missing
tooth, between two cars, and so narrow that she was
afraid of crumpling the lordly fenders of the Gomez.
She ran down the floor, returned with a flourish,
thought she was going to back straight into the stall&mdash;and
found she wasn't. While her nerves shrieked, and
it did not seem possible that she could change gears,
she managed to get the Gomez behind a truck and
side-on to the stall.</p>

<p>"Go forward again, and cramp your wheel&mdash;sharp!"
ordered the garage man.</p>

<p>Claire wanted to outline what she thought of him,
but she merely demanded, "Will you kindly drive
it in?"</p>

<p>"Why, sure. You bet," said the man casually.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
His readiness ruined her inspired fury. She was
somewhat disappointed.</p>

<p>As she climbed out of the car and put a hand on
the smart bags strapped on a running-board, the accumulated
weariness struck her in a shock. She could
have driven on for hours, but the instant the car was
safe for the night, she went to pieces. Her ears rang,
her eyes were soaked in fire, her mouth was dry, the
back of her neck pinched. It was her father who took
the lead as they rambled to the one tolerable hotel in
the town.</p>

<p>In the hotel Claire was conscious of the ugliness
of the poison-green walls and brass cuspidors and
insurance calendars and bare floor of the office; conscious
of the interesting scientific fact that all air had
been replaced by the essence of cigar smoke and cooking
cabbage; of the stares of the traveling men lounging
in bored lines; and of the lack of welcome on the
part of the night clerk, an oldish, bleached man with
whiskers instead of a collar.</p>

<p>She tried to be important: "Two rooms with bath,
please."</p>

<p>The bleached man stared at her, and shoved forward
the register and a pen clotted with ink. She signed.
He took the bags, led the way to the stairs. Anxiously
she asked, "Both rooms are with bath?"</p>

<p>From the second step the night clerk looked down
at her as though she were a specimen that ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
be pinned on the corks at once, and he said loudly,
"No, ma'am. Neither of 'em. Got no rooms vacant
with bawth, or bath either! Not but what we got 'em
in the house. This is an up-to-date place. But one of
'm's took, and the other has kind of been out of order,
the last three-four months."</p>

<p>From the audience of drummers below, a delicate
giggle.</p>

<p>Claire was too angry to answer. And too tired.
When, after miles of stairs, leagues of stuffy hall, she
reached her coop, with its iron bed so loose-jointed
that it rattled to a breath, its bureau with a list to
port, and its anemic rocking-chair, she dropped on the
bed, panting, her eyes closed but still brimming with
fire. It did not seem that she could ever move again.
She felt chloroformed. She couldn't even coax herself
off the bed, to see if her father was any better off
in the next room.</p>

<p>She was certain that she was not going to drive to
Seattle. She wasn't going to drive anywhere! She
was going to freight the car back to Minneapolis, and
herself go back by train&mdash;Pullman!&mdash;drawing-room!</p>

<p>But for the thought of her father she would have
fallen asleep, in her drenched tweeds. When she did
force the energy to rise, she had to support herself
by the bureau, by the foot of the bed, as she moved
about the room, hanging up the wet suit, rubbing
herself with a slippery towel, putting on a dark silk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
frock and pumps. She found her father sitting motionless
in his room, staring at the wall. She made
herself laugh at him for his gloomy emptiness. She
paraded down the hall with him.</p>

<p>As they reached the foot of the stairs, the old
one, the night clerk leaned across the desk and, in a
voice that took the whole office into the conversation,
quizzed, "Come from New York, eh? Well, you're
quite a ways from home."</p>

<p>Claire nodded. She felt shyer before these solemnly
staring traveling men than she ever had in a box at
the opera. At the double door of the dining-room,
from which the cabbage smell steamed with a lustiness
undiminished by the sad passing of its youth, a
man, one of the average-sized, average-mustached,
average business-suited, average-brown-haired men
who can never be remembered, stopped the Boltwoods
and hawed, "Saw you coming into town. You've got
a New York license?"</p>

<p>She couldn't deny it.</p>

<p>"Quite a ways from home, aren't you?"</p>

<p>She had to admit it.</p>

<p>She was escorted by a bouncing, black-eyed waitress
to a table for four. The next table was a long one,
at which seven traveling men, or local business men
whose wives were at the lake for the summer, ceased
trying to get nourishment out of the food, and gawped
at her. Before the Boltwoods were seated, the waitress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
dabbed at non-existent spots on their napkins,
ignored a genuine crumb on the cloth in front of
Claire's plate, made motions at a cup and a formerly
plated fork, and bubbled, "Autoing through?"</p>

<p>Claire fumbled for her chair, oozed into it, and
breathed, "Yes."</p>

<p>"Going far?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"New York."</p>

<p>"My! You're quite a ways from home, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Apparently."</p>

<p>"Hamnegs roasbeef roaspork thapplesauce frypickerel
springlamintsauce."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon."</p>

<p>The waitress repeated.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;oh&mdash;oh, bring us ham and eggs. Is that all
right, father?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;no&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You wanted same?" the waitress inquired of Mr.
Boltwood.</p>

<p>He was intimidated. He said, "If you please," and
feebly pawed at a fork.</p>

<p>The waitress was instantly back with soup, and a
collection of china gathered by a man of much
travel, catholic interests, and no taste. One of the
plates alleged itself to belong to a hotel in Omaha.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
She pushed a pitcher of condensed milk to the exact
spot where it would catch Mr. Boltwood's sleeve,
brushed the crumb from in front of Claire to a shelter
beneath the pink and warty sugar bowl, recovered a
toothpick which had been concealed behind her glowing
lips, picked for a while, gave it up, put her hands
on her hips, and addressed Claire:</p>

<p>"How far you going?"</p>

<p>"To Seattle."</p>

<p>"Got any folks there?"</p>

<p>"Any&mdash;&mdash; Oh, yes, I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Going to stay there long?"</p>

<p>"Really&mdash;&mdash; We haven't decided."</p>

<p>"Come from New York, eh? Quite a ways from
home, all right. Father in business there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What's his line?"</p>

<p>"I beg pardon?"</p>

<p>"What's his line? Ouch! Jiminy, these shoes
pinch my feet. I used to could dance all night, but
I'm getting fat, I guess, ha! ha! Put on seven pounds
last month. Ouch! Gee, they certainly do pinch my
toes. What business you say your father's in?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say, but&mdash;&mdash; Oh, railroad."</p>

<p>"G. N. or N. P.?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I quite understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood interposed, "Are the ham and eggs
ready?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>"I'll beat it out and see." When she brought them,
she put a spoon in Claire's saucer of peas, and demanded,
"Say, you don't wear that silk dress in the
auto, do you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I should think you'd put a pink sash on it. Seems
like it's kind of plain&mdash;it's a real pretty piece of goods,
though. A pink sash would be real pretty. You
dark-complected ladies always looks better for a touch
of color."</p>

<p>Then was Claire certain that the waitress was baiting
her, for the amusement of the men at the long
table. She exploded. Probably the waitress did not
know there had been an explosion when Claire looked
coldly up, raised her brows, looked down, and poked
the cold and salty slab of ham, for she was continuing:</p>

<p>"A light-complected lady like me don't need so much
color, you notice my hair is black, but I'm light, really,
Pete Liverquist says I'm a blonde brunette, gee, he
certainly is killing that fellow, oh, he's a case, he sure
does like to hear himself talk, my! there's Old Man
Walters, he runs the telephone exchange here, I heard
he went down to St. Cloud on Number 2, but I guess
he couldn't of, he'll be yodeling for friend soup and
a couple slabs of moo, I better beat it, I'll say so, so
long."</p>

<p>Claire's comment was as acid as the pale beets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
before her, as bitter as the peas, as hard as the lumps
in the watery mashed potatoes:</p>

<p>"I don't know whether the woman is insane or
ignorant. I wish I could tell whether she was trying
to make me angry for the benefit of those horrid unshaven
men, or merely for her private edification."</p>

<p>"By me, dolly. So is this pie. Let's get some medium
to levitate us up to bed. Uh&mdash;uh&mdash;&mdash; I think
perhaps we'd better not try to drive clear to Seattle.
If we just went through to Montana?&mdash;or even just
to Bismarck?"</p>

<p>"Drive through with the hotels like this? My
dear man, if we have one more such day, we stop
right there. I hope we get by the man at the desk. I
have a feeling he's lurking there, trying to think up
something insulting to say to us. Oh, my dear, I hope
you aren't as beastly tired as I am. My bones are hot
pokers."</p>

<p>The man at the desk got in only one cynical question,
"Driving far?" before Claire seized her father's arm
and started him upstairs.</p>

<p>For the first time since she had been ten&mdash;and in a
state of naughtiness immediately following a pronounced
state of grace induced by the pulpit oratory of
the new rector of St. Chrysostom's&mdash;she permitted
herself the luxury of not stopping to brush her teeth
before she went to bed. Her sleep was drugged&mdash;it
was not sleep, but an aching exhaustion of the body<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
which did not prevent her mind from revisualizing
the road, going stupidly over the muddy stretches
and sharp corners, then becoming conscious of that
bed, the lump under her shoulder blades, the slope to
westward, and the creak that rose every time she
tossed. For at least fifteen minutes she lay awake
for hours.</p>

<p>Thus Claire Boltwood's first voyage into democracy.</p>

<p>It was not so much that the sun was shining, in the
morning, as that a ripple of fresh breeze came through
the window. She discovered that she again longed to
go on&mdash;keep going on&mdash;see new places, conquer new
roads. She didn't want all good road. She wanted
something to struggle against. She'd try it for one
more day. She was stiff as she crawled out of bed,
but a rub with cold water left her feeling that she
was stronger than she ever had been; that she was a
woman, not a dependent girl. Already, in the beating
prairie sun-glare, the wide main street of Gopher
Prairie was drying; the mud ruts flattening out. Beyond
the town hovered the note of a meadow lark&mdash;sunlight
in sound.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a sweet morning! Sweet! We will go
on! I'm terribly excited!" she laughed.</p>

<p>She found her father dressed. He did not know
whether or not he wanted to go on. "I seem to have
lost my grip on things. I used to be rather decisive.
But we'll try it one more day, if you like," he said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>When she had gaily marched him downstairs, she
suddenly and unhappily remembered the people she
would have to face, the gibing questions she would
have to answer.</p>

<p>The night clerk was still at the desk, as though he
had slept standing. He hailed them. "Well, well!
Up bright and early! Hope you folks slept well.
Beds aren't so good as they might be, but we're kind
of planning to get some new mattresses. But you get
pretty good air to sleep in. Hope you have a fine hike
today."</p>

<p>His voice was cordial; he was their old friend;
faithful watcher of their progress. Claire found herself
dimpling at him.</p>

<p>In the dining-room their inquisitional acquaintance,
the waitress, fairly ran to them. "Sit down, folks.
Waffles this morning. You want to stock up for your
drive. My, ain't it an elegant morning! I hope you
have a swell drive today!"</p>

<p>"Why!" Claire gasped, "why, they aren't rude.
They care&mdash;about people they never saw before.
That's why they ask questions! I never thought&mdash;I
never thought! There's people in the world who want
to know us without having looked us up in the Social
Register! I'm so ashamed! Not that the sunshine
changes my impression of this coffee. It's frightful!
But that will improve. And the people&mdash;they were
being friendly, all the time. Oh, Henry B., young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Henry Boltwood, you and your godmother Claire have
a lot to learn about the world!"</p>

<p>As they came into the garage, their surly acquaintance
of the night before looked just as surly, but
Claire tried a boisterous "Good morning!"</p>

<p>"Mornin'! Going north? Better take the left-hand
road at Wakamin. Easier going. Drive your
car out for you?"</p>

<p>As the car stood outside taking on gas, a man
flapped up, spelled out the New York license, looked
at Claire and her father, and inquired, "Quite a ways
from home, aren't you?"</p>

<p>This time Claire did not say "Yes!" She experimented
with, "Yes, quite a ways."</p>

<p>"Well, hope you have a good trip. Good luck!"</p>

<p>Claire leaned her head on her hand, thought hard.
"It's I who wasn't friendly," she propounded to her
father. "How much I've been losing. Though I still
refuse to like that coffee!"</p>

<p>She noticed the sign on the air-hose of the garage&mdash;"Free
Air."</p>

<p>"There's our motto for the pilgrimage!" she cried.</p>

<p>She knew the exaltation of starting out in the fresh
morning for places she had never seen, without the
bond of having to return at night.</p>

<p>Thus Claire's second voyage into democracy.</p>

<p>While she was starting the young man who had
pulled her out of the mud and given her lunch was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
folding up the tarpaulin and blankets on which he had
slept beside his Teal bug, in the woods three miles
north of Gopher Prairie. To the high-well-born cat,
Vere de Vere, Milt Daggett mused aloud, "Your ladyship,
as Shakespeare says, the man that gets cold feet
never wins the girl. And I'm scared, cat, clean
scared."</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
RELEASE BRAKES&mdash;SHIFT TO THIRD</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Milt Daggett</span> had not been accurate in his
implication that he had not noticed Claire at a
garage in Schoenstrom. For one thing, he owned the
garage.</p>

<p>Milt was the most prosperous young man in the
village of Schoenstrom. Neither the village itself nor
the nearby <i>Strom</i> is really <i>schoen</i>. The entire business
district of Schoenstrom consists of Heinie Rauskukle's
general store, which is brick; the Leipzig
House, which is frame; the Old Home Poolroom and
Restaurant, which is of old logs concealed by a frame
sheathing; the farm-machinery agency, which is galvanized
iron, its roof like an enlarged washboard;
the church; the three saloons; and the Red Trail Garage,
which is also, according to various signs, the
Agency for Teal Car Best at the Test, Stonewall Tire
Service Station, Sewing Machines and Binders Repaired,
Dr. Hostrum the Veterinarian every Thursday,
Gas Today 27c.</p>

<p>The Red Trail Garage is of cement and tapestry
brick. In the office is a clean hardwood floor, a typewriter,
and a picture of Elsie Ferguson. The establishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
has an automatic rim-stretcher, a wheel
jack, and a reputation for honesty.</p>

<p>The father of Milt Daggett was the Old Doctor,
born in Maine, coming to this frontier in the day
when Chippewas camped in your dooryard, and came
in to help themselves to coffee, which you made of
roasted corn. The Old Doctor bucked northwest blizzards,
read Dickens and Byron, pulled people through
typhoid, and left to Milt his shabby old medicine case
and thousands of dollars&mdash;in uncollectible accounts.
Mrs. Daggett had long since folded her crinkly hands
in quiet death.</p>

<p>Milt had covered the first two years of high school
by studying with the priest, and been sent to the city
of St. Cloud for the last two years. His father had
meant to send him to the state university. But Milt
had been born to a talent for machinery. At twelve he
had made a telephone that worked. At eighteen he
was engineer in the tiny flour mill in Schoenstrom.
At twenty-five, when Claire Boltwood chose to come
tearing through his life in a Gomez-Dep, Milt was the
owner, manager, bookkeeper, wrecking crew, ignition
expert, thoroughly competent bill-collector, and all but
one of the working force of the Red Trail Garage.</p>

<p>There were two factions in Schoenstrom: the retired
farmers who said that German was a good enough language
for anybody, and that taxes for schools and
sidewalks were yes something crazy; and the group<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
who stated that a pig-pen is a fine place, but only for
pigs. To this second, revolutionary wing belonged a
few of the first generation, most of the second, and
all of the third; and its leader was Milt Daggett. He
did not talk much, normally, but when he thought
things ought to be done, he was as annoying as a machine-gun
test in the lot next to a Quaker meeting.</p>

<p>If there had been a war, Milt would probably have
been in it&mdash;rather casual, clearing his throat, reckoning
and guessing that maybe his men might try going
over and taking that hill ... then taking it.
But all of this history concerns the year just before
America spoke to Germany; and in this town buried
among the cornfields and the wheat, men still thought
more about the price of grain than about the souls of
nations.</p>

<p>On the evening before Claire Boltwood left Minneapolis
and adventured into democracy, Milt was in the
garage. He wore union overalls that were tan where
they were not grease-black; a faded blue cotton shirt;
and the crown of a derby, with the rim not too neatly
hacked off with a dull toad-stabber jack-knife.</p>

<p>Milt smiled at his assistant, Ben Sittka, and suggested,
"Well, <i>wie geht 's mit</i> the work, eh? Like to
stay and get the prof's flivver out, so he can have it
in the morning?"</p>

<p>"You bet, boss."</p>

<p>"Getting to be quite a mechanic, Ben."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>"I'll say so!"</p>

<p>"If you get stuck, come yank me out of the Old
Home."</p>

<p>"Aw rats, boss. I'll finish it. You beat it." Ben
grinned at Milt adoringly.</p>

<p>Milt stripped off his overalls and derby-crown, and
washed his big, firm hands with gritty soft soap. He
cleaned his nails with a file which he carried in his
upper vest pocket in a red imitation morocco case
which contained a comb, a mirror, an indelible pencil,
and a note-book with the smudged pencil addresses of
five girls in St. Cloud, and a memorandum about
Rauskukle's car.</p>

<p>He put on a twisted brown tie, an old blue serge
suit, and a hat which, being old and shabby, had become
graceful. He ambled up the street. He couldn't
have ambled more than three blocks and have remained
on the street. Schoenstrom tended to leak off into jungles
of tall corn.</p>

<p>Two men waved at him, and one demanded, "Say,
Milt, is whisky good for the toothache? What d' you
think! The doc said it didn't do any good. But then,
gosh, he's only just out of college."</p>

<p>"I guess he's right."</p>

<p>"Is that a fact! Well, I'll keep off it then."</p>

<p>Two stores farther on, a bulky farmer hailed, "Say,
Milt, should I get an ensilage cutter yet?"</p>

<p>"Yuh," in the manner of a man who knows too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
much to be cocksure about anything, "I don't know
but what I would, Julius."</p>

<p>"I guess I vill then."</p>

<p>Minnie Rauskukle, plump, hearty Minnie, heiress
to the general store, gave evidence by bridling and
straightening her pigeon-like body that she was aware
of Milt behind her. He did not speak to her. He
ducked into the door of the Old Home Poolroom and
Restaurant.</p>

<p>Milt ranged up to the short lunch counter, in front
of the pool table where two brick-necked farm youngsters
were furiously slamming balls and attacking
cigarettes. Loose-jointedly Milt climbed a loose-jointed
high stool and to the proprietor, Bill McGolwey,
his best friend, he yawned, "You might poison
me with a hamburger and a slab of apple, Mac."</p>

<p>"I'll just do that little thing. Look kind of grouchy
tonight, Milt."</p>

<p>"Too much excitement in this burg. Saw three
people on the streets all simultaneously to-once."</p>

<p>"What's been eatin' you lately?"</p>

<p>"Me? Nothing. Only I do get tired of this metropolis.
One of these days I'm going to buck some
bigger place."</p>

<p>"Try Gopher Prairie maybe?" suggested Mac,
through the hiss and steam of the frying hamburger
sandwich.</p>

<p>"Rats. Too small."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>"Small? Why, there's darn near five thousand
people there!"</p>

<p>"I know, but&mdash;I want to tackle some sure-nuff
city. Like Duluth or New York."</p>

<p>"But what'd you do?"</p>

<p>"That's the devil of it. I don't know just what I
do want to do. I could always land soft in a garage,
but that's nothing new. Might hit Detroit, and learn
the motor-factory end."</p>

<p>"Aw, you're the limit, Milt. Always looking for
something new."</p>

<p>"That's the way to get on. The rest of this town
is afraid of new things. 'Member when I suggested
we all chip in on a dynamo with a gas engine and
have electric lights? The hicks almost died of nervousness."</p>

<p>"Yuh, that's true, but&mdash;&mdash; You stick here, Milt.
You and me will just nachly run this burg."</p>

<p>"I'll say! Only&mdash;&mdash; Gosh, Mac, I would like to
go to a real show, once. And find out how radio
works. And see 'em put in a big suspension bridge!"</p>

<p>Milt left the Old Home rather aimlessly. He told
himself that he positively would not go back and help
Ben Sittka get out the prof's car. So he went back
and helped Ben get out the prof's car, and drove the
same to the prof's. The prof, otherwise professor,
otherwise mister, James Martin Jones, B.A., and Mrs.
James Martin Jones welcomed him almost as noisily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as had Mac. They begged him to come in. With Mr.
Jones he discussed&mdash;no, ye Claires of Brooklyn
Heights, this garage man and this threadbare young
superintendent of a paintbare school, talking in a town
that was only a comma on the line, did not discuss
corn-growing, nor did they reckon to guess that by
heck the constabule was carryin' on with the Widdy
Perkins. They spoke of fish-culture, Elihu Root, the
spiritualistic evidences of immortality, government
ownership, self-starters for flivvers, and the stories
of Irvin Cobb.</p>

<p>Milt went home earlier than he wanted to. Because
Mr. Jones was the only man in town besides the priest
who read books, because Mrs. Jones was the only
woman who laughed about any topics other than children
and family sickness, because he wanted to go to
their house every night, Milt treasured his welcome as
a sacred thing, and kept himself from calling on them
more than once a week.</p>

<p>He stopped on his way to the garage to pet Emil
Baumschweiger's large gray cat, publicly known as
Rags, but to Milt and to the lady herself recognized
as the unfortunate Countess Vere de Vere&mdash;perhaps
the only person of noble ancestry and mysterious past
in Milt's acquaintance. The Baumschweigers did not
treat their animals well; Emil kicked the bay mare,
and threw pitchforks at Vere de Vere. Milt saluted
her and sympathized:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>"You have a punk time, don't you, countess?
Like to beat it to Minneapolis with me?"</p>

<p>The countess said that she did indeed have an
extraordinarily punk time, and she sang to Milt the
hymn of the little gods of the warm hearth. Then
Milt's evening dissipations were over. Schoenstrom
has movies only once a week. He sat in the office of
his garage ruffling through a weekly digest of events.
Milt read much, though not too easily. He had no
desire to be a poet, an Indo-Iranian etymologist, a lecturer
to women's clubs, or the secretary of state. But
he did rouse to the marvels hinted in books and magazines;
to large crowds, the mechanism of submarines,
palm trees, gracious women.</p>

<p>He laid down the magazine. He stared at the wall.
He thought about nothing. He seemed to be fumbling
for something about which he could deliciously think
if he could but grasp it. Without quite visualizing
either wall or sea, he was yet recalling old dreams of a
moonlit wall by a warm stirring southern sea. If
there was a girl in the dream she was intangible as
the scent of the night. Presently he was asleep, a
not at all romantic figure, rather ludicrously tipped
to one side in his office chair, his large solid shoes up
on the desk.</p>

<p>He half woke, and filtered to what he called home&mdash;one
room in the cottage of an oldish woman who had
prejudices against the perilous night air. He was too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sleepy to go through any toilet save pulling off his
shoes, and achieving an unconvincing wash at the
little stand, whose crackly varnish was marked with
white rings from the toothbrush mug.</p>

<p>"I feel about due to pull off some fool stunt. Wonder
what it will be?" he complained, as he flopped on
the bed.</p>

<p>He was up at six, and at a quarter to seven was at
work in the garage. He spent a large part of the
morning in trying to prove to a customer that even a
Teal car, best at the test, would not give perfect service
if the customer persisted in forgetting to fill the oil-well,
the grease-cups, and the battery.</p>

<p>At three minutes after twelve Milt left the garage
to go to dinner. The fog of the morning had turned
to rain. McGolwey was not at the Old Home. Sometimes
Mac got tired of serving meals, and for a day or
two he took to a pocket flask, and among his former
customers the cans of prepared meat at Rauskukle's
became popular. Milt found him standing under the
tin awning of the general store. He had a troubled
hope of keeping Mac from too long a vacation with
the pocket flask. But Mac was already red-eyed. He
seemed only half to recognize Milt.</p>

<p>"Swell day!" said Milt.</p>

<p>"Y' bet."</p>

<p>"Road darn muddy."</p>

<p>"I should worry. Yea, bo', I'm feelin' good!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>At eleven minutes past twelve a Gomez-Dep roadster
appeared down the road, stopped at the garage.
To Milt it was as exciting as the appearance of a
comet to a watching astronomer.</p>

<p>"What kind of a car do you call that, Milt?"
asked a loafer.</p>

<p>"Gomez-Deperdussin."</p>

<p>"Never heard of it. Looks too heavy."</p>

<p>This was sacrilege. Milt stormed, "Why, you poor
floof, it's one of the best cars in the world. Imported
from France. That looks like a special-made American
body, though. Trouble with you fellows is, you're
always scared of anything that's new. Too&mdash;heavy!
Huh! Always wanted to see a Gomez&mdash;never have,
except in pictures. And I believe that's a New York
license. Let me at it!"</p>

<p>He forgot noon-hunger, and clumped through the
rain to the garage. He saw a girl step from the car.
He stopped, in the doorway of the Old Home, in uneasy
shyness. He told himself he didn't "know just
what it is about her&mdash;she isn't so darn unusually
pretty and yet&mdash;gee&mdash;&mdash; Certainly isn't a girl to get
fresh with. Let Ben take care of her. Like to talk
to her, and yet I'd be afraid if I opened my mouth,
I'd put my foot in it."</p>

<p>He was for the first time seeing a smart woman.
This dark, slender, fine-nerved girl, in her plain, rough,
closely-belted, gray suit, her small black Glengarry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
cocked on one side of her smooth hair, her little kid
gloves, her veil, was as delicately adjusted as an aeroplane
engine.</p>

<p>Milt wanted to trumpet her exquisiteness to the
world, so he growled to a man standing beside him,
"Swell car. Nice-lookin' girl, kind of."</p>

<p>"Kind of skinny, though. I like 'em with some
meat on 'em," yawned the man.</p>

<p>No, Milt did not strike him to earth. He insisted
feebly, "Nice clothes she's got, though."</p>

<p>"Oh, not so muchamuch. I seen a woman come
through here yesterday that was swell, though&mdash;had
on a purple dress and white shoes and a hat big 's a
bushel."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, I kind of like those simple
things," apologized Milt.</p>

<p>He crept toward the garage. The girl was inside.
He inspected the slope-topped, patent-leather motoring
trunk on the rack at the rear of the Gomez-Dep.
He noticed a middle-aged man waiting in the car.
"Must be her father. Probably&mdash;maybe she isn't
married then." He could not get himself to shout at
the man, as he usually did. He entered the garage
office; from the inner door he peeped at the girl, who
was talking to his assistant about changing an inner
tube.</p>

<p>That Ben Sittka whom an hour ago he had cajoled
as a promising child he now admired for the sniffing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
calmness with which he was demanding, "Want a red
or gray tube?"</p>

<p>"Really, I don't know. Which is the better?" The
girl's voice was curiously clear.</p>

<p>Milt passed Claire Boltwood as though he did not
see her; stood at the rear of the garage kicking at the
tires of a car, his back to her. Over and over he was
grumbling, "If I just knew one girl like that&mdash;&mdash; Like
a picture. Like&mdash;like a silver vase on a blue
cloth!"</p>

<p>Ben Sittka did not talk to the girl while he inserted
the tube in the spare casing. Only, in the triumphant
moment when the parted ends of the steel rim snapped
back together, he piped, "Going far?"</p>

<p>"Yes, rather. To Seattle."</p>

<p>Milt stared at the cobweb-grayed window. "Now
I know what I was planning to do. I'm going to
Seattle," he said.</p>

<p>The girl was gone at twenty-nine minutes after
twelve. At twenty-nine and a half minutes after,
Milt remarked to Ben Sittka, "I'm going to take a
trip. Uh? Now don't ask questions. You take
charge of the garage until you hear from me. Get
somebody to help you. G'-by."</p>

<p>He drove his Teal bug out of the garage. At
thirty-two minutes after twelve he was in his room,
packing his wicker suitcase by the method of throwing
things in and stamping on the case till it closed. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
it he had absolutely all of his toilet refinements and
wardrobe except the important portion already in use.
They consisted, according to faithful detailed report,
of four extra pairs of thick yellow and white cotton
socks; two shirts, five collars, five handkerchiefs; a
pair of surprisingly vain dancing pumps; high tan
laced boots; three suits of cheap cotton underclothes;
his Sunday suit, which was dead black in color, and
unimaginative in cut; four ties; a fagged toothbrush,
a comb and hairbrush, a razor, a strop, shaving soap
in a mug; a not very clean towel; and nothing else
whatever.</p>

<p>To this he added his entire library and private picture
gallery, consisting of Ivanhoe, Ben-Hur, his
father's copy of Byron, a wireless manual, and the
1916 edition of Motor Construction and Repairing:
the art collection, one colored Sunday supplement picture
of a princess lunching in a Proven&ccedil;e courtyard,
and a half-tone of Colonel Paul Beck landing in an
early military biplane. Under this last, in a pencil
scrawl now blurred to grayness, Milt had once written,
"This what Ill be aviator."</p>

<p>What he was to wear was a piercing trouble. Till
eleven minutes past twelve that day he had not cared.
People accepted his overalls at anything except a
dance, and at the dances he was the only one who
wore pumps. But in his discovery of Claire Boltwood
he had perceived that dressing is an art. Before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
he had packed, he had unhappily pawed at the prized
black suit. It had become stupid. "Undertaker!"
he growled.</p>

<p>With a shrug which indicated that he had nothing
else, he had exchanged his overalls for a tan flannel
shirt, black bow tie, thick pigskin shoes, and the suit
he had worn the evening before, his best suit of two
years ago&mdash;baggy blue serge coat and trousers. He
could not know it, but they were surprisingly graceful
on his wiry, firm, white body.</p>

<p>In his pockets were a roll of bills and an unexpectedly
good gold watch. For warmth he had a
winter ulster, an old-fashioned turtle-neck sweater,
and a raincoat heavy as tarpaulin. He plunged into
the raincoat, ran out, galloped to Rauskukle's store,
bought the most vehement cap in the place&mdash;a plaid
of cerise, orange, emerald green, ultramarine, and five
other guaranteed fashionable colors. He stocked up
with food for roadside camping.</p>

<p>In the humping tin-covered tail of the bug was a
good deal of room, and this he filled with motor
extras, a shotgun and shells, a pair of skates, and all
his camping kit as used on his annual duck-hunting
trip to Man Trap Lake.</p>

<p>"I'm a darned fool to take everything I own
but&mdash;&mdash; Might be gone a whole month," he reflected.</p>

<p>He had only one possession left&mdash;a check book, concealed
from the interested eye of his too maternal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
landlady by sticking it under the stair carpet. This
he retrieved. It showed a balance of two hundred
dollars. There was ten dollars in the cash register in
the office, for Ben Sittka. The garage would, with the
mortgage deducted, be worth nearly two thousand.
This was his fortune.</p>

<p>He bolted into the kitchen and all in one shout he
informed his landlady, "Called out of town, li'l trip,
b'lieve I don't owe you an'thing, here's six dollars, two
weeks' notice, dunno just when I be back."</p>

<p>Before she could issue a questionnaire he was out
in the bug. He ran through town. At his friend
McGolwey; now loose-lipped and wabbly, sitting in
the rain on a pile of ties behind the railroad station,
he yelled, "So long, Mac. Take care yourself, old
hoss. Off on li'l trip."</p>

<p>He stopped in front of the "prof's," tooted till the
heads of the Joneses appeared at the window, waved
and shouted, "G'-by, folks. Goin' outa town."</p>

<p>Then, while freedom and the distant Pacific seemed
to rush at him over the hood, he whirled out of town.
It was two minutes to one&mdash;forty-seven minutes since
Claire Boltwood had entered Schoenstrom.</p>

<p>He stopped only once. His friend Lady Vere de
Vere was at the edge of town, on a scientific exploring
trip in the matter of ethnology and field mice. She
hailed him, "Mrwr? Me mrwr!"</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" Milt answered in surprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
"Well, if I promised to take you, I'll keep my word."
He vaulted out, tucked Vere de Vere into the seat,
protecting her from the rain with the tarpaulin winter
radiator-cover.</p>

<p>His rut-skipping car overtook the mud-walloping
Gomez-Dep in an hour, and pulled it out of the mud.</p>

<p>Before Milt slept that night, in his camp three miles
from Gopher Prairie, he went through religious rites.</p>

<p>"Girl like her, she's darn particular about her looks.
I'm a sloppy hound. Used to be snappier about my
clothes when I was in high school. Getting lazy&mdash;too
much like Mac. Think of me sleeping in my
clothes last night!"</p>

<p>"Mrwr!" rebuked the cat.</p>

<p>"You're dead right. Fierce is the word. Nev'
will sleep in my duds again, puss. That is, when I
have a reg'lar human bed. Course camping, different.
But still&mdash;&mdash; Let's see all the funny things we can
do to us."</p>

<p>He shaved&mdash;two complete shaves, from lather to
towel. He brushed his hair. He sat down by a campfire
sheltered between two rocks, and fought his nails,
though they were discouragingly crammed with motor
grease. Throughout this interesting but quite painful
ceremony Milt kept up a conversation between himself
as the World's Champion Dude, and his cat
as Vallay. But when there was nothing more to do,
and the fire was low, and Vere de Vere asleep in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
sleeve of the winter ulster, his bumbling voice slackened;
in something like agony he muttered:</p>

<p>"But oh, what's the use? I can't ever be anything
but a dub! Cleaning my nails, to make a hit with
a girl that's got hands like hers! It's a long trail to
Seattle, but it's a darn sight longer one to being&mdash;being&mdash;well,
sophisticated. Oh! And incidentally,
what the deuce am I going to do in Seattle if I do get
there?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
THE LAND OF BILLOWING CLOUDS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Never</span> a tawny-beached ocean has the sweetness
of the prairie slew. Rippling and blue, with
long grass up to its edge, a spot of dancing light set
in the miles of rustling wheat, it retains even in July,
on an afternoon of glare and brazen locusts, the freshness
of a spring morning. A thousand slews, a hundred
lakes bordered with rippling barley or tinkling
bells of the flax, Claire passed. She had left the
occasional groves of oak and poplar and silver birch,
and come out on the treeless Great Plains.</p>

<p>She had learned to call the slews "pugholes," and
to watch for ducks at twilight. She had learned that
about the pugholes flutter choirs of crimson-winged
blackbirds; that the ugly brown birds squatting on
fence-rails were the divine-voiced meadow larks; that
among the humble cowbird citizens of the pastures
sometimes flaunted a scarlet tanager or an oriole; and
that no rose garden has the quaint and hardy beauty of
the Indian paint brushes and rag babies and orange
milkweed in the prickly, burnt-over grass between
roadside and railway line.</p>

<p>She had learned that what had seemed rudeness in
garage men and hotel clerks was often a resentful reflection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
of her own Eastern attitude that she was necessarily
superior to a race she had been trained to call
"common people." If she spoke up frankly, they
made her one of their own, and gave her companionable
aid.</p>

<p>For two days of sunshine and drying mud she followed
a road flung straight across flat wheatlands, then
curving among low hills. Often there were no fences;
she was so intimately in among the grain that the
fenders of the car brushed wheat stalks, and she became
no stranger, but a part of all this vast-horizoned
land. She forgot that she was driving, as she let the
car creep on, while she was transported by Armadas
of clouds, prairie clouds, wisps of vapor like a ribbed
beach, or mounts of cumulus swelling to gold-washed
snowy peaks.</p>

<p>The friendliness of the bearing earth gave her a
calm that took no heed of passing hours. Even her
father, the abstracted man of affairs, nodded to dusty
people along the road; to a jolly old man whose bulk
rolled and shook in a tiny, rhythmically creaking
buggy, to women in the small abrupt towns with their
huge red elevators and their long, flat-roofed stores.</p>

<p>Claire had discovered America, and she felt stronger,
and all her days were colored with the sun.</p>

<p>She had discovered, too, that she could adventure.
No longer was she haunted by the apprehension that
had whispered to her as she had left Minneapolis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
She knew a thrill when she hailed&mdash;as though it were
a passing ship&mdash;an Illinois car across whose dust-caked
back was a banner "Chicago to the Yellowstone."
She experienced a new sensation of common
humanness when, on a railway paralleling the wagon
road for miles, the engineer of a freight waved his
hand to her, and tooted the whistle in greeting.</p>

<p>Her father was easily tired, but he drowsed through
the early afternoons when a none-too-digestible small-town
lunch was as lead within him. Despite the beauty
of the land and the joy of pushing on, they both had
things to endure.</p>

<p>After lunch, it was sometimes an agony to Claire
to keep awake. Her eyes felt greasy from the food,
or smarted with the sun-glare. In the still air, after
the morning breeze had been burnt out, the heat from
the engine was a torment about her feet; and if there
was another car ahead, the trail of dust sifted into
her throat. Unless there was traffic to keep her awake,
she nodded at the wheel; she was merely a part of a
machine that ran on without seeming to make any
impression on the prairie's endlessness.</p>

<p>Over and over there were the same manipulations:
slow for down hill, careful of sand at the bottom, letting
her out on a smooth stretch, waving to a lonely
farmwife in her small, baked dooryard, slow to pass a
hay-wagon, gas for up the next hill, and repeat the
round all over again. But she was joyous till noon;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and with mid-afternoon a new strength came which,
as rose crept above the golden haze of dust, deepened
into serene meditation.</p>

<p>And she was finding the one secret of long-distance
driving&mdash;namely, driving; keeping on, thinking by
fifty-mile units, not by the ten-mile stretches of Long
Island runs; and not fretting over anything whatever.
She seemed charmed; if she had a puncture&mdash;why,
she put on the spare. If she ran out of gas&mdash;why, any
passing driver would lend her a gallon. Nothing, it
seemed, could halt her level flight across the giant
land.</p>

<p>She rarely lost her way. She was guided by the
friendly trail signs&mdash;those big red R's and L's on fence
post and telephone pole, magically telling the way from
the Mississippi to the Pacific.</p>

<p>Her father's occasional musing talk kept her from
loneliness. He was a good touring companion.
Motoring is not the best occasion for epigrams, satire,
and the Good One You Got Off at the Lambs' Club
last night. Such verbiage on motor trips invariably
results in the mysterious finding of the corpse of a
strange man, well dressed, hidden beside the road.
Claire and her father mumbled, "Good farmhouse&mdash;brick,"
or "Nice view," and smiled, and were for
miles as silent as the companionable sky.</p>

<p>She thought of the people she knew, especially of
Jeff Saxton. But she could not clearly remember his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
lean earnest face. Between her and Jeff were sweeping
sunny leagues. But she was not lonely. Certainly
she was not lonely for a young man with a raincoat, a
cat, and an interest in Japan.</p>

<p>No singer after a first concert has felt more triumphant
than Claire when she crossed her first state-line;
rumbled over the bridge across the Red River into
North Dakota. To see Dakota car licenses everywhere,
instead of Minnesota, was like the sensation of
street signs in a new language. And when she found
a good hotel in Fargo and had a real bath, she felt that
by her own efforts she had earned the right to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood caught her enthusiasm. Dinner was
a festival, and in iced tea the peaceful conquistadores
drank the toast of the new Spanish Main; and afterward,
arm in arm, went chattering to the movies.</p>

<p>In front of the Royal Palace, Pictures, 4 Great Acts
Vaudeville 4, was browsing a small, beetle-like, tin-covered
car.</p>

<p>"Dad! Look! I'm sure&mdash;yes, of course, there's
his suitcase&mdash;that's the car of that nice boy&mdash;don't
you remember?&mdash;the one that pulled us out of the mud
at&mdash;I don't remember the name of the place. Apparently
he's keeping going. I remember; he's headed for
Seattle, too. We'll look for him in the theater. Oh,
the darling, there's his cat! What was the funny name
he gave her&mdash;the Marchioness Montmorency or something?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Lady Vere de Vere, afraid of Fargo and movie
crowds, but trusting in her itinerant castle, the bug,
was curled in Milt Daggett's ulster, in the bottom of
the car. She twinkled her whiskers at Claire, and
purred to a stroking hand.</p>

<p>With the excitement of one trying to find the address
of a friend in a strange land Claire looked over
the audience when the lights came on before the vaudeville.
In the second row she saw Milt's stiffish, rope-colored
hair&mdash;surprisingly smooth above an astoundingly
clean new tan shirt of mercerized silk.</p>

<p>He laughed furiously at the dialogue between Pete-Rosenheim
&amp; Larose-Bettina, though it contained the
cheese joke, the mother-in-law joke, and the joke about
the wife rifling her husband's pockets.</p>

<p>"Our young friend seems to have enviable youthful
spirits," commented Mr. Boltwood.</p>

<p>"Now, no superiority! He's probably never seen
a real vaudeville show. Wouldn't it be fun to take
him to the Winter Garden or the Follies for the first
time!... Instead of being taken by Jeff Saxton,
and having the humor, oh! so articulately explained!"</p>

<p>The pictures were resumed; the film which, under
ten or twelve different titles, Claire had already seen,
even though Brooklyn Heights does not devote Saturday
evening to the movies. The badman, the sheriff&mdash;an
aged party with whiskers and boots&mdash;the holdup,
the sad eyes of the sheriff's daughter&mdash;also an aged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
party, but with a sunbonnet and the most expensive
rouge&mdash;the crook's reformation, and his violent adherence
to law and order; this libel upon the portions
of these United States lying west of longitude 101&deg;
Claire had seen too often. She dragged her father
back to the hotel, sent him to bed, and entered her
room&mdash;to find a telegram upon the bureau.</p>

<p>She had sent her friends a list of the places at which
she would be likely to stop. The message was from
Jeff Saxton, in Brooklyn. It brought to her mind the
steady shine of his glasses&mdash;the most expensive glasses,
with the very best curved lenses&mdash;as it demanded:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Received letter about trip surprised anxious will
tire you out fatigue prairie roads bad for your father
mountain roads dangerous strongly advise go only
part way then take train.</p>

<p class="rgt"><span class="smcap">Geoffrey.</span>"</p></div>

<p>She held the telegram, flipping her fingers against
one end of it as she debated. She remembered how
the wide world had flowed toward her over the hood
of the Gomez all day. She wrote in answer:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Awful perils of road, two punctures, split infinitive,
eggs at lunch questionable, but struggle on."</p></div>

<p>Before she sent it she held council with her father.
She sat on the foot of his bed and tried to sound dutiful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
"I don't want to do anything that's bad for
you, daddy. But isn't it taking your mind away from
business?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, I think it is. Anyway, we'll try it a few
days more."</p>

<p>"I fancy we can stand up under the strain and
perils. I think we can persuade some of these big
farmers to come to the rescue if we encounter any
walruses or crocodiles among the wheat. And I have
a feeling that if we ever get stuck, our friend of the
Teal bug will help us."</p>

<p>"Probably never see him again. He'll skip on ahead
of us."</p>

<p>"Of course. We haven't laid an eye on him, along
the road. He must have gotten into Fargo long before
we did. Now tomorrow I think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
THE GREAT AMERICAN FRYING PAN</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was Claire's first bad day since the hole in the
mud. She had started gallantly, scooting along
the level road that flies straight west of Fargo. But
at noon she encountered a restaurant which made eating
seem an evil.</p>

<p>That they might have fair fame among motorists
the commercial club of Reaper had set at the edge
of town a sign "Welcome to Reaper, a Live Town&mdash;Speed
Limit 8 Miles perhr." Being interpreted, that
sign meant that if you went much over twenty miles an
hour on the main street, people might glance at you;
and that the real welcome, the only impression of
Reaper that tourists were likely to carry away, was the
welcome in the one restaurant. It was called the Eats
Garden. As Claire and her father entered, they were
stifled by a belch of smoke from the frying pan in the
kitchen. The room was blocked by a huge lunch
counter; there was only one table, covered with oil
cloth decorated with venerable spots of dried egg yolk.</p>

<p>The waiter-cook, whose apron was gravy-patterned,
with a border and stomacher of plain gray dirt, grumbled,
"Whadyuhwant?"</p>

<p>Claire sufficiently recovered to pick out the type<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
from the fly specks on the menu, and she ordered a
small steak and coffee for her father; for herself tea,
boiled eggs, toast.</p>

<p>"Toast? We ain't got any toast!"</p>

<p>"Well, can't you make it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose I could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>When they came, the slices of toast were an inch
thick, burnt on one side and raw on the other. The
tea was bitter and the eggs watery. Her father reported
that his steak was high-test rawhide, and his
coffee&mdash;well, he wasn't sure just what substitute had
been used for chicory, but he thought it was lukewarm
quinine.</p>

<p>Claire raged: "You know, this town really has
aspirations. They're beginning to build such nice
little bungalows, and there's a fine clean bank&mdash;&mdash; Then
they permit this scoundrel to advertise the town
among strangers, influential strangers, in motors, by
serving food like this! I suppose they think that they
arrest criminals here, yet this restaurant man is a thief,
to charge real money for food like this&mdash;&mdash; Yes, and
he's a murderer!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, dolly!"</p>

<p>"Yes he is, literally. He must in his glorious career
have given chronic indigestion to thousands of people&mdash;shortened
their lives by years. That's wholesale
murder. If I were the authorities here, I'd be indulgent
to the people who only murder one or two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
people, but imprison this cook for life. Really! I
mean it!"</p>

<p>"Well, he probably does the best he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He does not! These eggs and this bread were
perfectly good, before he did black magic over them.
And did you see the contemptuous look he gave me
when I was so eccentric as to order toast? Oh, Reaper,
Reaper, you desire a modern town, yet I wonder if you
know how many thousands of tourists go from coast
to coast, cursing you? If I could only hang that
restaurant man&mdash;and the others like him&mdash;in a rope
of his own hempen griddle cakes! The Great American
Frying Pan! I don't expect men building a new
town to have time to read Hugh Walpole and James
Branch Cabell, but I do expect them to afford a cook
who can fry eggs!"</p>

<p>As she paid the check, Claire tried to think of some
protest which would have any effect on the obese wits
of the restaurant man. In face of his pink puffiness
she gave it up. Her failure as a Citizeness Fixit sent
her out of the place in a fury, carried her on in a dusty
whirl till the engine spat, sounded tired and reflective,
and said it guessed it wouldn't go any farther that
day.</p>

<p>Now that she had something to do, Claire became
patient. "Run out of gas. Isn't it lucky I got that
can for an extra gallon?"</p>

<p>But there was plenty of gas. There was no discernible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
reason why the car should not go. She started
the engine. It ran for half a minute and quit. All
the plugs showed sparks. No wires were detached in
the distributor. There was plenty of water, and the
oil was not clogged. And that ended Claire's knowledge
of the inside of a motor.</p>

<p>She stopped two motorists. The first was sure that
there was dirt on the point of the needle valve, in the
carburetor. While Claire shuddered lest he never get
it back, he took out the needle valve, wiped it, put it
back&mdash;and the engine was again started, and again,
with great promptness, it stopped.</p>

<p>The second Good Samaritan knew that one of the
wires in the distributor must be detached and, though
she assured him that she had inspected them, he looked
pityingly at her smart sports-suit, said, "Well, I'll
just take a look," and removed the distributor cover.
He also scratched his head, felt of the fuses under the
cowl, scratched his cheek, poked a finger at the carburetor,
rubbed his ear, said, "Well, uh&mdash;&mdash;" looked to
see if there was water and gas, sighed, "Can't just
seem to find out what's the trouble," shot at his own
car, and escaped.</p>

<p>Claire had been highly grateful and laudatory to
both of them&mdash;but she remained here, ten miles from
nowhere. It was a beautiful place. Down a hill the
wheat swam toward a village whose elevator was a
glistening tower. Mud-hens gabbled in a slew, alfalfa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
shone with unearthly green, and bees went junketing
toward a field of red clover. But she had the motorist's
fever to go on. The road behind and in front
was very long, very white&mdash;and very empty.</p>

<p>Her father, out of much thought and a solid ignorance
about all of motoring beyond the hiring of
chauffeurs and the payment of bills, suggested, "Uh,
dolly, have you looked to see if these, uh&mdash;&mdash; Is the
carburetor all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; I've looked at it three times, so far,"
she said, just a little too smoothly.</p>

<p>On the hill five miles to eastward, a line of dust, then
a small car. As it approached, the driver must have
sighted her and increased speed. He came up at
thirty-five miles an hour.</p>

<p>"Now we'll get something done! Look! It's a
bug&mdash;a flivver or a Teal or something. I believe it's
the young man that got us out of the mud."</p>

<p>Milt Daggett stopped, casually greeted them: "Why,
hello, Miss Boltwood. Thought you'd be way ahead
of me some place!"</p>

<p>"Mrwr," said Vere de Vere. What this meant the
historian does not know.</p>

<p>"No; I've been taking it easy. Mr., Uh&mdash;I can't
quite remember your name&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Milt Daggett."</p>

<p>"There's something mysterious the matter with my
car. The engine will start, after it's left alone a while,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
but then it stalls. Do you suppose you could tell what
it is?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'll see if I can find out."</p>

<p>"Then you probably will. The other two men knew
everything. One of them was the inventor of wheels,
and the other discovered skidding. So of course they
couldn't help me."</p>

<p>Milt added nothing to her frivolity, but his smile
was friendly. He lifted the round rubber cap of the
distributor. Then Claire's faith tumbled in the dust.
Twice had the wires been tested. Milt tested them
again. She was too tired of botching to tell him he
was wasting time.</p>

<p>"Got an oil can?" he hesitated.</p>

<p>Through a tiny hole in the plate of the distributor he
dripped two drops of oil&mdash;only two drops. "I guess
maybe that's what it needed. You might try her now,
and see how she runs," he said mildly.</p>

<p>Dubiously Claire started the engine. It sang jubilantly,
and it did not stop. Again was the road open
to her. Again was the settlement over there, to which
it would have taken her an hour to walk, only six minutes
away.</p>

<p>She stopped the engine, beamed at him&mdash;there in the
dust, on the quiet hilltop. He said as apologetically
as though he had been at fault, "Distributor got
dry. Might give it a little oil about once in six
months."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>"We are so grateful to you! Twice now you've
saved our lives."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess you'd have gone on living! And if
drivers can't help each other, who can?"</p>

<p>"That's a good start toward world-fellowship, I
suppose. I wish we could do&mdash;&mdash; Return your lunch
or&mdash;&mdash; Mr. Daggett! Do you read books? I
mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes I do, when I run across them."</p>

<p>"Mayn't I gi&mdash;lend you these two that I happen
to have along? I've finished them, and so has father,
I think."</p>

<p>From the folds of the strapped-down top she pulled
out Compton Mackenzie's <i>Youth's Encounter</i>, and
Vachel Lindsay's <i>Congo</i>. With a curious faint excitement
she watched him turn the leaves. His blunt
fingers flapped through them as though he was used
to books. As he looked at <i>Congo</i>, he exclaimed,
"Poetry! That's fine! Like it, but I don't hardly
ever run across it. I&mdash;&mdash; Say&mdash;&mdash; I'm terribly
obliged!"</p>

<p>His clear face lifted, sun-brown and young and
adoring. She had not often seen men look at her
thus. Certainly Jeff Saxton's painless worship did
not turn him into the likeness of a knight among banners.
Yet the good Geoffrey loved her, while to Milt
Daggett she could be nothing more than a strange
young woman in a car with a New York license. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
her tiny gift could so please him, how poor he must
be. "He probably lives on some barren farm," she
thought, "or he's a penniless mechanic hoping for a
good job in Seattle. How white his forehead is!"</p>

<p>But aloud she was saying, "I hope you're enjoying
your trip."</p>

<p>"Oh yes. I like it fine. You having a good time?
Well&mdash;&mdash; Well, thanks for the books."</p>

<p>She was off before him. Presently she exclaimed
to Mr. Boltwood: "You know&mdash;just occurs to me&mdash;it's
rather curious that our young friend should be so
coincidental as to come along just when we needed
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he just happened to, I suppose," hemmed her
father.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," she meditated, while she absently
watched another member of the Poultry Suicide
Club rush out of a safe ditch, prepare to take leave
for immortality, change her fowlish mind, flutter up
over the hood of the car, and come down squawking
her indignities to the barnyard. "I'm not so sure
about his happening&mdash;&mdash; No. I wonder if he could
possibly&mdash;&mdash; Oh no. I hope not. Flattering, but&mdash;&mdash; You
don't suppose he could be deliberately following
us?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! He's a perfectly decent young chap."</p>

<p>"I know. Of course. He probably works hard in
a garage, and is terribly nice to his mother and sisters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
at home. I mean&mdash;&mdash; I wouldn't want the dear lamb
to be a devoted knight, though. Too thankless a job."</p>

<p>She slowed the car down to fifteen an hour. For
the first time she began to watch the road behind her.
In a few minutes a moving spot showed in the dust
three miles back. Oh, naturally; he would still be
behind her. Only&mdash;&mdash; If she stopped, just to look at
the scenery, he would go on ahead of her. She
stopped for a moment&mdash;for a time too brief to indicate
that anything had gone wrong with her car. Staring
back she saw that the bug stopped also, and she fancied
that Milt was out standing beside it, peering with his
palm over his eyes&mdash;a spy, unnatural and disturbing
in the wide peace.</p>

<p>She drove on a mile and halted again; again halted
her attendant. He was keeping a consistent two to
four miles behind, she estimated.</p>

<p>"This won't do at all," she worried. "Flattering,
but somehow&mdash;&mdash; Whatever sort of a cocoon-wrapped
hussy I am, I don't collect scalps. I won't
have young men serving me&mdash;graft on them&mdash;get
amusement out of their struggles. Besides&mdash;suppose
he became just a little more friendly, each time he
came up, all the way from here to Seattle?... Fresh.... No,
it won't do."</p>

<p>She ran the car to the side of the road.</p>

<p>"More trouble?" groaned her father.</p>

<p>"No. Just want to see scenery."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>"But&mdash;&mdash; There's a good deal of scenery on all
sides, without stopping, seems to me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;" She looked back. Milt had come
into sight; had paused to take observations. Her
father caught it:</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Pardon me. Our squire still following?
Let him go on ahead? Wise lass."</p>

<p>"Yes. I think perhaps it's better to avoid complications."</p>

<p>"Of course." Mr. Boltwood's manner did not
merely avoid Milt; it abolished him.</p>

<p>She saw Milt, after five minutes of stationary watching,
start forward. He came dustily rattling up with
a hail of "Distributor on strike again?" so cheerful
that it hurt her to dismiss him. But she had managed
a household. She was able to say suavely:</p>

<p>"No, everything is fine. I'm sure it will be, now.
I'm afraid we are holding you back. You mustn't
worry about us."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," breezily. "Something might
go wrong. Say, is this poetry book&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I'm sure nothing will go wrong now. You
mustn't feel responsible for us. But, uh, you understand
we're very grateful for what you have done
and, uh, perhaps we shall see each other in Seattle?"
She made it brightly interrogatory.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see." His hands gripped the wheel. His
cheeks had been too ruddily tinted by the Dakota sun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to show a blush, but his teeth caught his lower lip.
He had no starter on his bug; he had in his embarrassment
to get out and crank. He did it quietly, not
looking at her. She could see that his hand trembled
on the crank. When he did glance at her, as he drove
off, it was apologetically, miserably. His foot was
shaking on the clutch pedal.</p>

<p>The dust behind his car concealed him. For twenty
miles she was silent, save when she burst out to her
father, "I do hope you're enjoying the trip. It's so
easy to make people unhappy. I wonder&mdash;&mdash; No.
Had to be done."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
THE DISCOVERY OF CANNED SHRIMPS AND HESPERIDES</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">On</span> the morning when Milt Daggett had awakened
to sunshine in the woods north of Gopher
Prairie, he had discovered the golden age. As mile
on mile he jogged over new hills, without having to
worry about getting back to his garage in time to
repair somebody's car, he realized that for the past
two years he had forced himself to find contentment in
building up a business that had no future.</p>

<p>Now he laughed and whooped; he drove with one
foot inelegantly and enchantingly up on the edge of
the cowl; he made Lady Vere de Vere bow to
astounded farmers; he went to the movies every
evening&mdash;twice, in Fargo; and when the chariot of the
young prince swept to the brow of a hill, he murmured,
not in the manner of a bug-driver but with a stinging
awe, "All that big country! Ours to see, puss! We'll
settle down some day and be solid citizens and raise
families and wheeze when we walk, but&mdash;&mdash; All those
hills to sail over and&mdash;&mdash; Come on! Lez sail!"</p>

<p>Milt attended the motion pictures every evening,
and he saw them in a new way. As recently as one
week before he had preferred those earnest depictions
in which hard-working, moral actors shoot one another,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
or ride the most uncomfortable horses up mountainsides.
But now, with a mental apology to that
propagandist of lowbrowism, the absent Mac, he chose
the films in which the leading men wore evening
clothes, and no one ever did anything without being
assisted by a "man." Aside from the pictures Milt's
best tutors were traveling men. Though he measured
every cent, and for his campfire dinners bought modest
chuck steaks, he had at least one meal a day at a hotel,
to watch the traveling men.</p>

<p>To Claire, traveling men were merely commercial
persons in hard-boiled suits. She identified them with
the writing-up of order-slips on long littered writing-tables,
and with hotels that reduced the delicate arts
of dining and sleeping to gray greasiness. But Milt
knew traveling men. He knew that not only were
they the missionaries of business, supplementing the
taking of orders by telling merchants how to build up
trade, how to trim windows and treat customers like
human beings; but also that they, as much as the local
ministers and doctors and teachers and newspapermen,
were the agents in spreading knowledge and
justice. It was they who showed the young men how
to have their hair cut&mdash;and to wash behind the ears
and shave daily; they who encouraged villagers to rise
from scandal and gossip to a perception of the Great
World, of politics and sports, and some measure of art
and science.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>Claire, and indeed her father and Mr. Jeff Saxton as
well, had vaguely concluded that because drummers
were always to be seen in soggy hotels and badly connecting
trains and the headachy waiting-rooms of
stations, they must like these places. Milt knew that
the drummers were martyrs; that for months of a
trip, all the while thinking of the children back home,
they suffered from landlords and train schedules; that
they were Claire's best allies in fighting the Great
American Frying Pan; that they knew good things,
and fought against the laziness and impositions of
people who "kept hotel" because they had failed as
farmers; and that when they did find a landlord who
was cordial and efficient, they went forth mightily
advertising that glorious man. The traveling men, he
knew, were pioneers in spats.</p>

<p>Hence it was to the traveling men, not to supercilious
tourists in limousines, that Milt turned for
suggestions as to how to perform the miracle of changing
from an ambitious boy into what Claire would
recognize as a charming man. He had not met enough
traveling men at Schoenstrom. They scooped up what
little business there was, and escaped from the Leipzig
House to spend the night at St. Cloud or Sauk Centre.</p>

<p>In the larger towns in Minnesota and Dakota, after
evening movies, before slipping out to his roadside
camp Milt inserted himself into a circle of traveling
men in large leather chairs, and ventured, "Saw a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Gomez-Dep with a New York license down the line
today."</p>

<p>"Oh. You driving through?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Going to Seattle."</p>

<p>That distinguished Milt from the ordinary young-men-loafers,
and he was admitted as one of the assembly
of men who traveled and saw things and
wondered about the ways of men. It was good talk
he heard; too much of hotels, and too many tight
banal little phrases suggesting the solution of all
economic complexities by hanging "agitators," but
with this, an exciting accumulation of impressions of
Vancouver and San Diego, Florida and K. C.</p>

<p>"That's a wonderful work farm they have at
Duluth," said one, and the next, "speaking of that,
I was in Chicago last week, and I saw a play&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Milt had, in his two years of high school in St.
Cloud, and in his boyhood under the genial but
abstracted eye of the Old Doctor, learned that it was
not well thought of to use the knife as a hod and to
plaster mashed potatoes upon it, as was the custom in
Mac's Old Home Lunch at Schoenstrom. But the
arts of courteously approaching oysters, salad, and
peas were rather unfamiliar to him. Now he studied
forks as he had once studied carburetors, and he gave
spiritual devotion to the nice eating of a canned-shrimp
cocktail&mdash;a lost legion of shrimps, now two thousand
miles and two years away from their ocean home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>He peeped with equal earnestness at the socks and
the shirts of the traveling men. Socks had been to
him not an article of faith but a detail of economy.
His attitude to socks had lacked in reverence and
technique. He had not perceived that socks may be
as sound a symbol of culture as the 'cello or even demountable
rims. He had been able to think with
respect of ties and damp piqu&eacute; collars secured by gold
safety-pins; and to the belted fawn overcoat that the
St. Klopstock banker's son had brought back from St.
Paul, he had given jealous attention. But now he
graduated into differential socks.</p>

<p>By his campfire, sighing to the rather somnolent
Vere de Vere, he scornfully yanked his extra pairs of
thick, white-streaked, yellow cotton socks from the
wicker suitcase, and uttered anathema:</p>

<p>"Begone, ye unworthy and punk-looking raiment.
I know ye! Ye werst a bargain and two pairs for two
bits. But even as Adolph Zolzac and an agent for flivver
accessories are ye become in my eyes, ye generation
of vipers, ye clumsy, bag-footed, wrinkle-sided
gunny-sacking ye!"</p>

<p>Next day, in the woods, a happy hobo found that
the manna-bringing ravens had left him four pairs of
good socks.</p>

<p>Five quite expensive pairs of silk and lisle socks
Milt purchased&mdash;all that the general merchant at Jeppe
had in stock. What they lost in suitability to touring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and to private laundering at creeks, they gained
as symbols. Milt felt less shut out from the life of
leisure. Now, in Seattle, say, he could go into a good
hotel with less fear of the clerks.</p>

<p>He added attractive outing shirts, ties neither too
blackly dull nor too flashily crimson, and a vicious
nail-brush which simply tore out the motor grease
that had grown into the lines of his hands. Also
he added a book.</p>

<p>The book was a rhetoric. Milt knew perfectly that
there was an impertinence called grammar, but it had
never annoyed him much. He knew that many persons
preferred "They were" to "They was," and were
nervous in the presence of "ain't." One teacher in St.
Cloud had buzzed frightfully about these minuti&aelig;.
But Milt discovered that grammar was only the beginning
of woes. He learned that there were such mental
mortgages as figures of speech and the choice of synonyms.
He had always known, but he had never passionately
felt that the invariable use of "hell," "doggone,"
and "You bet!" left certain subtleties unexpressed.
Now he was finding subtleties which he
had to express.</p>

<p>As joyously adventurous as going on day after day
was his experimentation in voicing his new observations.
He gave far more eagerness to it than Claire
Boltwood had. Gustily intoning to Vere de Vere,
who was the perfect audience, inasmuch as she never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
had anything to say but "Mrwr," and didn't mind
being interrupted in that, he clamored, "The prairies
are the sea. In the distance they are kind of silvery&mdash;no&mdash;they
are dim silver; and way off on the skyline
are the Islands of the&mdash;of the&mdash;&mdash; Now what the devil
was them, were those, islands in the mythology book
in high school? Of the&mdash;Blessed? Great snakes'
boots, you're an ignorant cat, Vere! Hesperyds? No!
Hesperides! Yea, bo'! Now that man in the hotel:
'May I trouble you for the train guide? Thanks so
much!' But how much is so much?"</p>

<p>As Claire's days were set free by her consciousness
of sun and brown earth, so Milt's odyssey was only
the more valorous in his endeavor to criticize life. He
saw that Mac's lunch room had not been an altogether
satisfactory home; that Mac's habit of saying to dissatisfied
customers, "If you don't like it, get out," had
lacked something of courtesy. Staring at towns along
the way, Milt saw that houses were not merely large
and comfortable, or small and stingy; but that there
was an interesting thing he remembered hearing his
teachers call "good taste."</p>

<p>He was not the preoccupied Milt of the garage but
a gay-eyed gallant, the evening when he gave a lift to
the school-teacher and drove her from the district
school among the wild roses and the corn to her home
in the next town. She was a neat, tripping, trim-sided
school-teacher of nineteen or twenty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>"You're going out to Seattle? My! That's a wonderful
trip. Don't you get tired?" she adored.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. And I'm seeing things. I used to think
everything worth while was right near my own town."</p>

<p>"You're so wise to go places. Most of the boys I
know don't think there is any world beyond Jimtown
and Fargo."</p>

<p>She glowed at him. Milt was saying to himself,
"Am I a fool? I probably could make this girl fall
in love with me. And she's better than I am; so darn
neat and clean and gentle. We'd be happy. She's a
nice comfy fire, and here I go like a boob, chasing after
a lone, cold star like Miss Boltwood, and probably I'll
fall into all the slews from hell to breakfast on the
way. But&mdash;&mdash; I'd get sleepy by a comfy fire."</p>

<p>"Are you thinking hard? You're frowning so,"
ventured the school-teacher.</p>

<p>"Didn't mean to. 'Scuse!" he laughed. One hand
off the steering wheel, he took her hand&mdash;a fresh,
cool, virginal hand, snuggling into his, suddenly stirring
him. He wanted to hold it tighter. The lamenting
historian of love's pilgrimage must set down the
fact that the pilgrim for at least a second forgot the
divine tread of the goddess Claire, and made rapid
calculation that he could, in a pinch, drive from
Schoenstrom to the teacher's town in two days and a
night; that therefore courtship, and this sweet white
hand resting in his, were not impossible. Milt himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
did not know what it was that made him lay down the
hand and say, so softly that he was but half audible
through the rattle of the engine:</p>

<p>"Isn't this a slick, mean to say glorious evening?
Sky rose and then that funny lavender. And that new
moon&mdash;&mdash; Makes me think of&mdash;the girl I'm in love
with."</p>

<p>"You're engaged?" wistfully.</p>

<p>"Not exactly but&mdash;&mdash; Say, did you study rhetoric in
Normal School? I have a rhetoric that's got all kind
of poetic extracts, you know, and quotations and
everything, from the big writers, Stevenson and all.
Always been so practical, making a garage pay, never
thought much about how I said things as long as I
could say 'No!' and say it quick. 'Cept maybe when
I was talking to the prof there. But it's great sport to
see how musical you can make a thing sound. Words.
Like Shenandoah. Gol-lee! Isn't that a wonderful
word? Makes you see old white mansion, and mocking
birds&mdash;&mdash; Wonder if a fellow could be a big
engineer, you know, build bridges and so on, and still
talk about, oh, beautiful things? What d' you think,
girlie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure you could!"</p>

<p>Her admiration, the proximity of her fragrant
slightness, was pleasant in the dusk, but he did not
press her hand again, even when she whispered, "Good
night, and thank you&mdash;oh, thank you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>If Milt had been driving at the rate at which he
usually made his skipjack carom over the roads about
Schoenstrom, he would by now have been through
Dakota, into Montana. But he was deliberately holding
down the speed. When he had been tempted by a
smooth stretch to go too breathlessly, he halted, teased
Vere de Vere, climbed out and, sitting on a hilltop, his
hands about his knees, drenched his soul with the
vision of amber distances.</p>

<p>He tried so to time his progress that he might always
be from three to five miles behind Claire&mdash;distant
enough to be unnoticed, near enough to help in case
of need. For behind poetic expression and the use of
forks was the fact that his purpose in life was to know
Claire.</p>

<p>When he was caught, when Claire informed him
that he "mustn't worry about her"; when, slowly, he
understood that she wasn't being neighborly and interested
in his making time, he wanted to escape, never
to see her again.</p>

<p>For thirty miles his cheeks were fiery. He, most
considerate of roadmen, crowded a woman in a flivver,
passed a laboring car on an upgrade with such a burst
that the uneasy driver bumped off into a ditch. He
hadn't really seen them. Only mechanically had he
got past them. He was muttering:</p>

<p>"She thought I was trying to butt in! Stung
again! Like a small boy in love with teacher. And I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
thought I was so wise! Cussed out Mac&mdash;blamed
Mac&mdash;no, damn all the fine words&mdash;cussed out Mac
for being the village rumhound. Boozing is twice as
sensible as me. See a girl, nice dress&mdash;start for
Seattle! Two thousand miles away! Of course she
bawled me out. She was dead right. Boob! Yahoo!
Goat!"</p>

<p>He caught up Vere de Vere, rubbed her fur against
his cheek while he mourned, "Oh, puss, you got to be
nice to me. I thought I'd do big things. And then the
alarm clock went off. I'm back in Schoenstrom. For
keeps, I guess. I didn't know I had feelings that could
get hurt like this. Thought I had a rhinoceros
hide. But&mdash;&mdash; Oh, it isn't just feeling ashamed
over being a fool. It's that&mdash;&mdash; Won't ever see her
again. Not once. Way I saw her through the window,
at that hotel, in that blue silky dress&mdash;that
funny long line of buttons, and her throat. Never
have dinner&mdash;lunch&mdash;with her by the road&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In the reaction of anger he demanded of Vere de
Vere, "What the deuce do I care? If she's chump
enough to chase away a crack garage man that's gone
batty and wants to work for nothing, let her go on
and hit some crook garage and get stuck for an entire
overhauling. What do I care? Had nice trip; that's
all I wanted. Never did intend to go clear to Seattle,
anyway. Go on to Butte, then back home. No more
fussing about fool table-manners and books, and I certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
will cut out tagging behind her! No, sir!
Nev-er again!"</p>

<p>It was somewhat inconsistent to add, "There's a
bully place&mdash;sneak in and let her get past me again.
But she won't catch me following next time!"</p>

<p>While he tried to keep up his virtuous anger, he
was steering into an abandoned farmyard, parking
the car behind cottonwoods and neglected tall currant
bushes which would conceal it from the road.</p>

<p>The windows of the deserted house stared at him;
a splintered screen door banged in every breeze.
Lichens leered from the cracks of the porch. The
yard was filled with a litter of cottonwood twigs, and
over the flower garden hulked ragged weeds. In the
rank grass about the slimy green lip of the well,
crickets piped derisively. The barn-door was open.
Stray kernels of wheat had sprouted between the
spokes of a rusty binder-wheel. A rat slipped across
the edge of the shattered manger. As dusk came on,
gray things seemed to slither past the upper windows
of the house, and somewhere, under the roof, there
was a moaning. Milt was sure that it was the wind
in a knothole. He told himself that he was absolutely
sure about it. And every time it came he stroked
Vere de Vere carefully, and once, when the moaning
ended in the slamming of the screen door, he said,
"Jiminy!"</p>

<p>This boy of the unghostly cylinders and tangible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
magnetos had never seen a haunted house. To toil of
the harvest field and machine shop and to trudging
the sun-beaten road he was accustomed, but he had
never crouched watching the slinking spirits of old
hopes and broken aspirations; feeble phantoms of the
first eager bridegroom who had come to this place, and
the mortgage-crushed, rust-wheat-ruined man who
had left it. He wanted to leap into the bug and go on.
Yet the haunt of murmurous memories dignified his
unhappiness. In the soft, tree-dimmed dooryard
among dry, blazing plains it seemed indecent to go on
growling "Gee," and "Can you beat it?" It was a
young poet, a poet rhymeless and inarticulate, who
huddled behind the shield of untrimmed currant
bushes, and thought of the girl he would never see
again.</p>

<p>He was hungry, but he did not eat. He was
cramped, but he did not move. He picked up the books
she had given him. He was quickened by the powdery
beauty of <i>Youth's Encounter</i>; by the vision of laughter
and dancing steps beneath a streaky gas-glow in the
London fog; of youth not "roughhousing" and wanting
to "be a sport," yet in frail beauty and faded
crimson banners finding such exaltation as Schoenstrom
had never known. But every page suggested
Claire, and he tucked the book away.</p>

<p>In Vachel Lindsay's <i>Congo</i>, in a poem called "The
Santa Fe Trail," he found his own modern pilgrimage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
from another point of view. Here was the poet, disturbed
by the honking hustle of passing cars. But
Milt belonged to the honking and the hustle, and it
was not the soul of the grass that he read in the poem,
but his own sun-flickering flight:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Swiftly the brazen car comes on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It burns in the East as the sunrise burns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see great flashes where the far trail turns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Butting through the delicate mists of the morning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It comes like lightning, goes past roaring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It will hail all the windmills, taunting, ringing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On through the ranges the prairie-dog tills&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scooting past the cattle on the thousand hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho for the tear-horn, scare-horn, dare-horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho for the gay-horn, bark-horn, bay-horn.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Milt did not reflect that if the poet had watched the
Teal bug go by, he would not have recorded a scare-horn,
a dare-horn, or anything mightier than a yip-horn.
Milt saw himself a cross-continent racer, with
the envious poet, left behind as a dot on the hill, celebrating
his passing.</p>

<p>"Lord!" he cried. "I didn't know there were
books like these! Thought poetry was all like Longfellow
and Byron. Old boys. Europe. And rhymed
bellyachin' about hard luck. But these books&mdash;they're
me." Very carefully: "No; they're I! And she gave
'em to me! I will see her again! But she won't know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
it. Now be sensible, son! What do you expect? Oh&mdash;nothing.
I'll just go on, and sneak in one more
glimpse of her to take back with me where I belong."</p>

<p>Half an hour after Claire had innocently passed his
ambush, he began to follow her. But not for days was
he careless. If he saw her on the horizon he paused
until she was out of sight. That he might not fail her
in need, he bought a ridiculously expensive pair of
field glasses, and watched her when she stopped by the
road. Once, when both her right rear tire and the
spare were punctured before she could make a town,
Milt from afar saw her patch a tube, pump up the tire
in the dust. He ached to go to her aid&mdash;though it
cannot be said that hand-pumping was his favorite
July afternoon sport.</p>

<p>Lest he encounter her in the streets, he always
camped to the eastward of the town at which she spent
the night. After dusk, when she was likely to end the
day's drive in the first sizable place, he hid his bug in
an alley and, like a spy after the papers, sneaked into
each garage to see if her car was there.</p>

<p>He would stroll in, look about vacuously, and pipe
to the suspicious night attendant, "Seen a traveling
man named Smith?" Usually the garage man snarled,
"No, I ain't seen nobody named Smith. An'thing
else I can do for you?" But once he was so unlucky
as to find the long-missing Mr. Smith!</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was surprised and insistent. Milt had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
do some quick lying. During that interview the cement
floor felt very hard under his fidgeting feet, and he
thought he heard the garage man in the office telephoning,
"Don't think he knows Smith at all. I got a
hunch he's that auto thief that was through here last
summer."</p>

<p>When Claire did not stop in the first town she
reached after twilight, but drove on by dark, he had
to do some perilous galloping to catch up. The lights
of a Teal are excellent for adornment, but they have
no relation to illumination. They are dependent upon
a magneto which is dependent only upon faith.</p>

<p>Once, skittering along by dark, he realized that the
halted car which he had just passed was the Gomez.
He thought he heard a shout behind him, but in a
panic he kept going.</p>

<p>To the burring motor he groaned, "Now I probably
never will see her again. Except that she thinks I'm
such a pest that I dassn't let her know I'm in the same
state, I sure am one successful lover. As a Prince
Charming I win the Vanderbilt Cup. I'm going ahead
backwards so fast I'll probably drop off into the
Atlantic over the next hill!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
THE MAN WITH AGATE EYES</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When</span> her car had crossed the Missouri River
on the swing-ferry between Bismarck and
Mandan, Claire had passed from Middle West to Far
West. She came out on an upland of virgin prairie,
so treeless and houseless, so divinely dipping, so rough
of grass, that she could imagine buffaloes still roving.
In a hollow a real prairie schooner was camped, and
the wandering homestead-seekers were cooking dinner
beside it. From a quilt on the hay in the wagon a
baby peeped, and Claire's heart leaped.</p>

<p>Beyond was her first butte, its sharp-cut sides glittering
yellow, and she fancied that on it the Sioux
scout still sat sentinel, erect on his pony, the feather
bonnet down his back.</p>

<p>Now she seemed to breathe deeper, see farther.
Again she came from unbroken prairie into wheat
country and large towns.</p>

<p>Her impression of the new land was not merely of
sun-glaring breadth. Sometimes, on a cloudy day, the
wash of wheatlands was as brown and lowering and
mysterious as an English moor in the mist. It dwarfed
the far-off houses by its giant enchantment; its brooding
reaches changed her attitude of brisk, gas-driven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
efficiency into a melancholy that was full of hints of
old dark beauty.</p>

<p>Even when the sun came out, and the land was
brazenly optimistic, she saw more than just prosperity.
In a new home, house and barn and windmill square-cornered
and prosaic, plumped down in a field with
wheat coming up to the unporticoed door, a habitation
unshadowed, unsheltered, unsoftened, she found a
frank cleanness, as though the inhabitants looked
squarely out at life, unafraid. She felt that the keen
winds ought to blow away from such a prairie-fronting
post of civilization all mildew and cowardice, all
the mummy dust of ancient fears.</p>

<p>These were not peasants, these farmers. Nor, she
learned, were they the "hicks" of humor. She could
never again encounter without fiery resentment the
Broadway peddler's faith that farmers invariably say
"Waal, by heck." For she had spent an hour talking
to one Dakota farmer, genial-eyed, quiet of speech.
He had explained the relation of alfalfa to soil-chemistry;
had spoken of his daughter, who taught economics
in a state university; and asked Mr. Boltwood
how turbines were hitched up on liners.</p>

<p>In fact, Claire learned that there may be an almost
tolerable state of existence without gardenias or the
news about the latest Parisian imagists.</p>

<p>She dropped suddenly from the vast, smooth-swelling
miles of wheatland into the tortured marvels of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the Bad Lands, and the road twisted in the shadow of
flying buttresses and the terraced tombs of maharajas.
While she tried to pick her way through a herd of
wild, arroyo-bred cattle, she forgot her maneuvering
as she was startled by the stabbing scarlet of a column
of rock marking the place where for months deep
beds of lignite had burned.</p>

<p>Claire had often given lifts to tramping harvesters
and even hoboes along the road; had enjoyed the sight
of their duffle-bags stuck up between the sleek fenders
and the hood, and their talk about people and crops
along the road, as they hung on the running-board.
In the country of long hillslopes and sentinel buttes
between the Dakota Bad Lands and Miles City she
stopped to shout to a man whose plodding heavy back
looked fagged, "Want a ride?"</p>

<p>"Sure! You bet!"</p>

<p>Usually her guests stepped on the right-hand running-board,
beside Mr. Boltwood, and this man was
far over on the right side of the road. But, while she
waited, he sauntered in front of the car, round to her
side, mounted beside her. Before the car had started,
she was sorry to have invited him. He looked her
over grinningly, almost contemptuously. His unabashed
eyes were as bright and hard as agates. Below
them, his nose was twisted a little, his mouth bent
insolently up at one corner, and his square long chin
bristled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>Usually, too, her passengers waited for her to start
the conversation, and talked at Mr. Boltwood rather
than directly to her. But the bristly man spat at her as
the car started, "Going far?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, some distance."</p>

<p>"Expensive car?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Fraid of getting held up?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought about it."</p>

<p>"Pack a cannon, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I quite understand."</p>

<p>"Cannon! Gun! Revolver! Got a revolver, of
course?"</p>

<p>"W-why, no." She spoke uncomfortably. She was
aware that his twinkling eyes were on her throat. His
look made her feel unclean. She tried to think of some
question which would lead the conversation to the
less exclamatory subject of crops. They were on a
curving shelf road beside a shallow valley. The road
was one side of a horseshoe ten miles long. The unprotected
edge of it dropped sharply to fields forty or
fifty feet below.</p>

<p>"Prosperous-looking wheat down there," she said.</p>

<p>"No. Not a bit!" His look seemed to add,
"And you know it&mdash;unless you're a fool!"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Make Glendive tonight?"</p>

<p>"At least that far."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>"Say, lady, how's the chance for borrowin' a couple
of dollars? I was workin' for a Finnski back here a
ways, and he did me dirt&mdash;holdin' out my wages on
me till the end of the month."</p>

<p>"Why, uh&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Claire, not the man, who was embarrassed.</p>

<p>He was snickering, "Come on, don't be a tightwad.
Swell car&mdash;poor man with no eats, not even a two-bits
flop for tonight. Could yuh loosen up and slip
me just a couple bones?"</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood intervened. He looked as uncomfortable
as Claire. "We'll see. It's rather against my
principles to give money to an able-bodied man like
you, even though it is a pleasure to give you a
ride&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure! Don't cost you one red cent!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;and if I could help you get a job, though of
course&mdash;&mdash; Being a stranger out here&mdash;&mdash; Seems
strange to me, though," Mr. Boltwood struggled on,
"that a strong fellow like you should be utterly
destitute, when I see all these farmers able to have
cars&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Their guest instantly abandoned his attitude of
supplication for one of boasting: "Destitute? Who
the hell said I was destitute, heh?" He was snarling
across Claire at Mr. Boltwood. His wet face was
five inches from hers. She drew her head as far back
as she could. She was sure that the man completely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
appreciated her distaste, for his eyes popped with
amusement before he roared on:</p>

<p>"I got plenty of money! Just 'cause I'm hoofin'
it&mdash;&mdash; I don't want no charity from nobody! I could
buy out half these Honyockers! I don't need none of
no man's money!" He was efficiently working himself
into a rage. "Who you calling destitute? All I
wanted was an advance till pay day! Got a check
coming. You high-tone, kid-glove Eastern towerists
want to watch out who you go calling destitute. I bet
I make a lot more money than a lot of your four-flushin'
friends!"</p>

<p>Claire wondered if she couldn't stop the car now,
and tell him to get off. But&mdash;that snapping eye was
too vicious. Before he got off he would say things&mdash;scarring,
vile things, that would never heal in her
brain. Her father was murmuring, "Let's drop him,"
but she softly lied, "No. His impertinence amuses
me."</p>

<p>She drove on, and prayed that he would of himself
leave his uncharitable hosts at the next town.</p>

<p>The man was storming&mdash;with a very meek ending:
"I'm tellin' you! I can make money anywhere! I'm
a crack machinist.... Give me two-bits for a
meal, anyway."</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood reached in his change pocket. He had
no quarter. He pulled out a plump bill-fold. Without
looking at the man, Claire could vision his eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
glistening and his chops dripping as he stared at the
hoard. Mr. Boltwood handed him a dollar bill.
"There, take that, and let's change the subject," said
Mr. Boltwood testily.</p>

<p>"All right, boss. Say, you haven't got a cartwheel
instead of this wrapping paper, have you? I like to
feel my money in my pocket."</p>

<p>"No, sir, I have not!"</p>

<p>"All right, boss. No bad feelin's!"</p>

<p>Then he ignored Mr. Boltwood. His eyes focused
on Claire's face. To steady himself on the running-board
he had placed his left hand on the side of the
car, his right on the back of the seat. That right
hand slid behind her. She could feel its warmth on
her back.</p>

<p>She burst out, flaring, "Kindly do not touch me!"</p>

<p>"Gee, did I touch you, girlie? Why, that's a
shame!" he drawled, his cracked broad lips turning
up in a grin.</p>

<p>An instant later, as they skipped round a bend of
the long, high-hung shelf road, he pretended to sway
dangerously on the running-board, and deliberately
laid his filthy hand on her shoulder. Before she could
say anything he yelped in mock-regret, "Love o'
Mike! 'Scuse me, lady. I almost fell off."</p>

<p>Quietly, seriously, Claire said, "No, that wasn't
accidental. If you touch me again, I'll stop the car
and ask you to walk."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>"Better do it now, dolly!" snapped Mr. Boltwood.</p>

<p>The man hooked his left arm about the side-post of
the open window-shield. It was a strong arm, a firm
grip. He seized her left wrist with his free hand.
Though all the while his eyes grotesquely kept their
amused sparkle, and beside them writhed laughter-wrinkles,
he shouted hoarsely, "You'll stop hell!"
His hand slid from her wrist to the steering wheel. "I
can drive this boat's well as you can. You make one
move to stop, and I steer her over&mdash;&mdash; Blooie! Down
the bank!"</p>

<p>He did twist the front wheels dangerously near to
the outer edge of the shelf road. Mr. Boltwood gazed
at the hand on the wheel. With a quick breath Claire
looked at the side of the road. If the car ran off, it
would shoot down forty feet ... turning over and
over.</p>

<p>"Y-you wouldn't dare, because you'd g-go, too!"
she panted.</p>

<p>"Well, dearuh, you just try any monkey business
and you'll find out how much I'll gggggggo-too! I'll
start you down the joy-slope and jump off, savvy?
Take your foot off that clutch."</p>

<p>She obeyed.</p>

<p>"Pretty lil feet, ain't they, cutie! Shoes cost
about twelve bucks, I reckon. While a better man
than you or old moldy-face there has to hit the pike
in three-dollar brogans. Sit down, yuh fool!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>This last to Mr. Boltwood, who had stood up,
swaying with the car, and struck at him. With a
huge arm the man swept Mr. Boltwood back into the
seat, but without a word to her father, he continued
to Claire:</p>

<p>"And keep your hand where it belongs. Don't go
trying to touch that switch. Aw, be sensible! What
would you do if the car did stop? I could blackjack
you both before this swell-elegant vehickle lost momentum,
savvy? I don't want to pay out my good
money to a lawyer on a charge of&mdash;murder. Get me?
Better take it easy and not worry." His hand was
constantly on the wheel. He had driven cars before.
He was steering as much as she. "When I get you up
the road a piece I'm going to drive all the cute lil
boys and girls up a side trail, and take all of papa's
gosh-what-a-wad in the cunnin' potet-book, and I guess
we'll kiss lil daughter, and drive on, a-wavin' our
hand politely, and let you suckers walk to the next
burg."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't dare! You wouldn't dare!"</p>

<p>"Dare? Huh! Don't make the driver laugh!"</p>

<p>"I'll get help!"</p>

<p>"Yep. Sure. Fact, there's a car comin' toward
us. 'Bout a mile away I'd make it, wouldn't you?
Well, dollface, if you make one peep&mdash;over the bank
you go, both of you dead as a couplin'-pin. Smeared
all over those rocks. Get me? And me&mdash;I'll be sorry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the regrettable accident was so naughty and went and
happened&mdash;and I just got off in time meself. And I'll
pinch papa's poke while I'm helping get out the
bodies!"</p>

<p>Till now she hadn't believed it. But she dared not
glance at the approaching car. It was their interesting
guest who steered the Gomez past the other; and he
ran rather too near the edge of the road ... so
that she looked over, down.</p>

<p>Beaming, he went on, "I'd pull the rough stuff right
here, instead of wastin' my time as a cap'n of industry
by taking you up to see the scenery in that daisy little
gully off the road; but the whole world can see us
along here&mdash;the hicks in the valley and anybody that
happens to sneak along in a car behind us. Shame the
way this road curves&mdash;see too far along it. Fact,
you're giving me a lot of trouble. But you'll give me
a kiss, won't you, Gwendolyn?"</p>

<p>He bent down, chuckling. She could feel his bristly
chin touch her cheek. She sprang up, struck at him.
He raised his hand from the wheel. For a second the
car ran without control. He jabbed her back into the
seat with his elbow. "Don't try any more monkey-shines,
if you know what's good for you," he said,
quite peacefully, as he resumed steering.</p>

<p>She was in a haze, conscious only of her father's
hand fondling hers. She heard a quick pit-pit-pit-pit
behind them. Car going to pass? She'd have to let it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
go by. She'd concentrate on finding something she
could&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then, "Hello, folks. Having a picnic? Who's
your little friend in the rompers?" sang out a voice
beside them. It was Milt Daggett&mdash;the Milt who
must be scores of miles ahead. His bug had caught
up with them, was running even with them on the
broad road.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE HILLSIDE ROAD</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">So</span> unexpectedly, so genially, that Claire wondered
if he realized what was happening, Milt chuckled
to the tough on the running-board, as the two cars
ran side by side, "Bound for some place, brother?"</p>

<p>The unwelcome guest looked puzzled. For the
first time his china eyes ceased twinkling; and he
answered dubiously: "Just gettin' a lift." He sped up
the car with the hand-throttle. Milt accelerated
equally.</p>

<p>Claire roused; wanted to shout. She was palsied
afraid that Milt would leave them. The last time she
had seen him, she had suggested that leaving them
would be a favor.</p>

<p>Her guest growled at her&mdash;the words coming
through a slit at the corner of his rowdy mouth, "Sit
still, or I'll run you over."</p>

<p>Milt innocently babbled on, "Better come ride with
me, bo'. More room in this-here handsome coupelet."</p>

<p>Then was the rough relieved in his uneasy tender
little heart, and his eyes flickered again as he shouted
back, not looking at Milt, "Thanks, bub, I'll stick by
me friends."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>"Oh no; can't lose pleasure of your company. I
like your looks. You're a bloomin' little island
way off on the dim silver skyline." Claire knitted
her brows. She had not seen Milt's rhetoric. "You're
an island of Hesperyds or Hesperides. Accent on the
bezuzus. Oh, yes, moondream, I think you better
come. Haven't decided"&mdash;Milt's tone was bland&mdash;"whether
to kill you or just have you pinched. Miss
Boltwood! Switch off your power!"</p>

<p>"If she does," the tough shouted, "I'll run 'em off
the bank."</p>

<p>"No, you won't, sweetheart, 'cause why? 'Cause
what'll I do to you afterwards?"</p>

<p>"You won't do nothin', Jack, 'cause I'd gouge your
eyes out."</p>

<p>"Why, lovesoul, d' you suppose I'd be talking up
as brash as this to a bid, stwong man like oo if I
didn't have a gun handy?"</p>

<p>"Yuh, I guess so, lil sunbeam. And before you
could shoot, I'd crowd your tin liz into the bank, and
jam right into it! I may get killed, but you won't
even be a grease-spot!"</p>

<p>He was turning the Gomez from its straight course,
forcing Milt's bug toward the high bank of earth
which walled in the road on the left.</p>

<p>While Claire was very sick with fear, then more
sick with contempt, Milt squealed, "You win!" And
he had dropped back. The Gomez was going on alone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>There was only one thing more for Claire&mdash;to jump.
And that meant death.</p>

<p>The tough was storming, "Your friend's a crack
shot&mdash;with his mouth!"</p>

<p>The thin pit-pit-pit was coming again. She looked
back. She saw Milt's bug snap forward so fast that
on a bump its light wheels were in the air. She saw
Milt standing on the right side of the bug holding the
wheel with one hand, and the other hand&mdash;firm, grim,
broad-knuckled hand&mdash;outstretched toward the tough,
then snatching at his collar.</p>

<p>The tough's grip was torn from the steering wheel.
He was yanked from the running-board. He crunched
down on the road.</p>

<p>She seized the wheel. She drove on at sixty miles
an hour. She had gone a good mile before she got
control of her fear and halted. She saw Milt turn
his little car as though it were a prancing bronco. It
seemed to paw the air with its front wheels. He shot
back, pursuing the late guest. The man ran bobbing
along the road. At this distance he was no longer
formidable, but a comic, jerking, rabbity figure, humping
himself over the back track.</p>

<p>As the bug whirled down on him, the tough was to
be seen throwing up his hands, leaping from the high
bank.</p>

<p>Milt turned again and came toward them, but
slowly; and after he had drawn up even and switched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
off the engine, he snatched off his violent plaid cap
and looked apologetic.</p>

<p>"Sorry I had to kid him along. I was afraid he
really would drive you off the bank. He was a bad
actor. And he was right; he could have licked me.
Thought maybe I could jolly him into getting off, and
have him pinched, next town."</p>

<p>"But you had a gun&mdash;a revolver&mdash;didn't you,
lad?" panted Mr. Boltwood.</p>

<p>"Um, wellllll&mdash;&mdash; I've got a shotgun. It wouldn't
take me more 'n five or ten minutes to dig it out, and
put it together. And there's some shells. They may
be all right. Haven't looked at 'em since last fall.
They didn't get so awful damp then."</p>

<p>"But suppose he'd had a revolver himself?" wailed
Claire.</p>

<p>"Gee, you know, I thought he probably did have
one. I was scared blue. I had a wrench to throw at
him though," confided Milt.</p>

<p>"How did you know we needed you?"</p>

<p>"Why back there, couple miles behind you, maybe I
saw your father get up and try to wrestle him, so I
suspected there was kind of a disagreement. Say,
Miss Boltwood, you know when you spoke to me&mdash;way
back there&mdash;I hadn't meant to butt in. Honest.
I thought maybe as we were going&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;the same way, you wouldn't mind my trailing,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
if I didn't sit in too often; and I thought maybe I
could help you if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! I'm so ashamed! So bitterly
ashamed! I just meant&mdash;&mdash; Will you forgive me?
You were so good, taking care of us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure, that's all right!"</p>

<p>"I fancy you do know how grateful father and I
are that you were behind us, this time! Wasn't it a
lucky accident that we'd slipped past you some place!"</p>

<p>"Yes," dryly, "quite an accident. Well, I'll skip
on ahead again. May run into you again before we
hit Seattle. Going to take the run through Yellowstone
Park?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;" began Claire. Her father interrupted:</p>

<p>"Uh, Mr., uh&mdash;Daggett, was it?&mdash;I wonder if you
won't stay a little closer to us hereafter? I was getting
rather a good change out of the trip, but I'm
afraid that now&mdash;&mdash; If it wouldn't be an insult, I'd
beg you to consider staying with us for a consideration,
uh, you know, remuneration, and you could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks, uh, thank you, sir, but I wouldn't like to
do it. You see, it's kind of my vacation. If I've done
anything I'm tickled&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But perhaps," Mr. Boltwood ardently begged the
young man recently so abysmally unimportant, "perhaps
you would consent to being my guest, when you
cared to&mdash;say at hotels in the Park."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>"'Fraid I couldn't. I'm kind of a lone wolf."</p>

<p>"Please! Pretty please!" besought Claire. Her
smile was appealing, her eyes on his.</p>

<p>Milt bit his knuckles. He looked weak. But he
persisted, "No, you'll get over this scrap with our
friend. By the way, I'll put the deputy onto him, in
the next town. He'll never get out of the county.
When you forget him&mdash;&mdash; Oh no, you can go on fine.
You're a good steady driver, and the road's perfectly
safe&mdash;if you give people the once-over before you pick
'em up. Picking up badmen is no more dangerous
here than it would be in New York. Fact, there's lot
more hold-ups in any city than in the wildest country.
I don't think you showed such awfully good taste in
asking Terrible Tim, the two-gun man, right into the
parlor. Gee, please don't do it again! Please!"</p>

<p>"No," meekly. "I was an idiot. I'll be good,
next time. But won't you stay somewhere near us?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to, but I got to chase on. Don't want to
wear out the welcome on the doormat, and I'm due in
Seattle, and&mdash;&mdash; Say, Miss Boltwood." He swung
out of the bug, cranked up, climbed back, went awkwardly
on, "I read those books you gave me. They're
slick&mdash;mean to say, interesting. Where that young
fellow in <i>Youth's Encounter</i> wanted to be a bishop
and a soldier and everything&mdash;&mdash; Just like me, except
Schoenstrom is different, from London, some ways!
I always wanted to be a brakie, and then a yeggman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
But I wasn't bright enough for either. I just became
a garage man. And I&mdash;&mdash; Some day I'm going to
stop using slang. But it'll take an operation!"</p>

<p>He was streaking down the road, and Claire was
sobbing, "Oh, the lamb, the darling thing! Fretting
about his slang, when he wasn't afraid in that horrible
nightmare. If we could just do something for him!"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about him, dolly. He's a very
energetic chap. And&mdash;&mdash; Uh&mdash;&mdash; Mightn't we
drive on a little farther, perhaps? I confess that the
thought of our recent guest still in this vicinity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I'm shameless. If Mohammed
Milton won't stay with our car mountain, we're going
to tag after him."</p>

<p>But when she reached the next hill, with its far
shining outlook, there was no Milt and no Teal bug
on the road ahead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
SAGEBRUSH TOURISTS OF THE GREAT HIGHWAY</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">She</span> had rested for two days in Miles City; had
seen the horse-market, with horse-wranglers in
chaps; had taken dinner with army people at Fort
Keogh, once the bulwark against the Sioux, now nodding
over the dry grass on its parade ground.</p>

<p>By the Yellowstone River, past the Crow reservation,
Claire had driven on through the Real West,
along the Great Highway. The Red Trail and the
Yellowstone Trail had joined now and she was one of
the new Canterbury Pilgrims. Even Mr. Boltwood
caught the trick of looking for licenses, and cried,
"There's a Connecticut car!"</p>

<p>To the Easterner, a drive from New York to Cape
Cod, over asphalt, is viewed as heroic, but here were
cars that had casually started on thousand-mile vacations.
She kept pace not only with large cars touring
from St. Louis or Detroit to Glacier Park and Yellowstone,
but also she found herself companionable with
families of workmen, headed for a new town and a
new job, and driving because a flivver, bought second-hand
and soon to be sold again, was cheaper than
trains.</p>

<p>"Sagebrush Tourists" these camping adventurers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
were called. Claire became used to small cars, with
curtain-lights broken, bearing wash-boilers or refrigerators
on the back, pasteboard suitcases lashed by
rope to the running-board, frying pans and canvas
water bottles dangling from top-rods. And once
baby's personal laundry was seen flapping on a line
across a tonneau!</p>

<p>In each car was what looked like the crowd at a
large farm-auction&mdash;grandfather, father, mother, a
couple of sons and two or three daughters, at least
one baby in the arms of each grown-up, all jammed
into two seats already filled with trunks and baby-carriages.
And they were happy&mdash;incredibly happier
than the smart people being conveyed in a bored way
behind chauffeurs.</p>

<p>The Sagebrush Tourists made camp; covered the
hood with a quilt from which the cotton was oozing;
brought out the wash-boiler, did a washing, had dinner,
sang about the fire; granther and the youngest
baby gamboling together, while the limousinvalids, insulated
from life by plate glass, preserved by their
steady forty an hour from the commonness of seeing
anything along the road, looked out at the campers
for a second, sniffed, rolled on, wearily wondering
whether they would find a good hotel that night&mdash;and
why the deuce they hadn't come by train.</p>

<p>If Claire Boltwood had been protected by Jeff
Saxton or by a chauffeur, she, too, would probably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
have marveled at cars gray with dust, the unshaved
men in fleece-lined duck coats, and the women wind-burnt
beneath the boudoir caps they wore as motoring
bonnets. But Claire knew now that filling grease-cups
does not tend to delicacy of hands; that when you
wash with a cake of petrified pink soap and half a
pitcher of cold hard water, you never quite get the
stain off&mdash;you merely get through the dust stratum
to the Laurentian grease formation, and mutter, "a
nice clean grease doesn't hurt food," and go sleepily
down to dinner.</p>

<p>She saw a dozen camping devices unknown to the
East: trailers, which by day bobbed along behind the
car like coffins on two wheels, but at night opened into
tents with beds, an ice-box, a table; tents covering a
bed whose head rested on the running-board; beds
made-up in the car, with the cushions as mattresses.</p>

<p>The Great Transcontinental Highway was colored
not by motors alone. It is true that the Old West of
the stories is almost gone; that Billings, Miles City,
Bismarck, are more given to Doric banks than to
gambling hells. But still are there hints of frontier
days. Still trudge the prairie schooners; cowpunchers
in chaps still stand at the doors of log cabins&mdash;when
they are tired of playing the automatic piano; and
blanket Indians, Blackfeet and Crows, stare at five-story
buildings&mdash;when they are not driving modern
reapers on their farms.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>They all waved to Claire. Telephone linemen, lolling
with pipes and climber-strapped legs in big trucks,
sang out to her; traction engine crews shouted; and
these she found to be her own people. Only once did
she lose contentment&mdash;when, on the observation platform
of a train bound for Seattle, she saw a Britisher
in flannels and a monocle, headed perhaps for the
Orient. As the train slipped silkenly away, the Gomez
seemed slow and clumsy, and the strain of driving
intolerable. And that Britisher must be charming&mdash;&mdash; Then
a lonely, tight-haired woman in the doorway of
a tar-paper shack waved to her, and in that wistful
gesture Claire found friendship.</p>

<p>And sometimes in the "desert" of yet unbroken
land she paused by the Great Highway and forgot
the passion to keep going&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>She sat on a rock, by a river so muddy that it was
like yellow milk. The only trees were a bunch of cottonwoods
untidily scattering shreds of cotton, and
the only other vegetation left in the dead world was
dusty green sagebrush with lumps of gray yet pregnant
earth between, or a few exquisite green and white
flashes of the herb called Snow-on-the-Mountain. The
inhabitants were jackrabbits, or American magpies in
sharp black and white livery, forever trying to balance
their huge tails against the wind, and yelling in low-magpie
their opinion of tourists.</p>

<p>She did not desire gardens, then, nor the pettiness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
of plump terraced hills. She was in the Real West,
and it was hers, since she had won to it by her own
plodding. Her soul&mdash;if she hadn't had one, it would
immediately have been provided, by special arrangement,
the moment she sat there&mdash;sailed with the hawks
in the high thin air, and when it came down it sang
hallelujahs, because the sagebrush fragrance was more
healing than piney woods, because the sharp-bitten
edges of the buttes were coral and gold and basalt and
turquoise, and because a real person, one Milt Daggett,
though she would never see him again, had found her
worthy of worship.</p>

<p>She did not often think of Milt; she did not know
whether he was ahead of her, or had again dropped
behind. When she did recall him, it was with respect
quite different from the titillation that dancing men
had sometimes aroused, or the impression of manicured
agreeableness and efficiency which Jeff Saxton
carried about.</p>

<p>She always supplicated the mythical Milt in moments
of tight driving. Driving, just the actual getting on,
was her purpose in life, and the routine of driving was
her order of the day: Morning freshness, rolling up
as many miles as possible before lunch, that she might
loaf afterward. The invariable two <span class="smcapl">P.M.</span> discovery
that her eyes ached, and the donning of huge amber
glasses, which gave to her lithe smartness a counterfeit
scholarliness. Toward night, the quarter-hour of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
level sun-glare which prevented her seeing the road.
Dusk, and the discovery of how much light there was
after all, once she remembered to take off her glasses.
The worst quarter-hour when, though the roads were
an amethyst rich to the artist, they were also a murkiness
exasperating to the driver, yet still too light to be
thrown into relief by the lamps. The mystic moment
when night clicked tight, and the lamps made a fan
of gold, and Claire and her father settled down to
plodding content&mdash;and no longer had to take the
trouble of admiring the scenery!</p>

<p>The morning out of Billings, she wondered why a
low cloud so persistently held its shape, and realized
that it was a far-off mountain, her first sight of the
Rockies. Then she cried out, and wished for Milt to
share her exultation. Rather earnestly she said to
Mr. Boltwood:</p>

<p>"The mountains must be so wonderful to Mr. Daggett,
after spending his life in a cornfield. Poor Milt!
I hope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think you need to worry about that young
man. I fancy he's quite able to run about by himself,
as jolly as a sand-dog. And&mdash;&mdash; Of course I'm extremely
grateful to him for his daily rescue of us from
the jaws of death, but he was right; if he had stayed
with us, it would have been inconvenient to keep
considering him. He isn't accustomed to the comedy
of manners&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>"He ought to be. He'd enjoy it so. He's the real
American. He has imagination and adaptability. It's
a shame: all the <i>petits fours</i> and Bach recitals wasted
on Jeff Saxton, when a Milt Dag&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, quite so!"</p>

<p>"No, honest! The dear honey-lamb, so ingenious,
and really, rather good-looking. But so lonely and
gregarious&mdash;like a little woolly dog that begs you to
come and play; and I slapped him when he patted his
paws and gamboled&mdash;&mdash; It was horrible. I'll never
forgive myself. Making him drive on ahead in that
nasty, patronizing way&mdash;&mdash; I feel as if we'd spoiled
his holiday. I wonder if he had intended to make the
Yellowstone Park trip? He didn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Let's forget the young man. Look!
How very curious!"</p>

<p>They were crossing a high bridge over a railroad
track along which a circus train was bending. Mr.
Boltwood offered judicious remarks upon the migratory
habits of circuses, and the vision of the Galahad
of the Teal bug was thoroughly befogged by parental
observations, till Claire returned from youthful
romance to being a sensible Boltwood, and decided that
after all, Milt was not a lord of the sky-painted mountains.</p>

<p>Before they bent south, at Livingston, Claire had
her first mountain driving, and once she had to ford a
stream, putting the car at it, watching the water curve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
up in a lovely silver veil. She felt that she was conquering
the hills as she had the prairies.</p>

<p>She pulled up on a plateau to look at her battery.
She noted the edge of a brake-band peeping beyond the
drum, in a ragged line of fabric and copper wire.
Then she knew that she didn't know enough to conquer.
"Do you suppose it's dangerous?" she asked
her father, who said a lot of comforting things that
didn't mean anything.</p>

<p>She thought of Milt. She stopped a passing car.
The driver "guessed" that the brake-band was all
gone, and that it would be dangerous to continue with
it along mountain roads. Claire dustily tramped two
miles to a ranch house, and telephoned to the nearest
garage, in a town called Saddle Back.</p>

<p>Whenever a motorist has delirium he mutters those
lamentable words, "Telephoned to the nearest garage."</p>

<p>She had to wait a tedious hour before she saw a
flivver rattling up with the garage man, who wasn't a
man at all, but a fourteen-year-old boy. He snorted,
"Rats, you didn't need to send for me. Could have
made it perfectly safe. Come on."</p>

<p>Never has the greatest boy pianist received such awe
as Claire gave to this contemptuous young god, with
grease on his peachy cheeks. She did come on. But
she rather hoped that she was in great danger. It
was humiliating to telephone to a garage for nothing.
When she came into the gas-smelling garage in Saddle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Back she said appealingly to the man in charge, a serious,
lip-puffing person of forty-five, "Was it safe to
come in with the brake-band like that?"</p>

<p>"No. Pretty risky. Wa'n't it, Mike?"</p>

<p>The Mike to whom he turned for authority was the
same fourteen-year-old boy. He snapped, "Heh?
That? Naw! Put in new band. Get busy. Bring
me the jack. Hustle up, uncle."</p>

<p>While the older man stood about and vainly tried
to impress people who came in and asked questions
which invariably had to be referred to his repair boy,
the precocious expert stripped the wheel down to
something that looked to Claire distressingly like an
empty milk-pan. Then the boy didn't seem to know
exactly what to do. He scratched his ear a good deal,
and thought deeply. The older man could only scratch.</p>

<p>So for two hours Claire and her father experienced
that most distressing of motor experiences&mdash;waiting,
while the afternoon that would have been so good for
driving went by them. Every fifteen minutes they
came in from sitting on a dry-goods box in front of
the garage, and never did the repair appear to be any
farther along. The boy seemed to be giving all his
time to getting the wrong wrench, and scolding the
older man for having hidden the right one.</p>

<p>When she had left Brooklyn Heights, Claire had
not expected to have such authoritative knowledge of
the Kalifornia Kandy Kitchen, Saddle Back, Montana,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
across from Tubbs' Garage, that she could tell whether
they were selling more Atharva Cigarettes or Polutropons.
She prowled about the garage till she knew
every pool of dripped water in the tin pail of soft
soap in the iron sink.</p>

<p>She was worried by an overheard remark of the
boy wonder, "Gosh, we haven't any more of that
decent brake lining. Have to use this piece of mush."
But when the car was actually done, nothing like a
dubious brake could have kept her from the glory
of starting. The first miles seemed miracles of ease
and speed.</p>

<p>She came through the mountains into Livingston.</p>

<p>Kicking his heels on a fence near town, and
fondling a gray cat, sat Milt Daggett, and he yelped
at her with earnestness and much noise.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
THE WONDERS OF NATURE WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"Hello</span>!" said Milt.</p>

<p>"Hel-lo!" said Claire.</p>

<p>"How dee do," said Mr. Boltwood.</p>

<p>"This is so nice! Where's your car? I hope
nothing's happened," glowed Claire.</p>

<p>"No. It's back here from the road a piece. Camp
there tonight. Reason I stopped&mdash;&mdash; Struck me
you've never done any mountain driving, and there's
some pretty good climbs in the Park; slick road, but
we go up to almost nine thousand feet. And cold
mornings. Thought I'd tip you off to some driving
tricks&mdash;if you'd like me to."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course. Very grateful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then I'll tag after you tomorrow, and speak my
piece."</p>

<p>"So jolly you're going through the Park."</p>

<p>"Yes, thought might as well. What the guide
books call 'Wonders of Nature.' Only wonder of
nature I ever saw in Schoenstrom was my friend Mac
trying to think he was soused after a case of near-beer.
Well&mdash;&mdash; See you tomorrow."</p>

<p>Not once had he smiled. His tone had been impersonal.
He vaulted the fence and tramped away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>When they drove out of town, in the morning, they
found Milt waiting by the road, and he followed them
till noon. By urgent request, he shared a lunch, and
lectured upon going down long grades in first or second
speed, to save brakes; upon the use of the retarded
spark and the slipped clutch in climbing. His bug was
beside the Gomez in the line-up at the Park gate, when
the United States Army came to seal one's firearms,
and to inquire on which mountain one intended to be
killed by defective brakes. He was just behind her all
the climb up to Mammoth Hot Springs.</p>

<p>When she paused for water to cool the boiling radiator,
the bug panted up, and with the first grin she had
seen on his face since Dakota Milt chuckled, "The
Teal is a grand car for mountains. Aside from overheating,
bum lights, thin upholstery, faulty ignition,
tissue-paper brake-bands, and this-here special aviation
engine, specially built for a bumble-bee, it's what the
catalogues call a powerful brute!"</p>

<p>Claire and her father stayed at the chain of hotels
through the Park. Milt was always near them, but
not at the hotels. He patronized one of the chains of
permanent camps.</p>

<p>The Boltwoods invited him to dinner at one hotel,
but he refused and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>Because he was afraid that Claire would find him
intrusive, Milt was grave in her presence. He couldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
respond either to her enthusiasm about canyon and
colored pool&mdash;or to her rage about the tourists who,
she alleged, preferred freak museum pieces to plain
beauty; who never admired a view unless it was labeled
by a signpost and megaphoned by a guide as something
they ought to admire&mdash;and tell the Folks Back Home
about.</p>

<p>When she tried to express this social rage to Milt he
merely answered uneasily, "Yes, I guess there's something
to that."</p>

<p>She was, he pondered, so darn particular. How
could he ever figure out what he ought to do? No
thanks; much obliged, but guessed he'd better not accept
her invitation to dinner. Darn sorry couldn't
come but&mdash;&mdash; Had promised a fellow down at the
camp to have chow with him.</p>

<p>If in this Milt was veracious, he was rather fickle
to his newly discovered friend; for while Claire was
finishing dinner, a solemn young man was watching
her through a window.</p>

<p>She was at a table for six. She was listening to a
man of thirty in riding-breeches, a stock, and a pointed
nose, who bowed to her every time he spoke, which
was so frequently that his dining gave the impression
of a man eating grape-fruit on a merry-go-round.
Back in Schoenstrom, fortified by Mac and the bunch
at the Old Home Lunch, Milt would have called the
man a "dude," and&mdash;though less noisily than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
others&mdash;would have yelped, "Get onto Percy's beer-bottle
pants. What's he got his neck bandaged for?
Bet he's got a boil."</p>

<p>But now Milt yearned, "He does look swell. Wish
I could get away with those things. Wouldn't I look
like a fool with my knees buttoned up, though! And
there's two other fellows in dress suits. Wouldn't
mind those so much. Gee, it must be awful where
you've got so many suits of trick clothes you don't
know which one to wear.</p>

<p>"That fellow and Claire are talking pretty swift.
He doesn't need any piston rings, that lad. Wonder&mdash;wonder
what they're talking about? Music, I guess,
and books and pictures and scenery. He's saying that
no tongue or pen can describe the glories of the Park,
and then he's trying to describe 'em. And maybe they
know the same folks in New York. Lord, how I'd
be out of it. I wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Milt made a toothpick out of a match, decided that
toothpicks were inelegant in his tragic mood, and
longed: "Never did see her among her own kind of
folks till now. I wish I could jabber about music and
stuff. I'll learn it. I will! I can! I picked up autos
in three months. I&mdash;&mdash; Milt, you're a dub. I wonder
can they be talking French, maybe, or Wop, or something?
I could get onto the sedan styles in highbrow
talk as long as it was in American.</p>

<p>"I could probably spring linen-collar stuff about,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
'Really a delightful book, so full of delightful characters,'
if I stuck by the rhetoric books long enough.
But once they begin the <i>parlez-vous, oui, oui</i>, I'm a
gone goose. Still, by golly, didn't I pick up Dutch&mdash;German&mdash;like
a mice? Back off, son! You did
not! You can talk Plattdeutsch something grand, as
long as you keep the verbs and nouns in American.
You got a nice character, Milt, but you haven't got any
parts of speech.</p>

<p>"Now look at Percy! Taking a bath in a finger-bowl.
I never could pull that finger-bowl stuff; pinning
your ears back and jiu-jitsing the fried chicken,
and then doing a high dive into a little dish that ain't&mdash;that
isn't either a wash-bowl or real good lemonade.
He's a perfect lady, Percy is. Dabs his mouth with
his napkin like a watchmaker tinkering the carburetor
in a wrist watch.</p>

<p>"Lookit him bow and scrape&mdash;asking her something&mdash;&mdash; Rats,
he's going out in the lobby with her.
Walks like a cat on a wet ash-pile. But&mdash;&mdash; Oh
thunder, he's all right. Neat. I never could mingle
with that bunch. I'd be web-footed and butter-fingered.
And he seems to know all that bunch&mdash;bows
to every maiden aunt in the shop. Now if I was
following her, I'd never see anybody but her; rest of
the folks could all bob their heads silly, and I'd never
see one blame thing except that funny little soft spot
at the back of her neck. Nope, you're kind to your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
cat, Milt, but you weren't cut out to be no parlor-organ
duet."</p>

<p>This same meditative young man might have been
discovered walking past the porch of the hotel, his
hands in his pockets, his eyes presumably on the stars&mdash;certainly
he gave no signs of watching Claire and
the man in riding-breeches as they leaned over the
rail, looked at mountain-tops filmy in starlight, while
in the cologne-atomized mode, Breeches quoted:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, 'tis far heaven my awed heart seeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I behold those mighty peaks.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Milt could hear him commenting, "Doesn't that
just get the feeling of the great open, Miss Boltwood?"</p>

<p>Milt did not catch her answer. Himself, he
grunted, "I never could get much het up about this
poetry that's full of Ah's and 'tises."</p>

<p>Claire must have seen Milt just after he had sauntered
past. She cried, "Oh, Mr. Daggett! Just a
moment!" She left Breeches, ran down to Milt. He
was frightened. Was he going to get what he deserved
for eavesdropping?</p>

<p>She was almost whispering. "Save me from our
friend up on the porch," she implored.</p>

<p>He couldn't believe it. But he took a chance.
"Won't you have a little walk?" he roared.</p>

<p>"So nice of you&mdash;just a little way, perhaps?" she
sang out.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>They were silent till he got up the nerve to admire,
"Glad you found some people you knew in the
hotel."</p>

<p>"But I didn't."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought your friend in the riding-pants was
chummy."</p>

<p>"So did I!" She rather snorted.</p>

<p>"Well, he's a nice-looking lad. I did admire those
pants. I never could wear anything like that."</p>

<p>"I should hope not&mdash;at dinner! The creepy jack-ass,
I don't believe he's ever been on a horse in his
life! He thinks riding-breeches are the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it. Breeches, not pants."</p>

<p>"&mdash;last word in smartness. Overdressing is just
ten degrees worse than underdressing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. Take this sloppy old blue suit
of mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's perfectly nice and simple, and quite well cut.
You probably had a clever tailor."</p>

<p>"I had. He lives in Chicago or New York, I believe."</p>

<p>"Really? How did he come to Schoenstrom?"</p>

<p>"Never been there. This tailor is a busy boy. He
fitted about eleventeen thousand people, last year."</p>

<p>"I see. Ready mades. Cheer up. That's where
Henry B. Boltwood gets most of his clothes. Mr.
Daggett, if ever I catch you in the Aren't-I-beautiful
frame of mind of our friend back on the porch, I'll
give up my trip to struggle for your soul."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>"He seemed to have soul in large chunks. He
seemed to talk pretty painlessly. I had a hunch you
and he were discussing sculpture, anyway. Maybe
Rodin."</p>

<p>"What do you know about Rodin?"</p>

<p>"Articles in the magazines. Same place you learned
about him!" But Milt did not sound rude. He said
it chucklingly.</p>

<p>"You're perfectly right. And we've probably read
the very same articles. Well, our friend back there
said to me at dinner, 'It must be dreadful for you
to have to encounter so many common people along
the road.' I said, 'It is,' in the most insulting tone I
could, and he just rolled his eyes, and hadn't an idea
I meant him. Then he slickered his hair at me, and
mooed, 'Is it not wonderful to see all these strange
manifestations of the secrets of Nature!' and I said,
'Is it?' and he went on, 'One feels that if one could
but meet a sympathetic lady here, one's cup of rejoicing
in untrammeled nature&mdash;&mdash;' Honest, Milt, Mr.
Daggett, I mean, he did talk like that. Been reading
books by optimistic lady authors. And one looked at
me, one did, as if one would be willing to hold my
hand, if I let one.</p>

<p>"He invited me to come out on the porch and give
the double O. to handsome mountains as illuminated
by terrestrial bodies, and I felt so weak in the presence
of his conceit that I couldn't refuse. Then he insisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
on introducing me to a woman from my own Brooklyn,
who condoled with me for having to talk to Western
persons while motoring. Oh, dear God, that such
people should live ... that the sniffy little Claire
should once have been permitted to live!... And
then I saw you!"</p>

<p>Through all her tirade they had stood close together,
her face visibly eager in the glow from the
hotel; and Milt had grown taller. But he responded,
"I'm afraid I might have been just as bad. I haven't
even reached the riding-breeches stage in evolution.
Maybe never will."</p>

<p>"No. You won't. You'll go right through it.
By and by, when you're so rich that father and I
won't be allowed to associate with you, you'll wear
riding-breeches&mdash;but for riding, not as a donation to
the beauties of nature."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm already rich. It shows. Waitress down
at the camp asked me whose car I was driving
through."</p>

<p>"I know what I wanted to say. Since you won't
be our guest, will you be our host&mdash;I mean, as far
as welcoming us? I think it would be fun for father
and me to stop at your camp, tomorrow night, at the
canyon, instead of at the hotel. Will you guide me
to the canyon, if I do?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;terribly&mdash;glad!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
ADVENTURERS BY FIRELIGHT</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Neither</span> of the Boltwoods had seen the Grand
Canyon of the Colorado. The Canyon of the
Yellowstone was their first revelation of intimidating
depth and color gone mad. When their car and
Milt's had been parked in the palisaded corral back
of the camp at which they were to stay, they three set
out for the canyon's edge chattering, and stopped
dumb.</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood declined to descend. He returned to
the camp for a cigar. The boy and girl crept down
seeming miles of damp steps to an outhanging pinnacle
that still was miles of empty airy drop above the river
bed. Claire had a quaking feeling that this rock pulpit
was going to slide. She thrust out her hand, seized
Milt's paw, and in its firm warmth found comfort.
Clinging to its security she followed him by the crawling
path to the river below. She looked up at columns
of crimson and saffron and burning brown, up at the
matronly falls, up at lone pines clinging to jutting
rocks that must be already crashing toward her, and
in the splendor she knew the Panic fear that is the
deepest reaction to beauty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>Milt merely shook his head as he stared up. He had
neither gossiped nor coyly squeezed her hand as he
had guided her. She fell to thinking that she preferred
this American boy in this American scene to a
nimble gentleman saluting the Alps in a dinky green
hat with a little feather.</p>

<p>It was Milt who, when they had labored back up
again, when they had sat smiling at each other with
comfortable weariness, made her see the canyon not
as a freak, but as the miraculous work of a stream
rolling grains of sand for millions of years, till it
had cut this Jovian intaglio. He seemed to have read&mdash;whether
in books, or in paragraphs in mechanical
magazines&mdash;a good deal about geology. He made it
real. Not that she paid much attention to what he
actually said! She was too busy thinking of the fact
that he should say it at all.</p>

<p>Not condescendingly but very companionably she
accompanied Milt in the exploration of their camp
for the night&mdash;the big dining tent, the city of individual
bedroom tents, canvas-sided and wooden-floored, each
with a tiny stove for the cold mornings of these high
altitudes. She was awed that evening by hearing her
waitress discussing the novels of Ibanez. Jeff Saxton
knew the names of at least six Russian novelists, but
Jeff was not highly authoritative regarding Spanish
literature.</p>

<p>"I suppose she's a school-teacher, working here in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
vacation," Claire whispered to Milt, beside her at the
long, busy, scenically conversational table.</p>

<p>"Our waitress? Well, sort of. I understand she's
professor of literature in some college," said Milt, in a
matter of fact way. And he didn't at all see the sequence
when she went on:</p>

<p>"There is an America! I'm glad I've found it!"</p>

<p>The camp's evening bonfire was made of logs on end
about a stake of iron. As the logs blazed up, the
guests on the circle of benches crooned "Suwanee
River," and "Old Black Joe," and Claire crooned
with them. She had been afraid that her father would
be bored, but she saw that, above his carefully tended
cigar, he was dreaming. She wondered if there had
been a time when he had hummed old songs.</p>

<p>The fire sank to coals. The crowd wandered off
to their tents. Mr. Boltwood followed them after an
apologetic, "Good night. Don't stay up too late."
With a scattering of only half a dozen people on the
benches, this huge circle seemed deserted; and Claire
and Milt, leaning forward, chins on hands, were alone&mdash;by
their own campfire, among the mountains.</p>

<p>The stars stooped down to the hills; the pines were
a wall of blackness; a coyote yammered to point the
stillness; and the mighty pile of coals gave a warmth
luxurious in the creeping mountain chill.</p>

<p>The silence of large places awes the brisk intruder,
and Claire's voice was unconsciously lowered as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
begged, "Tell me something about yourself, Mr. Daggett.
I don't really know anything at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, you wouldn't be interested. Just Schoenstrom!"</p>

<p>"But just Schoenstrom might be extremely interesting."</p>

<p>"But honest, you'd think I was&mdash;edging in on
you!"</p>

<p>"I know what you are thinking. The time I suggested,
way back there in Dakota, that you were sticking
too close. You've never got over it. I've tried
to make up for it, but&mdash;&mdash; I really don't blame you.
I was horrid. I deserve being beaten. But you do
keep on punishing ra&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Punishing? Lord, I didn't mean to! No!
Honest! It was nothing. You were right. Looked
as though I was inviting myself&mdash;&mdash; But, oh,
pleassssse, Miss Boltwood, don't ever think for a sec.
that I meant to be a grouch&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then do tell me&mdash;&mdash; Who is this Milton Daggett
that you know so much better than I ever can?"</p>

<p>"Well," Milt crossed his knees, caught his chin
in his hand, "I don't know as I really do know him so
well. I thought I did. I was onto his evil ways. He
was the son of the pioneer doctor, Maine folks."</p>

<p>"Really? My mother came from Maine."</p>

<p>Milt did not try to find out that they were cousins.
He went on, "This kid, Milt, went to high school in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
St. Cloud&mdash;town twenty times as big as Schoenstrom&mdash;but
he drifted back because his dad was old and
needed him, after his mother's death&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have no brothers or sisters?"</p>

<p>"No. Nobody. 'Cept Lady Vere de Vere&mdash;which
animal she is going to get cuffed if she chews up any
more of my overcoat out in my tent tonight!...
Well, this kid worked 'round, machinery mostly, and
got interested in cars, and started a garage&mdash;&mdash; Wee,
that was an awful shop, first one I had! In
Rauskukle's barn. Six wrenches and a screwdriver
and a one-lung pump! And I didn't know a roller-bearing
from three-point suspension! But&mdash;&mdash; Well,
anyway, he worked along, and built a regular garage,
and paid off practically all the mortgage on it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I remember stopping at a garage in Schoenstrom,
I'm almost sure it was, for something. I seem to remember
it was a good place. Do you own it?
Really?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, what there is of it."</p>

<p>"But there's a great deal of it. It's efficient.
You've done your job. That's more than most high-born
aides-de-camp could say."</p>

<p>"Honestly? Well&mdash;I don't know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who did you play with in Schoenstrom? Oh, I
<i>wish</i> I'd noticed that town. But I couldn't tell then
that&mdash;&mdash; What, uh, which girl did you fall in love
with?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>"None! Honest! None! Not one! Never fell
in love&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're unfortunate. I have, lots of times. I
remember quite enjoying being kissed once, at a
dance."</p>

<p>When he answered, his voice was strange: "I suppose
you're engaged to somebody."</p>

<p>"No. And I don't know that I shall be. Once, I
thought I liked a man, rather. He has nice eyes and
the most correct spectacles, and he is polite to his
mother at breakfast, and his name is Jeff, and he will
undoubtedly be worth five or six hundred thousand
dollars, some day, and his opinions on George Moore
and commercial paper are equally sound and unoriginal&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
I ought not to speak of him, and I certainly
ought not to be spiteful. I'm not at all reticent
and ladylike, am I! But&mdash;&mdash; Somehow I can't see
him out here, against a mountain of jagged rock."</p>

<p>"Only you won't always be out here against mountains.
Some day you'll be back in&mdash;where is it in
New York State?"</p>

<p>"I confess it's Brooklyn&mdash;but not what you'd mean
by Brooklyn. Your remark shows you to have subtlety.
I must remember that, mustn't I! I won't always
be driving through this big land. But&mdash;&mdash; Will
I get all fussy and ribbon-tied again, when I go back?"</p>

<p>"No. You won't. You drive like a man."</p>

<p>"What has that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>"It has a lot to do with it. A garage man can trail
along behind another car and figger out, figure out, just
about what kind of a person the driver is from the way
he handles his boat. Now you bite into the job. You
drive pretty neat&mdash;neatly. You don't either scoot too
far out of the road in passing a car, or take corners
too wide. You won't be fussy. But still, I suppose
you'll be glad to be back among your own folks and
you'll forget the wild Milt that tagged along&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Milt&mdash;or Mr. Daggett&mdash;no, Milt! I shall never,
in my oldest grayest year, in a ducky cap by the fireplace,
forget the half-second when your hand came
flashing along, and caught that man on the running-board.
But it wasn't just that melodrama. If that
hadn't happened, something else would have, to symbolize
you. It's that you&mdash;oh, you took me in, a
stranger, and watched over me, and taught me the
customs of the country, and were never impatient.
No, I shan't forget that; neither of the Boltwoods
will."</p>

<p>In the rose-haze of firelight he straightened up and
stared at her, but he settled into shyness again as she
added:</p>

<p>"Perhaps others would have done the same thing.
I don't know. If they had, I should have remembered
them too. But it happened that it was you, and I, uh,
my father and I, will always be grateful. We both
hope we may see you in Seattle. What are you planning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to do there? What is your ambition? Or is
that a rude question?"</p>

<p>"Why, uh&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What I mean&mdash;&mdash; I mean, how did you happen
to want to go there, with a garage at home? You still
control it?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Left my mechanic in charge. Why, I
just kind of decided suddenly. I guess it was what
they call an inspiration. Always wanted a long trip,
anyway, and I thought maybe in Seattle I could hook
up with something a little peppier than Schoenstrom.
Maybe something in Alaska. Always wished I were
a mechanical or civil engineer so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then why don't you become one? You're
young&mdash;&mdash; How old are you?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-five."</p>

<p>"We're both children, compared with Je&mdash;compared
with some men who are my friends. You're
quite young enough to go to engineering school. And
take some academic courses on the side&mdash;English, so
on. Why don't you? Have you ever thought of it?"</p>

<p>"N-no, I hadn't thought of doing it, but&mdash;&mdash; All
right. I will! In Seattle! B'lieve the University
of Washington is there."</p>

<p>"You mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I do. You're the boss."</p>

<p>"That's&mdash;that's flattering, but&mdash;&mdash; Do you always
make up your mind as quickly as this?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>"When the boss gives orders!"</p>

<p>He smiled, and she smiled back, but this time it was
she who was embarrassed. "You're rather overwhelming.
You change your life&mdash;if you really do
mean it&mdash;because a <i>jeune fille</i> from Brooklyn is so impertinent,
from her Olympian height of finishing-school
learning, as to suggest that you do so."</p>

<p>"I don't know what a <i>jeune fille</i> is, but I do
know&mdash;&mdash;" He sprang up. He did not look at her.
He paraded back and forth, three steps to the right,
three to the left, his hands in his pockets, his voice impersonal.
"I know you're the finest person I ever
met. You're the kind&mdash;I knew there must be people
like you, because I knew the Joneses. They're the only
friends I've got that have, oh, I suppose it's what they
call culture."</p>

<p>In a long monologue, uninterrupted by Claire, he
told of his affection for the Schoenstrom "prof" and
his wife. The practical, slangy Milt of the garage was
lost in the enthusiastic undergraduate adoring his
instructor in the university that exists as veritably
in a teacher's or a doctor's sitting-room in every
Schoenstrom as it does in certain lugubrious stone
hulks recognized by a state legislature as magically empowered
to paste on sacred labels lettered "Bachelor
of Arts."</p>

<p>He broke from his revelations to plump down on
the bench beside her, to slap his palm with his fist,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and sigh, "Lord, I've been gassing on! Guess I bored
you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Milt, please! I see it all so&mdash;&mdash; It
must have been wonderful, the evening when Mrs.
Jones read Noyes's 'Highwayman' aloud. Tell me&mdash;long
before that&mdash;were you terribly lonely as a little
boy?"</p>

<p>Now Milt had not been a terribly lonely little boy.
He had been a leader in a gang devoted to fighting,
swimming, pickerel-spearing, beggie-stealing, and
catching rides on freights.</p>

<p>But he believed that he was accurately presenting
every afternoon of his childhood, as he mused, "Yes,
I guess I was, pretty much. I remember I used to sit
on dad's doorstep, all those long sleepy summer afternoons,
and I'd think, 'Aw, geeeeee, I&mdash;wisht&mdash;I&mdash;had&mdash;somebody&mdash;to&mdash;play&mdash;with!'
I always wanted to
make-b'lieve Robin Hood, but none of the other kids&mdash;so
many of them were German; they didn't know
about Robin Hood; so I used to scout off alone."</p>

<p>"If I could only have been there, to be Maid
Marian for you! We'd have learned archery! Lonely
little boy on the doorstep!" Her fingers just touched
his sleeve. In her gesture, the ember-light caught the
crystal of her wrist watch. She stooped to peer at it,
and her pitying tenderness broke off in an agitated:
"Heavings! Is it that late? To bed! Good night,
Milt."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>"Good night, Cl&mdash;&mdash; Miss Boltwood."</p>

<p>"No. 'Claire,' of course. I'm not normally a first-name-snatcher,
but I do seem to have fallen into saying
'Milt.' Night!"</p>

<p>As she undressed, in her tent, Claire reflected, "He
won't take advantage of my being friendly, will he?
Only thing is&mdash;&mdash; I sha'n't dare to look at Henry B.
when Milt calls me 'Claire' in that sedate Brooklyn
Heights presence. The dear lamb! Lonely afternoons&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
THE BEAST OF THE CORRAL</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">They</span> met in the frost-shimmering mountain
morning, on their way to the corral, to get their
cars ready before breakfast. They were shy, hence
they were boisterous, and tremendously unreferential
to campfire confidences, and informative about distilled
water for batteries, and the price of gas in the Park.
On Milt's shoulder rode Vere de Vere who, in her
original way, relieved one pause by observing "Mrwr."</p>

<p>They came in through the corral gate before any
of the other motor tourists had appeared&mdash;and they
stupidly halted to watch a bear, a large, black, adipose
and extremely unchained bear, stalk along the line of
cars, sniff, cock an ear at the Gomez, lumber up on its
running-board, and bundle into the seat. His stern
filled the space between side and top, and he was to be
heard snuffing.</p>

<p>"Oh! Look! Milt! Left box of candy on
seat&mdash;&mdash; Oh, please drive him away!"</p>

<p>"Me? Drive&mdash;that?"</p>

<p>"Frighten him away. Aren't animals afraid human
eye&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not in this park. Guns forbidden. Animals protected
by U. S. Army, President, Congress, Supreme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Court, Department of Interior, Monroe Doctrine, W.
C. T. U. But I'll try&mdash;cautiously."</p>

<p>"Don't you want me think you're hero?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, providin' I don't have to go and be one."</p>

<p>They edged toward the car. The bear flapped his
hind legs, looked out at the intruders, said "Oofflll!"
and returned to the candy.</p>

<p>"Shoo!" Milt answered politely.</p>

<p>"Llooffll!"</p>

<p>From his own bug, beside the Gomez, Milt got a
tool kit, and with considerable brilliance as a pitcher
he sent a series of wrenches at the agitated stern of
the bear. They offended the dignity of the ward of
the Government. He finished the cover and ribbons
of the candy box, and started for Milt ... who proceeded
with haste toward Claire ... who was already
at the gate.</p>

<p>Lady Vere de Vere, cat of a thousand battles, gave
one frightful squawl, shot from Milt's shoulder and at
the bear, claws out, fur electric. The bear carelessly
batted once with its paw, and the cat sailed into the
air. The satisfied bear strolled to the fence, shinned
up it and over.</p>

<p>"Good old Vere! That wallop must of darn near
stunned her, though!" Milt laughed to Claire, as they
trotted back into the corral. The cat did not move,
as they came up; did not give the gallant "Mrwr"
with which she had saluted Milt on lonely morning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
after morning of forlorn driving behind the Gomez.
He picked Vere up.</p>

<p>"She's&mdash;she's dead," he said. He was crying.</p>

<p>"Oh, Milt&mdash;&mdash; Last night you said Vere was all
the family you had. You have the Boltwoods, now!"</p>

<p>She did not touch his hand, nor did they speak as
they walked soberly to the far side of the corral, and
buried Lady Vere de Vere. At breakfast they talked
of the coming day's run, from the canyon out of the
Park, and northward. But they had the queer, quick
casualness of intimates.</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>It was at breakfast that her father heard one Milt
Daggett address the daughter of the Boltwoods as
"Claire." The father was surprised into clearing his
throat, and attacking his oatmeal with a zealousness
unnatural in a man who regarded breakfast-foods as
moral rather than interesting.</p>

<p>While he was lighting a cigar, and Claire was paying
the bill, Mr. Boltwood stalked Milt, cleared his
throat all over again, and said, "Nice morning."</p>

<p>It was the first time the two men had talked unchaperoned
by Claire.</p>

<p>"Yes. We ought to have a good run, sir." The
"sir" came hard. The historian puts forth a theory
that Milt had got it out of fiction. "We might go up
over Mount Washburn. Take us up to ten thousand
feet."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>"Uh, you said&mdash;didn't Miss Boltwood tell me that
you are going to Seattle, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Friends there, no doubt?"</p>

<p>Milt grinned irresistibly. "Not a friend. But I'm
going to make 'em. I'm going to take up engineering,
and some French, I guess, at the university there."</p>

<p>"Ah. Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Been too limited in my ambition. Don't see
why I shouldn't get out and build railroads and
power plants and roads&mdash;Siberia, Africa, all sorts of
interesting places."</p>

<p>"Quite right. Quite right. Uh, ah, I, oh, I&mdash;&mdash; Have
you seen Miss Boltwood?"</p>

<p>"I saw Miss Boltwood in the office."</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Quite so. Uh&mdash;ah, here she is."</p>

<p>When the Gomez had started, Mr. Boltwood skirmished,
"This young man&mdash;&mdash; Do you think you better
let him call you by your Christian name?"</p>

<p>"Why not? I call him 'Milt.' 'Mr. Daggett' is
too long a handle to use when a man is constantly
rescuing you from the perils of the deep or hoboes or
bears or something. Oh, I haven't told you. Poor
old Milt, his cat was killed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, dolly, you may tell me about that in
due time, but let's stick to this social problem for a
moment. Do you think you ought to be too intimate
with him?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>"He's only too self-respecting. He wouldn't take
advantage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm quite aware of that. I'm not speaking on your
behalf, but on his. I'm sure he's a very amiable chap,
and ambitious. In fact&mdash;&mdash; Did you know that he
has saved up money to attend a university?"</p>

<p>"When did he tell you that? How long has he
been planning&mdash;&mdash; I thought that I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just this morning; just now."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm relieved."</p>

<p>"I don't quite follow you, dolly, but&mdash;&mdash; Where
was I? Do you realize what a demure tyrant you are?
If you can drag me from New York to the aboriginal
wilds, and I did <i>not</i> like that oatmeal, what will you do
to this innocent? I want to protect him!"</p>

<p>"You better! Because I'm going to carve him, and
paint him, and possibly spoil him. The creating of a
man&mdash;of one who knows how to handle life&mdash;is so
much more wonderful than creating absurd pictures or
statues or stories. I'll nag him into completing college.
He'll learn dignity&mdash;or perhaps lose his simplicity
and be ruined; and then I'll marry him off to
some nice well-bred pink-face, like Jeff Saxton's pretty
cousin&mdash;who may turn him into a beastly money-grubber;
and I'm monkeying with destiny, and I ought
to be slapped, and I realize it, and I can't help it, and
all my latent instinct as a feminine meddler is aroused,
and&mdash;golly, I almost went off that curve!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
THE BLACK DAY OF THE VOYAGE</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">That</span> was the one black day of her voyage&mdash;black
stippled with crimson.</p>

<p>It began with the bear's invasion of the car, resulting
in long claw-marks across the upholstery, the
loss of some particularly good candy bought at a Park
hotel, and genuine grief abiding after the sentimental
tragedy of Vere de Vere's death. The next act was
the ingenious loss of all power of her engine. She
forgot that, before breakfast, Milt had filled the oil-well
for her. When she stopped for gasoline, and the
seller inquired, "Quart of oil?"&mdash;she absently nodded.
So the cylinders filled with surplus oil, the spark-plugs
were fouled, and the engine had the power of a sewing
machine.</p>

<p>She could not make Mount Washburn&mdash;she could
not make even the slopes of the lower road. Now she
knew the agony of the feeble car in the mountains&mdash;most
shameful and anxious of a driver's dolors: the
brisk start up the hill, the belief that you will keep
on going this time; the feeling of weariness through
all the car; the mad shifting of gears, the slipping of
the clutch, and more gas, and less gas, and wondering
whether more gas or less is the better, and the appalling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
knocking when you finally give her a lot too much
gas; the remembrance, when it's too late, to retard the
spark; the safe crawling up to the last sharp pitch, just
fifteen feet from the summit; the car's halting; the
yelp at your passenger, "Jump out and push!"; the
painful next five feet; and the final death of the power
just as the front wheels creep up over the pitch. Then
the anxious putting on of brakes&mdash;holding the car with
both foot-brake and emergency, lest it run down backward,
slip off the road. The calf of your leg begins to
ache from the pressure on the foot-brake, and with an
unsuccessful effort to be courteous you bellow at the
passenger, who has been standing beside the car looking
deprecatory, "Will you please block the back
wheels with a stone&mdash;hustle up, will you!"</p>

<p>All this routine Claire thoroughly learned. Always
Milt bumbled up, said cheerful things, and either
hauled the Gomez over the pitch by a towline to his
bug, or getting out, pushing on a rear fender till his
neck was red and bulgy, gave the extra impetus necessary
to get the Gomez over.</p>

<p>"Would you mind shoving on that side, just a little
bit?" he suggested to Mr. Boltwood, who ceased the
elaborate smoking of cigars, dusted his hands, and
gravely obeyed, while Claire was awaiting the new captain's
command to throw on the power.</p>

<p>"I wish we weren't under so much obligation to
this young man," said Mr. Boltwood, after one crisis.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>"I know but&mdash;what can we do?"</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose we might pay him?"</p>

<p>"Henry B. Boltwood, if you tried to do that&mdash;&mdash; I'm
not sure. Your being my parent might save you,
but even so, I think he'd probably chase you off the
road, clear down into that chasm."</p>

<p>"I suppose so. Shall we have to entertain him in
Seattle?"</p>

<p>"Have to? My dear parent, you can't keep me from
it! Any of the Seattle friends of Gene Gilson who
don't appreciate that straight, fine, aspiring boy may
go&mdash;&mdash; Not overdo it, you understand. But&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
take him to the theater. By the way; shall we
try to climb Mount Rainier before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See here, my good dolly; you stop steering me
away from my feeble parental efforts. Do you wish
to be under obligations&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't mind, with Milt. He wouldn't charge interest,
as Jeff Saxton would. Milt is, oh, he's folks!"</p>

<p>"Quite true. But are we? Are you?"</p>

<p>"Learning to be!"</p>

<p>Between discussions and not making hills, Claire
cleaned the spark plugs as they accumulated carbon
from the surplus oil&mdash;or she pretended to help Milt
clean them. The plugs were always very hot, and
when you were unscrewing the jacket from the core,
you always burned your hand, and wished you could
swear ... and sometimes you could.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>After noon, when they had left the Park and entered
Gardiner, Milt announced, "I've got to stick
around a while. The key in my steering-gear seems to
be worn. May have to put in a new one. Get the
stuff at a garage here. If you wouldn't mind waiting,
be awful glad to tag, and try to give a few helping
hands till the oil cleans itself out."</p>

<p>"I'll just stroll on," she said, but she drove away
as swiftly as she could. Her father's worry about
obligations disturbed her, and she did not wish to
seem too troublesome an amateur to Milt. She would
see him in Livingston, and tell him how well she had
driven. The spark plugs kept clean enough now so
that she could command more power, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Between the Park and the transcontinental road
there are many climbs short but severely steep; up-shoots
like the humps on a scenic railway. To tackle
them with her uncertain motor was like charging a
machine-gun nest. She spent her nerve-force lavishly,
and after every wild rush to make a climb, she had to
rest, to rub the suddenly aching back of her neck.
Because she was so tired, she did not take the trouble
to save her brakes by going down in gear. She let
the brakes smoke while the river and railroad below
rose up at her.</p>

<p>There was a long drop. How long it was she did
not guess, because it was concealed by a curve at the
top. She seemed to plane down forever. The brakes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
squealed behind. She tried to shift to first but there
was a jarring snarl, and she could neither get into
first nor back into third. She was running in neutral,
the great car coasting, while she tried to slow it by
jamming down the foot-brake. The car halted&mdash;and
started on again. The brake-lining which had been
wished on her at Saddle Back was burnt out.</p>

<p>She had the feeling of the car bursting out from
under control ... ready to leap off the road, into a
wash. She wanted to jump. It took all her courage to
stay in the seat. She got what pressure she could
from the remaining band. With one hand she kept
the accelerating car in the middle of the road; with
the other she tried to pull the handle of the emergency
brake back farther. She couldn't. She was
not strong enough. Faster, faster, rushing at the
next curve so that she could scarce steer round it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>As quietly as she could, she demanded of her father,
"Pull back on this brake lever, far as you can. Take
both hands."</p>

<p>"I don't understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Heavens! Y' don't haft un'stand! Yank back!
Yank, I tell you!"</p>

<p>Again the car slowed. She was able to get into
second speed. Even that check did not keep the car
from darting down at thirty miles an hour&mdash;which
pace, to one who desires to saunter down at a dignified
rate of eighteen, is equivalent in terms of mileage on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
level ground to seventy an hour, with a drunken driver,
on a foggy evening, amid traffic.</p>

<p>She got the car down and, in the midst of a valley
of emptiness and quiet, she dropped her head on her
father's knee and howled.</p>

<p>"I just can't face going down another hill! I just
can't face it!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>"No, dolly. Mustn't. We better&mdash;&mdash; You're
quite right. This young Daggett is a very gentlemanly
fellow. I didn't think his table-manners&mdash;&mdash; But
we'll sit here and regard the flora and fauna till he
comes. He'll see us through."</p>

<p>"Yes! He will! Honestly, dad&mdash;&mdash;" She said it
with the first touch of hero-worship since she had seen
an aviator loop loops. "Isn't he, oh, effective! Aren't
you glad he's here to help us, instead of somebody like
Jeff Saxton?"</p>

<p>"We-ul, you must remember that Geoffrey wouldn't
have permitted the brake to burn out. He'd have foreseen
it, and have had a branch office, with special
leased wire, located back on that hill, ready to do business
the instant the market broke. Enthusiasm is a
nice quality, dolly, but don't misplace it. This lad,
however trustworthy he may be, would scarcely even
be allowed to work for a man like Geoffrey Saxton.
It may be that later, with college&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. He'd work for Jeff two hours. Then Jeff
would give him that 'You poor fish!' look, and Milt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
would hit him, and stroll out, and go to the North
Pole or some place, and discover an oil-well, and hire
Jeff as his nice, efficient general manager. And&mdash;&mdash; I
do wish Milt would hurry, though!"</p>

<p>It was dusk before they heard the pit-pit-pit chuckling
down the hill. Milt's casual grin changed to
bashfulness as Claire ran into the road, her arms wide
in a lovely gesture of supplication, and cried, "We
been waiting for you so long! One of my brake-bands
is burnt out, and the other is punk."</p>

<p>"Well, well. Let's try to figure out something
to do."</p>

<p>She waited reverently while the local prophet sat in
his bug, stared at the wheels of the Gomez, and
thought. The level-floored, sagebrush-sprinkled hollow
had filled with mauve twilight and creeping stilly
sounds. The knowable world of yellow lights and
security was far away. Milt was her only means of
ever getting back to it.</p>

<p>"Tell you what we might try," he speculated. "I'll
hitch on behind you, and hold back in going down
hill."</p>

<p>She did not even try to help him while he again
cleaned the spark plugs and looked over brakes, oil,
gas, water. She sat on the running-board, and it was
pleasant to be relieved of responsibility. He said
nothing at all. While he worked he whistled that recent
refined ballad:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wanta go back to Oregon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sit on the lawn, and look at the dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh motheruh dear, don't leavuh me here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaves are so sere, in the fallothe year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wanta go back to Oregugon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dearuh old Oregugon.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They started, shouting optimistically to each other,
lights on, trouble seeming over&mdash;and they stopped
after the next descent, and pools of tears were in the
corners of Claire's eyes. The holdback had not succeeded.
Her big car, with its quick-increasing momentum,
had jerked at the bug as though it were a
lard-can. The tow-rope had stretched, sung, snapped,
and again, in fire-shot delirium, she had gone rocking
down hill.</p>

<p>He drove up beside her, got out, stood at her elbow.
His "I'm a bum inventor. We'll try somethin' else"
was so careless that, in her nerve-twanging exhaustion
she wailed, "Oh, don't be so beastly cheerful! You
don't care a bit!"</p>

<p>In the dusk she could see him straighten, and his
voice came sharp as he ignored the ever-present
parental background and retorted, "Somebody has got
to be cheerful. Matter fact, I worked out the right
stunt, coming down."</p>

<p>Like a man in the dentist's chair, recovering between
bouts, she drowsed and ignored the fact that in a few
minutes she would again have to reassemble herself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
become wakeful and calm, and go through quite impossible
maneuvers of driving. Milt was, with a
hatchet from his camping-kit, cutting down a large
scrub pine. He dragged it to the Gomez and hitched
it to the back axle. The knuckles of the branches
would dig into the earth, the foliage catch at every
pebble.</p>

<p>"There! That anchor would hold a truck!" he
shouted.</p>

<p>It held. She went down the next two hills easily.
But she was through. Her forearms and brain were
equally numb. She appealed to Milt, "I can't seem to
go on any more. It's so dark, and I'm so tired&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right. No ranch houses anywheres near, so
we'll camp here, if Mr. Boltwood doesn't mind."</p>

<p>Claire stirred herself to help him prepare dinner.
It wasn't much of a dinner to prepare. Both cars had
let provisions run low. They had bacon and petrified
ends of a loaf and something like coffee&mdash;not much
like it. Scientists may be interested in their discovery
that as a substitute for both cream and sugar in beverages
strawberry jam is a fallacy.</p>

<p>For Mr. Boltwood's bed Milt hauled out the springy
seat-cushions of both cars. The Gomez cushion was
three inches thicker than that of the bug, which
resulted in a mattress two stories in front with a lean-to
at the foot, and the entire edifice highly slippery.
But with a blanket from Milt's kit, it was sufficient.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
To Claire, Milt gave another blanket, his collection of
antique overcoats, and good advice. He spoke vaguely
of a third blanket for himself. And he had one. Its
dimensions were thirteen by twenty inches, it was of
white wool, he had bought it in Dakota for Vere de
Vere, and many times that day he had patted it and
whispered, "Poor old cat."</p>

<p>Under his blankets Mr. Boltwood thought of rattlesnakes,
bears, rheumatism, Brooklyn, his debt to Milt,
and the fact that&mdash;though he hadn't happened to mention
it to Claire&mdash;he had expected to be killed when
the brake had burned out.</p>

<p>Claire was drowsily happy. She had got through.
She was conscious of rustling sagebrush, of the rapids
of the Yellowstone beside her, of open sky and sweet
air and a scorn for people in stuffy rooms, and comfortably
ever conscious of Milt, ten feet away. She
had in him the interest that a young physician would
have in a new X-ray machine, a printer in a new font
of type, any creator in a new outlet for his power.
She would see to it that her Seattle cousins, the Gilsons,
helped him to know the right people, during his
university work. She herself would be back in Brooklyn,
but perhaps he would write to her, write&mdash;write
letters&mdash;Brooklyn&mdash;she was in Brooklyn&mdash;no,
no, where was she?&mdash;oh, yes, camping&mdash;bad day&mdash;brakes&mdash;&mdash; No,
she would not marry Jeff Saxton!
Brooklyn&mdash;river singing&mdash;stars&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>And when Milt wasn't unromantically thinking of
his cold back, he exulted. "She won't be back among
her own folks till Seattle. Probably forget me then.
Don't blame her. But till we get there, she'll let me
play in her yard. Gee! In the morning I'll be talking
to her again, and she's right there, right now!"</p>

<p>In the morning they were all very stiff, but glad of
the sun on sagebrush and river, and the boy and girl
sang over breakfast. While Milt was gathering fuel he
looked up at Claire standing against a background of
rugged hills, her skirt and shoes still smug, but her
jacket off, her blouse turned in at the throat, her hair
blowing, her sleeves rolled up, one hand on her hip,
erect, charged with vigor&mdash;the spirit of adventure.</p>

<p>When her brake had been relined, at Livingston,
they sauntered companionably on to Butte. And the
day after Butte, when Milt was half a mile behind the
Gomez, a pink-haired man with a large, shiny revolver
stepped out from certain bushes, and bowed politely,
and at that point Milt stopped.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
THE SPECTACLES OF AUTHORITY</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Over</span> the transcontinental divide and into Butte,
diamond-glittering on its hills in the dark; into
Missoula, where there are trees and a university, with
a mountain in everybody's backyard; through the
Flathead Agency, where scarlet-blanketed Indians
stalk out of tepees and the papoose rides on mother's
back as in forgotten days; down to St. Ignatius, that
Italian Alp town with its old mission at the foot of
mountains like the wall of Heaven, Claire had driven
west, then north. She was sailing past Flathead Lake,
where fifty miles of mountain glory are reflected in
bright waters. Everywhere were sections of flat
wheat-plains, stirring with threshing, with clattering
machinery and the flash of blown straw. But these
miniature prairies were encircled by abrupt mountains.</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood remarked, "I'd rather have one of
these homesteads and look across my fields at those
hills than be King of England." Not that he made
any effort to buy one of the homesteads. But then,
he made no appreciable effort to become King of
England.</p>

<p>Claire had not seen Milt for a day and a half; not
since the morning when both cars had left Butte. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
wondered, and was piqued, and slightly lonely. Toward
evening, when she was speculating as to whether
she would make Kalispell&mdash;almost up to the Canadian
border&mdash;she saw a woman run into the road from a
house on the shore of Flathead Lake. The woman
held out her hand. Claire pulled up.</p>

<p>"Are you Miss Boltwood?"</p>

<p>It was as startling as the same question would
have been in a Chinese village.</p>

<p>"W-why, yes."</p>

<p>"Somebody trying to get you on the long-distance
'phone."</p>

<p>"Me? 'Phone?"</p>

<p>She was trembling. "Something's happened to
Milt. He needs me!" She could not manage her
voice, as she got the operator on the farmers'-line wire,
and croaked, "Was some one trying to get Miss Boltwood?"</p>

<p>"Yes. This Boltwood? Hotel in Kalispell trying
to locate you, for two hours. Been telephoning all
along the line, from Butte to Somers."</p>

<p>"W-well, w-will you g-get 'em for me?"</p>

<p>It was not Milt's placid and slightly twangy voice
but one smoother, more decisive, perplexingly familiar,
that finally vibrated, "Hello! Hello! Miss Boltwood!
Operator, I can't hear. Get me a better connection.
Miss Boltwood?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! This is Miss Boltwood!" she kept<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
beseeching, during a long and not unheated controversy
between the unknown and the crisp operator,
who knew nothing of the English language beyond,
"Here's your party. Why don't you talk? Speak
louder!"</p>

<p>Then came clearly, "Hear me now?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!"</p>

<p>"Miss Boltwood?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Oh. Oh, hello, Claire. This is Jeff."</p>

<p>"Jess who?"</p>

<p>"Not Jess. Jeff! Geoffrey! J-e-f-f! Jeff Saxton!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" It was like a sob. "Why&mdash;why&mdash;but
you're in New York."</p>

<p>"Not exactly, dear. I'm in Kalispell, Montana."</p>

<p>"But that's right near here."</p>

<p>"So am I!"</p>

<p>"B-but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out West to see copper interests. Traced you
from Yellowstone Park but missed you at Butte.
Thought I'd catch you on road. You talking from
Barmberry's?"</p>

<p>The woman who had hailed her was not missing a
word of a telephone conversation which might be relative
to death, fire, elopement, or any other dramatic
event. Claire begged of her, "Where in the world
am I talking from, anyway?"</p>

<p>"This is Barmberry's Inn."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>"Yes," Claire answered on the telephone, "I seem
to be. Shall I start on and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. Got ripping plan. Stay right where you are.
Got a fast car waiting. Be right down. We'll have
dinner. By!"</p>

<p>A click. No answer to Claire's urgent hellos. She
hung up the receiver very, very carefully. She hated
to turn and face her audience of Mr. Henry B. Boltwood,
Mr. James Barmberry, Mrs. James Barmberry,
and four Barmberry buds averaging five and a quarter
in age. She tried to ignore the Barmberrys, but their
silence was noisy and interested while she informed
her father, "It's Jeff Saxton! Out here to see copper
mines. Telephoned along road to catch us. Says
we're to wait dinner till he comes."</p>

<p>"Yessum," Mrs. Barmberry contributed, "he told
me if I did catch you, I was to have some new-killed
chickens ready to fry, and some whipped cream&mdash;&mdash; Jim
Barmberry, you go right out and finish whipping
that cream, and don't stand there gawping and gooping,
and you children, you scat!"</p>

<p>Claire seized the moment of Mr. Boltwood's lordly
though bewildered bow to their hostess, and escaped
outdoors. Round the original settler's log-cabin were
nests of shacks and tents, for bedrooms, and on a
screened porch, looking on Flathead Lake, was the
dining-room. The few other guests had finished supper
and gone to their tents.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>She ambled to the lake shore, feeling feebler, more
slapped and sent back to be a good little girl, than she
had when Milt had hitched a forest to the back axle,
three days ago. A map of her thoughts about Jeff Saxton
would have shown a labyrinth. Now, she was muttering,
"Dear Jeff! So thoughtful! Clever of him
to find me! So good to see him again!" Now: "It's
still distinctly understood that I am not engaged to
him, and I'm not going to be surprised into kissing him
when he comes down like a wolf on the fold." Now:
"Jeff Saxton! Here! Makes me homesick for the
Heights. And nice shops in Manhattan, and a really
good play&mdash;music just before the curtain goes up."
Now: "Ohhhhhh geeeeee whizzzzzz! I wonder if
he'll let us go any farther in the car? He's so managerial,
and dad is sure to take his side. He tried to
scare us off by that telegram to Fargo." Now: "He'd
be horrified if he knew about that bum brake. Milt
didn't mind. Milt likes his womenfolks to be daring.
Jeff wants his harem admiring and very reliable."</p>

<p>She crouched on the shore, a rather forlorn
figure. The peaks of the Mission Range, across the
violet-shadowed mirror of Flathead Lake, were a
sudden pure rose, in reflection of sunset, then stony,
forbidding. Across the road, on the Barmberry porch,
she could hear her father saying "Ah?" and "Indeed?"
to James's stories.</p>

<p>Up the road, a blaring horn, great lights growing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
momently more dazzling, a roar, a rush, the halting
car, and out of its blurred bulk, a trim figure darting&mdash;Jeff
Saxton&mdash;home and the people she loved, and the
ways and days she knew best of all. He had shouted
only "Is Miss&mdash;&mdash;" before she had rushed to him,
into the comfort of his arms, and kissed him.</p>

<p>She backed off and tried to sound as if it hadn't
happened, but she was quavery: "I can't believe it!
It's too ridiculously wonderful to see you!" She
retreated toward the Barmberry porch, Jeff following,
his two hands out. They came within the range of
the house lights, and Mr. Boltwood hailed, "Ah!
Geoffrey! Never had such a surprise&mdash;nor a more
delightful one!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Boltwood! Looking splendid, sir! New
man! William Street better look to its laurels when
you come back and get into the game!"</p>

<p>Then, on the lamp-lighted porch, the two men
shook hands, and looked for some other cordial thing
to do. They thought about giving each other cigars.
They smiled, and backed away, and smiled, in the
foolish, indeterminate way males have, being unable
to take it out in kissing. Mr. Boltwood solved the
situation by hemming, "Must trot in and wash. See
you very soon." Mr. James Barmberry and the squad
of lesser Barmberrys regretfully followed. Claire
was alone with Jeff, and she was frightened. Yet she
was admitting that Jeff, in his English cap and flaring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
London top-coat, his keen smile and his extreme
shavedness, was more attractive than she had remembered.</p>

<p>"Glad to see me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, rather!"</p>

<p>"You're looking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nice trip? You know you've sent me nothing but
postcards with 'Pretty town,' or something equally
sentimental."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's really been bully. These mountains and
big spaces simply inspire me." She said it rather defiantly.</p>

<p>"Of course they do! Trouble is, with you away,
we've nothing to inspire us!"</p>

<p>"Do you need anything, with your office and your
club?"</p>

<p>"Why, Claire!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. That was horrid of me."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was. Though I don't mind. I'm sure
we've all become meek, missing you so. I'm quite
willing to be bullied, and reminded that I'm a mere
T.B.M."</p>

<p>She had got herself into it; she had to tell him that
he wasn't just a business man; that she had "just
meant" he was so practical.</p>

<p>"But Jeff is no longer the practical one," he declared.
"Think of Claire driving over deserts and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
mountains. But&mdash;&mdash; Oh, it's been so lonely for us.
Can you guess how much? A dozen times every evening,
I've turned to the telephone to call you up and
beg you to let me nip in and see you, and then realized
you weren't there, and I've just sat looking at the
'phone&mdash;&mdash; Oh, other people are so dull!"</p>

<p>"You really miss&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish I were a poet, so I could tell you adequately.
But you haven't said you missed me, Claire. Didn't
you, a teeny bit? Wouldn't it have been tolerable to
have poor old Jeff along, to drive down dangerous
hills&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And fill grease-cups! Nasty and stickum on the
fingers!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd have done that, too. And invented surprises
along the way. I'm a fine surpriser! I've
arranged for a motor-boat so we can explore the lake
here tomorrow. That's why I had you wait here instead
of coming on to Kalispell. Tomorrow morning,
unfortunately, I have to hustle back and catch a train&mdash;called
to California, and possibly a northern trip.
But meantime&mdash;&mdash; By now, my driver must have
sneaked my s'prises into the kitchen."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Guess."</p>

<p>"Food. Eats. Divine eats."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"But what? Please, sir. Claire is so hungry."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>"We shall see in time, my child. Uncle Jeff is not
to be hurried."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;let&mdash;me&mdash;see&mdash;now! I'll kick and scream!"</p>

<p>From New York Jeff had brought a mammoth
picnic basket. To the fried chicken ordered for dinner
he added sealed jars of pur&eacute;e of wood pigeon, of
stuffed artichokes prepared by his club chef; caviar
and anchovies; a marvelous nightmare-creating fruit
cake to go with the whipped cream; two quarts of a
famous sherry; candied fruits in a silver box. Dinner
was served not on the dining-porch but before the fire
in the Barmberrys' living-room. Claire looked at the
candied fruits, stared at Jeff rather queerly&mdash;as though
she was really thinking of some one else&mdash;and mused:</p>

<p>"I didn't know I cared so much for these foolish
luxuries. Tonight, I'd like a bath, just a tiny bit
scented, and a real dressing-table with a triple mirror,
and French talc, and come down in a dinner-gown&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
I have enjoyed the trip, Jeff. But my poor body
does get so tired and dusty, and then you treacherously
come along with these things that you've magicked
out of the mountains and&mdash;&mdash; I'm not a pioneer
woman, after all. And Henry B. is not a caveman.
See him act idolatrously toward his soup."</p>

<p>"I feel idolatrous. I'd forgotten the supreme ethical
importance of the soup. I'll never let myself
forget it again," said Mr. Boltwood, in the tone of
one who has come home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>Claire was grateful to Jeff that he did not let her
go on being grateful. He turned the talk to Brooklyn.
He was neat and explicit&mdash;and almost funny&mdash;in his
description of an outdoor presentation of <i>Midsummer
Night's Dream</i>, in which a domestic and intellectual
lady weighing a hundred and eighty-seven stageside
had enacted Puck. As they sat after dinner, as Claire
shivered, he produced a knitted robe, and pulled it
about her shoulders, smiling at her in a lonely, hungry
way. She caught his hand.</p>

<p>"Nice Jeff!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" he implored. He shook his head
in a wistful way that caught her heart, and dutifully
went back to informing Mr. Boltwood of the true
state of the markets.</p>

<p>"Talk to Claire too!" she demanded. She stopped,
stared. From outside she heard a nervous pit-pit-pit,
a blurred dialogue between Mr. James Barmberry and
another man. Into the room rambled Milt Daggett,
dusty of unpressed blue suit, tired of eyes, and not
too well shaved of chin, grumbling, "Thought I'd
never catch up with you, Claire&mdash;&mdash; Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh, Milt&mdash;Mr. Daggett&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Jeff, this
is our good friend Milt Daggett, who has helped us
along the road."</p>

<p>Jeff's lucid rimless spectacles stared at Milt's wind-reddened
eyes; his jaunty patch-pocket outing clothes
sniffed at Milt's sweater; his even voice followed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Milt's grunt of surprise with a curt "Ah. Mr.
Daggett."</p>

<p>"Pleased meet you," faltered Milt.</p>

<p>Jeff nodded, turned his shoulder on Milt, and went
on, "The fact is, Mr. Boltwood, the whole metal
market&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Milt was looking from one to another. Claire was
now over her first shocked comparison of candied
fruits with motor grease. She rose, moved toward
Milt, murmuring, "Have you had dinner?"</p>

<p>The door opened again. A pink-haired, red-faced
man in a preposterous green belted suit lunged in,
swept his broad felt hat in greeting, and boomed like a
cheap actor:</p>

<p>"Friends of my friend Milt, we about to dine salute
you. Let me introduce myself as Westlake Parrott,
better known to the vulgar as Pinky Parrott, gentleman
adventurer, born in the conjunction of Mars and
Venus, with Saturn ascendant."</p>

<p>Jeff had ignored Milt. But at this absurd second
intrusion on his decidedly private dinner-party he
flipped to the center of the room and said "I beg
your pardon!" in such a head-office manner that the
pink-locked Mystery halted in his bombast. Claire
felt wabbly. She had no theories as to where Milt
had acquired a private jester, nor as to what was about
to happen to Milt&mdash;and possibly to her incautious
self.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />
THE VAGABOND IN GREEN</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">As</span> Milt had headed westward from Butte, as he
rattled peacefully along the road, conscious of
golden haze over all the land, and the unexpectedness
of prairie threshing-crews on the sloping fields of
mountainsides, a man had stepped out from bushes
beside the road, and pointed a .44 navy revolver.</p>

<p>The man was not a movie bandit. He wore a green
imitation of a Norfolk jacket, he had a broad red
smile, and as he flourished his hat in a bow, his hair
was a bristly pompadour of gray-streaked red that
was almost pink. He made oration:</p>

<p>"Pardon my eccentric greeting, brother of the open
road, but I wanted you to give ear to my obsequious
query as to how's chances on gettin' a lift? I have
learned that obsequiousness is best appreciated when
it is backed up by prayer and ca'tridges."</p>

<p>"What's the idea? I seem to gather you'd like a
lift. Jump in."</p>

<p>"You do not advocate the Ciceronian style, I take
it," chuckled the man as he climbed aboard.</p>

<p>Milt was not impressed. Claire might have been,
but Milt had heard politics and religion argued about
the stove in Rauskukle's store too often to be startled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
by polysyllabomania. He knew it was often the sign
of a man who has read too loosely and too much by
himself. He snorted. "Huh! What are you&mdash;newspaper,
politics, law, preacher, or gambler?"</p>

<p>"Well, a little of all those interesting occupations.
And ten-twent-thirt trouping, and county-fair spieling,
and selling Dr. Thunder Rapids' Choctaw Herbal
Sensitizer. How far y' going?"</p>

<p>"Seattle."</p>

<p>"Honest? Say, kid, this is&mdash;&mdash; Muh boy, we
shall have the rare privilege of pooling adventures as
far as Blewett Pass, four to six days' run from here&mdash;a
day this side of Seattle. I'm going to my gold-mine
there. I'll split up on the grub&mdash;I note from your kit
that you camp nights. Quite all right, my boy. Pinky
Parrott is no man to fear night air."</p>

<p>He patted Milt's shoulder with patronizing insolence.
He filled a pipe and, though the car was
making twenty-five, he lighted the pipe with distinguished
ease, then settled down to his steady stride:</p>

<p>"In the pride of youth, you feel that you have thoroughly
categorized me, particularly since I am willing
to admit that, though I shall have abundance of the
clinking iron men to buy my share of our chow, I
chance just for the leaden-footed second to lack the
wherewithal to pay my railroad fare back to Blewett;
and the bumpers and side-door Pullman of the argonauts
like me not. Too damn dusty. But your analysis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
is unsynthetic, though you will scarce grasp my
paradoxical metaphor."</p>

<p>"The hell I won't. I've taken both chemistry and
rhetoric," growled Milt, strictly attending to driving,
and to the desire to get rid of his parasite.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh, I see. Well, anyway: I am no mere
nimble knight of wits, as you may take it. In fact,
I am lord of fair acres in Arcady."</p>

<p>"Don't know the burg. Montana or Idaho?"</p>

<p>"Neither! In the valley of dream!"</p>

<p>"Oh! That one. Huh!"</p>

<p>"But I happen to back them up with a perfectly undreamlike
gold-mine. Prospected for it in a canyon
near Blewett Pass and found it, b' gum, and my lady
wife, erstwhile fairest among the society favorites of
North Yakima, now guards it against her consort's
return. Straight goods. Got the stuff. Been to Butte
to get a raise on it, but the fell khedives of commerce
are jealous. They would hearken not. Gee, those
birds certainly did pull the frigid mitt! So I wend my
way back to the demure Dolores, the houri of my
heart, and the next time I'll take a crack at the big
guns in Seattle. And I'll sure reward you for your
generosity in taking me to Blewett, all the long, long,
languid, languorous way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too bad I got to stop couple of days at Spokane."</p>

<p>"Well, then you shall have the pleasure of taking
me that far."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>"And about a week in Kalispell!"</p>

<p>"'Twill discommode me, but 'pon honor, I like your
honest simple face, and I won't desert you. Besides!
I know a guy in Kalispell, and I can panhandle the
sordid necessary chuck while I wait for you. Little
you know, my cockerel, how facile a brain your 'bus
so lightly bears. When I've cashed in on the mine,
I'll take my rightful place among the motored gentry.
Not merely as actor and spieler, promoter and inventor
and soldier and daring journalist, have I played my
r&ocirc;le, but also I am a mystic, an initiate, a clairaudient,
a psychometrist, a Rosicrucian adept, and profoundly
psychic&mdash;in fact, my guide is Hermes Trismegistus
himself! I also hold a degree as doctor of mento-practic,
and my studies in astro-biochemistry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gonna stop. All off. Make little coffee," said
Milt.</p>

<p>He did not desire coffee, and he did not desire to
stop, but he did desperately desire not to inflict Pinky
Parrott upon the Boltwoods. It was in his creed as a
lover of motors never to refuse a ride to any one,
when he had room. He hoped to get around his creed
by the hint implied in stopping. Pinky's reaction to
the hint was not encouraging:</p>

<p>"Why, you have a touch of the psychic's flare! I
could do with coffee myself. But don't trouble to
make a fire. I'll do that. You drive&mdash;I do the camp
work. Not but that I probably drive better than you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
if you will permit me to say so. I used to do a bit
of racing, before I took up aviation."</p>

<p>"Huh! Aviation! What machine d'you fly?"</p>

<p>"Why, why&mdash;a biplane!"</p>

<p>"Huh! What kind of motor?"</p>

<p>"Why, a foreign one. The&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash; It was a
French motor."</p>

<p>"Huh! What track you race on?"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;&mdash; Pardon me till I build a fire for our
<i>al fresco</i> collation, and I my driving history will unfold."</p>

<p>But he didn't do either.</p>

<p>After he had brought seven twigs, one piece of
sagebrush, and a six-inch board, Pinky let Milt finish
building the fire, while he told how much he knew
about the mysteries of ancient Egyptian priests.</p>

<p>Milt gave up hope that Pinky would become bored
by waiting and tramp on. After one hour of conversational
deluge, he decided to let Pinky drive&mdash;to
make him admit that he couldn't. He was wrong.
Pinky could drive. He could not drive well, he wabbled
in his steering, and he killed the engine on a grade,
but he showed something of the same dashing idiocy
that characterized his talk. It was Milt not Pinky,
who was afraid of their running off the road, and
suggested resuming the wheel.</p>

<p>Seven times that day Milt tried to lose him. Once
he stopped without excuse, and merely stared up at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
rocks overhanging the hollowed road. Pinky was not
embarrassed. He leaned back in the seat and sang
two Spanish love songs. Once Milt deliberately took
a wrong road, up a mountainside. They were lost,
and took five hours getting back to the highway.
Pinky loved the thrill and&mdash;in a brief address lasting
fifteen minutes&mdash;he said so.</p>

<p>Milt tried to bore him by driving at seven miles an
hour. Pinky affectionately accepted this opportunity
to study the strata of the hills. When they camped,
that night, Pinky loved him like a brother, and was
considering not stopping at Blewett Pass, to see his
gold-mine and Dolores the lady-wife, but going clear
on to Seattle with his playmate.</p>

<p>The drafted host lay awake, and when Pinky awoke
and delivered a few well-chosen words on the subject
of bird-song at dawn, Milt burst out:</p>

<p>"Pinky, I don't like to do it, but&mdash;&mdash; I've never
refused a fellow a lift, but I'm afraid you'll have to
hike on by yourself, the rest of the way."</p>

<p>Pinky sat up in his blankets. "Afraid of me, eh?
You better be! I'm a bad actor. I killed Dolores's
husband, and took her along, see? I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you trying to scare me, you poor four-flusher?"
Milt's right hand expanded, fingers arching,
with the joyous tension of a man stretching.</p>

<p>"No. I'm just reading your thoughts. I'm telling
you you're scared of me! You think that if I went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
on, I might steal your car! You're afraid because
I'm so suave. You aren't used to smooth ducks. You
don't dare to let me stick with you, even for today!
You're afraid I'd have your mis'able car by tonight!
You don't dare!"</p>

<p>"The hell I don't!" howled Milt. "If you think
I'm afraid&mdash;&mdash; Just to show you I'm not, I'll let you
go on today!"</p>

<p>"That's sense, my boy. It would be a shame for two
such born companions of the road to part!" Pinky
had soared up from his blankets; was lovingly shaking
Milt's hand.</p>

<p>Milt knew that he had been tricked, but he felt
hopeless. Was it impossible to insult Pinky? He tried
again:</p>

<p>"I'll be frank with you. You're the worst wind-jamming
liar I ever met. Now don't reach for that
gat of yours. I've got a hefty rock right here handy."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, dear boy, I don't intend to reach for
any crude lethal smoke-wagon. Besides, there isn't
anything in it. I hocked the shells in Butte. I am not
angry, merely grieved. We'll argue this out as we
have breakfast and drive on. I can prove to you that,
though occasionally I let my fancy color mere untutored
fact with the pigments of a Robert J. Ingersoll&mdash;&mdash; By
the way, do you know his spiel on
whisky?"</p>

<p>"Stick to the subject. We'll finish our arguing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
right now, and I'll give you breakfast, and we'll sadly
part."</p>

<p>"Merely because I am lighter of spirits than this
lugubrious old world? No! I decline to be dropped.
I'll forgive you and go on with you. Mind you, I am
sensitive. I will not intrude where I am not welcome.
Only you must give me a sounder reason than my
diverting conversational powers for shucking me. My
logic is even stronger than my hedonistic contempt for
hitting the pike."</p>

<p>"Well, hang it, if you must know&mdash;&mdash; Hate to say
it, but I'd do almost anything to get rid of you. Fact
is, I've been sort of touring with a lady and her father,
and you would be in the way!"</p>

<p>"Aaaaaaah! You see! Why, my boy, I will not
only stick, but for you, I shall do the nimble John
Alden and win the lady fair. I will so bedizen your
virile, though somewhat crassly practical gifts&mdash;&mdash; Why,
women are my long suit. They fall for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, tut! You're a fool. She's no beanery
mistress, like you're used to. She really is a lady."</p>

<p>"How blind you are, cruel friend. You do not
even see that whatever my vices may be, my social
standing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;shut&mdash;up! Can't you see I'm trying to be
kind to you? Have I simply got to beat you up before
you begin to suspect you aren't welcome? Your social
standing isn't even in the telephone book. And your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
vocabulary&mdash;&mdash; You let too many 'kids' slip in
among the juicy words. Have I got to lick&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well. You're right. I'm a fliv. Shake hands,
m' boy, and no hard feelings."</p>

<p>"Good. Then I can drive on nice and alone, without
having to pound your ears off?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. That is&mdash;we'll compromise. You take
me on just a few miles, into more settled country, and
I'll leave you."</p>

<p>So it chanced that Milt was still inescapably accompanied
by Mr. Pinky Parrott, that evening, when he
saw Claire's Gomez standing in the yard at Barmberry's
and pulled up.</p>

<p>Pinky had voluntarily promised not to use his eloquence
on Claire, nor to try to borrow money from
Mr. Boltwood. Without ever having quite won permission
to stay, he had stayed. He had also carried
out his promise to buy his half of the provisions by
adding a five-cent bag of lemon drops to Milt's bacon
and bread.</p>

<p>When they had stopped, Milt warned, "There's
their machine now. Seems to be kind of a hotel here.
I'm going in and say howdy. Good-by, Pink. Glad
to have met you, but I expect you to be gone when I
come out here again. If you aren't&mdash;&mdash; Want granite
or marble for the headstone? I mean it, now!"</p>

<p>"I quite understand, my lad. I admire your chivalric
delicacy. Farewell, old <i>compagnon de voyage</i>!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>Milt inquired of Mr. Barmberry whether the Boltwoods
were within, and burst into the parlor-living-room-library.
As he cried to Claire, by the fire,
"Thought I'd never catch up with you," he was conscious
that standing up, talking to Mr. Boltwood, was
an old-young man, very suave, very unfriendly of eye.
He had an Oxford-gray suit, unwrinkled cordovan
shoes; a pert, insultingly well-tied blue bow
tie, and a superior narrow pink bald spot. As he
heard Jeff Saxton murmur, "Ah. Mr. Daggett!"
Milt felt the luxury in the room&mdash;the fleecy robe over
Claire's shoulders, the silver box of candy by her
elbow, the smell of expensive cigars, and the portly
complacence of Mr. Boltwood.</p>

<p>"Have you had any dinner?" Claire was asking,
when a voice boomed, "Let me introduce myself as
Westlake Parrott."</p>

<p>Jeff abruptly took charge. He faced Pinky and
demanded, "I beg pardon!"</p>

<p>Claire's eyebrows asked questions of Milt.</p>

<p>"This is a fellow I gave a lift to. Miner&mdash;I mean
actor&mdash;well, kind of spiritualistic medium&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood, with the geniality of dinner and
cigar, soothed, "Jeff, uh, Daggett here has saved our
lives two distinct times, and given us a great deal of
help. He is a motor expert. He has always refused
to let us do anything in return but&mdash;&mdash; I noticed
there was almost a whole fried chicken left. I wonder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
if he wouldn't share it with, uh, with his acquaintance
here before&mdash;before they make camp for the night?"</p>

<p>In civil and vicious tones Jeff began, "Very glad
to reward any one who has been of service to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was drowned out by Pinky's effusive, "True
hospitality is a virtue as delicate as it is rare. We
accept your invitation. In fact I should be glad to
have one of those cigarros elegantos that mine olfactory&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Milt cut in abruptly, "Pink! Shut up! Thanks,
folks, but we'll go on. Just wanted to see if you had
got in safe. See you tomorrow, some place."</p>

<p>Claire was close to Milt, her fingers on his sleeve.
"Please, Milt! Father! You didn't make your introduction
very complete. You failed to tell Mr. Daggett
that this is Mr. Saxton, a friend of ours in
Brooklyn. Please, Milt, do stay and have dinner. I
won't let you go on hungry. And I want you to know
Jeff&mdash;Mr. Saxton.... Jeff, Mr. Daggett is an
engineer, that is, in a way. He's going to take an
engineering course in the University of Washington.
Some day I shall make you bloated copper magnates
become interested in him.... Mrs. Barmberry.
Mrssssssss. Barrrrrrrmberrrrrry! Oh. Oh, Mrs.
Barmberry, won't you please warm up that other
chicken for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, now, that's too bad. Me and Jim have et it
all up!" wept the landlady, at the door.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>"I'll go on," stammered Milt.</p>

<p>Jeff looked at him expressionlessly.</p>

<p>"You will not go on!" Claire was insisting. "Mrs.
Barmberry, won't you cook some eggs or steak or
something for these boys?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Jeff suggested, "they'd rather make
their own dinner by a campfire. Must be very jolly,
and that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Jeff, if you don't mind, this is my party, just for
the moment!"</p>

<p>"Quite right. Sorry!"</p>

<p>"Milt, you sit here by the fire and get warm. I'm
not going to be robbed of the egotistic pleasure of
being hospitable. Everybody look happy now!"</p>

<p>She got them all seated&mdash;all but Pinky. He had
long since seated himself, by the fire, in Claire's chair,
and he was smoking a cigar from the box which Jeff
had brought for Mr. Boltwood.</p>

<p>Milt sat farthest from the fire, by the dining-table.
He was agonizing, "This Jeff person is the real thing.
He's no Percy in riding-breeches. He's used to
society and nastiness. If he looks at me once more&mdash;young
garage man found froze stiff, near Flathead
Lake, scared look in eyes, believed to have met a
grizzly, no signs of vi'lence. And I thought I could
learn to mingle with Claire's own crowd! I wish I
was out in the bug. I wonder if I can't escape?"</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
THE FALLACY OF ROMANCE</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">During</span> dinner Milt watched Jeff Saxton's manner
and manners. The hot day had turned into
a cold night. Jeff tucked the knitted robe about
Claire's shoulders, when she returned to the fire. He
moved quietly and easily. He kept poking up the fire,
smiling at Claire as he did so. He seemed without
difficulty to maintain two conversations: one with Mr.
Boltwood about finances, one with Claire about mysterious
persons called Fannie and Alden and Chub and
Bobbie and Dot, the mention of whom made Milt
realize how much a stranger he was. Once, as he
passed by Claire, Jeff said gently, "You <i>are</i> lovely!"
Only that, and he did not look at her. But Milt saw
that Claire flushed, and her eyes dimmed.</p>

<p>Pinky was silent till he had eaten about two-thirds
of the total amount of fried eggs, cold lamb and ice-box
curios. When Claire came over to see how they
fared, Pinky removed himself, with smirking humility,
and firmly joined himself to Jeff and Mr. Boltwood.
He caught the subject of finance and, while Claire
dropped down in the chair by Milt, Pinky was lecturing
the two men from New York:</p>

<p>"Ah, finance! Queen of the sociological pantheon!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
I don't know how come I am so graced by Fortune as
to have encountered in these wilds two gentlemen so
obviously versed in the stratagems of the great golden
game, but I will take the opportunity to give you gentlemen
some statistics about the gold-deposits still
existent in the Cascades and other ranges that may be
of benefit and certainly will be a surprise to you. It
happens that I have at the present time a mine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Claire was whispering to Milt, "If we can get rid
of your dreadful passenger, I do want you to meet
Mr. Saxton. He may be of use to you some day.
He's terribly capable, and really quite nice. Think!
He happened to be out here, and he traced me by telephone&mdash;oh,
he treats long-distance 'phoning as I do
a hair-pin. He brought down the duckiest presents&mdash;divertissements
for dinner, and that knitted robe, and
some real Ren&eacute; Bleuzet perfume&mdash;I was all out of
it&mdash;&mdash; And after the grime of the road&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you really care for things like that, all those
awfully expensive luxuries?" begged Milt.</p>

<p>"Of course I do. Especially after small hotels."</p>

<p>"Then you don't really like adventuring?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;in its place! For one thing, it makes a
clever dinner seem so good by contrast!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash; Afraid I don't know much about clever
dinners," Milt was sighing, when he was aware of
Jeff Saxton looming down on him, demanding:</p>

<p>"Daggett, would you mind trying to inform your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
friend that neither Mr. Boltwood nor I care to
invest in his gold-mine? We can't seem to get that
into his head. I don't mind being annoyed myself,
but I really feel I must protect Mr. Boltwood."</p>

<p>"What can I do?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, since you brought him here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was the potassium cyanide and cracked ice and
carpet tacks and TNT and castor oil in Jeff's "My
dear sir" that did it. Milt discovered himself on his
feet, bawling, "I am not your dear sir! Pinky is my
guest, and&mdash;&mdash; Gee, sorry I lost my temper, Claire,
terrible sorry. See you along the road. Good night.
Pink! You take your hat! Git!"</p>

<p>Milt followed Pinky out of the door, snarling, "Git
in the car, and do it quick. I'll take you clear to
Blewett Pass. We drive all night."</p>

<p>Pinky was of great silence and tact. Milt lumped
into the bug beside him. But he did not start the all-night
drive. He wanted to crawl back, on his knees,
to apologize to Claire&mdash;and to be slapped by Jeff
Saxton. He compromised by slowly driving a quarter
of a mile up the road, and camping there for the night.</p>

<p>Pinky tried to speak words of philosophy and
cheer&mdash;just once he tried it.</p>

<p>For hours, by a small fire, Milt grieved that all his
pride was gone in a weak longing to see Claire again.
In the morning he did see her&mdash;putting off on the
lake, in a motor-boat with Jeff and Mr. Barmberry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
He saw the boat return, saw Jeff get into the car
which had brought him from Kalispell, saw the farewell,
the long handclasp, the stoop of Jeff's head, and
Claire's quick step backward before Jeff could kiss
her. But Claire waved to Jeff long after his car had
started.</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>When Claire and her father came along in the
Gomez, Milt was standing by the road. She stopped.
She smiled. "Night of sadness and regrets? You
were fairly rude, Milt. So was Mr. Saxton, but I've
lectured him, and he sends his apologies."</p>

<p>"I send him mine&mdash;'deed I do," said Milt gravely.</p>

<p>"Then everything's all right. I'm sure we were
all tired. We'll just forget it."</p>

<p>"Morning, Daggett," Mr. Boltwood put in. "Hope
you lose that dreadful red-headed person."</p>

<p>"No, I can't, Mr. Boltwood. When Mr. Saxton
turned on me, I swore I'd take Pinky clear through
to Blewett Pass ... though not to Seattle, by
golly!"</p>

<p>"Foolish oaths should be broken," Claire platitudinized.</p>

<p>"Claire&mdash;look&mdash;&mdash; You don't really care so terribly
much about these little luxuries, food and fixin's
and six-dollar-a-day-hotel junk, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," stoutly, "I do."</p>

<p>"But not compared with mountains and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>"Oh, it's all very well to talk, and be so superior
about these dear old grandeurs of Nature, and the
heroism of pioneers, and I do like a glimpse of them.
But the niceties of life do mean something and even
if it is weak and dependent, I shall always simply
adore them!"</p>

<p>"All these things are kind of softening." And he
meant that she was still soft.</p>

<p>"At least they're not rude!" And she meant that
he was rude.</p>

<p>"They're absolutely trivial. They shut off&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They shut off rain and snow and dirt, and I still
fail to see the picturesqueness of dirt! Good-by!"</p>

<p>She had driven off, without looking back. She
was heading for Seattle and the Pacific Ocean at
forty miles an hour&mdash;and they had no engagement to
meet either in Seattle or in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Before Milt went on he completed a task on which
he had decided the night before while he had meditated
on the tailored impertinence of Jeff Saxton's
gray suit. The task was to give away the Best Suit,
that stolid, very black covering which at Schoenstrom
had seemed suitable either to a dance or to the
Y. P. S. C. E. The recipient was Mr. Pinky Parrott,
who gave in return a history of charity and high
souls.</p>

<p>Milt did not listen. He was wondering, now that
they had started, where they had started for. Certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
not for Seattle! Why not stop and see Pinky's
gold-mine? Maybe he did have one. Even Pinky
had to tell the truth sometimes. With a good popular
gold-mine in his possession, Milt could buy quantities
of clothes like Jeff Saxton's, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"And," he reflected, "I can learn as good manners
as his in one hour, with a dancing lesson thrown in.
If I didn't, I'd sue the professor!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
THE NIGHT OF ENDLESS PINES</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">On</span> the edge of Kootenai Canyon, feeling more like
an aviator than like an automobilist, Claire had
driven, and now, nearing Idaho, she had entered a
national forest. She was delayed for hours, while she
tried to change a casing, after a blow-out when the
spare tire was deflated. She wished for Milt. She
would never see him again. She was sorry. He
hadn't meant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But hang it, she panted, if he admired her at all,
he'd be here now and get on this per-fect-ly beast-ly
casing, over which she had been laboring for a dozen
years; and she was simply too ridiculously tired; and
was there any respectful way of keeping Henry B.
from beaming in that benevolent manner while she
was killing herself; and look at those fingernails; and&mdash;oh,
drrrrrrat that casing!</p>

<p>To make the next town, after this delay, she had to
drive for hours by night through the hulking pines of
the national forest. It was her first long night drive.</p>

<p>A few claims, with log cabins of recent settlers,
once or twice the shack of a forest-ranger, a telephone
in a box by the road or a rough R. F. D. box nailed
to a pine trunk, these indicated that civilization still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
existed, but they were only melancholy blurs. She
was in a cold enchantment. All of her was dead save
the ability to keep on driving, forever, with no hope
of the tedium ending. She was bewildered. She
passed six times what seemed to be precisely the same
forest clearing, always with the road on a tiny ridge
to the left of the clearing, always with a darkness-stilled
house at one end and always, in the pasture at
the other end, a horse which neighed. She was in a
panorama stage-scene; things moved steadily by her,
there was a sound of the engine, and a sensation of
steering, but she was forever in the same place, among
the same pines, with the same scowling blackness between
their bare clean trunks. Only the road ahead
was clear: a one-way track, the foot-high earthy bank
and the pine-roots beside it, two distinct ruts, and a
roughening of strewn brown bark and pine-needles,
which, in the beating light of the car's lamps, made
the sandy road scabrous with little incessant shadows.</p>

<p>She had never known anything save this strained
driving on. Jeff and Milt were old tales, and untrue.
Was it ten hours before that she had cooked dinner
beside the road? No matter. She wasn't hungry any
longer. She would never reach the next town&mdash;and
she didn't care. It wasn't she, but a grim spirit which
had entered her dead body, that kept steering, feeding
gas, watching the road.</p>

<p>In the darkness outside the funnel of light from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
lamps were shadows that leaped, and gray hands
hastily jerked back out of sight behind tree trunks as
she came up; things that followed her, and hidden
men waiting for her to stop.</p>

<p>As drivers will, she tried to exorcise the creeping
fear by singing. She made up what she called her
driving-song. It was intended to echo the hoofs of
a fat old horse on a hard road:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 24em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The old horse trots with a jog, jog, jog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a jog, jog, jog; and a jog, jog, jog.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the old road makes a little jog, jog, jog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the west, jog, jog; and the north, jog, jog.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the farmer drinks some cider from his jug, jug, jug,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his coy jug, jug; from his joy jug, jug.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he accumulates a little jag, jag, jag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he jigs, jigs, jigs, with his jug, jug, jug&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The song was a comfort, at first&mdash;then a torment.
She drove to it, and she steered to it, and when she
tried to forget, it sang itself in her tired brain: "Jog,
jog, jog&mdash;oh, <i>damn</i>!"</p>

<p>Her father had had a chill. Miserable, weak as a
small boy, he had curled up on the bottom of the car,
his head on the seat, and gone to sleep. She was
alone. The mile-posts went by slowly. The posts
said there was a town ahead called Pellago, but it
never came&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>And when it did come she was too tired to care.
In a thick dream she drove through midnight streets
of the town. In stupid paralysis she kicked at the
door of the galvanized-iron-covered garage. No
answer. She gave it up. She drove down the street
and into the yard of a hotel marked by a swing sign
out over the plank sidewalk. She got out the traveling
bags, awakened her father, led him up on the porch.</p>

<p>The Pellago Tavern was a transformed dwelling
house. The pillars of the porch were aslant, and the
rain-warped boards snapped beneath her feet. She
hesitatingly opened the door. The hallway was dark
and musty. A sound like a moan filtered down the
unlighted stairs.</p>

<p>There seemed to be light in the room on the right.
Trying to assure herself that her father was a protection,
she pushed open the door. She looked into an
airless room, scattered with rubber boots, unsavory
old corduroy caps, tattered magazines. By the stove
nodded a wry-mouthed, squat old woman, and a tall,
cheaply handsome man of forty. Tobacco juice
stained the front of his stiff-bosomed, collarless shirt.
His hands were white but huge.</p>

<p>The old woman started. "Well?"</p>

<p>"I want to get two rooms for the night, please."</p>

<p>The man smirked at her. The woman creaked,
"Well, I don't know. Where d' you come from,
heh?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>"We're motoring through."</p>

<p>"Heh? Who's that man?"</p>

<p>"He's my father, madam."</p>

<p>"Needn't to be so hoity-toity about it, 'he's my
father, madam!' F' that matter, that thing there is
my husband!"</p>

<p>The man had been dusting his shabby coat, stroking
his mustache, smiling with sickly gallantry. He burbled,
"Shut up, Teenie. This lady is all right. Give
her a room. Number 2 is empty, and I guess Number
7 has been made up since Bill left&mdash;if 'tain't, the sheets
ain't been slept on but one night."</p>

<p>"Where d' you come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now don't go shooting off a lot of questions at
the lady, Teenie. I'll show her the rooms."</p>

<p>The woman turned on her husband. He was perhaps
twenty-five years younger; a quarter-century less
soaked in hideousness. Her yellow, concave-sided
teeth were bared at him, her mouth drew up on one
side above the gums. "Pete, if I hear one word more
out of you, out you go. Lady! Huh! Where d' you
come from, young woman?"</p>

<p>Claire was too weak to stagger away. She leaned
against the door. Her father struggled to speak, but
the woman hurled:</p>

<p>"Wherdjuhcomfromised!"</p>

<p>"From New York. Is there another hotel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nah, there ain't another hotel! Oh! So you come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
from New York, do you? Snobs, that's what N'
Yorkers are. I'll show you some rooms. They'll be
two dollars apiece, and breakfast fifty cents extra."</p>

<p>The woman led them upstairs. Claire wanted to
flee, but&mdash;&mdash; Oh, she couldn't drive any farther!
She couldn't!</p>

<p>The floor of her room was the more bare in contrast
to a two-foot-square splash of gritty ingrain
carpet in front of the sway-backed bed. On the bed
was a red comforter that was filthy beyond disguise.
The yellow earthenware pitcher was cracked. The
wall mirror was milky. Claire had been spoiled. She
had found two excellent hotels since Yellowstone
Park. She had forgotten how badly human beings can
live. She protested:</p>

<p>"Seems to me two dollars is a good deal to charge
for this!"</p>

<p>"I didn't say two dollars. I said three! Three
each for you and your pa. If you don't like it you
can drive on to the next town. It's only sixteen
miles!"</p>

<p>"Why the extra dollar&mdash;or extra two dollars?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see that carpet? These is our best
rooms. And three dollars&mdash;&mdash; I know you New
Yorkers. I heard of a gent once, and they charged
him five dollars&mdash;five dol-lars!&mdash;for a room in New
York, and a boy grabbed his valise from him and
wanted a short-bit and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>"Oh&mdash;all&mdash;right! Can we get something to eat?"</p>

<p>"Now!?"</p>

<p>"We haven't eaten since noon."</p>

<p>"That ain't my fault! Some folks can go gadding
around in automobuls, and some folks has to stay at
home. If you think I'm going to sit up all night
cooking for people that come chassayin' in here God
knows what all hours of the day and night&mdash;&mdash;!
There's an all-night lunch down the street."</p>

<p>When she was alone Claire cried a good deal.</p>

<p>Her father declined to go out to the lunch room.
The chill of the late ride was still on him, he croaked
through his door; he was shivering; he was going
right to bed.</p>

<p>"Yes, do, dear. I'll bring you back a sandwich."</p>

<p>"Safe to go out alone?"</p>

<p>"Anything's safe after facing that horrible&mdash;&mdash; I
do believe in witches, now. Listen, dear; I'll bring
you a hot-water bag."</p>

<p>She took the bag down to the office. The landlady
was winding the clock, while her husband yawned.
She glared.</p>

<p>"I wonder if I may have some hot water for my
father? He has a chill."</p>

<p>"Stove's out. No hot water in the house."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you heat some?"</p>

<p>"Now look here, miss. You come in here, asking
for meals and rooms at midnight, and you want a cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
rate on everything, and I do what I can, but enough's
enough!"</p>

<p>The woman stalked out. Her husband popped up.
"Mustn't mind the old girl, lady. Got a grouch.
Well, you can't blame her, in a way; when Bill lit out,
he done her out of four-bits! But I'll tell you!" he
leered. "You leave me the hot-water biznai, and I'll
heat you some water myself!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, but I won't trouble you. Good night."</p>

<p>Claire was surprised to find a warm, rather comfortable
all-night lunch room, called the Alaska Caf&eacute;,
with a bright-eyed man of twenty-five in charge. He
nodded in a friendly way, and made haste with her
order of two ham-and-egg sandwiches. She felt adventurous.
She polished her knife and fork on a
napkin, as she had seen people do in lunches along the
way. A crowd of three rubbed their noses against
the front window to stare at the strange girl in town,
but she ignored them, and they drifted away.</p>

<p>The lunchman was cordial: "At a hotel, ma'am?
Which one? Gee, not the Tavern?"</p>

<p>"Why yes. Is there another?"</p>

<p>"Sure. First-rate one, two blocks over, one up."</p>

<p>"The woman said the Tavern was the only hotel."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's an old sour-face. Don't mind her. Just
bawl her out. What's she charging you for a room?"</p>

<p>"Three dollars."</p>

<p>"Per each? Gee! Well, she sticks tourists anywheres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
from one buck to three. Natives get by for
fifty cents. She's pretty fierce, but she ain't a patch on
her husband. He comes from Spokane&mdash;nobody
knows why&mdash;guess he was run out. He takes some
kind of dope, and he cheats at rummy."</p>

<p>"But why does the town stand either of them?
Why do you let them torture innocent people? Why
don't you put them in the insane hospital, where they
belong?"</p>

<p>"That's a good one!" her friend chuckled. But
he saw it only as a joke.</p>

<p>She thought of moving her father to the good hotel,
but she hadn't the strength.</p>

<p>Claire Boltwood, of Brooklyn Heights, went
through the shanty streets of Pellago, Montana, at
one <span class="smcapl">A.M.</span> carrying a sandwich in a paper bag which had
recently been used for salted peanuts, and a red rubber
hot-water bag filled with water at the Alaska
Caf&eacute;. At the Tavern she hastened past the office door.
She made her father eat his sandwich; she teased him
and laughed at him till the hot-water bag had relieved
his chill-pinched back; she kissed him boisterously,
and started for her own room, at the far end of the
hall.</p>

<p>The lights were off. She had to feel her way, and
she hesitated at the door of her room before she entered.
She imagined voices, creeping footsteps,
people watching her from a distance. She flung into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the room, and when the kindled lamp showed her
familiar traveling bag, she felt safer. But once she
was in bed, with the sheet down as far as possible over
the loathly red comforter, the quiet rustled and snapped
about her, and she could not relax. Sinking into sleep
seemed slipping into danger, and a dozen times she
started awake.</p>

<p>But only slowly did she admit to herself that she
actually did hear a fumbling, hear the knob of her
door turning.</p>

<p>"W-who's there?"</p>

<p>"It's me, lady. The landlord. Brought you the
hot water."</p>

<p>"Thanks so much, but I don't need it now."</p>

<p>"Got something else for you. Come to the door.
Don't want to holler and wake ev'body up."</p>

<p>At the door she said timorously, "Nothing else I
want, thank you. D-don't bother me."</p>

<p>"Why, I've brought you up a sandwich, girlie, all
nice and hot, and a nip of something to take the chill
off."</p>

<p>"I don't want it, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Be a sport now! You use Pete right, and he'll use
you right. Shame to see a lady like you not gettin'
no service here. Open the door. Dandy sandwich!"
The knob rattled again. She said nothing. The heel
of her palm pressed against the door till the molding
ate into it. The man was snorting:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>"I ain't going to all this trouble and then throw
away a good sandwich. You asked me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"M-must I s-shout?"</p>

<p>"S-shout your fool head off!" He kicked the door.
"Good friends of mine, 'long this end of the hall.
Aw, listen. Just teasing. I'm not going to rob you,
little honey bird. Laws, you could have a million
dollars, and old Pete wouldn't take two-bits. I just
get so darn lonely in this hick town. Like to chat to
live ones from the big burg. I'm a city fella myself&mdash;Spokane
and Cheyenne and everything."</p>

<p>In her bare feet, Claire had run across the room,
looked desperately out of the window. Could she
climb out, reach her friend of the Alaska Caf&eacute;? If
she had to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Then she grinned. The world was rose-colored
and hung with tinkling bells. "I love even that
Pinky person!" she said. In the yard of the hotel,
beside her Gomez, was a Teal bug, and two men were
sleeping in blankets on the ground.</p>

<p>She marched over to the door. She flung it open.
The man started back. He was holding an electric,
torch. She could not see him, but to the hovering ball
of light she remarked, "Two men, friends of mine, are
below, by their car. You will go at once, or I'll call
them. If you think I am bluffing, go down and look.
Good night!"</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
THE FREE WOMAN</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Before</span> breakfast, Claire darted down to the
hotel yard. She beamed at Milt, who was lacing
a rawhide patch on a tire, before she remembered that
they were not on speaking terms. They both looked
extremely sheepish and young. It was Pinky Parrott
who was the social lubricant. Pinky was always on
speaking terms with everybody. "Ah, here she is!
The little lady of the mutinous eyes! Our colonel of
the flivver hussars!"</p>

<p>But he got no credit. Milt straightened up and
lumbered, "Hel-lo!"</p>

<p>She peeped at him and whispered, "Hel-lo!"</p>

<p>"Say, oh please, Claire&mdash;&mdash; I didn't mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! Let's&mdash;let's go have breakfast."</p>

<p>"Was awfully afraid you'd think we were fresh,
but when we came in last night, and saw your car&mdash;didn't
like the looks of the hotel much, and thought
we'd stick around."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad. Oh, Milt&mdash;yes, and you, Mr. Parrott&mdash;will
you whip&mdash;lick&mdash;beat up&mdash;however you
want to say it&mdash;somebody for me?"</p>

<p>With one glad communal smile Milt and Pinky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
curved up their wrists and made motions as of pulling
up their sleeves.</p>

<p>"But not unless I say so. I want to be a Citizeness
Fixit. I've been good for so long. But now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Show him to me!" and "Up, lads, and atum!"
responded her squad.</p>

<p>"Not till after breakfast."</p>

<p>It was a sufficiently vile breakfast, at the Tavern.
The feature was curious cakes whose interior was
raw creepy dough. A dozen skilled workmen were at
the same long table with Claire, Milt, Pinky, and Mr.
Boltwood&mdash;the last two of whom were polite and
scenically descriptive to each other, but portentously
silent about gold-mines. The landlady and a slavey
waited on table; the landlord could be seen loafing in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the meal Claire insultingly
crooked her finger at the landlady and said, "Come
here, woman."</p>

<p>The landlady stared, then ignored her.</p>

<p>"Very well. Then I'll say it publicly!" Claire
swept the workmen with an affectionate smile.
"Gentlemen of Pellago, I want you to know from one
of the poor tourists who have been cheated at this
nasty place that we depend on you to do something.
This woman and her husband are criminals, in the
way they overcharge for hideous food and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The landlady had been petrified. Now she charged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
down. Behind her came her husband. Milt arose.
The husband stopped. But it was Pinky who faced
the landlady, tapped her shoulder, and launched into,
"And what's more, you hag, if our new friends here
have any sense, they'll run you out of town."</p>

<p>That was only the beginning of Pinky's paper on
corrections and charities. He enjoyed himself. Before
he finished, the landlady was crying ... she
voluntarily promised to give her boarders waffles, some
morning, jus' soon as she could find the waffle-iron.</p>

<p>With her guard about her, at the office desk, Claire
paid one dollar apiece for the rooms, and discussion
was not.</p>

<p>Before they started, Milt had the chance to say to
her, "I'm getting so I can handle Pinky now. Have
to. Thinking of getting hold of his gold-mine. I
just give him the eye, as your friend Mr. Saxton
would, and he gets so meek&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But don't! Please understand me, Milt; I do admire
Mr. Saxton; he is fine and capable, and really
generous; only&mdash;&mdash; He may be just a bit snippish at
times, while you&mdash;you're a playmate&mdash;father's and
mine&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash; I did face that landlady, didn't I!
I'm not soft and trivial, am I! Praise!"</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>She had driven through the panhandle of Idaho
into Washington, through Spokane, through the writhing
lava deposits of Moses Coulee where fruit trees<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
grow on volcanic ash. Beyond Wenatchee, with its
rows of apple trees striping the climbing fields like
corduroy in folds, she had come to the famous climb
of Blewett Pass. Once over that pass, and Snoqualmie,
she would romp into Seattle.</p>

<p>She was sorry that she hadn't come to know Milt
better, but perhaps she would see him in Seattle.</p>

<p>Not adventure alone was she finding, but high intellectual
benefit in studying the names of towns in the
state of Washington. Not Kankakee nor Kalamazoo
nor Oshkosh can rival the picturesque fancy of Washington,
and Claire combined the town-names in a lyric
so emotion-stirring that it ought, perhaps, to be the
national anthem. It ran:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Humptulips, Tum Tum, Moclips, Yelm,<br /></span>

<p>"And then," complained Claire, "they talk about
Amy Lowell! I leave it to you, Henry B., if any union
poet has ever written as gay a refrain as 'Ohop
Ladd'!"</p>

<p>She was not merely playing mental whist. She was
trying to keep from worry. All the way she had heard
of Blewett Pass; its fourteen miles of climbing, and
the last half mile of stern pitch. On this eastern side
of the pass, the new road was not open; there was a
tortuous, flint-scattered trail, too narrow, in most
places, for the passing of other cars. Claire was glad
that Milt and Pinky were near her.</p>

<p>If so many of the race of kind advisers of tourists<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
had not warned her about it, doubtless she would have
gone over the pass without difficulty. But their voluntary
croaking sapped her nerve, and her father's.
He kept worrying, "Do you think we better try it?"
When they stopped at a ranch house at the foot of the
climb, for the night, he seemed unusually tired. He
complained of chill. He did not eat breakfast. They
started out silent, depressed.</p>

<p>He crouched in the corner of the seat. She looked
at him and was anxious. She stopped on the first
level space on the pass, crying, "You are perfectly
miserable. I'm afraid of&mdash;&mdash; I think we ought to
see a doctor."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be all right."</p>

<p>But she waited till Milt came pit-pattering up the
slope. "Father feels rather sick. What shall I do?
Turn round and drive to the nearest doctor&mdash;at Cashmere,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"There's a magnolious medico ahead here on the
pass," Pinky Parrott interrupted. "A young thing,
but they say he's a graduate of Harvard. He's out
here because he has some timber-claims. Look, Milt
o' the Daggett, why don't you drive Miss Boltwood's
'bus&mdash;make better time, and hustle the old gent up to
the doc, and I'll come on behind with your machine."</p>

<p>"Why," Claire fretted, "I hate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A new Milt, the boss, abrupt, almost bullying,
snapped out of his bug. "Good idee. Jump in, Claire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
I'll take your father up. Heh, whasat, Pink? Yes, I
get it; second turn beyond grocery. Right. On we
go. Huh? Oh, we'll think about the gold-mine later,
Pink."</p>

<p>With the three of them wedged into the seat of the
Gomez, and Pinky recklessly skittering after them in
the bug, they climbed again&mdash;and lo! there was no
climb! Unconsciously Claire had hesitated before
dashing at each sharp upsloping bend; had lost headway
while she was wondering, "Suppose the car went
off this curve?" Milt never sped up, but he never
slackened. His driving was as rhythmical as music.</p>

<p>They were so packed in that he could scarcely reach
gear lever and hand-brake. He halted on a level, and
curtly asked, "That trap-door in the back of the car&mdash;convertible
extra seat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we almost never use it, and it's stuck.
Can't get it open."</p>

<p>"I'll open it all right! Got a big screwdriver?
Want you sit back there. Need elbow room."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better drive with Mr. Pinky."</p>

<p>"Nope. Don't think better."</p>

<p>With one yank he opened the trap-door, revealing a
folding seat, which she meekly took. Back there, she
reflected, "How strong his back looks. Funny how
the little silvery hairs grow at the back of his neck."</p>

<p>They came to a settlement and the red cedar bungalow
of Dr. Hooker Beach. The moment Claire saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the doctor's thin demanding face, she trusted him. He
spoke to Mr. Boltwood with assurance: "All you need
is some rest, and your digestion is a little shaky. Been
eating some pork? Might stay here a day or two.
We're glad to have a glimpse of Easterners."</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood went to bed in the Beaches' guest-room.
Mrs. Beach gave Claire and Milt lunch, with
thin toast and thin china, on a porch from which an
arroyo dropped down for a hundred feet. Fir trees
scented the air, and a talking machine played the same
Russian music that was popular that same moment in
New York. And the Beaches knew people who knew
Claire.</p>

<p>Claire was thinking. These people were genuine
aristocrats, while Jeff Saxton, for all his family and
his assumptions about life, was the eternal climber.
Milt, who had been uncomfortable with Jeff, was
serene and un-self-conscious with the Beaches, and the
doctor gratefully took his advice about his stationary
gas engine. "He's rather like the Beaches in his
simplicity&mdash;yes, and his ability to do anything if he
considers it worth while," she decided.</p>

<p>After lunch, when the doctor and his wife had to
trot off to a patient, Claire proposed, "Let's walk up
to that ledge of rock and see the view, shall we, Milt?"</p>

<p>"Yes! And keep an eye on the road for Pinky.
The poor nut, he hasn't showed up. So reckless; hope
he hasn't driven the Teal off the road."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>She crouched at the edge of a rock, where she would
have been frightened, a month before, and looked
across the main road to a creek in a pine-laced gully.
He sat beside her, elbows on knees.</p>

<p>"Those Beaches&mdash;their kin are judges and senators
and college Presidents, all over New England," she
said. "This doctor must be the grandson of the ambassador,
I fancy."</p>

<p>"Honest? I thought they were just regular folks.
Was I nice?"</p>

<p>"Of course you were."</p>

<p>"Did I&mdash;did I wash my paws and sit up and beg?"</p>

<p>"No, you aren't a little dog. I'm that. You're the
big mastiff that guards the house, while I run and
yip." She was turned toward him, smiling. Her hand
was beside him. He touched the back of it with his
forefinger, as though he was afraid he might soil it.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no reason, but he was trembling
as he stammered, "I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm d-darn glad I didn't
know they were anybody, or 'd have been as bad as a
flivver driver the first time he tries a t-twelve-cylinder
machine. G-gee your hand is little!"</p>

<p>She took it back and inspected it. "I suppose it is.
And pretty useless."</p>

<p>"N-no, it isn't, but your shoes are. Why don't you
wear boots when you're out like this?" A flicker of
his earlier peremptoriness came into his voice. She
resented it:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>"My shoes are perfectly sensible! I will not wear
those horrible vegetarian uplift sacks on my feet!"</p>

<p>"Your shoes may be all right for New York, but
you're not going to New York for a while. You've
simply got to see some of this country while you're
out here&mdash;British Columbia and Alaska."</p>

<p>"Would be nice, but I've had enough roughing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Chance to see the grandest mountains in the world,
almost, and then you want to go back to tea and all
that junk!"</p>

<p>"Stop trying to bully me! You have been dictatorial
ever since we started up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have I? Didn't mean to be. Though I suppose
I usually am bullying. At least I run things. There's
two kinds of people; those that give orders, and those
that naturally take them; and I belong to the first one,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But my dear Milt, so do I, and really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And mostly I'd take them from you. But hang
it, Seattle is just a day away, and you'll forget me.
Wish I could kidnap you. Have half a mind to. Take
you way up into the mountains, and when you got used
to roughing it in sure-enough wilderness&mdash;say you'd
helped me haul timber for a flume&mdash;then we'd be real
pals. You have the stuff in you, but you still need
toughening before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Milton. You have been reading fiction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
about this man&mdash;sometimes he's a lumberjack,
and sometimes a trapper or a miner, but always he's
frightfully hairy&mdash;and he sees a charming woman in
the city, and kidnaps her, and shuts her up in some
unspeakable shanty, and makes her eat nice cold boiled
potatoes, and so naturally, she simply adores him!
A hundred men have written that story, and it's an
example of their insane masculine conceit, which I, as
a woman, resent. Shakespeare may have started it,
with his silly <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>. Shakespeare's
men may have been real, but his women were dolls, designed
to please some majesty. You may not know it,
but there are women today who don't live just to please
majesties' fancies. If a woman like me were kidnapped,
she would go on hating the brute, or if she
did give in, then the man would lose anyway, because
she would have degenerated; she'd have turned into a
slave, and lost exactly the things he'd liked in her.
Oh, you cavemen! With your belief that you can
force women to like you! I have more courage than
any of you!"</p>

<p>"I admit you have courage, but you'd have still
more, if you bucked the wilds."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! In New York I face every day a
hundred complicated problems you don't know I ever
heard of!"</p>

<p>"Let me remind you that Brer Julius C&aelig;sar said
he'd rather be mayor in a little Spanish town than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
police commissioner in Rome. I'm king in Schoenstrom,
while you're just one of a couple hundred
thousand bright people in New York&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really? Oh, at least a million. Thanks!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;gee&mdash;Claire, I didn't mean to be personal,
and get in a row and all, but&mdash;can't you see&mdash;kind of
desperate&mdash;Seattle so soon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her face was turned from him; its thin profile was
firm as silver wire. He blundered off into silence and&mdash;they
were at it again!</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to make you angry," he gulped.</p>

<p>"Well, you did! Bullying&mdash;&mdash; You and your men
of granite, in mackinaws and a much-needed shave,
trying to make a well-bred woman satisfied with a
view consisting of rocks and stumps and socks on the
line! Let me tell you that compared with a street
canyon, a mountain canyon is simply dead, and yet
these unlettered wild men&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"See here! I don't know if you're firing these adjectives
at me, but I don't know that I'm so much
more unlettered&mdash;&mdash; You talked about taking French
in your finishing-school. Well, they taught American
in mine!"</p>

<p>"They would!"</p>

<p>Then he was angry. "Yes, and chemistry and
physics and Greek and Latin and history and mathematics
and economics, and I took more or less of a
whirl at all of them, while you were fiddling with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
ribbons, and then I had to buck mechanics and business
methods."</p>

<p>"I also 'fiddled' with manners&mdash;an unfortunate
omission in your curriculum, I take it! You have been
reasonably rude&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So have you!"</p>

<p>"I had to be! But I trust you begin to see that even
your strong hand couldn't control a woman's taste.
Kidnapping! As intelligent a boy as you wanting to
imitate these boorish movie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a darn bit more boorish than your smart set,
with its champagne and these orgies at country
clubs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You know so much about country clubs, don't
you! The worst orgy I ever saw at one was the golf
champion reading the beauty department in <i>Boudoir</i>.
Would you mind backing up your statements about the
vices of myself and my friends&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you. Oh, I didn't mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then why did you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now you're bullying me, and you know that if the
smart set isn't vicious, at least it's so snobbish that it
can't see any&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then it's wise to be snobbish, because if it did
condescend&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't stand people talking about condescending&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would you mind not shouting so?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>"Very well! I'll keep still!"</p>

<p>Silence again, while both of them looked unhappy,
and tried to remember just what they had been fighting
about. They did not at first notice a small red car
larruping gaily over the road beneath the ledge,
though the driver was a pink-haired man in a green
coat. He was almost gone before Milt choked, "It's
Pinky!"</p>

<p>"Pink! Pinky!" he bellowed.</p>

<p>Pinky looked back but, instead of stopping, he sped
up, and kept going.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
THE MINE OF LOST SOULS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"That</span> couldn't have been Pinky! Why! Why,
the car he had was red," cried Claire.</p>

<p>"Sure. The idiot's got hold of some barn paint
somewhere, and tried to daub it over. He's trying to
make a getaway with it!"</p>

<p>"We'll chase him. In my car."</p>

<p>"Don't you mind?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I do not give up my objections to
the roughing philosophy, but&mdash;&mdash; You were right
about these shoes&mdash;&mdash; Oh, don't leave me behind!
Want to go along!"</p>

<p>These sentences she broke, scattered, and totally lost
as she scrambled after him, down the rocks. He
halted. His lips trembled. He picked her up, carried
her down, hesitated a second while his face&mdash;curiously
foreshortened as she looked up at it from his big
arms&mdash;twisted with emotion. He set her down gently,
and she climbed into the Gomez.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that he drove rather too carefully,
too slowly. He took curves and corners evenly. His
face was as empty of expression, as unmelodramatic,
as that of a jitney driver. Then she looked at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
speedometer. He was making forty-eight miles an
hour down hill and forty to thirty on upgrades.</p>

<p>They were in sight of the fleeing Pinky in two miles.
Pinky looked back; instantly was to be seen pulling
his hat low, stooping over&mdash;the demon driver. Milt
merely sat more erect, looked more bland and white-browed
and steady.</p>

<p>The bug fled before them on a winding shelf road.
It popped up a curve, then slowed down. "He took it
too fast. Poor Pink!" said Milt.</p>

<p>They gained on that upslope, but as the road
dropped, the bug started forward desperately. Another
car was headed toward them; was drawn to the
side of the road, in one of the occasional widenings.
Pinky passed it so carelessly that, with crawling spine,
Claire saw the outer wheels of the bug on the very
edge of the road&mdash;the edge of a fifty-foot drop. Milt
went easily past the halted car&mdash;even waved his hand
to the waiting driver.</p>

<p>This did not seem to Claire at all like the chase
of a thief. She looked casually ahead at Pinky, as he
whirled round an S-shaped curve on the downslope,
then&mdash;&mdash; It was too quick to see what happened.
The bug headed directly toward the edge of the road,
shot out, went down the embankment, over and over.
It lay absurdly upside-down, its muffler and brake-rods
showing in place of the seat and hood.</p>

<p>Milt quite carefully stopped the Gomez. The day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
was still&mdash;just a breathing of running water in the
deep gully. The topsy-turvy car below them was
equally still; no sight of Pinky, no sound.</p>

<p>The gauche boy gone from him, Milt took her hand,
pressed it to his cheek. "Claire! You're here! You
might have gone with him, to make room&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I
was bullying you because I was bullying myself! Trying
to make myself tell you&mdash;but oh, you know, you
know! Can you stand going down there? I hate to
have you, but you may be needed."</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll come," she whispered.</p>

<p>Their crawl down the rock-rolling embankment
seemed desperately slow.</p>

<p>"Wait here," bade Milt, at the bottom.</p>

<p>She looked away from the grotesque car. She had
seen that one side of it was crumpled like paper in an
impatient hand.</p>

<p>Milt was stooping, looking under; seemed to be saying
something. When he came back, he did not speak.
He wiped his forehead. "Come. We'll climb back
up. Nothing to do, now. Guess you better not try
to help, anyway. You might not sleep well."</p>

<p>He gave her his hand up the embankment, drove to
the nearest house, telephoned to Dr. Beach. Later she
waited while Milt and the doctor, with two other men,
were raising the car. As she waited she thought of
the Teal bug as a human thing&mdash;as her old friend,
to which she had often turned in need.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>Milt returned to her. "There is one thing for
you to do. Before he died, Pinky asked me to go
get his wife&mdash;Dolores, I think it is. She's up in a
side canyon, few miles away. She may want a woman
around. Beach will take care of&mdash;of him. Can you
come?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Oh, Milt, I didn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;mean you were a caveman! You're my big brother!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;mean you were a snob!"</p>

<p>They drove five miles along the highway, then up a
trail where the Gomez brushed the undergrowth on
each side as it desperately dug into moss, rain-gutted
ruts, loose rocks, all on a vicious slant which seemed to
push the car down again. Beside them, the mountain
woods were sacredly quiet, with fern and lily and
green-lit spaces. They came out in a clearing, before
dusk. Beside the clearing was a brook, with a crude
cradle&mdash;sign of a not very successful gold miner. Before
a log cabin, in a sway-sided rocker, creaked a
tall, white, flabby woman, once nearly beautiful, now
rubbed at the edges. She rose, huddling her wrapper
about her bosom, as they drove into the clearing and
picked their way through stumps and briars.</p>

<p>"Where you folks think you're going?" she whimpered.</p>

<p>"Why, why just&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>"I cer'nly am glad to see somebody! I been 'most
scared to death. Been here alone two weeks now. Got
a shotgun, but if anybody come, I guess they'd take
it away from me. I was brought up nice, no rough-house
or&mdash;&mdash; Say, did you folks come to see the
gold-mine?"</p>

<p>"M-mine?" babbled Milt.</p>

<p>"Course not. Pinky said I was to show it, but I'm
so sore on that low-life hound now, I swear I won't
even take the trouble and lie about it. No more gold
in that crick than there is in my eye. Or than there's
flour or pork in the house!"</p>

<p>The woman's voice was rising. Her gestures were
furious. Claire and Milt stood close, their hands slipping
together.</p>

<p>"What d' you think of a man that'd go off and leave
a lady without half enough to eat, while he gallivanted
around, trying to raise money by gambling, when he
was offered a good job up here? He's a gambler&mdash;told
me he was a rich mine-owner, but never touched
a mine in his life. Lying hound&mdash;worst talker in ten
counties! Got a gambler's hand on him, too&mdash;I ought
to seen it! Oh, wait till I get hold of him; just wait!"</p>

<p>Claire thought of the still hand&mdash;so still&mdash;that she
had seen under the edge of the upturned car. She tried
to speak, while the woman raved on, wrath feeding
wrath:</p>

<p>"Thank God, I ain't really his wife! My husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
is a fine man&mdash;Mr. Kloh&mdash;Dlorus Kloh, my name is.
Mr. Kloh's got a fine job with the mill, at North
Yakima. Oh, I was a fool! This gambler Pinky Parrott,
he comes along with his elegant ways, and he
hands me out a swell line of gab, and I ups and leaves
poor Kloh, and the kid, and the nicest kid&mdash;&mdash; Say,
please, could you folks take me wherever you're going?
Maybe I could get a job again&mdash;used to was a good
waitress, and I ain't going to wait here any longer for
that lying, cheating, mean-talking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mrs. Kloh, please don't! He's dead!" wailed
Claire.</p>

<p>"Dead? Pinky? Oh&mdash;my&mdash;God! And I won't
ever see him, and he was so funny and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She threw herself on the ground; she kicked her
heels; she tore at her loosely caught, tarnished blonde
hair.</p>

<p>Claire knelt by her. "You mustn't&mdash;you mustn't&mdash;we'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn you, with your smug-faced husband there,
and your fine auto and all, butting into poor folks'
troubles!" shrieked Dlorus.</p>

<p>Claire stumbled to her feet, stood with her clenched
right hand to her trembling lips, cupping it with her
nervous left hand. Her shoulders were dejected.
Milt pleaded, "Let's hike out. I don't mind decent
honest grease, but this place&mdash;look in at table! Dirty
dishes&mdash;&mdash; And gin bottles on the floor!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>"Desert her? When she needs me so?" Claire
started forward, but Milt caught her sleeve, and admired,
"You were right! You've got more nerve
than I have!"</p>

<p>"No. I wouldn't dare if&mdash;&mdash; I'm glad you're here
with me!"</p>

<p>Claire calmed the woman; bound up her hair;
washed her face&mdash;which needed it; and sat on the log
doorstep, holding Dlorus's head in her lap, while
Dlorus sobbed, "Pinky&mdash;dead! Him that was so
lively! And he was so sweet a lover, oh, so sweet.
He was a swell fellow; my, he could just make you
laugh and cry, the way he talked; and he was so
educated, and he played the vi'lin&mdash;he could do anything&mdash;and
athaletic&mdash;he would have made me rich.
Oh, let me alone. I just want to be alone and think
of him. I was so bored with Kloh, and no nice dresses
or nothin', and&mdash;I did love the kid, but he squalled so,
just all the time, and Pinky come, and he was so
funny&mdash;&mdash; Oh, let me alone!"</p>

<p>Claire shivered, then, and the strength seemed to
go from the steady arms that had supported Dlorus's
head. Dusk had sneaked up on them; the clearing was
full of swimming grayness, and between the woman's
screams, the woods crackled. Each time Dlorus spoke,
her screech was like that of an animal in the woods,
and round about them crept such sinister echoes that
Milt kept wanting to look back over his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>"Yes," sighed Claire at last, "perhaps we'd better
go."</p>

<p>"If you go, I'll kill myself! Take me to Mr. Kloh!
Oh, he was&mdash;&mdash; My husband, Mr. Kloh. Oh, so
good. Only he didn't understand a lady has to have
her good times, and Pink danced so well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dlorus sprang up, flung into the cabin, stood in the
dimness of the doorway, holding a butcher knife and
clamoring, "I will! I'll kill myself if you leave me!
Take me down to Mr. Kloh, at North Yakima, tonight!"</p>

<p>Milt sauntered toward her.</p>

<p>"Don't you get flip, young man! I mean it!
And I'll kill you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Most unchivalrously, quite out of the picture of
gray grief, Milt snapped, "That'll be about enough
of you! Here! Gimme that knife!"</p>

<p>She dropped the knife, sniveling, "Oh Gawd, somebody's
always bullying me! And all I wanted was a
good time!"</p>

<p>Claire herded her into the cabin. "We'll take you
to your husband&mdash;tonight. Come, let's wash up, and
I'll help you put on your prettiest dress."</p>

<p>"Honest, will you?" cried the woman, in high
spirits, all grief put aside. "I got a dandy China
silk dress, and some new white kid shoes! My, Mr.
Kloh, he won't hardly know me. He'll take me back.
I know how to handle him. That'll be swell, going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
back in an automobile. And I got a new hair-comb,
with genuine Peruvian diamonds. Say, you aren't
kidding me along?"</p>

<p>In the light of the lantern Milt had kindled, Claire
looked questioningly at him. Both of them shrugged.
Claire promised, "Yes. Tonight. If we can make
it."</p>

<p>"And will you jolly Mr. Kloh for me? Gee, I'll be
awfully scared of him. I swear, I'll wash his dishes
and everything. He's a good man. He&mdash;&mdash; Say, he
ain't seen my new parasol, neither!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
ACROSS THE ROOF OF THE WORLD</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Claire</span> dressed Dlorus, cooked a dinner of beet
greens, potatoes, and trout; and by bullying and
great sweetness kept Dlorus from too many trips to
the gin bottle. Milt caught the trout, cut wood, locked
in a log shed Pinky's forlorn mining-tools. They
started for North Yakima at eight of the evening, with
Dlorus, back in the spare seat, alternately sobbing and
to inattentive ears announcing what she'd say to the
Old Hens.</p>

<p>Milt was devoted to persuading the huge cat of a
car to tiptoe down the slippery gouged ruts of the
road, and Claire's mind was driving with him. Every
time he touched the foot-brake, she could feel the
strain in the tendons of her own ankle.</p>

<p>A mile down the main road they stopped at a store-post-office
to telephone back to Mr. Boltwood and Dr.
Beach. On the porch was a man in overalls and laced
boots. He was lean and quick-moving. As he raised
his head, and his spectacles flashed, Claire caught Milt's
arm and gasped, "Oh, my dear, I'm in a beautiful
state of nerves. For a moment I thought that was
Jeff Saxton. I bet it is his astral body!"</p>

<p>"And you thought he was going to forbid your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
running away on this fool expedition, and you were
scared," chuckled Milt, as they sat in the car.</p>

<p>"Of course I was! And I still am! I know what
he'll say afterward! He <i>is</i> here, reasoning with me.
Oughtn't I to be sensible? Oughtn't I to have you
leave me at the Beaches' before you start&mdash;jolly jaunt
to take a strange woman to her presumably homicidal
husband! Why am I totally lacking in sense? Just
listen to what Jeff is saying!"</p>

<p>"Of course you ought to go back, and let me drive
alone. Absolutely insane, your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you would like me to go along, wouldn't
you!"</p>

<p>"Like you to? It's our last ride together, and that
bloomin' old Browning never thought of a ride together
by midnight over the roof of the world! No,
it's really our first ride together, and tomorrow&mdash;you're
gone."</p>

<p>"No, I sha'n't be gone, but&mdash;&mdash;" Addressing herself
to the astounded overalled man on the porch, she
declared, "You're quite right, Jeff. And Milt is
wrong. Insane adventure. Only, it's wonderful to
be young enough to do insane adventures. Falling
down abyssy places is so much more interesting than
bridge. I'm going&mdash;going&mdash;going!... Milt, you telephone."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you better?"</p>

<p>"No, siree! Father would forbid me. Try not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to get him&mdash;just tell Dr. Beach where we're going,
and hang up, and scoot!"</p>

<p>All night they drove; down the Pacific side of
Blewett Pass; down the sweeping spirals to a valley.
Dlorus drowsed in the extra seat. Claire's sleepy
head was fantastically swaying. She was awakened
by an approaching roar and, as though she sat at a
play, she watched a big racing machine coming toward
them, passing them with two wheels in the ditch. She
had only a thunderous glimpse of the stolid driver; a
dark, hooded, romantic figure, like a sailor at the
helm in a storm.</p>

<p>Milt cried, "Golly! May be a transcontinental
racer! Be in New York in five days&mdash;going night
and day&mdash;take mud at fifty an hour&mdash;crack mechanic
right from the factory&mdash;change tires in three minutes&mdash;people
waiting up all night to give him gasoline
and a sandwich! That's my idea of fun!"</p>

<p>Studying Milt's shadowed face, Claire considered,
"He could do it, too. Sitting there at the wheel,
taking danger and good road with the same steadiness.
Oh, he's&mdash;well, anyway, he's a dear boy."</p>

<p>But what she said was:</p>

<p>"Less dramatic things for you, now, Milt. Trigonometry
is going to be your idea of fun; blueprints
and engineering books."</p>

<p>"Yes. I know. I'm going to do it. Do four
years' work in three&mdash;or two. I'll tack pages of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
formulas on the wall, in my bum hallroom, and study
'em while I'm shaving. Oh, I'll be the grind! But
learn to dance the fox-trot, though! If America gets
into the war, I'll get into the engineering corps, and
come back to school afterward."</p>

<p>"Will the finances&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll sell my garage, by mail. Rauskukle will take
it. He won't rob me of more than a thousand dollars
on price&mdash;not much more."</p>

<p>"You're going to love Seattle. And we'll have some
good tramps while I'm there, you and I."</p>

<p>"Honestly? Will you want to?"</p>

<p>"Do you suppose for one second I'd give up my
feeling of free air? If you don't come and get me,
I'll call on you and make you come!"</p>

<p>"Warn you I'll probably be living over some
beanery."</p>

<p>"Probably. With dirty steps leading up to it. I'll
sweep the steps. I'll cook supper for you. I can do
things, can't I! I did manage Dlorus, didn't I!"</p>

<p>He was murmuring, "Claire, dear!" when she
changed her tone to the echo of Brooklyn Heights,
and hurried on, "You do understand, don't you!
We'll be, uh, good friends."</p>

<p>"Yes." He drove with much speed and silence.</p>

<p>Though they were devouring the dark road, though
roadside rocks, caught by the headlights, seemed to
fly up at them, though they went on forever, chased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
by a nightmare, Claire snuggled down in security.
Her head drooped against his shoulder. He put his
arm about her, his hand about her waist. She sleepily
wondered if she ought to let him. She heard herself
muttering, "Sorry I was so rude when you were so
rude," and her chilly cheek discovered that the smooth-worn
shoulder of his old blue coat was warm, and she
wondered some more about the questions of waists
and hands and&mdash;&mdash; She was asleep.</p>

<p>She awoke, bewildered to find that dawn was slipping
into the air. While she had slept Milt had taken
his arm from about her and fished out a lap-robe for
her. Behind them, Dlorus was slumbering, with her
soft mouth wide open. Claire felt the luxury of the
pocket of warmth under the lap-robe; she comfortably
stretched her legs while she pictured Milt driving on
all the night, rigid, tireless, impersonal as the engineer
of a night express.</p>

<p>They came into North Yakima at breakfast time,
and found the house of Mr. Kloh, a neat, bare, drab
frame box, with tight small front and back yards.
Dlorus was awake, and when she wasn't yawning, she
was enjoying being hysterical.</p>

<p>"Miss Boltwood," she whined, "you go in and
jolly him up."</p>

<p>Milt begged, "Better let me do it, Claire."</p>

<p>They looked squarely at each other. "No, I think
I'd better," she decided.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>"Right, Claire, but&mdash;I wish I could do more things
for you."</p>

<p>"I know!"</p>

<p>He lifted her stiff, cold little body from the car.
His hands under her arms, he held her on the running-board
an instant, her eyes level with his. "Little
sister&mdash;plucky little sister!" he sighed. He lowered
her to the ground.</p>

<p>Claire knocked at the back door. To it came a
bald, tired man, in an apron wet at the knees. The
kitchen floor was soaped, and a scrubbing-brush rode
amid the seas. A rather dirty child clung to his
hand. "Trying to clean up, ma'am. Not very good
at it. I hope you ain't the Cruelty to Children lady.
Willy looks mussed, but fact is, I just can't get time
to wash the clothes, but he means a terrible lot to me.
What was it? Will you step in?"</p>

<p>Claire buttoned the child's rompers before she spoke.
Then:</p>

<p>"Mr. Kloh, I want to be perfectly honest with you.
I've had word from your wife. She's unhappy, and
she loves and admires you more than any other man in
the world, and I think she would come back&mdash;misses
the child so."</p>

<p>The man wiped his reddened hands. "I don't
know&mdash;&mdash; I don't wish her no harm. Trouble was,
I'm kind of pokey. I guess I couldn't give her any
good times. I used to try to go to dances with her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
but when I'd worked late, I'd get sleepy and&mdash;&mdash; She's
a beautiful woman, smart 's a whip, and I guess
I was too slow for her. No, she wouldn't never come
back to me."</p>

<p>"She's out in front of the house now&mdash;waiting!"</p>

<p>"Great C&aelig;sar's ghost, and the floor not scrubbed!"
With a squawk of anxiety he leaped on the scrubbing-brush,
and when Milt and Dlorus appeared at the door,
Mr. Kloh and Miss Claire Boltwood were wiping up
the kitchen floor.</p>

<p>Dlorus looked at them, arms akimbo, and sighed,
"Hello, Johnny, my, ain't it nice to be back, oh, you
had the sink painted, oh, forgive me, Johnny, I was
a bad ungrateful woman, I don't care if you don't
never take me to no more dances, hardly any, Willy
come here, dear, oh, he is such a sweet child, my, his
mouth is so dirty, will you forgive me, Johnny, is my
overcoat in the moth-balls?"</p>

<p>When Mr. Kloh had gone off to the mill&mdash;thrice
returning from the gate to kiss Dlorus and to thank
her rescuers&mdash;Claire sat down and yawningly lashed
off every inch of Dlorus's fair white skin:</p>

<p>"You're at it already; taking advantage of that
good man's forgiveness, and getting lofty with him,
and rather admiring yourself as a spectacular sinner.
You are a lazy, ignorant, not very clean woman, and
if you succeed in making Mr. Kloh and Willy happy,
it will be almost too big a job for you. Now if I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
come back from Seattle and find you misbehaving
again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dlorus broke down. "You won't, miss! And I
will raise chickens, like he wanted, honest I will!"</p>

<p>"Then you may let me have a room to take a
nap in, and perhaps Mr. Daggett could sleep in there
on the sofa, and we'll get rested before we start
back."</p>

<p>Both Milt and Dlorus meekly followed the boss.</p>

<p>It was noon before Milt and Claire woke, and discovered
that Dlorus had prepared for them scrambled
eggs and store celery, served on an almost clean table-cloth.
Mr. Kloh came home for lunch, and while
Dlorus sat on his lap in the living-room, and repeated
that she had been a "bad, naughty, 'ittle dirl&mdash;what
did the fellows say at the mill?" Milt and Claire
sat dumpily on the back porch, regarding scenery
which featured of seven tin cans, a broken patent
washing-machine, and a rheumatic pear tree.</p>

<p>"I suppose we ought to start," groaned Claire.</p>

<p>"I have about as much nerve as a rabbit, and as
much punch as a bale of hay," Milt admitted.</p>

<p>"We're like two children that have been playing
too long."</p>

<p>"But don't want to go home!"</p>

<p>"Quite! Though I don't think much of your idea
of a playhouse&mdash;those tin cans. But it's better than
having to be grown-up."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>In the midst of which chatter they realized that Mr.
Henry B. Boltwood and Dr. Hooker Beach had come
round the corner of the house, and were gaping at
them.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
THE GRAEL IN A BACK YARD IN YAKIMA</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"I must</span> say that you two have chosen a fine
pastoral scene!" observed Mr. Boltwood.</p>

<p>"Hhhhhhhhow did you get here?" gasped Claire.</p>

<p>"Auto 'bus over Blewett Pass, train here from
Ellensburg. That woman&mdash;everything all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, everything's fine. We were just starting
back, sir," implored Milt.</p>

<p>"Huh!"</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry, sir, to take Claire on such a
hike&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't blame you particularly. When that young
woman gets an idea into her head, the rest of us are
pawns. Why, even me&mdash;she's dragged me all over the
Rocky Mountains. And I will admit, Claire, that it's
been good for me. But I begin to feel human again,
and I think it's about time I took charge. We'll catch
the afternoon train for Seattle, Claire. The trip has
been extremely interesting, but I think perhaps we'll
call it enough. Daggett, want to get you to drive the
Gomez on to Seattle. Beach tells me your car is
completely wrecked. Lose any money in it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Had my roll in the bug. I'll have to
go back to it and get some clothes out of it, though."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>"Well, then, will you drive my car in? Charge
me anywhere up to fifty dollars, if you want to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a perfectly honest job&mdash;I'd do it, too quick!
Or if your confounded pride won't let you charge
anything, bring the car on anyway. Come, dolly, I
have a jitney here, please observe my graceful use of
'jitney,' and I have the bags. We'll hustle to the
station now. No! No arguments, chick!"</p>

<p>On the station platform, Claire and Milt were under
the surveillance of Mr. Boltwood, who was extremely
irritable as every two minutes the train was reported
to be two minutes later. They tramped up and down,
speaking in lowered voices, very meek but in their
joint naughtiness very intimate.</p>

<p>"That was a nice place to end a transcontinental
drive&mdash;in the back yard of Mr. Johnny Kloh, with
an unrestricted view of tin cans!" lamented Claire.</p>

<p>"Still, your drive didn't end at Kloh's; it ended
way up in the mountains."</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood bumbled down on them: "Another
minute late! Like to know what the matter is!"</p>

<p>"Yes, father!"</p>

<p>When Mr. Boltwood's impatiently waiting back was
turned, Claire gripped Milt's hand, and whispered to
him, "You see, I'm captured! I thought I was
father's lord and chauffeur, but he sniffs the smoke
of the ticker. In his mind, he's already back in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
office, running things. He'll probably turn me over to
Jeff, for disciplining! You won't let them change me
back into a pink-face, will you? Come to tea, at the
Gilsons', just as soon as you reach Seattle."</p>

<p>"Tea&mdash;&mdash; Now we're so near your Gilsons, I
begin to get scared. Wouldn't know what to do. Gee,
I've heard you have to balance a tea-cup and a sandwich
and a hunk o' cake and a lot of conversation
all at once! I'd spill the tea, and drop crumbs, and
probably have the butler set on me."</p>

<p>"You will not! And if you did&mdash;can't you see?&mdash;it
wouldn't matter! It just wouldn't matter!"</p>

<p>"Honestly? Claire dear, do you know why I came
on this trip? In Schoenstrom, I heard you say you
were going to Seattle. That moment, I decided I
would, too, and get acquainted with you, if murder
would do it. But, oh, I'm clumsy."</p>

<p>"You've seen me clumsy, in driving. You taught
me to get over it. Perhaps I can teach you some
things. And we'll study&mdash;together&mdash;evenings! I'm a
thoroughly ignorant parasite woman. Make me become
real! A real woman!"</p>

<p>"Dear&mdash;dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Boltwood loomed on them. "The train's coming,
at last. We'll have a decent sleep for once, at
the Gilsons'. I've wired them to meet us." He departed.</p>

<p>"Terribly glad your father keeps coming down on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
us, because it scares me so I get desperate," said Milt.
"Golly, I think I can hear the train. I, uh, Claire,
Claire dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Milt, are you proposing to me? Please hurry,
because that is the train. Isn't it absurd&mdash;some day
you'll have to propose all over again formally, for the
benefit of people like father, when you and I already
know we're partners! We've done things together,
not just danced together! When you're an engineer,
you'll call me, and I'll come a-running up to Alaska.
And sometimes you'll come with me to Brooklyn&mdash;we'll
be a couple of bombs&mdash;&mdash; There's the train.
Oh, playmate, hurry with your engineering course!
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Because when it's done,
then&mdash;&mdash; Whither thou goest, there I go also! And
you did bully me, you did, you did, and I like it,
and&mdash;&mdash; Yes, father, the bags are right here. Telephone
me, minute you reach Seattle, dear, and we'll
have a private lesson in balancing tea-cups&mdash;&mdash; Yes,
father, I have the tickets. So glad, dear, the trip
smashed up like this&mdash;shocked me into reality&mdash;made
me realize I've been with you every hour since I dismissed
you, back in Dakota, and you looked at me, big
hurt eyes, like a child, and&mdash;&mdash; Yes, father, Pullman's
at the back. Yes, I'm coming!"</p>

<p>"W-wait! D-did you know I was going to
propose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Ever since the Yellowstone. Been trying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
think of a nice way to refuse you. But there isn't
any. You're like Pinky&mdash;can't get rid of you&mdash;have
t' adopt you. Besides, I've found out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You love me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know! How can I tell? But I do like
to drive with my head on your shoulder and&mdash;&mdash; Yesssss,
father, coming!"</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
HER OWN PEOPLE</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Mr. Henry B. Boltwood</span> was decorously
asleep in a chair in the observation car, and
Claire, on the wide back platform, sat unmoving, apparently
devoted to agriculture and mountain scenery.
But it might have been noted that her hand clenched
one of the wooden supports of her camp-stool, and
that her hunched back did not move.</p>

<p>When she had turned to follow her father into the
train, Milt had caught her shoulders and kissed her.</p>

<p>For half an hour that kiss had remained, a perceptible
warm pressure on her lips. And for half an hour
she had felt the relief of gliding through the mountains
without the strain of piloting, the comfort of
having the unseen, mysterious engineer up ahead
automatically drive for her. She had caroled to her
father about nearing the Pacific. Her nervousness
had expressed itself in jerky gaiety.</p>

<p>But when he had sneaked away for a nap, and
Claire could no longer hide from herself by a veil of
chatter the big decision she had made on the station
platform, then she was lonely and frightened&mdash;and
very anxious to undecide the decision. She could not
think clearly. She could see Milt Daggett only as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
solemn young man in an inferior sweater, standing by
the track in a melancholy autumnal light, waving to
her as the train pulled out, disappearing in a dun
obscurity, less significant than the station, the receding
ties, or the porter who was, in places known only
to his secretive self, concealing her baggage.</p>

<p>She could only mutter in growing panic, "I'm crazy.
In-sane! Pledging myself to this boy before I know
how he will turn out. Will he learn anything besides
engineering? I know it&mdash;I do want to stroke his
cheek and&mdash;his kiss frightened me, but&mdash;&mdash; Will I
hate him when I see him with nice people? Can I
introduce him to the Gilsons? Oh, I was mad; so
wrought up by that idiotic chase with Dlorus, and so
sure I was a romantic heroine and&mdash;&mdash; And I'm
simply an indecisive girl in a realistic muddle!"</p>

<p>Threatened by darkness and the sinister evening
chill of the mountains, with the train no longer cheerfully
climbing the rocky ridge but rumbling and snorting
in the defiles, and startling her with agitating forward
leaps as though the brakes had let go, she could
not endure the bleak platform, and even less could she
endure sitting in the chair car, eyed by the smug
tourists&mdash;people as empty of her romance as they
were incapable of her sharp tragedy. She balanced
forward to the vestibule. She stood in that cold,
swaying, darkling place that was filled with the smell
of rubber and metal and grease and the thunderous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
clash of steel on steel; she tried to look out into the
fleeing darkness; she tried to imagine that the train
was carrying her away from the pursuing enemy&mdash;from
her own weak self.</p>

<p>Her father came puffing and lip-pursing and jolly,
to take her to dinner. Mr. Boltwood had no tearing
meditations; he had a healthy interest in soup. But
he glanced at her, across the bright, sleek dining-table;
he seemed to study her; and suddenly Claire saw that
he was a very wise man. His look hinted, "You're
worried, my dear," but his voice ventured nothing
beyond comfortable drawling stories to which she had
only, from the depth of her gloomy brooding, to nod
mechanically.</p>

<p>She got a great deal of satisfaction and
horror out of watching two traveling-men after
dinner. Milt had praised the race, and one of
the two traveling-men, a slender, clear-faced
youngster, was rather like Milt, despite plastered hair,
a watch-chain slung diagonally across his waistcoat,
maroon silk socks, and shoes of pearl buttons, gray
tops, and patent-leather bottoms. The other man was
a butter-ball. Both of them had harshly pompous
voices&mdash;the proudly unlettered voices of the smoking
compartment. The slender man was roaring:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he's got a great proposition there&mdash;believe
me, he's got a great proposition&mdash;he's got one
great little factory there, take it from me. He can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
turn out toothpicks to compete with Michigan. He's
simply piling up the shekels&mdash;why say, he's got a house
with eighteen rooms&mdash;every room done different."</p>

<p>Claire wondered whether Milt, when the sting and
faith of romance were blunted, would engage in Great
Propositions, and fight for the recognition of his&mdash;toothpicks.
Would his creations be favorites in the
best lunch rooms? Would he pile up shekels?</p>

<p>Then her fretting was lost in the excitement of approaching
Seattle and their host&mdash;Claire's cousin,
Eugene Gilson, an outrageously prosperous owner of
shingle-mills. He came from an old Brooklyn Heights
family. He had married Eva Gontz of Englewood.
He liked music and wrote jokey little letters and
knew the addresses of all the best New York shops.
He was of Her Own People, and she was near now to
the security of his friendship, the long journey done.</p>

<p>Lights thicker and thicker&mdash;a factory illuminated
by arc-lamps,&mdash;the baggage&mdash;the porter&mdash;the eager
trail of people in the aisle&mdash;climbing down to the platform&mdash;red
caps&mdash;passing the puffing engine which had
brought them in&mdash;the procession to the gate&mdash;faces
behind a grill&mdash;Eugene Gilson and Eva waving&mdash;kisses,
cries of "How was the trip?" and "Oh! Had
won-derful drive!"&mdash;the huge station, and curious
waiting passengers, Jap coolies in a gang, lumbermen
in corks&mdash;the Gilsons' quiet car, and baggage stowed
away by the chauffeur instead of by their own tired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
hands&mdash;streets strangely silent after the tumult of the
train&mdash;Seattle and the sunset coast at last attained.</p>

<p>Claire had forgotten how many charming, most
desirable things there were in the world. The Gilsons
drove up Queen Anne Hill to a bay-fronting house
on a breezy knob&mdash;a Georgian house of holly hedge,
French windows, a terrace that suggested tea, and a
great hall of mahogany and white enamel with the hint
of roses somewhere, and a fire kindled in the paneled
drawing-room to be seen beyond the hall. Warmth
and softness and the Gilsons' confident affection
wrapped her around; and in contented weariness she
mounted to a bedroom of Bakst sketches, a four-poster,
and a bedside table with a black and orange
electric lamp and a collection of Arthur Symons' essays.</p>

<p>She sank by the bed, pitifully rubbed her cheek
against the silk comforter that was primly awaiting her
commands at the foot of the bed, and cried, "Oh,
four-posters <i>are</i> necessary! I can't give them up!
I won't! They&mdash;&mdash; No one has a right to ask me."
She mentally stamped her foot. "I simply won't live
in a shack and take in washing. It isn't worth it."</p>

<p>A bath, faintly scented, in a built-in tub in her own
marble bathroom. A preposterously and delightfully
enormous Turkish towel. One of Eva Gilson's foamy
neglig&eacute;es. Slow exquisite dressing&mdash;not the scratchy
hopping over ingrown dirt, among ingrown smells, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
a filthy small-hotel bedroom, but luxurious wandering
over rugs velvety to her bare feet. A languid inspection
of the frivolous colors and curves in the drawings
by Bakst and George Plank and Helen Dryden. A
glance at the richness of the toilet-table, at the velvet
curtains that shut out the common world.</p>

<p>Expanding to the comfort as an orchid to cloying
tropic airs, she drew on her sheerest chemise, her most
frivolous silk stockings. In a dreaming enervated joy
she saw how smooth were her arms and legs; she
sleepily resented the redness of her wrists and the callouses
of the texture of corduroy that scored her palms
from holding the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Yes, she was glad that she had made the experiment&mdash;but
gladder that she was safely in from the
long dust-whitened way, back in her own world of
beauty; and she couldn't imagine ever trying it again.
To think of clumping out into that world of deliberate
and brawling crudeness&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Of one Milt Daggett she didn't think at all.</p>

<p>Gorgeously sleepy&mdash;and gorgeously certain that by
and by she would go, not to a stingy hotel bed, with
hound-dog ribs to cut into her tired back, but to a
feathery softness of slumber&mdash;she wavered down to
the drawing-room, and on the davenport, by the fire,
with Victoria chocolates by her elbow, and pillows
behind her shoulders, she gossiped of her adventure,
and asked for news of friends and kin back East.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>Eugene and Eva Gilson asked with pyrotechnic merriness
about the "funny people she must have met
along the road." With a subdued, hidden unhappiness,
Claire found that she could not mention Milt&mdash;that
she was afraid her father would mention Milt&mdash;to
these people who took it for granted that all persons
who did not live in large houses and play good games
of bridge were either "queer" or "common"; who
believed that their West was desirable in proportion
as it became like the East; and that they, though
Westerners, were as superior to workmen with hard
hands as was Brooklyn Heights itself.</p>

<p>Claire tried to wriggle out from under the thought
of Milt while, with the Gilsons as the perfect audience,
she improvised on the theme of wandering. With
certain unintended exaggerations, and certain not
quite accurate groupings of events, she described the
farmers and cowpunchers, the incredible hotels and
garages. Indeed they had become incredible to her
own self. Obviously this silken girl couldn't possibly
take seriously a Dlorus Kloh&mdash;or a young garage man
who said "ain't."</p>

<p>Eva Gilson had been in Brooklyn within the month,
and in a passion of remembrance of home, Claire cried,
"Oh, do tell me about everybody."</p>

<p>"I had such a good time with Amy Dorrance," said
Mrs. Gilson. "Of course Amy is a little dull, but she's
such an awfully good sort and&mdash;&mdash; We did have the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
jolliest party one afternoon. We went to lunch at
the Ritz, and a matin&eacute;e, and we saw such an interesting
man&mdash;Gene is frightfully jealous when I rave
about him&mdash;I'm sure he was a violinist&mdash;simply an
exquisite thing he was&mdash;I wanted to kiss him. Gene
will now say, 'Why didn't you?'"</p>

<p>And Gene said, "Well, why <i>didn't</i> you?" and
Claire laughed, and her toes felt warm and pink and
good, and she was perfectly happy, and she murmured,
"It would be good to hear a decent violinist again.
Oh! What had George Worlicht been doing, when
you were home?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think Georgie is wonderful?" fluttered
Mrs. Gilson. "He makes me rue my thirty-six
sad years. I think I'll adopt him. You know, he almost
won the tennis cup at Long Branch."</p>

<p>Georgie had a little mustache and an income, just
enough income to support the little mustache, and he
sang inoffensively, and was always winning tennis cups&mdash;almost&mdash;and
he always said, at least once at every
party, "The basis of <i>savoir faire</i> is knowing how to
be rude to the right people." Fire-enamored and gliding
into a perfumed haze of exquisite drowsiness,
Claire saw Georgie as heroic and wise. But the firelight
got into her eyes, and her lids wouldn't stay open,
and in her ears was a soft humming as of a million
bees in a distant meadow golden-spangled&mdash;and Gene
was helping her upstairs; sleepiness submerged her like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
bathing in sweet waters; she fumbled at buttons and
hooks and stays, let things lie where they fell&mdash;and
of all that luxury nothing was more pleasant than the
knowledge that she did not have to take precautions
against the rats, mice, cockroaches, and all their obscene
little brothers which&mdash;on some far-off fantastic
voyaging when she had been young and foolish&mdash;she
seemed to remember having found in her own room.
Then she was sinking into a bed like a tide of rainbow-colored
foam, sinking deep, deep, deep&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And it was morning, and she perceived that the
purpose of morning light was to pick out surfaces of
mahogany and orange velvet and glass, and that only
an idiot would ever leave this place and go about
begging dirty garage men to fill her car with stinking
gasoline and oil.</p>

<p>The children were at breakfast&mdash;children surely not
of the same species as the smeary-cheeked brats she
had seen tumbling by roadsides along the way&mdash;sturdy
Mason, with his cap of curls, and Virginia,
with bobbed ash-blond hair prim about her delicate
face. They curtsied, and in voices that actually had
intonations they besought her, "Oh, Cousin Claire,
would you pleasssssse tell us about drive-to-the-coast?"</p>

<p>After breakfast, she went out on the terrace for the
View.</p>

<p>In Seattle, even millionaires, and the I. W. W., and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
men with red garters on their exposed shirt-sleeves
who want to give you real estate, all talk about the
View. The View is to Seattle what the car-service,
the auditorium, the flivver-factory, or the price of coal
is to other cities. At parties in Seattle, you discuss the
question of whether the View of Lake Union or the
View of the Olympics is the better, and polite office-managers
say to their stenographers as they enter,
"How's your View this morning?" All real-estate
deeds include a patent on the View, and every native
son has it as his soundest belief that no one in Tacoma
gets a View of Mount Rainier.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gilson informed Claire that they had the finest
View in Seattle.</p>

<p>Below Claire was the harbor, with docks thrust far
out into the water, and steamers alive with smoke.
Mrs. Gilson said they were Blue Funnel Liners, loading
for Vladivostok and Japan. The names, just the
names, shot into Claire's heart a wistful unexpressed
desire that was somehow vaguely connected with a
Milt Daggett who, back in the Middlewestern mud and
rain, had longed for purple mountains and cherry blossoms
and the sea. But she cast out the wish, and lifted
her eyes to mountains across the sound&mdash;not purple
mountains, but sheer silver streaked with black, like
frozen surf on a desolate northern shore&mdash;the
Olympics, two-score miles away.</p>

<p>Up there, one could camp, with a boy in a deteriorated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
sweater singing as he watched the coffee&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Hastily she looked to the left, across the city, with
its bright new skyscrapers, its shining cornices and
masses of ranked windows, and the exclamation-point
of the "tallest building outside of New York"&mdash;far
livelier than her own rusty Brooklyn. Beyond the
city was a dun cloud, but as she stared, far up in the
cloud something crept out of the vapor, and hung there
like a dull full moon, aloof, majestic, overwhelming,
and she realized that she was beholding the peak of
Mount Rainier, with the city at its foot like white
quartz pebbles at the base of a tower.</p>

<p>A landing-stage for angels, she reflected.</p>

<p>It did seem larger than dressing-tables and velvet
hangings and scented baths.</p>

<p>But she dragged herself from the enticing path
of that thought, and sighed wretchedly, "Oh, yes, he
would appreciate Rainier, but how&mdash;how would he
manage a grape-fruit? I mustn't be a fool! I
mustn't!" She saw that Mrs. Gilson was peeping at
her, and she made herself say adequate things about
the View before she fled inside&mdash;fled from her sputtering
inquiring self.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they drove to Capitol Hill; they
dropped in at various pretty houses and met the sort
of people Claire knew back home. Between people
they had Views; and the sensible Miss Boltwood,
making a philosophic discovery, announced to herself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
"After all, I've seen just as much from this limousine
as I would from a bone-breaking Teal bug. Silly to
make yourself miserable to see things. Oh yes, I will
go wandering some more, but not like a hobo.
But&mdash;&mdash; What can I say to him? Good heavens,
he may be here any time now, with our car. Oh, why&mdash;why&mdash;why
was I insane on that station platform?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />
THE ABYSSINIAN PRINCE</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Snoqualmie Pass</span> lies among mountains
prickly with rocks and burnt stumps, but the
road is velvet, with broad saucer curves; and to Milt
it was pure beauty, it was release from life, to soar
up coaxing inclines and slip down easy grades in the
powerful car. "No more Teals for me," he cried,
in the ecstasy of handling an engine that slowed to a
demure whisper, then, at a touch of the accelerator,
floated up a rise, effortless, joyous, humming the booming
song of the joy in speed. He suddenly hated the
bucking tediousness of the Teal. The Gomez-Dep
symbolized his own new life.</p>

<p>So he came to Lake Washington, and just across it
was the city of his long dreams, the city of the Pacific&mdash;and
of Claire. There was no ferry in sight, and he
rounded the lake, struck a brick pavement, rolled
through rough woods, suburban villas, and petty
business streets, to a region of factories and mills, with
the funnels of ships beyond.</p>

<p>And every minute he drove more slowly and became
more uneasy.</p>

<p>The pavement&mdash;the miles of it; the ruthless lumbermills,
with their thousands of workmen quite like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
himself; the agitation of realizing that every three
minutes he was passing a settlement larger than
Schoenstrom; the strangeness of ships and all the
cynical ways of the sea&mdash;the whole scene depressed
him as he perceived how little of the world he knew,
and how big and contemptuous of Milt Daggetts that
world must be.</p>

<p>"Huh!" he growled. "Quite some folks living
here. Don't suppose they spend such a whale of a lot
of time thinking about Milt Daggett and Bill McGolwey
and Prof Jones. I guess most of these people
wouldn't think Heinie Rauskukle's store was so gosh-awful
big. I wasn't scared of Minneapolis&mdash;much&mdash;but
there they didn't ring in mountains and an
ocean on you. And I didn't have to go up on the
hill and meet folks like Claire's relations, and figure
out whether you shake hands catch-as-catch-can or
Corinthian. Look at that sawmill chimney&mdash;isn't it
nice of 'em to put the fly-screen over it so the flies
won't get down into the flames. No, they haven't got
much more than a million feet of lumber in that one
pile. And here's a bum little furniture store&mdash;it
wouldn't cost more 'n about ten times all I've got to
buy one of those Morris chairs. Oh Gooooooosh,
won't these houses ever stop? Say, that must be a
jitney. The driver snickered at me. Will the whole
town be onto me? Milt, you're a kind young fellow,
and you know what's the matter with Heinie's differential,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
but they don't need you here. Quite a few
folks to carry on the business. Gosh, look at that
building ahead&mdash;nine stories!"</p>

<p>He had planned to stop at a hotel, to wash up, and
to gallop to Claire. But&mdash;well&mdash;wouldn't it maybe
be better to leave the car at a public garage, so the
Boltwoods could get it when they wanted to? He'd
better "just kind of look around before he tackled the
watch-dog."</p>

<p>It was the public garage which finally crushed him.
It was a garage of enameled brick and colored tiles,
with a plate-glass-enclosed office in which worked
young men clad as the angels. One of them wore a
carnation, Milt noted.</p>

<p>"Huh! I'll write back and tell Ben Sittka that
hereafter he's to wear his best-Sunday-go-to-meeting
clothes and a milkweed blossom when he comes down
to work at the Red Trail Garage!"</p>

<p>Milt drove up the brick incline into a room
thousands of miles long, with millions of new and
recently polished cars standing in lines as straight as a
running-board. He begged of a high-nosed colored
functionary&mdash;not in khaki overalls but in maroon
livery&mdash;"Where'll I put this boat?"</p>

<p>The Abyssinian prince gave him a check, and in a
tone of extreme lack of personal interest snapped,
"Take it down the aisle to the elevator."</p>

<p>Milt had followed the natural lines of traffic into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the city; he had spoken to no one; the prince's snort
was his welcome to Seattle.</p>

<p>Meekly he drove past the cars so ebon and silvery,
so smug and strong, that they would have regarded a
Teal bug as an insult. Another attendant waved him
into the elevator, and Milt tried not to look surprised
when the car started, not forward, but upward, as
though it had turned into an aeroplane.</p>

<p>When these adventures were over, when he had had
a shave and a shine, and washed his hands, and looked
into a department-store window that contained ten
billion yards of silk draped against polished satinwood,
when he had felt unhappy over a movie theater large
enough to contain ten times the population of Schoenstrom,
and been cursed by a policeman for jaywalking,
and had passed a hotel entirely full of diplomats and
marble and caviare&mdash;then he could no longer put off
telephoning to Claire, and humbly, in a booth meant
for an umbrella-stand, he got the Eugene Gilson house,
and to a female who said "Yes?" in a tone which
made it mean "No!" he ventured, "May I speak to
Miss Boltwood?"</p>

<p>Miss Boltwood, it seemed, was out.</p>

<p>He was not sorry. He was relieved. He ducked out
of the telephone-booth with a sensation of escape.</p>

<p>Milt was in love with Claire; she was to him the
purpose of life; he thought of her deeply and tenderly
and longingly. All the way into Seattle he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
brooded about her; remembered her every word and
gesture; recalled the curve of her chin, and the fresh
feeling of her hands. But Claire had suddenly become
too big. In her were all these stores, these office
buildings for clever lawyers and surgeons, these contemptuous
trolley cars, these careless people in beautiful
clothes. They were too much for him. Desperately
he was pushing them back&mdash;back&mdash;fighting
for breath. And she belonged with them.</p>

<p>He mailed the check for the stored car to her,
with a note&mdash;written standing before a hacked wall-desk
in a branch post-office&mdash;which said only, "Here's
check for the boat. Did not know whether you would
have room for it at house. Tried to get you on phone,
phone again just as soon as rent room etc. Hope having
happy time, M.D."</p>

<p>He went out to the university. On the trolley he
relaxed. But he did not exultantly feel that he had
won to the Pacific; he could not regard Seattle now
as a magic city, the Bagdad of modern caravans, with
Alaska and the Orient on one hand, the forests to the
north, and eastward the spacious Inland Empire of
the wheat. He saw it as a place where you had to
work hard just to live; where busy policemen despised
you because you didn't know which trolley to take;
where it was incredibly hard to remember even the
names of the unceasing streets; where the conductors
said "Step lively!" and there was no room to whistle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
no time to swap stories with a Bill McGolwey at an
Old Home lunch-counter.</p>

<p>He found the university; he talked with the authorities
about entering the engineering school; the Y. M.
C. A. gave him a list of rooms; and, because it was
cheap, he chose a cubbyhole in a flat over a candy
store&mdash;a low room, which would probably keep out
the rain, but had no other virtues. It had one bed, one
table, one dissipated bureau, two straight bare chairs,
and one venerable lithograph depicting a girl with
ringlets shaking her irritating forefinger at a high-church
kitten.</p>

<p>The landlady consented to his importing an oil-stove
for cooking his meals. He bought the stove, with a
box of oatmeal, a jar of bacon, and half a dozen eggs.
He bought a plane and solid geometry, and an algebra.
At dinner time he laid the algebra beside his plate
of anemic bacon and leaking eggs. The eggs grew
cold. He did not stir. He was reviewing his high-school
algebra. He went down the pages, word by
word, steadily, quickly, absolutely concentrated&mdash;as
concentrated as he would recently have been in a new
problem of disordered transmission. Not once did
he stop to consider how glorious it would be to marry
Claire&mdash;or how terrifying it would be to marry Miss
Boltwood.</p>

<p>Three hours went by before he started up, bewildered,
rubbed his eyes, picked at the chill bacon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and altogether disgusting eggs, and rambled out into
the street.</p>

<p>Again he risked the scorn of conductors and jitney
drivers. He found Queen Anne Hill, found the residence
of Mr. Eugene Gilson. He sneaked about it,
slipped into the gate, prowled toward the house.
Flabby from the intensity of study, he longed for the
stimulus of Claire's smile. But as he stared up at the
great squares of the clear windows, at the flare of
white columns in the porch-lights, that smile seemed
unreachable. He felt like a rustic at court. From the
shelter of the prickly holly hedge he watched the
house. It was "some kind of a party?&mdash;or what
would folks like these call a party?" Limousines
were arriving; he had a glimpse of silken ankles,
frothy underskirts; heard easy laughter; saw people
moving through a big blue and silver room; caught
a drifting tremor of music.</p>

<p>At last he saw Claire. She was dancing with a
young man as decorative as "that confounded Saxton
fellow" he had met at Flathead Lake, but younger
than Saxton, a laughing young man, with curly black
hair. For the first time in his life Milt wanted to kill.
He muttered, "Damn&mdash;damn&mdash;DAMN!" as he saw
the young man carelessly embracing Claire.</p>

<p>His fingers tingling, his whole body yearning till
every cell seemed a beating hammer, Milt longed just
once to slip his hand about Claire's waist like that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
He could feel the satin of her bodice and its warmth.</p>

<p>Then it seemed to him, as Claire again passed the
window, that he did not know her at all. He had
once talked to a girl who resembled her, but that was
long ago. He could understand a Gomez-Dep and
appreciate a brisk sports-suit, but this girl was of a
world unintelligible to him. Her hair, in its dips and
convolutions, was altogether a puzzle. "How did
she ever fix it like that?" Her low evening dress&mdash;"what
was it made of&mdash;some white stuff, but was it
silk or muslin or what?" Her shoulders were startling
in their bare powdery smoothness&mdash;"how dare that
young pup dance with her?" And her face, that had
seemed so jolly and friendly, floated past the window
as pale and illusive as a wisp of fog. His longing for
her passed into clumsy awe. He remembered, without
resentment, that once on a hilltop in Dakota she had
coldly forbidden him to follow her.</p>

<p>With all the pleasure of martyrdom&mdash;to make quite
sure that he should realize how complete a fool he had
been to intrude on Miss Boltwood&mdash;he studied the
other guests. He gave them, perhaps, a glory they did
not have. There were girls sleek as ivory. There
was a lean stooped man, very distinguished. There
was a bulky man in a dinner coat, with a semi-circle
of mustache, and eyes that even at a distance seemed
to give impatient orders. He would be a big banker,
or a lumberman.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>It was the easy friendliness of all of them that most
made Milt feel like an outsider. If a servant had
come out and ordered him away, he would have gone
meekly ... he fancied.</p>

<p>He straggled off, too solidly unhappy to think how
unhappy he was. In his clammy room he picked up
the algebra. For a quarter-hour he could not gather
enough vigor to open it. In his lassitude, his elbows
felt feeble, his fingers were ready to drop off. He
slowly scratched the book open&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>At one o'clock he was reading algebra, his face
still and grim. But already it seemed less heartily
brick-red.</p>

<p>He listlessly telephoned to Claire, in the morning.</p>

<p>"Hello? Oh! Miss Boltwood? This is Milt Daggett."</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh, how are you?"</p>

<p>"Why, why I'm&mdash;I've got settled. I can get into
the engineering school all right."</p>

<p>"I'm glad."</p>

<p>"Uh, enjoying Seattle?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh yes. The mountains&mdash;&mdash; Do you like
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh yes. Sea and all&mdash;&mdash; Great town."</p>

<p>"Uh, w-when are we going to see you? Daddy
had to go East, left you his regards. W-when&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why I suppose you're awful&mdash;awfully busy,
meeting people and all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>"Yes, I am, rather, but&mdash;&mdash;" Her hedging uncomfortable
tone changed to a cry of distress.
"Milt! I must see you. Come up at four this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>He rushed to a small, hot tailor-shop. He panted
"Press m' suit while I wait?" They gave him a
pair of temporary trousers, an undesirable pair of
trousers belonging to a short fat man with no taste
in fabrics, and with these flapping about his lean legs,
he sat behind a calico curtain, reading <i>The War Cry</i>
and looking at a "fashion-plate" depicting nine gentlemen
yachtsmen each nine feet tall, while the Jugoslav
in charge unfeelingly sprinkled and ironed and patted
his suit.</p>

<p>He spent ten minutes in blacking his shoes, in his
room&mdash;and twenty minutes in getting the blacking off
his fingers.</p>

<p>He was walking through the gate in the Gilson hedge
at one minute to four.</p>

<p>But he had reached Queen Anne Hill at three. For
an hour he had walked the crest road, staring at the
steamers below, alternately gripping his hands with
desire of Claire, and timorously finally deciding that
he wouldn't go to her house&mdash;wouldn't ever see her
again.</p>

<p>He came into the hall tremblingly expecting some
great thing, some rending scene, and she met him with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
a cool, "Oh, this is nice. Eva had some little white
cakes made for us." He felt like a man who has asked
for a drink of cold charged water and found it warm
and flat.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;&mdash; Dandy house," he muttered, limply
shaking her limp hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it a darling. They do themselves awfully
well here. I'm afraid your bluff, plain, democratic
Westerners are a fraud. I hear a lot more about
'society' here than I ever did in the East. The
sets seem frightfully complicated." She was drifting
into the drawing-room, to a tapestry stool, and Milt
was awkwardly stalking a large wing chair, while she
fidgeted:</p>

<p>"Everybody tells me about how one poor dear
soul, a charming lady who used to take in washing
or salt gold-mines or something, and she came here
a little while ago with billions and billions of
dollars, and tried to buy her way in by shopping
for all the charities in town, and apparently she's
just as out of it here as she would be in London.
You and I aren't exclusive like that, are
we!"</p>

<p>Somehow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Her "you and I" was too kindly, as though she was
trying to put him at ease, as though she knew he
couldn't possibly be at ease. With a horribly elaborate
politeness, with a smile that felt hot on his twitching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
cheeks, he murmured, "Oh no. No, we&mdash;&mdash; No, I
guess&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>If he knew what it was he guessed, he couldn't get
it out. While he was trying to find out what had become
of all the things there were to say in the world,
a maid came in with an astonishing object&mdash;a small,
red, shelved table on wheels, laden with silver vessels,
and cake, and sandwiches that were amazingly small
and thin.</p>

<p>The maid was so starched that she creaked. She
glanced at Milt&mdash;&mdash; Claire didn't make him so
nervous that he thought of his clothes, but the maid
did. He was certain that she knew that he had blacked
his own shoes, knew how old were his clothes. He
was urging himself, "Must get new suit tomorrow&mdash;ready-made&mdash;mustn't
forget, now&mdash;be sure&mdash;get suit
tomorrow." He wanted to apologize to the maid for
existing.... He wouldn't dare to fall in love with
the maid.... And he'd kill the man who said he
could be fool enough to fall in love with Miss Boltwood.</p>

<p>He sipped his tea, and dropped sandwich crumbs,
and ached, and panted, and peeped at the crushing
quantities of pictures and sconces and tables and
chairs in the room, and wondered what they did with
all of them, while Claire chattered:</p>

<p>"Yes, we weren't exclusive out on the road. Didn't
we meet funny people though! Oh, somehow that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
'funny people' sounds familiar. But&mdash;&mdash; What fun
that morning was at&mdash;Pellago, was it? Heavens, I'm
forgetting those beastly little towns already&mdash;that
place where we hazed the poor landlady who overcharged
me."</p>

<p>"Yes." He was thinking of how much Claire
would forget, now. "Yes. We certainly fixed her,
all right. Uh&mdash;did you get the storage check for your
car?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, thank you. So nice of you to bother
with it."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing at all, nothing&mdash;&mdash; Nothing at all.
Uh&mdash;&mdash; Do you like Seattle?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Such views&mdash;the mountains&mdash;&mdash; Do you
like it?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Always wanted to see the sea."</p>

<p>"Yes, and&mdash;&mdash; Such a well-built town."</p>

<p>"Yes, and&mdash;&mdash; They must do a lot of business
here."</p>

<p>"Yes, they&mdash;&mdash; Oh yes, I do like Seat&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had darted from his chair, brushed by the tea-wagon,
ignoring its rattle and the perilous tipping of
cups. He put his hand on her shoulder, snorted,
"Look here. We're both sparring for time. Stop
it. It's&mdash;it's all right, Claire. I want you to like
me, but I'm not&mdash;I'm not like that woman you were
telling about that's trying to butt in. I know, Lord I
know so well what you're thinking! You're thinking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
I'm not up to the people you've been seeing last couple
of days&mdash;not up to 'em yet, anyway. Well&mdash;&mdash; We'll
be good friends."</p>

<p>Fearless, now, his awe gone in tenderness, he lifted
her chin, looked straight into her eyes, smiled. But
his courage was slipping. He wanted to run and
hide.</p>

<p>He turned abruptly, grumbling, "Well, better get
back to work now, I guess."</p>

<p>Her cry was hungry: "Oh, please don't go." She
was beside him, shyly picking at his sleeve. "I know
what you mean. I like you for being so understanding.
But&mdash;&mdash; I do like you. You were the perfect
companion. Let's&mdash;&mdash; Oh, let's have a walk&mdash;and
try to laugh again."</p>

<p>He definitely did not want to stay. At this moment
he did not love her. He regarded her as an estimable
young woman who, for a person so idiotically reared,
had really shown a good deal of pluck out on the road&mdash;where
he wanted to be. He stood in the hall disliking
his old cap while she ran up to put on a top
coat.</p>

<p>Mute, casual, they tramped out of the house together,
and down the hill to a region of shabby old
brown houses like blisters on the hillside. They had
little to say, and that little was a polite reminiscence
of incidents in which neither was interested.</p>

<p>When they came back to the Gilson hedge, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
stopped at the gate, with terrific respectableness removed
his cap.</p>

<p>"Good night," she said cheerily. "Call me up soon
again."</p>

<p>He did not answer "Good night." He said "Good-by";
and he meant it to be his last farewell. He
caught her hand, hastily dropped it, fled down the hill.</p>

<p>He was, he told himself, going to leave Seattle that
evening.</p>

<p>That, doubtless, is the reason why he ran to a
trolley, to get to a department-store before it closed;
and why, precipitating himself upon a startled clerk,
he purchased a new suit of chaste blue serge, a new
pair of tan boots (curiously like some he had seen on
the university campus that morning) and a new hat
so gray and conservative and felty that it might have
been worn by Woodrow Wilson.</p>

<p>He spent the evening in reading algebra and geometry,
and in telling himself that he was beautifully not
thinking about Claire.</p>

<p>In the midst of it, he caught himself at it, and
laughed.</p>

<p>"What you're doing, my friend, is pretending you
don't like Claire, so that you can hide from your fool
self the fact that you're going to sneak back to see
her the first chance you get&mdash;first time the watch-dog
is out. Seriously now, son, Claire is impossible for
you. No can do. Now that you've been chump<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
enough to leave home&mdash;&mdash; Oh Lord, I wish I hadn't
promised to take this room for all winter. Wish I
hadn't matriculated at the U. But I'm here now, and
I'll stick it out. I'll stay here one year anyway, and
go back home. Oh! And to&mdash;&mdash; By Golly! She
liked me!"</p>

<p>He was thinking of the wild-rose teacher to whom
he had given a lift back in Dakota. He was remembering
her daintiness, her admiration.</p>

<p>"Now there's somebody who'd make me keep climbing,
but wouldn't think I was a poor hick. If I were
to drive back next spring, I could find her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
A CLASS IN ENGINEERING AND OMELETS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> one thing of which Milt Daggett was certain
was that now he had managed to crawl into the
engineering school, he must get his degree in mechanical
engineering. He was older than most of his classmates.
He must hurry. He must do four years'
work in two.</p>

<p>There has never been a Freshman, not the most goggle-eyed
and earnest of them, who has seen less of
classmates, thought less about "outside activities,"
more grimly centered the universe about his work.</p>

<p>Milt had sold his garage, by mail, to Ben Sittka
and Heinie Rauskukle. He had enough money to get
through two years, with economy. His life was as
simple and dull as it had been in Schoenstrom. He
studied while he cooked his scrappy meals; he pinned
mathematical formul&aelig; and mechanical diagrams on
the wall, and pored over them while he was dressing&mdash;or
while he was trying to break in the new shoes,
which were beautiful, squeaky, and confoundedly
tight.</p>

<p>He was taking French and English and "composition-writing"
in addition to engineering, and he made
out a schedule of life as humorlessly as a girl grind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
who intends to be a Latin teacher. When he was
not at work, or furiously running and yanking chest-weights
in the gymnasium, he was attending concerts,
lectures.</p>

<p>Studying the life about him, he had discovered that
the best way to save time was to avoid the lazy friendships
of college; the pipe-smoking, yawning, comfortable,
rather heavy, altogether pleasant wondering
about "what'll we do next?" which occupies at least
four hours a day for the average man in college. He
would have liked it, as he had liked long talks about
nothing with Bill McGolwey at the Old Home Lunch.
But he couldn't afford it. He had to be ready to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>That was the point at which his reflections always
came up with a jolt. He was quite clear about the
method of getting ready, but he hadn't the slightest
idea of what he was getting ready for. The moment
he had redecided to marry Claire, he saw that his only
possible future would be celibate machinery-installing
in Alaska; and the moment he was content with the
prospect of an engineer's camp in Alaskan wilds, his
thoughts went crazily fluttering after Claire.</p>

<p>Despite his aloofness, Milt was not unpopular in
his class. The engineers had few of them the interest
in dances, athletics, college journalism, which distinguished
the men in the academic course. They
were older, and more conscious of a living to earn.
And Milt's cheerful, "How's the boy?" his manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
of waving his hand&mdash;as though to a good customer
leaving the Red Trail Garage with the generator at
last tamed&mdash;indicated that he was a "good fellow."</p>

<p>One group of collegians Milt did seek. It is true
that he had been genuine in scorning social climbers.
But it is also true that the men whom he sought to
know were the university smart set. Their satisfaction
in his allegiance would have been lessened, however,
had they known how little he cared for what
they thought of him, and with what cruel directness
he was using them as models for the one purpose of
pleasing Miss Claire Boltwood.</p>

<p>The American state universities admit, in a pleased
way, that though Yale and Harvard and Princeton
may be snobbish, the state universities are the refuge
of a myth called "college democracy." But there is no
university near a considerable city into which the inheritors
of the wealth of that city do not carry all
the local social distinctions. Their family rank, their
place in the unwritten peerage, determines to which
fraternity they shall be elected, and the fraternity determines
with whom&mdash;men and girls&mdash;they shall be
intimate. The sons and daughters of Seattle and
Tacoma, the scions of old families running in an
unbroken line clear back to 1880, were amiable to poor
outsiders from the Yakima valley and the new claims
of Idaho, but they did not often invite them to their
homes on the two hills and the Boulevard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>Yet it was these plutocrats whom Milt followed;
they whose boots and table manners, cigarettes and
lack of interest in theology, he studied. He met them
in his English class. He remarked "Hello, Smith,"
and "Mornin', Jones," as though he liked them but
didn't care a hang whether they liked him. And by
and by he drifted into their fraternity dwelling-house,
with a question about the next day's assignment, and
met their friends. He sat pipe-smoking, silent, cheerful,
and they seemed to accept him. Whenever one of
them felt that Milt was intruding, and asked impertinent
questions in the manner of a Pullman porter at a
Darktown ball, Milt had a peculiar level look which
had been known to generate courtesy even in the offspring
of a million dollars. They found that he knew
more about motor-cars than any of them, and as
motor-cars were among their greater gods, they
considered him wise. He was incomparably simple
and unpretentious; they found his presence comfortable.</p>

<p>But there is a question as to what they would have
thought had they known that, lying awake in the
morning, Milt unsmilingly repeated:</p>

<p>"Hair always straight down at the back. Never
rounded. Nix on clippers over the ears.</p>

<p>"Matisse is a popular nut artist. Fashionable for
the swells to laugh at him, and the fellows on the
college papers to rave about him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>"Blinx and Severan the swellest&mdash;the smartest
haberdashery in the city.</p>

<p>"The one way to get in Dutch is to mention labor
leaders.</p>

<p>"Never say 'Pleased to meet you.' Just look about
halfway between bored and tol'able and say, 'How
do you do?'"</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>All these first three weeks of his life in Seattle, he
had seen Claire only on his first call. Twice he had
telephoned to her. On one of these high occasions she
had invited him to accompany the family to the
theater&mdash;which meant to the movies&mdash;and he had
wretchedly refused; the other time she had said that
she might stay in Seattle all winter, and she might go
any day, and they "must be sure to have that good
long walk"; and he had said "oh yes," ten or twelve
unhappy times, and had felt very empty as he hung up
the receiver.</p>

<p>Then she wrote to invite him to late Sunday breakfast
at the Gilsons'&mdash;they made a function of it, and
called it bruncheon. The hour was given as ten-thirty;
most people came at noon; but Milt arrived
at ten-thirty-one, and found only a sleepy butler in
sight.</p>

<p>He waited in the drawing-room for five minutes,
feeling like a bill-collector. Into the room vaulted a
medium-sized, medium-looking, amiable man, Eugene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Gilson, babbling, "Oh, I say, so sorry to keep you
waiting, Mr. Daggett. Rotten shame, do come have
a bun or something, frightfully informal these
bruncheons, play auction?"</p>

<p>"Zallright&mdash;no," said Milt.</p>

<p>The host profusely led him to a dining-room where&mdash;in
English fashion, or something like English
fashion, or anyway a close approximation to the fictional
pictures of English fashion&mdash;kidneys and
sausages and omelets waited in dishes on the side-board.
Mr. Gilson poured coffee, and chanted:</p>

<p>"Do try the kidneys. They're usually very fair.
Miss Boltwood tells me that you were very good to
her on the trip. Must have been jolly trip. You going
to be in town some time, oh yes, Claire said you were
in the university, engineering, wasn't it? have you ever
seen our lumbermills, do drop around some&mdash;&mdash; Try
the omelet before the beastly thing gets cold, do you
mind kicking that button, we'll have some more omelet
in&mdash;any time at the mill and I'll be glad to have
some one show you through, how did you find the
roads along the Red Trail?"</p>

<p>"Why, pretty fair," said Milt.</p>

<p>Into the room precipitated Mrs. Gilson, in a
smile, a super-sweater, and a sports skirt that would
have been soiled by any variety of sport more
violent than pinochle, and she was wailing as she
came:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>"We're disgraced, Gene, is this Mr. Daggett? how
do you do, so good of you to come, do try the kidneys,
they're usually quite decent, are the omelets warm, you
might ring for some more, Gene, for heaven's sake give
me some coffee, Miss Boltwood will be right down,
Mr. Daggett, she told us how fortunate they were that
they met you on the road, did you like the trip, how
were the roads?"</p>

<p>"Why, they were pretty good," said Milt.</p>

<p>Claire arrived, fresh and serene in white taffeta,
and she cried prettily, "I ought to have known that
you'd be prompt even if no one else in the world is,
so glad you came, have you tried the kidneys, and do
have an&mdash;oh, I see you have tried the omelets, how
goes the work at the university?"</p>

<p>"Why, fine," said Milt.</p>

<p>He ate stolidly, and looked pleased, and sneaked in
a glance at his new (and still tight and still squeaky)
tan boots to make sure that they were as well polished
as they had seemed at home.</p>

<p>From nowhere appeared a bustling weighty woman,
purring, "Hello, hello, hello, is it possible that you're
all up&mdash;&mdash; Mr. Daggett. Yes, do lead me to the
kidneys."</p>

<p>And a man with the gray hair of a grandfather
and the giggle of a cash-girl bounced in clamoring,
"Mornin'&mdash;expected to have bruncheon alone&mdash;do
we have some bridge? Oh, good morning, Mr. Daggett,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
how do you like Seattle? Oh, thanks so much,
yes, just two."</p>

<p>Then Milt ceased to keep track of the conversation,
which bubbled over the omelets, and stewed over the
kidneys, and foamed about the coffee, and clashed
above a hastily erected bridge table, and altogether
sounded curiously like four cars with four quite different
things the matter with them all being tried out
at once in a small garage. People flocked in, and
nodded as though they knew one another too well to
worry about it. They bowed to him charmingly, and
instantly forgot him for the kidneys and sausages.
He sat looking respectable and feeling lonely, by a cup
of coffee, till Claire&mdash;dropping the highly unreal smile
with which she had been listening to the elderly beau's
account of a fishing-trip he hadn't quite got around to
taking&mdash;slipped into a chair beside him and begged,
"Are they looking out for you, Milt?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, thank you."</p>

<p>"You haven't been to see me."</p>

<p>"Oh no, but&mdash;&mdash; Working so darn hard."</p>

<p>"What a strikingly original reason! But have you
really?"</p>

<p>"Honest."</p>

<p>Suddenly he wanted&mdash;eternal man, forever playing
confidential small boy to the beloved&mdash;to tell her about
his classes and acquaintances; to get pity for his bare
room and his home-cooking. But round them blared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the brazen interest in kidneys, and as Claire glanced
up with much brightness at another arrival, Milt lost
momentum, and found that there was absolutely
nothing in the world he could say to her.</p>

<p>He made a grateful farewell to the omelets and
kidneys, and escaped.</p>

<p>He walked many miles that day, trying to remember
how Claire looked.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
THE VICIOUSNESS OF NICE THINGS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"What</span> did you think of my nice Daggett
boy?" Claire demanded of Eva Gilson, the
moment bruncheon was over.</p>

<p>"Which one was&mdash;&mdash; Oh, the boy you met on the
road? Why, really, I didn't notice him particularly.
I'd rather fancied from the way you referred to him
that he was awfully jolly and forceful, but rather
crude. But I didn't notice him at all. He seemed
perfectly well-bred, but slightly heavy."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't that&mdash;&mdash; He&mdash;&mdash; Why did you lead
spades?" reflected Claire.</p>

<p>They were in the drawing-room, resting after the
tact and tumult of the bruncheon. Claire had been
here long enough now for the Gilsons to forget her
comfortably, and be affectionate and quarrelsome and
natural, and to admit by their worrying that even in
their exalted social position there were things to fuss
about.</p>

<p>"I do think we ought to have invited Belle Torrens,"
fretted Mrs. Gilson. "We've simply got to
have her here soon."</p>

<p>Mr. Gilson speculated intensely, "But she's the
dullest soul on earth, and her husband spends all his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
spare time in trying to think up ways of doing me dirt
in business. Oh, by the way, did you get the water
tap in the blue room fixed? It's dripping all the
time."</p>

<p>"No, I forgot it."</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>do</i> wish you'd have it attended to. It
simply drips all the time."</p>

<p>"I know. I intended to 'phone the plumber&mdash;&mdash; Can't
you 'phone him tomorrow, from the office?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't time to bother with it. But I do
wish you would. It keeps on dripping&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, it doesn't seem to stop. Well, you remind
me of it in the morning."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'll forget. You better make a note
of it. If it keeps on dripping that way, it's likely to
injure something. And I do wish you'd tell the Jap
not to put so much parsley in the omelet. And I say,
how would an omelet be with a butter sauce over it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I don't think so. An omelet ought to be
nice and dry. Butter makes it so greasy&mdash;besides,
with the price of butter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But there's a richness to butter&mdash;&mdash; You'd better
make a note about the tap dripping in the blue room
right now, before you forget it. Oh! Why in
heaven's name did we have Johnny Martin here? He's
dull as ditchwater&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, but&mdash;&mdash; It is nice to go out to his place
on the Point. Oh, Gene, I do wish you'd try and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
remember not to talk about your business so much.
You and Mr. Martin were talking about the price
of lumber for at least half an hour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind. We scarcely mentioned it.
Oh! What car are you going to use this afternoon?
If we get out to the Barnetts', I thought we might use
the limousine&mdash;&mdash; Or no, you'll probably go out before
I do, I have to read over some specifications, and
I promised to give Will a lift, couldn't you take the
Loco, maybe you might drive yourself, no, I forgot,
the clutch is slipping a little, well, you might drive
out and send the car back for me&mdash;still, there wouldn't
hardly be time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Listening to them as to a play, Claire suddenly desired
to scream, "Oh, for heaven's sake quit fussing!
I'm going up and drown myself in the blue-room tap!
What does it matter! Walk! Take a surface car!
Don't fuss so!"</p>

<p>Her wrath came from her feeling of guilt. Yes,
Milt had been commonplace. Had she done this to
him? Had she turned his cheerful ignorances into a
careful stupor? And she felt stuffy and choking and
overpacked with food. She wanted to be out on the
road, clear-headed, forcing her way through, an independent
human being&mdash;with Milt not too far behind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gilson was droning, "I do think Mattie Vincent
is so nice."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>"Rather dull I'd call her," yawned Mr. Gilson.</p>

<p>Mattie was the seventh of their recent guests whom
he had called dull by now.</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;oh, of course she doesn't dance on
tables and quote Maeterlinck, but she does have an
instinct for the niceties and the proprieties&mdash;her little
house is so sweet&mdash;everything just exactly right&mdash;it
may be only a single rose, but always chosen so carefully
to melt into the background; and such adorable
china&mdash;I simply die of envy every time I see her
Lowestoft plates. And such a quiet way of reproving
any bad taste&mdash;the time that crank university professor
was out there, and spoke of the radical labor movement,
and Mattie just smiled at him and said, 'If you
don't mind, let's not drag filthy lumberjacks into the
drawing-room&mdash;they'd hate it just as much as we
would, don't you think, perhaps?'"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>damn</i> nice china! Oh, let's hang all spinsters
who are brightly reproving," Claire was silently raging.
"And particularly and earnestly confound all
nicety and discretion of living."</p>

<p>She tried to break the spell of the Gilsons' fussing.
She false-heartedly fawned upon Mr. Gilson, and inquired:</p>

<p>"Is there anything very exciting going on at the
mills, Gene?"</p>

<p>"Exciting?" asked Mr. Gilson incredulously.
"Why, how do you mean?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>"Don't you find business exciting? Why do you
do it then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, wellllll&mdash;&mdash; Of course&mdash;&mdash; Oh, yes, exciting
in a way. Well&mdash;&mdash; Well, we've had a jolly interesting
time making staves for candy pails&mdash;promises
to be wonderfully profitable. We have a new way of
cutting them. But you wouldn't be interested in the
machinery."</p>

<p>"Of course not. You don't bore Eva with your
horrid, headachy business-problems, do you?" Claire
cooed, with low cunning.</p>

<p>"Indeed no. Don't think a chap ought to inflict
his business on his wife. The home should be a place
of peace."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Claire.</p>

<p>But she wasn't thinking "Yes." She was thinking,
"Milt, what worries me now isn't how I can risk
letting the 'nice people' meet you. It's how I can ever
waste you on the 'nice people.' Oh, I'm spoiled for
cut-glass-and-velvet afternoons. Eternal spiritual agony
over blue-room taps is too high a price even for
four-poster beds. I want to be driving! hiking! living!"</p>

<p>That afternoon, after having agreed that Mr.
Johnny Martin was a bore, Mr. and Mrs. Gilson decided
to run out to the house of Mr. Johnny Martin.
They bore along the lifeless Claire.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin was an unentertaining bachelor who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
entertained. There were a dozen supercilious young
married people at his bayside cottage when the Gilsons
arrived. Among them were two eyebrow-arching
young matrons whom Claire had not met&mdash;Mrs.
Corey and Mrs. Betz.</p>

<p>"We've all heard of you, Miss Boltwood," said
Mrs. Betz. "You come from the East, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," fluttered Claire, trying to be cordial.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corey and Mrs. Betz looked at each other in a
motionless wink, and Mrs. Corey prodded:</p>

<p>"From New York?"</p>

<p>"No. Brooklyn." Claire tried not to make it too
short.</p>

<p>"Oh." The tacit wink was repeated. Mrs. Corey
said brightly&mdash;much too brightly&mdash;"I was born in
New York. I wonder if you know the Dudenants?"</p>

<p>Now Claire knew the Dudenants. She had danced
with that young ass Don Dudenant a dozen times. But
the devil did enter into her and possess her, and, to
Eva Gilson's horror, Claire said stupidly, "No-o, but
I think I've heard of them."</p>

<p>The condemning wink was repeated.</p>

<p>"I hear you've been doing such interesting things&mdash;motoring
and adventuring&mdash;you must have met some
terrible people along the way," fished Mrs. Betz.</p>

<p>"Yes, everybody does seem to feel that way. But
I'm afraid I found them terribly nice," flared Claire.</p>

<p>"I always say that common people can be most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
agreeable," Mrs. Corey patronized. Before Claire
could kill her&mdash;there wasn't any homicidal weapon
in sight except a silver tea-strainer&mdash;Mrs. Corey had
pirouetted on, "Though I do think that we're much
too kind to workmen and all&mdash;the labor situation is
getting to be abominable here in the West, and upon
my word, to keep a maid nowadays, you have to treat
her as though she were a countess."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't maids be like countesses? They're
much more important," said Claire sweetly.</p>

<p>It cannot be stated that Claire had spent any large
part of her time in reading Karl Marx, leading syndicalist
demonstrations, or hemming red internationalist
flags, but at this instant she was a complete revolutionist.
She could have executed Mrs. Corey and
pretty Mrs. Betz with zeal; she disliked the entire bourgeoisie;
she looked around for a Jap boy to call "comrade"
and she again thought about the possibilities of
the tea-strainer for use in assassination. She stolidly
wore through the combined and exclamatory explanations
of Mrs. Corey, Mrs. Betz, Mrs. Gilson, and Mr.
Johnny Martin about the inherent viciousness of all
maids, and when the storm was over, she said in a
manner of honey and syrup:</p>

<p>"You were speaking of the Dudenants, weren't you,
Mrs. Corey? I do remember them now. Poor Don
Dudenant, isn't it a pity he's such a fool? His father
is really a very decent old bore."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>"I," observed Mrs. Corey, in prim horror, "regard
the Dudenants as extremely delightful people. I fancy
we must be thinking of different families. I mean the
Manhattan Dudenants, not the Brooklyn family."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I meant the Manhattan family, too&mdash;the
one that made its fortune selling shoddy woolens in the
Civil War," caressed Claire.</p>

<p>Right there, her welcome by Mrs. Corey and Mrs.
Betz ceased; and without any of the unhappiness
which the thought would have caused her three months
before, Claire reflected, "How they hate me!"</p>

<p>The Gilsons had a number of thoughts upon the
subject of tact to express to Claire on the way home.
But she, who had always smiled, who had been the
obedient guest, shrugged and snapped, "They're
idiots, those young women. They're impertinent
shopgirls in good frocks. I like your Seattle. It's a
glorious city. And I love so many of the fine, simple,
real people I've met here. I admire your progress. I
do know how miraculously you've changed it from a
mining camp. But for heaven's sake don't forget the
good common hardiness of the miners. Somehow,
London social distinctions seem ludicrous in American
cities that twenty years ago didn't have much but
board sidewalks and saloons. I don't care whether
it's Seattle or Minneapolis or Omaha or Denver, I
refuse to worry about the Duchess of Corey and the
Baroness Betz and all the other wonderful imitations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
of gilt. When a pair of finishing-school flappers like
Betz and Corey try to impress me with their superiority
to workmen, and their extreme aristocracy and
Easternness, they make me tired. I <i>am</i> the East!"</p>

<p>She had made peace with the Gilsons by night; she
had been reasonably repentant about not playing the
game of her hosts; but inside her eager heart she snuggled
a warm thought. She remembered how gaily she
had once promised, out on the road, to come to Milt's
room and cook for him. She thought of it with homesick
desire. His room probably wasn't particularly
decorative, and she doubted his having an electric
range, but it would be fun to fry eggs again, to see
him fumbling with the dish-washing, to chatter and
plan golden futures, and not worry about the opinions
of Mrs. Corey and Mrs. Betz.</p>

<p>The next afternoon the limousine was not busy and
she borrowed it, with the handsome Greek chauffeur.</p>

<p>She gave him an address not far from the university.</p>

<p>He complained, "Pardon me, miss, but I think you
have the wrong number. That block is a low quarter."</p>

<p>"Probably! But that's the right number!"</p>

<p>He raised his Athenian eyebrows, and she realized
what a mistake she had made in not bringing the
lethal tea-strainer along. When they had stopped in
front of a cheap candy-store, he opened the door of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the car with such frigid reserve that she thought seriously
about slapping him.</p>

<p>She climbed the stingy, flapping stairs, and knocked
at the first door in the upper hall. It was opened by a
large apron, to which a sleepy woman was an unimportant
attachment, and out of the mass of apron
and woman came a yawning, "Mr. Daggett's room is
down the hall on the right."</p>

<p>Claire knocked at a door which had at various
epochs been blue, yellow, and pink, and now was all
three. No answer. She tried the knob, went in.</p>

<p>She could not tell whether it was the barrenness
of the room, or Milt's carefulness, that caught her.
The uncarpeted boards of the floor were well swept.
He had only one plate, one spoon, but they were
scoured, and put away on newspaper-covered shelves
in a cupboard made of a soap-box. Behind a calico
curtain was his new suit, dismayingly neat on its
hanger. On the edge of the iron sink primly washed
and spread out to dry, was a tattered old rag. At
the sight of it, at the thought of Milt solemnly washing
dishes, the tears began to creep to her eyes.</p>

<p>There was but one picture in the room&mdash;a half-tone
of a girl, clipped from a magazine devoted to actresses.
The name was cut off. As she wondered at it, Claire
saw that the actress was very much like herself.</p>

<p>The only other ornament was a papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; figure
of a cat, a cat reminiscent of the Lady Vere de Vere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Claire picked it up. On the bottom was the price-mark&mdash;three
cents.</p>

<p>It was the price-mark that pierced her. She flung
across the room, dropped on his creaky cot-bed,
howled, "Oh, I've been a beast&mdash;a beast&mdash;a beast!
All the pretty things&mdash;limousines and marble baths&mdash;thinking
so much of them, and not wanting them for
<i>him</i>! And he with so little, with just nothing&mdash;he
that would appreciate jolly things so much&mdash;here in
this den, and making it as tolerable as he can&mdash;and
me half ashamed of him instead of fighting for
him&mdash;&mdash; I belong with Corey and Betz. Oh, I'm so
ashamed, so bitterly ashamed."</p>

<p>She patted his bed smooth with nervous eager
fingers.</p>

<p>She scraped a pin-point of egg-yolk off a platter.</p>

<p>Before she had been home five minutes she had
written a note asking him to tea for next day.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
THE MORNING COAT OF MR. HUDSON B. RIGGS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Mr. Hudson B. Riggs</span> now enters the tale&mdash;somewhat
tardily, and making a quick exit,
all in a morning coat too tight about the shoulders,
and a smile of festivity too tight about the lips. He
looked as improbable as an undertaker's rubber-plant.
Yet in his brief course he had a mighty effect upon
the progress of civilization as exemplified in the social
career of Mr. Milton Daggett.</p>

<p>Mr. Riggs had arrived at a golden position in
Alaskan mining engineering by way of the farm, the
section gang, the surveyor's chain, and prospecting;
and his thick hands showed his evolution. His purpose
in life was to please Mrs. Riggs, and he wasn't
ever going to achieve his purpose in life. She wore
spangles, and her corsets creaked, and she smiled nervously,
and could tell in a glance quicker than the 1/100
kodak shutter whether or not a new acquaintance was
"worth cultivating." She had made Mr. Riggs thoroughly
safe and thoroughly unhappy in the pursuit of
society. He stood about keeping from doing anything
he might want to, and he was profusely polite to young
cubs whom he longed to have in his office&mdash;so that he
could get even with them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>What Mr. Riggs wanted to do, at the third large
tea given by Mrs. Gilson for Miss Claire Boltwood,
was to sneak out on the sun-porch and play over the
new records on the phonograph; but the things he had
heard from Mrs. Riggs the last time he'd done that
had convinced him that it was not a wise method of
escape. So he stood by the fireplace&mdash;safe on one
side at least&mdash;and ate lettuce sandwiches, which he
privately called "cow feed," and listened to a shining,
largely feminine crowd rapidly uttering unintelligible
epigrams from which he caught only the words, "Ripping
hand&mdash;trained nurse&mdash;whipcord&mdash;really worth
seeing&mdash;lost the ball near the second hole&mdash;most absurd
person&mdash;new maid&mdash;thanks so much." He was hoping
that some one would come around and let him be
agreeable. He knew that he stood the ride home with
Mrs. Riggs much better after he had been agreeable
to people he didn't like.</p>

<p>What Mr. Riggs did not know was that a young
man in uninteresting blue, who looked like a good
tennis-player, was watching him. It wasn't because
he detected a fellow soul in purgatory but because he
always was obsequious outside of his office that Mr.
Riggs bowed so profusely that he almost lost his tea-cup,
when the young man in blue drifted to him and
suggested, "I hear you're in the Alaskan mining-game,
Mr. Riggs."</p>

<p>"Oh yes."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>"Do you get up there much now?"</p>

<p>"No, not much."</p>

<p>"I hope to hit Alaska some day&mdash;I'm taking engineering
at the U."</p>

<p>"Do you? Straight?" Mr. Riggs violently set his
cup down on a table&mdash;Mrs. Riggs would later tell
him that he'd put it down in the wrong place, but
never mind. He leaned over Milt and snarled, "Offer
me a cigarette. I don't know if they smoke here, and
I dassn't be the first to try. Say, boy, Alaska&mdash;&mdash; I
wish I was there now! Say, it beats all hell how good
tea can taste in a tin cup, and how wishy-washy it is
in china. Boy, I don't know anything about you, but
you look all right, and when you get ready to go to
Alaska, you come to me, and I'll see if I can't give
you a chance to go up there. But don't ever come
back!"</p>

<p>When the crowd began bubblingly to move toward
the door, Milt prepared to move&mdash;and bubble&mdash;with
them. Though Claire's note had sounded as though
she was really a little lonely, at the tea she had said
nothing to him except, "So glad you came. Do you
know Dolly Ransome? Dolly, this is my nice Mr.
Daggett. Take him and make him happy."</p>

<p>Dolly hadn't made him in the least happy. She
had talked about tennis; she had with some detail
described her remarkable luck in beating one Sally
Saunders three sets. Now Milt was learning tennis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
He was at the present period giving two hours a week
to tennis, two to dancing, two to bridge. But he preferred
cleaning oil-wells to any of these toilsome accomplishments,
and it must sadly be admitted that all
the while he was making his face bright at Dolly, he
was wondering what would happen if he interrupted
Dolly's gurgling, galloping, giggling multitudinousness
by shouting, "Oh, shut up!"</p>

<p>When it seemed safe to go, and he tried to look as
though he too were oozing out to a Crane-Simplex,
Claire slipped beside him, soft as a shadow, and whispered,
"Please don't go. I want to talk to you.
<i>Please!</i>" There was fluttering wistfulness in her
voice, though instantly it was gone as she hastened
to the door and was to be heard asserting that she did
indeed love Seattle.</p>

<p>Milt looked out into the hall. He studied a console
with a curious black and white vase containing a
single peacock feather, and a gold mirror shimmering
against a gray wall.</p>

<p>"Lovely stuff. I like that mirror. Like a slew in
the evening. But it isn't worth being a slave for.
I'm not going to be a Mr. Riggs. Poor devil, he's
more of a servant than any of these maids. Certainly
am sorry for that poor fish. He'll have a chance to
take his coat off and sit down and smoke&mdash;when he's
dead!"</p>

<p>The guests were gone; the Gilsons upstairs. Claire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
came running, seized Milt's sleeve, coaxed him to the
davenport in the drawing-room&mdash;then sighed, and
rubbed her forehead, and looked so tired that he could
say nothing but, "Hope you haven't been overdoing."</p>

<p>"No, just&mdash;just talking too much."</p>

<p>He got himself to say, "Miss Ransome&mdash;the one
that's nuts about tennis&mdash;she's darn nice."</p>

<p>"Is she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she's&mdash;she's&mdash;&mdash; What do you hear from
your father?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's back at work."</p>

<p>"Trip do him good?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a lot."</p>

<p>"Did he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Milt! Tell me about you. What are you doing?
What are you studying? How do you live? Do you
really cook your own meals? Do you begin to get
your teeth into the engineering? Oh, do tell me
everything. I want to know, so much!"</p>

<p>"There isn't a whole lot to tell. Mostly I'm getting
back into math. Been out of touch with it. I
find that I know more about motors than most of the
fellows. That helps. And about living&mdash;oh, I keep
conservative. Did you know I'd sold my garage?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't, I didn't!"</p>

<p>He wondered why she said it with such stooping
shame, but he went on mildly, "Well, I got a pretty
good price, but of course I don't want to take any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
chances on running short of coin, so I'm not splurging
much. And&mdash;&mdash;" He looked at his nails, and whistled
a bar or two, and turned his head away, and
looked back with a shy, "And I'm learning to play
bridge and tennis and stuff!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" It was a cry of pain. She beat
her hands for a moment before she murmured, "When
are we going to have our lessons in dancing&mdash;and in
making an impression on sun-specks like Dolly Ransome?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he parried. Then, looking at her
honestly, he confessed, "I don't believe we're ever
going to. Claire, I can't do it. I'm no good for this
tea game. You know how clumsy I was. I spilled
some tea, and I darn near tripped over some woman's
dress and&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I'm not afraid of them. Now that
I get a good close look at this bunch, they seem pretty
much like other folks, except maybe that one old
dame says 'cawn't.' But I can't do the manners stunt.
I can't get myself to give enough thought to how you
ought to hold a tea-cup."</p>

<p>"Oh, those things don't matter&mdash;they don't <i>matter</i>!
Besides, everybody likes you&mdash;only you're so terribly
cautious that you never let them see the force and
courage and all that wonderful sweet dear goodness
that's in you. And as for your manners&mdash;heaven
knows I'm no P. G. Wodehouse valet. But I'll teach
you all I know."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>"Claire, I appreciate it a lot but&mdash;&mdash; I'm not so
darn sure I want to learn. I'm getting scared. I
watched that bird named Riggs here today. He's a
regular fellow, or he was, but now he's simply lost in
the shuffle. I don't want to be one of the million
ghosts in a city. Seattle is bad enough&mdash;it's so big
that I feel like a no-see-um in a Norway pine reserve.
But New York would be a lot worse. I don't want to
be a Mr. Riggs."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;I'm not a Mrs. Riggs!"</p>

<p>"What do you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish asking her what she meant. She
was in his arms; she was whispering, "My heart is so
lonely;" and the room was still. The low sun flooded
the windows, swam in the mirror in the hall, but they
did not heed, did not see its gliding glory.</p>

<p>Not till there was a sound of footsteps did she burst
from his arms, spring to her reflection in the glass of a
picture, and shamefacedly murmur to him over her
shoulder, "My hair&mdash;it's a terrible giveaway!"</p>

<p>He had followed her; he stood with his arm circling
her shoulder.</p>

<p>She begged, "No. Please no. I'm frightened.
Let's&mdash;oh, let's have a walk or something before you
scamper home."</p>

<p>"Look! My dear! Let's run away, and explore
the town, and not come back till late evening."</p>

<p>"Yes. Let's."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>They walked from Queen Anne Hill through the
city to the docks. There was nothing in their excited,
childish, "Oh, see that!" and "There's a dandy car!"
and "Ohhhhh, that's a Minnesota license&mdash;wonder
who it is?" to confess that they had been so closely,
so hungrily together.</p>

<p>They swung along a high walk overlooking the
city wharf. They saw a steamer loading rails and
food for the government railroad in Alaska. They
exclaimed over a nest of little, tarry fishing-boats.
They watched men working late to unload Alaska
salmon.</p>

<p>They crossed the city to Jap Town and its writhing
streets, its dark alleys and stairways lost up the hillsides.
They smiled at black-eyed children, and found
a Japanese restaurant, and tried to dine on raw fish
and huge shrimps and roots soaked in a very fair
grade of light-medium motor oil.</p>

<p>With Milt for guide, Claire discovered a Christianity
that was not of candles and shifting lights and insinuating
music, nor of carpets and large pews and
sound oratory, but of hoboes blinking in rows, and
girls in gospel bonnets, and little silver and crimson
placards of Bible texts. They stopped on a corner to
listen to a Pentecostal brother, to an I. W. W. speaker,
to a magnificent negro who boomed in an operatic
baritone that the Day of Judgment was coming on
April 11, 1923, at three in the morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>In the streets of Jap Town, in cheap motion-picture
theaters, in hotels for transient workmen, she found
life, running swift and eager and many-colored; and
it seemed to her that back in the house of four-posters
and walls of subdued gray, life was smothered in the
very best pink cotton-batting. Milt's delight in every
picturesque dark corner, and the colloquial eloquence
of the street-orators, stirred her. And when she saw
a shopgirl caress the hand of a slouching beau in
threadbare brown, her own hand slipped into Milt's
and clung there.</p>

<p>But they came shyly up to the Gilson hedge, and
when Milt chuckled, "Bully walk; let's do it again,"
she said only, "Oh, yes, I did like it. Very much."</p>

<p>He had abruptly dropped his beautiful new felt hat.
He was clutching her arms, demanding, "Can you
like me? Oh my God, Claire, I can't play at love.
I'm mad&mdash;I just live in you. You're my blood and
soul. Can I become&mdash;the kind of man you like?"</p>

<p>"My dear!" She was fiercely addressing not him
alone but the Betzes and Coreys and Gilsons and Jeff
Saxtons, "don't you forget for one moment that all
these people&mdash;here or Brooklyn either&mdash;that seem so
aloof and amused, are secretly just plain people with
enamel on, and you're to have the very best enamel,
if it's worth while. I'm not sure that it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're going to kiss me!"</p>

<p>"No! Please no! I don't&mdash;I don't understand us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
even now. Can't we be just playmates a while yet?
But&mdash;I do like you!"</p>

<p>She fled. When she reached the hall she found her
eyelids wet.</p>

<p>It was the next afternoon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Claire was curled on the embroidered linen counterpane
of her bed, thinking about chocolates and Brooklyn
and driving through Yellowstone Park and corn
fritters and satin petticoats versus <i>cr&ecirc;pe de chine</i> and
Mount Rainier and Milt and spiritualism and manicuring,
when Mrs. Gilson prowled into her room and demanded
"Busy?" so casually that Claire was suspicious.</p>

<p>"No. Not very. Something up?"</p>

<p>"A nice party. Come down and meet an amusing
man from Alaska."</p>

<p>Claire took her time powdering her nose, and ambled
downstairs and into the drawing-room, to
find&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Jeff Saxton, Mr. Geoffrey Saxton, who is the height
of Brooklyn Heights, standing by the fireplace, smiling
at her.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />
THE ENEMY LOVE</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">But</span> at second glance&mdash;was it Jeff? This man
was tanned to a thick even brown in which his
eyes were startlingly white. His hands were burned
red; there was a scar across one of them; and he was
standing with them cockily at his hips, all unlike the
sleekly, noisily quiet Jeff of Brooklyn. He was in
corduroy trousers and belted corduroy jacket, with a
khaki-colored flannel shirt.</p>

<p>But his tranquilly commanding smile was Jeff's,
and his lean grace; and Jeff's familiar amused voice
greeted her paralyzed amazement with:</p>

<p>"Hello, pard! Ain't I met you some place in Montana?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;where&mdash;in&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just landed from Alaska. Had to run up there
from California. How are you, little princess?"</p>

<p>His hand was out to her, then both hands, beseechingly,
but she did not run to him, as she had at Flathead
Lake. She stalked him cautiously, and shook
hands&mdash;much too heartily. She sought cover in the
wing-chair and&mdash;much too cordially&mdash;she invited:</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>He was watching her. Already his old pursuing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
determination, his steady dignity, were beginning to
frighten her. But he calmly dropped into a straight
chair, and obliged:</p>

<p>"It's really been quite a lively journey. Didn't
know I could like roughing-it so well. And it was real
roughing-it, pretty much. Oh, not dangerous at all,
but rather vigorous. I had to canoe up three hundred
miles of a shallow river, with one Indian guide, making
a portage every ten miles or so, and we got tipped
over in the rapids now and then&mdash;the Big Chief almost
got drowned once&mdash;and we camped at night in the
original place where they invented mosquitoes&mdash;and
one morning I shot a black bear just in time to keep
him from eating my boots."</p>

<p>"Oh!" she sighed in admiration, and "Oh!" again,
uneasily.</p>

<p>Nothing had been said about it; Jeff was the last
person in the world to spoil his triumph by commenting
on it; but both of them knew that they had violently
changed places; that now it was she who was
the limp indoor-dweller, and he who was the ruddy
ranger; that as he had admired her at Flathead Lake,
so now it was hers to admire, and his to be serenely
heroic.</p>

<p>She was not far from the worshiping sub-deb in
her sighing, "How <i>did</i> you get the scar?"</p>

<p>"That? Oh, nothing."</p>

<p>"Please tell me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>"Really and truly. Nothing at all. Just a drunken
fellow with a knife, playing the fool. I didn't have
to touch him&mdash;quite sure he could have given me a
frightful beating and all that sort of thing. It was the
Big Chief who got rid of him."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;cut you? With a kniiiiiife? Ohhhhhhh!"</p>

<p>She ran to him, pityingly stroked the scar, looked
down at him with filmy eyes. Then she tried to retreat,
but he retained her hand, glanced up at her as
though he knew her every thought. She felt weak.
How could she escape him? "Please!" she begged
flutteringly.</p>

<p>If he held her hand another moment, she trembled,
she'd be on his lap, in his arms&mdash;lost. And he was
holding it. He was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Oh, he was too old for her. Yes, and too paternal.
But still&mdash;&mdash; Life with Jeff would be protected,
kindly, honorable.</p>

<p>Yet all the time she wanted, and stormily knew she
wanted, to be fleeing to the boy Milt, her mate; to run
away with him, hand in hand, discovering all the colored
world, laughing at life, not afraid of losing dignity.
In fear of Jeff's very kindliness and honor, she
jerked her hand free. Then she tried to smile like
a clever fencer.</p>

<p>As she retreated to her chair she stammered, "Did
you&mdash;&mdash; Was Alaska interesting?"</p>

<p>He did not let her go, this time. Easy, cat-like for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
all his dry gravity, he sauntered after her, and with
a fine high seriousness pleaded his case:</p>

<p>"Claire dear, those few weeks of fighting nature
were a revelation to me. I'm going to have lots more
of it. As it happens, they need me there. There's
plenty of copper, but there's big transportation and
employment problems that I seem better able to solve
than the other chaps&mdash;though of course I'm an absolute
muff when it comes to engineering problems. But
I've had certain training and&mdash;I'm going to arrange
things so that I get up there at least once a year. Next
summer I'll make a much longer trip&mdash;see the mountains&mdash;oh,
glorious mountains&mdash;and funny half-Russian
towns, and have some fishing&mdash;&mdash; Wandering.
The really big thing. Even finer than your superb
plucky trip through&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wasn't plucky! I'm a cry baby," she said, like
a bad, contradictory little girl.</p>

<p>He didn't argue it. He smiled and said "Tut!"
and placidly catalogued her with, "You're the pluckiest
girl I've ever seen, and it's all the more amazing
because you're not a motion-picture Tomboy, but essentially
exquisite&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm a grub."</p>

<p>"Very well, then. You're a grub. So am I. And
I like it. And when I make the big Alaskan trip
next year I want you to go along! Claire! Haven't
you any idea how terribly close to me the thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
you has been these weeks? You've guided me
through the wilderness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;&mdash; I'm glad." She sprang up, beseeching,
"Jeff dear, you're going to stay for tea? I must run
up and powder my nose."</p>

<p>"Not until you say you're glad to see me. Child
dear, we've been ambling along and&mdash;&mdash; No. You
aren't a child any more. You're a woman. And if
I've never been quite a man, but just a dusty office-machine,
that's gone now. I've got the wind of the
wilderness in my lungs. Man and woman! My
woman! That's all I'm going to say now, but&mdash;&mdash; Oh
my God, Claire, I do need you so!"</p>

<p>He drew her head to his shoulder, and for an
instant she rested there. But as she looked up, she
saw coming age in the granulated skin of his throat.</p>

<p>"He needs me&mdash;but he'd boss me. I'd be the cunning
child-wife, even at fifty," she worried, and
"Hang him, it's like his superiority to beat poor Milt
even at adventuring&mdash;and to be such a confounded
Modest Christian Gentleman about it!"</p>

<p>"You'd&mdash;you're so dreadfully managing," she
sighed aloud.</p>

<p>For the first time in all their acquaintanceship, Jeff's
pride broke, and he held her away from him, while
his lips were pathetic, and he mourned, "Why do you
always try to hurt me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, I don't."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>"Is it because you resent the decent things I have
managed to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"If I have an idea for a party, you think I'm
'managing.' If I think things out deeply, you say
I'm dull."</p>

<p>"Oh, you aren't. I didn't mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are you? A real woman, or one of these
flirts, that love to tease a man because he's foolish
enough to be honestly in love?"</p>

<p>"I'm not&mdash;hon-estly I'm not, Jeff. It's&mdash;&mdash; You
don't quite make me&mdash;&mdash; It's just that I'm not in love
with you. I like you, and respect you terribly,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to make you love me." His clutching
fingers hurt her arm, and somehow she was not angry,
but stirred. "But I'm not going to try now. Forget
the Alaskan caveman. Remember, I haven't even used
the word 'love.' I've just chatted about fjords, or
whatever they are, but one of these days&mdash;&mdash; No.
I won't do it. I want to stay here in Seattle a few
days, and take you on jolly picnics, but&mdash;&mdash; Would
you rather I didn't even do that? I'm&mdash;&mdash;" He
dropped her arm, kneaded his forehead with the heel
of his palm. "I can't stand being regarded as a
bothersome puppy. I can't stand it! I can't!"</p>

<p>"Please stay, Jeff! We'll have some darling drives
and things. We'll go up Rainier as far as we can."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>He stayed. He was anecdotal and amusing at tea,
that afternoon. Claire saw how the Gilsons, and two
girls who dropped in, admired him. That made her
uneasy. And when Mrs. Gilson begged him to leave
his hotel and stay with them, he refused with a quick
look at Claire that hurt her.</p>

<p>"He wants me to be free. He's really so much
more considerate than Milt. And I hurt him. Even
his pride broke down. And I've spoiled Milt's life by
meddling. And I've hurt the Gilsons' feelings. And
I'm not much of a comfort to father. Oh, I'm absolutely
no good," she agonized.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />
THE VIRTUOUS PLOTTERS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Mr. Geoffrey Saxton</span>, in Alaskan tan
and New York evening clothes and Piccadilly
poise, was talking to the Eugene Gilsons while Claire
finished dressing for the theater.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gilson observed, "She's the dearest thing.
We've become awfully fond of her. But I don't
think she knows what she wants to do with life.
She's rather at loose ends. Who is this Daggett boy&mdash;some
university student&mdash;whom she seems to like?"</p>

<p>"Well, since you speak of him&mdash;&mdash; I hadn't meant
to, unless you did. I want to be fair to him. What
did she tell you about him?" Jeff asked confidentially.</p>

<p>"Nothing, except that he's a young engineer, and
frightfully brave and all those uncomfortable virtues,
and she met him in Yellowstone Park or somewhere,
and he saved her from a bear&mdash;or was it a tramp?&mdash;from
something unnecessary, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Eva, I don't want to be supercilious, but the truth
is that this young Daggett is a rather dreadful person.
He's been here at the house, hasn't he? How did he
strike you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. He's silent, and as dull as lukewarm
tea, but perfectly inoffensive."</p>

<p>"Then he's cleverer than I thought! Daggett is
anything but dull and inoffensive, and if he can play<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
that estimable r&ocirc;le&mdash;&mdash;! It seems that he is the son
of some common workman in the Middlewest; he
isn't an engineer at all; he's really a chauffeur or a
taxi-driver or something; and he ran into Claire and
Henry B. on the road, and somehow insinuated himself
into their graces&mdash;far from being silent and commonplace,
he appears to have some strange kind of
charm which," Jeff sighed, "I don't understand at all.
I simply don't understand it!</p>

<p>"I met him in Montana with the most gorgeously
atrocious person I've ever encountered&mdash;one Pinky
Westlake, or some such a name&mdash;positively, a crook!
He tried to get Boltwood and myself interested in the
commonest kind of a mining swindle&mdash;hinted that we
were to join him in cheating the public. And this
Daggett was his partner&mdash;they actually traveled together.
But I do want to be just. I'm not <i>sure</i> that
Daggett was aware of his partner's dishonesty. That
isn't what worries me about the lad. It's his utter
impossibility. He's as crude as iron-ore. When he's
being careful, he may manage to be inconspicuous,
but give him the chance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Really, I'm not exaggerating when I say that
at thirty-five he'll be dining in his shirt-sleeves, and
sitting down to read the paper with his shoes off and
feet up on the table. But Claire&mdash;you know what
a dear Quixotic soul she is&mdash;she fancies that because
this fellow repaired a puncture or something of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
sort for her on the road, she's indebted to him, and
the worse he is, the more she feels that she must
help him. And affairs of that kind&mdash;&mdash; Oh, it's quite
too horrible, but there have been cases, you know,
where girls as splendid and fine and well-bred as Claire
herself have been trapped into low marriages by their
loyalty to cadging adventurers!"</p>

<p>"Oh!" groaned Mrs. Gilson; and "Good Lord!"
lamented Mr. Gilson, delighted by the possibility of
tragedy; and "Really, I'm not exaggerating," said
Jeff enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" demanded Mrs. Gilson;
while Mr. Gilson, being of a ready and inventive
mind, exclaimed, "By Jove, you ought to kidnap her
and marry her yourself, Jeff!"</p>

<p>"I'd like to. But I'm too old."</p>

<p>They beautifully assured him that he was a blithe
young thing with milk teeth; and with a certain satisfaction
Jeff suggested, "I tell you what we might do.
Of course it's an ancient stunt, but it's good. I judge
that Daggett hasn't been here at the house much.
Why not have him here so often that Claire will
awaken to his crudity, and get sick of him?"</p>

<p>"We'll do it," thrilled Mrs. Gilson. "We'll have
him for everything from nine-course dinners with
Grandmother Eaton's napkins on view, to milk and
cold ham out of the ice-box. When Claire doesn't
invite him, I will!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br />
THE KITCHEN INTIMATE</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Milt</span> had become used to the Gilson drawing-room.
He was no longer uncomfortable in
the presence of its sleek fatness, though at first (not
knowing that there were such resources as interior
decorators), he had been convinced that, to have
created the room, the Gilsons must have known everything
in the world. Now he glanced familiarly at
its white paneling, its sconces like silver candlesticks,
the inevitable davenport inevitably backed by an
amethyst-shaded piano lamp and a table crowded with
silver boxes and picture-frames. He liked the winsomeness
of light upon velvet and polished wood.</p>

<p>It was not the drawing-room but the kitchen that
dismayed him.</p>

<p>In Schoenstrom he had known that there must somewhere
be beautiful "parlors," but he had trusted in
his experience of kitchens. Kitchens, according to his
philosophy, were small smelly rooms of bare floors,
and provided with one oilcloth-covered table, one stove
(the front draft always broken and propped up with
the lid-lifter), one cupboard with panes of tin pierced
in rosettes, and one stack of dirty dishes.</p>

<p>But the Gilson kitchen had the efficiency of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
laboratory and the superciliousness of a hair-dresser's
booth. With awe Milt beheld walls of white tiles, a
cork floor, a gas-range large as a hotel-stove, a ceiling-high
refrigerator of enamel and nickel, zinc-topped
tables, and a case of utensils like a surgeon's knives.
It frightened him; it made more hopelessly unapproachable
than ever the Alexandrian luxury of the
great Gilsons.... The Vanderbilts' kitchen must be
like this. And maybe King George's.</p>

<p>He was viewing the kitchen upon the occasion of an
intimate Sunday evening supper to which he had been
yearningly invited by Mrs. Gilson. The maids were
all out. The Gilsons and Claire, Milt and Jeff Saxton,
shoutingly prepared their own supper. While Mrs.
Gilson scrambled eggs and made coffee, the others
set the table, and brought cold ham and a bowl of
salad from the ice-box.</p>

<p>Milt had intended to be a silent but deft servitor.
When he had heard that he was to come to supper
with the returned Mr. Geoffrey Saxton, he had first
been panic-shaken, then resolved. He'd "let old iron-face
Saxton do the high and mighty. Let him stand
around and show off his clothes and adjectives, way
he did at Flathead Lake." But he, Milt, would be "on
the job." He'd help get supper, and calmly ignore
Jeff's rudeness.</p>

<p>Only&mdash;Jeff wasn't rude. He greeted Milt with,
"Ah, Daggett! This is <i>so</i> nice!" And Milt had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
chance to help. It was Jeff who anticipated him and
with a pleasant, "Let me get that&mdash;I'm kitchen-broke,"
snatched up the cold ham and salad. It was
Jeff who found the supper plates, while Milt was
blunderingly wondering how any one family could use
a "whole furniture-store-full of different kinds of
china." It was Jeff who sprang to help Claire wheel
in the tea-wagon, and so captured the chance to speak
to her for which Milt had been maneuvering these
five minutes.</p>

<p>When they were settled, Jeff glowed at him, and
respectfully offered, "I thought of you so often, Daggett,
on a recent little jaunt of mine. You'd have been
helpful."</p>

<p>"Where was that?" asked Milt suspiciously (wondering,
and waiting to see, whether you could take cold
ham in your fingers).</p>

<p>"Oh, in Alaska."</p>

<p>"In&mdash;Alaska?" Milt was dismayed.</p>

<p>"Yes, just a business trip there. There's something
I wish you'd advise me about."</p>

<p>He was humble. And Milt was uneasy. He
grumbled, "What's that?"</p>

<p>"I've been wondering whether it would be possible
to use wireless telephony in Alaska. But I'm such
a dub at electricity. Do you know&mdash;&mdash; What would
be the cost of installing a wireless telephone plant with
a hundred-mile radius?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>"Gee, I don't know!"</p>

<p>"Oh, so sorry. Well, I wonder if you can tell
me about wireless telegraphy, then?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know anything about that either."</p>

<p>Milt had desperately tried to make his answer
gracious but somehow&mdash;&mdash; He hated this devil's
obsequiousness more than he had his chilliness at
Flathead Lake. He had a feeling that the Gilsons
had delightedly kicked each other under the table;
that, for all her unchanging smile, Claire was unhappy....
And she was so far off, a white wraith
floating beyond his frantic grasp.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter, really. But I didn't know&mdash;&mdash; So
you've started in the engineering school at the
University of Washington," Saxton was purring.
"Have you met Gid Childers there&mdash;son of old
Senator Childers&mdash;charming people."</p>

<p>"I've seen him. He has a Stutz&mdash;no, his is the
Mercer," sighed Milt.</p>

<p>He hated himself for it, but he couldn't quite keep
the awe out of his voice. People with Mercers&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Claire seemed to be trying to speak. She made a
delicate, feminine, clairesque approximation to clearing
her throat. But Jeff ignored her and with almost
osculatory affection continued to Milt:</p>

<p>"Do let me know if there's anything I can do to
help you. We're acquainted with two or three of
your engineering faculty at the Office. They write<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
in about various things. Do you happen to know Dr.
Philgren?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Say! He's a wonder!" Milt was betrayed
into exclaiming.</p>

<p>"Yes. Good chap, I believe. He's been trying to
get a job with us. We may give him one. Just tell
him you're a friend of mine, and that he's to give you
any help he can."</p>

<p>Milt choked on a "Thanks."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;now that we're just the family here together&mdash;how
goes the financial side? Can I be of
any assistance in introducing you to some engineering
firm where you could do a little work on the side? You
could make quite a little money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>So confoundedly affectionate and paternal&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Milt said irritably, "Thanks, but I don't need to do
any work. I've got plenty of money."</p>

<p>"How pleasant!" Saxton's voice was smooth as
marshmallow. "You're fortunate. I had quite a
struggle to get through Princeton."</p>

<p>Wasn't Mr. Gilson contrasting Saxton's silk shirt
with Milt's darned cotton covering, and in light of
that contrast chuckling at Milt's boast and Saxton's
modesty? Milt became overheated. His scalp prickled
and his shoulder-blades were damp. As Saxton turned
from him, and crooned to Claire, "More ham,
honey?" Milt hated himself. He was in much of the
dramatic but undesirable position of a man in pajamas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
not very good pajamas, who has been locked out in
the hotel corridor by the slamming of his door. He
was in the frame of mind of a mongrel, of a real
Boys'-Dog, at a Madison Square dog-show. He had a
faint shrewd suspicion of Saxton's game. But what
could he do about it?</p>

<p>He felt even more out of place when the family forgot
him and talked about people of whom he had
never heard.</p>

<p>He sat alone on an extremely distant desert isle and
ate cold ham and wished he were in Schoenstrom.</p>

<p>Claire had recovered her power of speech. She
seemed to be trying to bring him into the conversation,
so that the family might appreciate him.</p>

<p>She hesitated, and thought with creased brows, and
brought out, "Uh, uh, oh&mdash;&mdash; Oh Milt: How much
is gas selling at now?"...</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>Milt left that charming and intimate supper-party at
nine. He said, "Got to work on&mdash;on my analytical
geometry," as though it was a lie; and he threw
"Good night" at Saxton as though he hated his kind,
good benefactor; and when he tried to be gracious
to Mrs. Gilson the best he could get out was, "Thanks
f' inviting me." They expansively saw him to the
door. Just as he thought that he had escaped, Saxton
begged, "Oh, Daggett, I was arguing with a chap&mdash;&mdash; What
color are Holstein-Friesian cattle? Red?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>"Black and white," Milt said eagerly.</p>

<p>He heard Mrs. Gilson giggle.</p>

<p>He stood on the terrace wiping his forehead and,
without the least struggle, finally and irretrievably
admitting that he would never see Claire Boltwood or
any of her friends again. Not&mdash;never!</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>He had received from Mrs. Gilson a note inviting
him to share their box at the first night of a three-night
Opera Season. He had spent half a day in trying
to think of a courteously rude way of declining.</p>

<p>A straggly little girl came up from the candy-shop
below his room, demanding, "Say, are you Mr. Daggett?
Say, there's some woman wants to talk to you
on our telephone. Say, tell them we ain't supposed to
be no messenger-office. You ain't supposed to call no
upstairs people on our telephone. We ain't supposed
to leave the store and go trotting all over town to&mdash;&mdash; Gee,
a nickel, gee, thank you, don't mind what ma
says, she's always kicking."</p>

<p>On the telephone, he heard Claire's voice in an agitated,
"Milt! Meet me down-town, at the Imperial
Motion Picture Theater, right away. Something I've
got to tell you. I'll be in the lobby. Hurry!"</p>

<p>When he bolted in she was already in the lobby,
agitatedly looking over a frame of "stills." She ran
to him, hooked her fingers in his lapel, poured out,
"They've invited you to the opera? I want you to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
come and put it all over them. I'm almost sure there's
a plot. They want to show me that you aren't used
to tiaras and saxophones and creaking dowagers and
tulle. Beat 'em! Beat 'em! Come to the opera and be
awf'ly aloof and supercilious. You can! Yes, you can!
And be sure&mdash;wear evening clothes. Now I've got to
hurry."</p>

<p>"B-but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't disappoint me. I depend on you. Oh, say
you will!"</p>

<p>"I will!"</p>

<p>She was gone, whisking into the Gilson limousine.
He was in a glow at her loyalty, in a tremor of anger
at the meddlers.</p>

<p>But he had never worn evening clothes.</p>

<p>He called it "a dress-suit," and before the complications
of that exotic garb, he was flabby with
anxiety. To Milt and to Schoenstrom&mdash;to Bill McGolwey,
even to Prof Jones and the greasily prosperous
Heinie Rauskukle&mdash;the dress-suit was the symbol
and proof, the indication and manner, of sophisticated
wealth. In Schoenstrom even waiters do not wear
dress-suits. For one thing there aren't any waiters.
There is one waitress at the Leipzig House, Miss
Annie Schweigenblat, but you wouldn't expect Miss
Schweigenblat to deal them off the arm in black
trousers with braid down the side.</p>

<p>No; a dress-suit was what the hero wore in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
movies; and the hero in the movies, when he wasn't
a cowpuncher, was an ex-captain of the Yale football
team, and had chambers and a valet. You could
tell him from the valet because he wasn't so bald. It
is true that Milt had heard that in St. Cloud there
were people who wore dress-suits at parties, but then
St. Cloud was a city, fifteen or sixteen thousand.</p>

<p>"How could he get away with a dress-suit? How
could he keep from feeling foolish in a low-cut vest,
and what the deuce would he do with the tails? Did
you part 'em or roll 'em up, when you sat down? And
wouldn't everybody be able to tell from his foolish
look that he didn't belong in one?" He could hear
A.D.T. boys and loafers in front of pool rooms
whispering, "Look at the piker in the rented soup
and fish!"</p>

<p>For of course he'd rent one. Nobody bought them&mdash;except
plutes like Henry B. Boltwood.</p>

<p>He agitatedly walked up and down for an hour,
peering into haberdashery windows, looking for a
kind-faced young man. He found him, in Ye Pall
Mall Toggery Shoppe &amp; Shoes; an open-faced young
man who was gazing through the window as sparklingly
as though he was thinking of going as a missionary
to India&mdash;and liked curry. Milt ironed out
his worried face, clumped in, demanded fraternally,
"Say, old man, don't some of these gents' furnishings
stores have kind of little charts that tell just what you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
wear with dress-suits and Prince Alberts and everything?"</p>

<p>"You bet," said the kind-faced young man.</p>

<p>West of Chicago, "You bet" means "Rather," and
"Yes indeed," and "On the whole I should be inclined
to fancy that there may be some vestiges of accuracy
in your curious opinion," and "You're a liar but I
can't afford to say so."</p>

<p>The kind-faced young man brought from behind the
counter a beautiful brochure illustrated with photographs
of Phoebus Apollo in what were described as
"American Beauty Garments&mdash;neat, natty, nobby,
new." The center pages faithfully catalogued the
ties, shirts, cuff-links, spats, boots, hats, to wear with
evening clothes, morning clothes, riding clothes, tennis
costumes, polite mourning.</p>

<p>As he looked it over Milt felt that his wardrobe already
contained all these gentlemanly possessions.</p>

<p>With the aid of the clerk and the chart he purchased
a tradition-haunted garment with a plate-armor bosom
and an opening as crooked as the Missouri River; a
white tie which in his strong red hands looked as silly
as a dead fish; waistcoat, pearl links, and studs. For
the first time, except for seizures of madness during
two or three visits to Minneapolis motor accessory
stores, he caught the shopping-fever. The long shining counter,
the trim red-stained shelves, the glittering cases,
the racks of flaunting ties, were beautiful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
to him and beckoning. He revolved a pleasantly
clicking rack of ties, then turned and fought his way
out.</p>

<p>He bought pumps&mdash;which cost exactly twice as much
as the largest sum which he had allowed himself. He
bought a newspaper, and in the want-columns found
the advertisement:</p>

<p class="center"><big>Silberfarb the Society Tailor<br />
DRESS SUITS TO RENT<br />
Snappiest in the City</big></p>

<p>Despite the superlative snappiness of Mr. Silberfarb's
dress-suits his establishment was a loft over a
delicatessen, approached by a splintery stairway along
which hung shabby signs announcing the upstairs
offices of "J. L. &amp; T. J. O'Regan, Private Detectives,"
"The Zenith Spiritualist Church, Messages by Rev.
Lulu Paughouse," "The International Order of Live
Ones, Seattle Wigwam," and "Mme. Lavourie,
Sulphur Baths." The dead air of the hallway suggested
petty crookedness. Milt felt that he ought to
fight somebody but, there being no one to fight, he
banged along the flapping boards of the second-floor
hallway to the ground-glass door of Silberfarb the
Society Tailor, who was also, as an afterthought
on a straggly placard, "Pressng &amp; Cleang While U
Wait."</p>

<p>He belligerently shouldered into a low room. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
light from the one window was almost obscured by
racks of musty-smelling black clothes which stretched
away from him in two dismal aisles that resembled a
morgue of unhappy dead men indecently hung up on
hooks. On a long, clumsily carpentered table, a small
Jew, collarless, sweaty, unshaven, was darning trousers
under an evil mantle gaslight. The Jew wrung out his
hands and tried to look benevolent.</p>

<p>"Want to rent a dress-suit," said Milt.</p>

<p>"I got just the t'ing for you!"</p>

<p>The little man unfolded himself, galloped down the
aisle, seized the first garment that came to hand, and
came back to lay it against Milt's uncomfortable frame,
bumbling, "Fine, mister, fy-en!"</p>

<p>Milt studied the shiny-seamed, worn-buttonholed,
limp object with dislike. Its personality was disintegrated.
The only thing he liked about it was the
good garage stink of gasoline.</p>

<p>"That's almost worn out," he growled.</p>

<p>At this sacrilege Mr. Silberfarb threw up his hands,
with the dingy suit flapping in them like a bed-quilt
shaken from a tenement window. He looked Milt all
over, coldly. His red but shining eyes hinted that
Milt was a clodhopper and no honest wearer of evening
clothes. Milt felt humble, but he snapped, "No
good. Want something with class."</p>

<p>"Vell, that was good enough for a university professor
at the big dance, but if you say so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>In the manner of one who is being put to an unfair
amount of trouble, Mr. Silberfarb returned the
paranoiac dress-suit to the rack, sighing patiently as
he laboriously draped it on a hanger. He peered and
pawed. He crowed with throaty triumph and brought
back a rich ripe thing of velvet collar and cuffs. He
fixed Milt with eyes that had become as sulky as the
eyes of a dog in August dust.</p>

<p>"Now that&mdash;you can't beat that, if you vant class,
and it'll fit you like a glove. Oh, that's an ellllegant
garment!"</p>

<p>Shaking himself out of the spell of those contemptuous
eyes Milt opened his brochure, studied the chart,
and in a footnote found, "Never wear velvet collars
or cuffs with evening coat."</p>

<p>"Nope. Nix on the velvet," he remarked.</p>

<p>Then the little man went mad and ran around in
circles. He flung the ellllegant garment on the table.
He flapped his arms, and wailed, "What do you vant?
What do you vannnnt? That's a hundred-and-fifty-dollar
dress-suit! That belonged to one of the richest
men in the city. He sold it to me because he was
going to Japan."</p>

<p>"Well, you can send it to Japan after him. I want
something decent. Have you got it&mdash;or shall I go
some place else?"</p>

<p>The tailor instantly became affectionate. "How
about a nice Tuxedo?" he coaxed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>"Nope. It says here&mdash;let me see&mdash;oh yes, here it
is&mdash;it says here in the book that for the theater-with-ladies,
should not wear 'dinner-coat or so-called
Tuxedo, but&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Oh, dem fellows what writes books they don't
know nothing. Absolute! They make it up."</p>

<p>"Huh! Well, I guess I'll take my chance on them.
The factory knows the ignition better 'n any repair-man."</p>

<p>"Vell say, you're a hard fellow to please. I'll give
you one of my reserve stock, but you got to leave me
ten dollars deposit instead of five."</p>

<p>Mr. Silberfarb quite cheerfully unlocked a glass
case behind the racked and ghostly dead; he brought
out a suit that seemed to Milt almost decent. And it
almost fitted when, after changing clothes in a broiling,
boiling, reeking, gasoline-pulsing hole behind the
racks, he examined it before a pier-glass. But he
caught the tailor assisting the fit by bunching up a
roll of cloth at the shoulder. Again Milt snapped, and
again the tailor suffered and died, and to a doubting
heathen world maintained the true gospel of "What
do you vannnnt? It ain't stylish to have the dress-suit
too tight! All the gents is wearing 'em loose and
graceful." But in the end, after Milt had gone as
far as the door, Mr. Silberfarb admitted that one dress-coat
wouldn't always fit all persons without some
alterations.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>The coat did bag a little, and it was too long in the
sleeves, but as Milt studied himself in his room&mdash;by
placing his small melancholy mirror on the bureau,
then on a chair, then on the floor, finally, to get a complete
view, clear out in the hall&mdash;he admitted with
stirring delight that he looked "pretty fair in the
bloomin' outfit." His clear face, his shining hair, his
straight shoulders, seemed to go with the costume.</p>

<p>He wriggled into his top-coat and marched out of
his room, theater-bound, with the well-fed satisfaction
of a man who is certain that no one is giggling,
"Look at the hand-me-downs." His pumps did alternately
pinch his toes and rub his heels; the trousers
cramped his waist; and he suspected that his tie had
gone wandering. But he swaggered to the trolley,
and sat as one rich and famous and very kind to the
Common People, till&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Another man in evening clothes got on the car, and
Milt saw that he wore a silk hat, and a white knitted
scarf; that he took out and examined a pair of white
kid gloves.</p>

<p>He'd forgotten the hat! He was wearing his gray
felt. He could risk the gloves, but the hat&mdash;the
"stovepipe"&mdash;and the chart had said to wear one&mdash;he
was ruined&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He turned up the collar of his top-coat to conceal
his white tie, tried to hide each of his feet behind the
other to cover up his pumps; sought to change his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
expression from that of a superior person in evening
clothes to that of a decent fellow in honest Regular
Clothes. Had the conductor or any of the passengers
realized that he was a dub in a dress-suit without the
hat?</p>

<p>Once he thought that the real person in real evening
clothes was looking at him. He turned his head
and bore the probable insult in weak misery.</p>

<p>Too feeble for anything but thick suffering he was
dragged on toward the theater, the opera, people in
silk hats&mdash;toward Jeff Saxton and exposure.</p>

<p>But his success in bullying the tailor had taught him
that dressing wasn't really a hidden lore to be known
only by initiates; that some day he too might understand
the black and white magic of clothes. His
bruised self-consciousness healed. "I'll do&mdash;something,"
he determined. He waited, vacuously.</p>

<p>The Gilson party was not in the lobby when he
arrived. He tore off his top-coat. He draped it over
his felt hat, so that no one could be sure what sort
of hat it shamefully concealed. That unveiling did
expose him to the stare of everybody waiting in the
lobby. He was convinced that the entire ticket-buying
cue was glumly resenting him. Peeping down at the
unusual white glare of his shirt-front, he felt naked
and indecent.... "Nice kind o' vest. Must make
'em out of old piqu&eacute; collars."</p>

<p>He endured his martyrdom till his party arrived&mdash;the Gilsons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Claire, Jeff Saxton, and a glittering
young woman whose name, Milt thought, was Mrs.
Corey.</p>

<p>And Saxton wasn't wearing a high hat! He wore
a soft one, and he didn't seem to care!</p>

<p>Milt straightened up, followed them through the
manifold dangers of the lobby, down a perilous aisle
of uptilted scornful faces, to a red narrow corridor,
winding stairs, a secret passage, a mysterious dark
closet&mdash;and he walked out into a room with one
side missing, and, on that side, ten trillion people in
a well, and nine trillion of them staring at him and
noticing that he'd rented his dress-suit. Hot about the
neck, he stumbled over one or two chairs, and was
permitted to rest in a foolish little gilt chair in the
farthest corner.</p>

<p>Once safe, he felt much better. Except that Jeff did
put on white kid gloves, Milt couldn't see that they
two looked so different. And neither of the two men
in the next box wore gloves. Milt made sure of that
comfort; he reveled in it; he looked at Claire, and in
her loyal smile found ease.</p>

<p>He snarled, "She trusts you. Forget you're a dub.
Try to be human. Hang it, I'm no greener at the
opera than old horsehair sofa there would be at a
garage."</p>

<p>There was something&mdash;&mdash; What was it he was
trying to remember? Oh yes. When he'd worked in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the Schoenstrom flour-mill, as engineer, at eighteen,
the owner had tried to torment him (to "get his goat,"
Milt put it), and Milt had found that the one thing
that would save him was to smile as though he knew
more than he was telling. It did not, he remembered,
make any difference whether or not the smile was
real. If he merely looked the miller up and down, and
smiled cynically, he was let alone.</p>

<p>Why not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Saxton was bending toward him, asking in honeyed
respectfulness:</p>

<p>"Don't you think that the new school in music&mdash;audible
pointillage, one might call it&mdash;mistakes cacophony
for power?"</p>

<p>Milt smiled, paternally.</p>

<p>Saxton waited for something more. He dug the
nail of his right middle finger into his thumb, looked
thoughtful, and attacked again:</p>

<p>"Which do you like better: the new Italian music,
or the orthodox German?"</p>

<p>Milt smiled like two uncles watching a clever baby,
and patronized Saxton with, "They both have their
points."</p>

<p>He saw that Claire was angry; but that the Gilsons
and Mrs. Corey, flap-eared, gape-mouthed, forward-bending,
were very proud of their little Jeff. He saw
that, except for their clothes and self-conscious coiffures,
they were exactly like a gang of cracker-box<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
loafers at Heinie Rauskukle's badgering a new boy in
town.</p>

<p>Saxton looked bad-tempered. Then Mrs. Corey
bustled with her face and yearned at Milt, "Do tell
me: what is the theme of the opera tonight. I've
rather forgotten."</p>

<p>Milt ceased to smile. While all of them regarded
him with interest he said clearly, "I haven't got the
slightest idea. I don't know anything about music.
Some day I hope I can get a clever woman like you to
help me, Mrs. Corey. It must be great to know all
about all these arts, the way you do. I wish you'd
explain that&mdash;overture they call it, don't they?"</p>

<p>For some reason, Mr. Gilson was snickering, Mrs.
Corey flushing, Claire looking well pleased. Milt had
tried to be insulting, but had got lost in the intricacies
of the insult. He felt that he'd better leave it in its
apparently safe state, and he leaned back, and smiled
again, as though he was waiting. Mrs. Corey did not
explain the overture. She hastily explained her second
maid, to Mrs. Gilson.</p>

<p>The opera was <i>Il Amore dei Tre Re</i>. Milt was
bewildered. To him, who had never seen an opera, the
convention that a girl cannot hear a man who is
bellowing ten feet away from her, was absurd; and
he wished that the singers would do something besides
making their arms swim.</p>

<p>He discovered that by moving his chair forward, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
could get within a foot of Claire. His hand slipped
across, touched hers. She darted a startled backward
glance. Her fingers closed tight about his, then restlessly
snuggled inside his palm&mdash;and Milt was lost in
enchantment.</p>

<p>Stately kings of blood-red cloaks and chrysoberyls
malevolent in crowns of ancient and massy gold&mdash;the
quick dismaying roll of drums and the shadow of
passing banners below a tower&mdash;a woman tall and
misty-veiled and pale with dreams&mdash;a world of spirit
where the soul had power over unseen dominions&mdash;this
he saw and heard and tasted in the music. What
the actual plot was, or the technique of the singing, he
did not know, but it bore him beyond all reality save
the sweet, sure happiness of Claire's nestling hand.</p>

<p>He held her fingers so firmly that he could feel the
pulse beat in them.</p>

<hr class="shr" />

<p>In the clamminess of his room, when the enchantment
was gone, he said gravely:</p>

<p>"How much longer can I keep this up? Sooner or
later I bust loose and smash little Jeff one in the snoot,
and he takes the count, and I'm never allowed to see
Claire again. Turn the roughneck out on his ear. I
s'pose I'm vulgar. I s'pose that fellow Michael in
<i>Youth's Encounter</i> wouldn't talk about snoots. I
don't care, I'll&mdash;&mdash; If I poke Saxton one&mdash;&mdash; I'm
not afraid of the kid-glove precinct any more. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
brain's as good as theirs, give it a chance. But oh,
they're all against me. And they bust the Athletic
Union's wrestling rule that 'striking, kicking, gouging,
hair-pulling, butting, and strangling will not be allowed.'
How long can I go on being good-natured?
When I do break loose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Slowly, beneath the moral cuff of his dress-shirt,
Milt's fist closed in a brown, broad-knuckled lump, and
came up in the gesture of a right to the jaw. But it
came up only a foot. The hand opened, climbed to
Milt's face, rubbed his temples, while he sighed:</p>

<p>"Nope. Can't even do that. Bigger game now.
Used to could&mdash;used to be able to settle things with
a punch. But I've got to be more&mdash;oh, more diplomatic
now. Oh Lord, how lonely I get for Bill McGolwey.
No. That isn't true. I couldn't stand Bill
now. Claire took all that out of me. Where am I,
where am I? Why did I ever get a car that takes a
36 &times; 6?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII<br />
THE CORNFIELD ARISTOCRAT</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was an innocent little note from Jeff Saxton; a
polite, humble little note; it said that Jeff had a
card to the Astoria Club, and wouldn't Milt please have
lunch with him? But Milt dropped it on the table,
and he walked round it as though it were a dictagraph
which he'd discovered in the table drawer after happy,
happy, hidden hours at counterfeiting.</p>

<p>It seemed more dangerous to refuse than to go. He
browned the celebrated new shoes; he pressed the
distinguished new trousers, with a light and quite
unsatisfactory flatiron; he re-re-retied his best spotted
blue bow&mdash;it persisted in having the top flaps too short,
but the retying gave him spiritual strength&mdash;and he
modestly clumped into the aloof brick portal of the
Astoria Club on time.</p>

<p>He had never been in a club before.</p>

<p>He looked at the red tiled floor of the entrance hall;
he stared through the hall into an immense lounge with
the largest and softest chairs in the world, with oil
portraits of distinguished old bucks, and ninety per
cent. of the wealth and power of Seattle pulling its
several mustaches, reading the P.I., and ignoring the
lone intruder out in the hall.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>A small Zulu in blue tights and brass buttons glared
at Milt; and a large, soft, suave, insulting young man
demanded, "Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"Mr. G-g-geoffrey Saxton?" ventured Milt.</p>

<p>"Not in, sir." The "sir" sounded like "And you
know it." The flaming guardian retired behind a narrow
section of a bookkeeper's desk and ignored him.</p>

<p>"I'm to meet him for lunch," Milt forlornly persisted.</p>

<p>The young man looked up, hurt and annoyed at
finding that the person was still to be dealt with.</p>

<p>"If you will wait in there?" he groaned.</p>

<p>Milt sat in there, which was a small blue tapestry
room with hard chairs intended to discourage bill-collectors.
He turned his hat round and round and
round, till he saw Jeff Saxton, slim and straight and
hard as the stick hooked over his arm, sailing into
the hall. He plunged out after him, took refuge with
him from the still unconvinced inspection of the hall-man.
For twenty seconds, he loved Jeff Saxton.</p>

<p>And Jeff seemed to adore him in turn. He solicitously
led Milt to the hat-checking counter. He
showed Milt the lounge and the billiard room, through
which Milt crept with erect shoulders and easy eyes
and a heart simply paralyzed with fear that one of
these grizzled clubmen with clipped mustaches would
look at him. He coaxed Milt into a grill that was a
cross between the Chinese throne-room and a Viennese<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
Weinstube, and he implored his friend Milt to do him
the favor of trying the "very fair" English mutton
chops and potatoes <i>au gratin</i>.</p>

<p>"I did want to see you again before we go East,
Daggett," he said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Th-thanks. When do you go?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying to get Miss Boltwood to start soon
now. The season is opening in the East. She does like
your fine sturdy West, as I do, but still, when we
think of the exciting new shows opening, and the
dances, and the touch with the great world&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
it does make one eager to get back."</p>

<p>"That's so," risked Milt.</p>

<p>"We, uh&mdash;&mdash; Daggett&mdash;&mdash; In fact, I'm going
to call you Milt, as Claire does. You don't know what
a pleasure it has been to have encountered you.
There's a fine keen courage about you Western chaps
that makes a cautious old fogy like me envious. I
shall remember meeting you with a great deal of
pleasure."</p>

<p>"Th-thanks. Been pleasure meet you."</p>

<p>"And I know Claire will, too."</p>

<p>Milt felt that he was being dealt with foully. He
wanted to object to Saxton's acting as agent for Claire
as incompetent, irrelevant, immaterial, and no foundation
laid. But he could not see just where he was
being led, and with Saxton glowing at him as warmly
and greasily as the mutton chops, Milt could only smile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
wanly, and reflectively feel the table leg to see if it
was loose enough to jerk out in case of need.</p>

<p>Saxton was being optimistic:</p>

<p>"In fact, Claire and I both hope that some day when
you've finished your engineering course, we'll see you
in the East. I wonder&mdash;&mdash; As I say, my dear fellow,
I've taken the greatest fancy to you, and I do hope
you won't think I'm too intimate if I say that I
imagine that even in your charming friendship with
Miss Boltwood, you've probably never learned what
important people the Boltwoods are. I thought I'd tell
you so that you could realize the privilege both you
and I have in knowing them. Henry B. is&mdash;while not
a man of any enormous wealth&mdash;regarded as one of
the keenest intellects in New York wholesale circles.
But beyond that, he is a scholar, and a man of the
broadest interests. Of course the Boltwoods are too
modest to speak of it, but he was chiefly instrumental
in the establishment of the famous Brooklyn Symphony
Orchestra. And his ancestors clear through&mdash;his
father was a federal judge, and his mother's
brother was a general in the Civil War, and afterwards
an ambassador. So you can guess something
of the position Claire holds in that fine, quiet, solid
old Brooklyn set. Henry Ward Beecher himself was
complimented at being asked to dine with the Boltwoods
of his day, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>No, the table leg wouldn't come loose, so it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
only verbally that the suddenly recovered Milt attacked:</p>

<p>"Certainly is nice to have one of those old families.
It's something like&mdash;&mdash; As you say, you and I have
gotten pretty well acquainted along the line, so I guess
I can say it to you&mdash;&mdash; My father and his folks came
from that same kind of family. Father's dad was a
judge, back in Maine, and in the war, grand-dad was
quite friendly with Grant."</p>

<p>This tribute of Milt to his grandsire was loyal but
inaccurate. Judge Daggett, who wasn't a judge at all,
but a J. P., had seen General Grant only once, and at
the time the judge had been in company with all the
other privates in the Fourteenth Maine.</p>

<p>"Dad was a pioneer. He was a doctor. He had to
give up all this easy-going stuff in order to help open
up the West to civilization, but I guess it was worth
it. He used to do the hardest kind of operations, on
kitchen tables, with his driver giving the chloroform.
I'm mighty proud of him. As you say, it's kind of
what you might call inspiring to belong to the old
Pilgrim aristocracy."</p>

<p>Never before had Milt claimed relation to a group
regarding which his only knowledge was the information
derived from the red school-history to the effect
that they all carried blunderbusses, put people in the
stocks for whistling, and frequently said, "Why don't
you speak for yourself, John?" But he had made his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
boast with a clear eye and a pleasant, superior, calm
smile.</p>

<p>"Oh! Very interesting," grunted Saxton.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see grandfather's daguerreotype?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, uh, thanks, that would be very interesting&mdash;&mdash; Do
let me see it, when&mdash;&mdash; Uh, as I
was saying, Claire doubtless has a tremendous social
career before her. So many people expecting her to
marry well. Of course she has a rather unusual combination
of charm and intelligence and&mdash;&mdash; In fact I
think we may both be glad that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. That's right. And the best thing about her
is the way she can shake off all the social stuff and go
camping and be a regular human being," Milt
caressed.</p>

<p>"Um, uh, no doubt, no doubt, though&mdash;&mdash; Of
course, though, that isn't an inherent part of her. I
fancy she's been rather tired by this long trip, poor
child. Of course she isn't very strong."</p>

<p>"That's right. Real pluck. And of course she'll
get stronger by hiking. You've never seen her bucking
a dangerous hill&mdash;I kind of feel that a person
who hasn't seen her in the wilds doesn't know
her."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be contradictory, old man, but I
feel on the other hand that no one who has failed to
see her at the Junior League Dances, in a Poiret<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
frock, can know her! Come, come! Don't know how
we drifted into this chorus of praise of Claire! What
I wanted to ask was your opinion of the Pierce-Arrow.
I'm thinking of buying one. Do you think
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>All the way home Milt exulted, "I put it all over
him. I wasn't scared by the 'Don't butt into the
aristocracy, my young friend' stuff. I lied handsome.
But&mdash;&mdash; Darn it, now I'll have to live up to my
New England aristocracy.... Wonder if my grand-dad's
dad was a hired man or a wood-sawyer?...
Ne' mine; I'm Daggett of Daggett from now on." He
bounded up to his room vaingloriously remarking,
"I'm there with the ancestors. I was brought up in
the handsome city of Schoenstrom, which was founded
by a colony of Vermont Yankees, headed by Herman
Skumautz. I was never allowed to play with the
Dutch kids, and&mdash;&mdash;" He opened the door. "&mdash;the
Schoenstrom minister taught me Greek and was my
bosom frien'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped with his heart in his ankles. Lolling
on the bed, grinning, waving a cigarette, was Bill
McGolwey, proprietor of the Old Home Lunch, of
Schoenstrom, Minnesota.</p>

<p>"Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwhy
where the heck did you come from?" stammered the
deposed aristocrat to his bosom friend Bill.</p>

<p>"You old lemon-pie-faced, lollygagging, flap-footed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
crab-nosed son of misery, gee, but it's good to see you,
Milt!"</p>

<p>Bill was off the bed, wringing Milt's hand with
simple joy, with perfect faith that in finding his friend
all the troubles of life were over. And Milt was
gloomily discovering the art of diplomacy. Bill was
his friend, yes, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It was hard enough to carry his own self.</p>

<p>He pictured Jeff Saxton leering at the door, and
while he pounded Bill's shoulder, and called him the
name which, west of Chicago, is the token of hatred
and of extreme gladness at meeting, he discovered that
some one had stolen his stomach and left a piece of
ice in its place.</p>

<p>They settled down on bed and chair, Bill's ears red
with joy, while Milt demanded:</p>

<p>"How the deuce did you get here?"</p>

<p>"Well, tell you, old hoss. Schoenstrom got so darn
lonely after you left, and when Ben and Heinie got
your address and bought the garage, think's I, lez go
off on a little bum."</p>

<p>Milt was realizing&mdash;and hating himself for realizing&mdash;that
Bill's face was dirty, his hair linty, the bottoms
of his trousers frayed masses of mud, while Bill
chuckled:</p>

<p>"I figured out maybe I could get a job here in a
restaurant, and you and me could room together. I
sold out my good will in the Old Home Lunch for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
hundred bucks. I was going to travel swell, riding the
cushions. But Pete Swanson wanted me to go down
to the Cities first, and we run into some pretty swift
travelers in Minneapolis, and a couple of girls&mdash;saaaaaaay,
kid, some class!"</p>

<p>Bill winked, and Milt&mdash;Milt was rather sick. He
knew Bill's conception of class in young women. Was
this the fellow he had liked so well? These the ideas
which a few months ago he had taken as natural and
extremely amusing?</p>

<p>"And I got held up in an alley off Washington
Avenue, and they got the last twenty bones off'n me,
and I was flatter 'n a pancake. So I says 'ish
kabibble,' and I sneaks onto the blind baggage, and
bums my way West. You'd 'a' died laughing to seen
me throwing my feet for grub. Oh, I'm some panhandler!
There was one <i>Frau</i> sicked her dog onto me,
and I kicked him in the jaw and&mdash;&mdash; Oh, it was one
swell hike."</p>

<p>Milt was trying to ignore the voice that was raging,
"And now he expects to live on me, after throwing
his own money away. The waster! The hobo! He'll
expect to meet Claire&mdash;&mdash; I'd kill him before I'd
let him soil her by looking at her. Him and his classy
girls!" Milt tried to hear only the other inner voice,
which informed him, "He looks at you so trustingly.
He'd give you his shirt, if you needed it&mdash;and he
wouldn't make you ask for it!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>Milt tried to be hearty: "What're you going to do,
old kid?"</p>

<p>"Well, the first thing I'm going to do is to borrow
ten iron-men and a pair of pants."</p>

<p>"You bet! Here she is. Haven't got any extra
pants. Tell you: Here's another five, and you can
get the pants at the store in the next block, this side
of the street. Hustle along now and get 'em!" He
chuckled at Bill; he patted his arm; he sought to hurry
him out.... He had to be alone, to think.</p>

<p>But Bill kissed the fifteen dollars, carelessly rammed
it into his pocket, crawled back on the bed, yawned,
"What's the rush? Gosh, I'm sleepy. Say, Milt,
whadyuh think of me and you starting a lunch-room
here together? You got enough money out of the
garage&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no, noooo, gee, I'd like to, Bill, but you see,
well, I've got to hold onto what little I've got so I can
get through engineering school."</p>

<p>"Sure, but you could cash in on a restaurant&mdash;you
could work evenings in the dump, and there'd be a lot
of city sports hanging around, and we'd have the time
of our lives."</p>

<p>"No, I&mdash;&mdash; I study, evenings. And I&mdash;&mdash; The
fact is, Bill, I've met a lot of nice fellows at the university
and I kind of go around with them."</p>

<p>"Aw, how d'you get that way? Rats, you don't
want to go tagging after them Willy-boys. Damn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
dirty snobs. And the girls are worse. I tell you,
Milt, these hoop-te-doodle society Janes may look all
right to hicks like us, but on the side they raise more
hell than any milliner's trimmer from Chi that ever
vamped a rube burg."</p>

<p>"What do you know about them?"</p>

<p>"Now don't get sore. I'm telling you. I don't like
to see any friend of mine make a fool of himself hanging
around with a bunch that despises him because he
ain't rich, that's all. Met any of the high-toned
skirts?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I&mdash;<i>have</i>!"</p>

<p>"Trot 'em up and lemme give 'em the once-over."</p>

<p>"We&mdash;we'll see about it. Now I got to go to a
mathematics recitation, Bill. You make yourself comfortable,
and I'll be back at five."</p>

<p>Milt did not have to go to a recitation. He marched
out with briskness in his step, and a book under his
arm; but when he reached the corner, the briskness
proved to be spurious, and the mathematics book
proved to be William Rose Ben&eacute;t's <i>Merchants of
Cathay</i>, which Claire had given him in the Yellowstone,
and which he had rescued from the wrecked
bug.</p>

<p>He stood staring at it. He opened it with unhappy
tenderness. He had been snatched from the world of
beautiful words and serene dignity, of soaring mountains
and companionship with Claire in the radiant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
morning, back to the mud and dust of Schoenstrom,
from the opera to "city sports" in a lunch-room!
He hated Bill McGolwey and his sneering assumption
that Milt belonged in the filth with him. And
he hated himself for not being enough of a genius to
combine Bill McGolwey and Claire Boltwood. But
not once, in his maelstrom of worry on that street
corner, did he expect Claire to like Bill. Through all
his youthful agonizing, he had enough common sense
to know that though Claire might conquer a mountain
pass, she could never be equal to the social demands
of Schoenstrom and Bill McGolwey.</p>

<p>He wandered for an hour and came back to find
that, in a "dry" city which he had never seen before,
the crafty Bill had obtained a quart of Bourbon, and
was in a state of unsteady beatitude. He wanted, he
announced, to dance.</p>

<p>Milt got him into the community bathtub, and
soused him under, but Bill's wet body was slippery,
and Bill's merry soul was all for frolicsome gamboling,
and he slid out of Milt's grasp, he sloshed around
in the tub, he sprinkled Milt's sacred good suit with
soapy water, and escaped, and in the costume of
Adam he danced orientally in Milt's room, till he was
seized with sleepiness and cosmic grief, and retired to
Milt's bed in tears and nothing else.</p>

<p>The room dimmed, grew dark. The street lamps
outside sent a wan, wavery gleam into the room.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
Evening crowds went by, and in a motion-picture
theater a banging piano struck up. Bill breathed in
choking snorts. Milt sat unmoving, feeling very old,
very tired, too dumbly unhappy to be frightened of
the dreadful coming hour when Claire and Jeff should
hear of Bill, and discover Milt's real world.</p>

<p>He was not so romantically loyal, not so inhumanly
heroic, that it can truthfully be reported that he never
thought of getting rid of Bill. He did think of it,
again and again. But always he was touched by Bill's
unsuspecting trust, and shook his head, and sank again
into the fog.</p>

<p>What was the use of trying to go ahead? Wasn't
he, after all, merely a Bill McGolwey himself?</p>

<p>If he was, he wouldn't inflict himself on Claire.</p>

<p>For several minutes he gave up forever the zest of
climbing.</p>

<p>When Bill awoke, brightly solicitous about the rest
of the quart of Bourbon, and bouncingly ready to "go
out and have a time," Milt loafed about the streets
with him, showing him the city. He dully cut his
classes, next morning, and took Bill to the wharves.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, when they were lounging
in the room, and Bill was admiring his new pants&mdash;he
boasted of having bought them for three dollars,
and pointed out that Milt had been a "galoot" to
spend ten dollars for shoes&mdash;that some one knocked
at the door. Sleepily expectant of his landlady, Milt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
opened it on Miss Claire Boltwood, Mr. and Mrs.
Eugene Gilson, and Mr. Geoffrey Saxton.</p>

<p>Saxton calmly looked past him, at Bill, smiled
slightly, and condescended, "I thought we ought to
call on you, so we've dropped in to beg for tea."</p>

<p>Bill had stopped midway in scratching his head to
gape at Claire. Claire returned the look, stared at
Bill's frowsy hair, his red wrists, his wrinkled, grease-stained
coat, his expression of impertinent stupidity.
Then she glanced questioningly at Milt, who choked:</p>

<p>"Oh yes, yes, sure, glad see you, come in, get some
tea, so glad see you, come in&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII<br />
TOOTH-MUG TEA</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">"My</span> friend Mr. McGolwey&mdash;I knew him in
Schoenstrom&mdash;come on to Seattle for a while.
Bill, these are some people I met along the road," Milt
grumbled.</p>

<p>"Glad to meet 'em. Have a chair. Have two
chairs! Say, Milt, y'ought to have more chairs if
you're going to have a bunch of swells coming to call
on you. Ha, ha, ha! Say, I guess I better pike out
and give the folks a chance to chin with you," Bill
fondly offered.</p>

<p>"Oh, sit down," Milt snapped at him.</p>

<p>They all sat down, four on the bed; and Milt's inner
ear heard a mute snicker from the Gilsons and Saxton.
He tried to talk. He couldn't. Bill looked at
him and, perceiving the dumbness, gallantly helped
out:</p>

<p>"So you met the kid on the road, eh? Good scout,
Milt is. We always used to say at Schoenstrom that
he was the best darn hand at fixing a flivver in seven
townships."</p>

<p>"So you knew Mr. Daggett at home? Now isn't
that nice," said Mrs. Gilson.</p>

<p>"<i>Knew</i> him? Saaaaay, Milt and I was brung up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
together. Why, him and I have bummed around together,
and worked on farms, summers, and fished for
bull-heads&mdash;&mdash; Ever catch a bull-head? Damnedest
slipperiest fish you ever saw, and got horns that sting
the stuffin's out of you and&mdash;&mdash; Say, I wonder if
Milt's told you about the time we had at a barn-dance
once? There was a bunch of hicks there, and I
says, 'Say, kid, lez puncture their tires, and hide back
of the manure pile, and watch the fun when they come
out.' I guess maybe I was kind of stewed a little, tell
the truth, but course Milt he don't drink much, hardly
at all, nice straight kid if I do say so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bill!" Milt ordered. "We must have some tea.
Here's six-bits. You run down to the corner grocery
and get some tea and a little cream. Oh, you better
buy three-four cups, too. Hustle now, son!"</p>

<p>"Attaboy! Yours to command, ladies and gents,
like the fellow says!" Bill boomed delightedly. He
winked at Jeff Saxton, airily spun his broken hat on
his dirty forefinger, and sauntered out.</p>

<p>"Charming fellow. A real original," crooned Mrs.
Gilson.</p>

<p>"Did he know your friend Mr. Pinky?" asked
Saxton.</p>

<p>Before Milt could answer, Claire rose from the
bed, inspected the Gilsons and Jeff with cold dislike,
and said quietly to Milt, "The poor dear thing&mdash;he
was dreadfully embarrassed. It's so good of you to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
be nice to him. I believe in being loyal to your old
friends."</p>

<p>"Oh, so do I!" babbled Mrs. Gilson. "It's just
too splendid. And <i>we</i> must do something for him.
I'm going to invite Mr. Daggett and Mr.&mdash;Mr. McGollups,
was it?&mdash;to dinner this evening. I do want to
hear him tell about your boyhood. It must have been
so interesting."</p>

<p>"It was," mused Milt. "It was poor and miserable.
We had to work hard&mdash;we had to fight for whatever
education we got&mdash;we had no one to teach us
courtesy."</p>

<p>"Oh now, with your fine old doctor father? Surely
he was an inspiration?" Jeff didn't, this time, trouble
to hide the sneer.</p>

<p>"Yes. He was. He gave up the chance to be a
rich loafer in order to save farmers' babies for fees
that he never got."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he did. I wish I'd known him. We
need to know men like that in this pink-frosting playing
at living we have in cities," Claire said sweetly&mdash;not
to Milt but to Jeff.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gilson had ignored them, waiting with the
patience of a cat at a mouse-hole, and she went on,
"But you haven't said you'd come, this evening.
Do say you will. I don't suppose Mr. McGollups will
care to dress for dinner?"</p>

<p>With saccharin devotion Milt yearned back, "No,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Mrs. Gilson. No. Mr. McGolwey won't care to
dress. He's eccentric."</p>

<p>"But you'll make him come?"</p>

<p>Milt was tactfully beginning to refuse when Gene
Gilson at last exploded, turned purple, covered his dripping,
too-red lips with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, Milt hurled at Mrs. Gilson, "All
right. We'll come. Bill'll be awfully funny. He's
never been out of a jerkwater burg in his life, hardly.
He's an amusing cuss. He thinks I'm smart! He
loves me like a dog. Oh, he's rich! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Milt might have gone on ... if he had, Mr. and
Mrs. Gilson would have gone away, much displeased.
But Bill arrived, with some of the worst tea in the
world, and four cups tastefully done in cupids' heads
and much gilt.</p>

<p>Milt made tea, ignoring them, while Bill entertained
the Gilsons and Saxtons with Rabelaisian stories of
threshing-time when shirts prickly with chaff and
gritty with dust stuck to sweat-dripping backs; of the
"funny thing" of Milt and Bill being hired to move
a garbage-pile and "swiping" their employer's
"mushmelons"; of knotting shirts at the swimming-hole
so that the bawling youngsters had to "chaw
beef"; of drinking beer in the livery-stable at Melrose;
of dropping the water-pitcher from a St. Klopstock
hotel window upon the head of the "constabule" and
escaping from him across the lean-to roof.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>Mrs. Gilson encouraged him; Bill sat with almost
closed eyes, glorying in the saga of small-town life;
Saxton and Gilson did not conceal their contemptuous
grins.</p>

<p>But Claire&mdash;&mdash; After nervously rubbing the tips of
her thumbs with flickering agitated fingers, she had
paid no attention to Bill and the revelation of Milt's
rustic life; she had quietly gone to Milt, to help him
prepare the scanty tea.</p>

<p>She whispered, "Never mind, dear. I don't care.
It was all twice as much fun as being wheeled in lacy
prams by cranky nurses, as Jeff and I were. But I
know how you feel. Are you ashamed of having been
a prairie pirate?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not! We were wild kids&mdash;we raised a lot
of Cain&mdash;but I'm glad we did."</p>

<p>"So am I. I couldn't stand it if you were ashamed.
Listen to me, and remember little Claire's words of
wisdom. These fools are trying&mdash;oh, they're so obvious!&mdash;they're
trying to make me feel that the prim
Miss Boltwood of Brooklyn Heights is a stranger to
you. Well, they're succeeding in making me a
stranger&mdash;to them!"</p>

<p>"Claire! Dear! You don't mind Bill?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I do. And so do you. You've grown away
from him."</p>

<p>"I don't know but&mdash;&mdash; Today has been quite a
test."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>"Yes. It has. Because if I can stand your friend
Mr. McGolwey&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you do care!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. And if I think that he's, oh, not much
good, and I remember that for a long time you just
had him to play with, then I'm all the more anxious
to make it up to you."</p>

<p>"Don't be sorry for me! I can't stand that! After
all, it was a good town, and good folks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! No! I'm not sorry for you! I just mean,
you couldn't have had so terribly much fun, after you
were eighteen or so. Schoenstrom must have been
a little dull, after very many years there. This stuff
about the charm of backwoods villages&mdash;the people
that write it seem to take jolly good care to stay in
Long Island suburbs!"</p>

<p>"Claire!" He was whispering desperately, "The
tea's most done. Oh, my dear. I'm crazy with this
puttering around, trying to woo you and having to
woo the entire Gilson tribe. Let's run away!"</p>

<p>"No; first I'm going to convince them that you
are&mdash;what I know you are."</p>

<p>"But you can't."</p>

<p>"Huh! You wait! I've thought of the most beautiful,
beastly cruel plan for the reduction of social
obesity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she was jauntily announcing, "Tea, my dears.
Jeff, you get the tooth-mug. Isn't this jolly!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>"Yes. Oh yes. Very jolly!" Jeff was thoroughly
patronizing, but she didn't look offended. She made
them drink the acid tea, and taste the chalk-like bread
and butter sandwiches. She coaxed Bill to go on
with his stories, and when the persistent Mrs. Gilson
again asked the pariahs to come to dinner, Claire
astonished Milt, and still more astonished Mrs. Gilson,
by begging, "Oh yes, please do come, Milt."</p>

<p>He consented, savagely.</p>

<p>"But first," Claire added to Mrs. Gilson, "I want
us to take the boys to&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I have the bulliest
idea. Come, everybody. We're going riding."</p>

<p>"Uh, where&mdash;&mdash;?" hinted Mr. Gilson.</p>

<p>"That's my secret. Come!"</p>

<p>Claire pranced to the door, herded all of them down
to the limousine, whispered an address to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>Milt didn't care much for that ride. Bill was somewhat
too evidently not accustomed to limousines. He
wiped his shoes, caked with red mud, upon the seat-cushions,
and apologized perspiringly. He said, "Gee
whillikens, that's a dandy idee, telephone to bawl the
shuffer out with," and "Are them flowers real, the
bokay in the vase?"</p>

<p>But the Gilsons and Jeff Saxton were happy about
it all&mdash;till the car turned from a main thoroughfare
upon a muddy street of shacks that clung like goats to
the sides of a high cut, a street unchanged from the
pioneer days of Seattle.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>"Good heavens, Claire, you aren't taking us to see
Aunt Hatty, are you?" wailed Mrs. Gilson.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, indeed. I knew the boys would like to
meet her."</p>

<p>"No, really, I don't think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eva, my soul, Jeff and you planned our tea
party today, and assured me I'd be so interested in
Milt's bachelor apartment&mdash;&mdash; By the way, I'd been
up there already, so it wasn't entirely a surprise. It's
my turn to lead." She confided to Milt, "Dear old
Aunt Hatty is related to all of us. She's Gene's aunt,
and my fourth cousin, and I think she's distantly related
to Jeff. She came West early, and had a hard
time, but she's real Brooklyn Heights&mdash;and she belongs
to Gramercy Park and North Washington
Square and Rittenhouse Square and Back Bay, too,
though she has got out of touch a little. So I wanted
you to meet her."</p>

<p>Milt wondered what unperceived bag of cement had
hardened the faces of Saxton and the Gilsons.</p>

<p>Silent save for polite observations of Claire upon
tight skirts and lumbering, the merry company reached
the foot of a lurching flight of steps that scrambled up
a clay bank to a cottage like a hen that has set too long.
Milt noticed that Mrs. Gilson made efforts to remain
in the limousine when it stopped, and he caught Gilson's
mutter to his wife, "No, it's Claire's turn. Be
a sport, Eva."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>Claire led them up the badly listed steps to an unpainted
porch on which sat a little old lady, very neat,
very respectable, very interested, and reflectively holding
in one ivory hand a dainty handkerchief and a
black clay pipe.</p>

<p>"Hello, Claire, my dear. You've broken the relatives'
record&mdash;you've called twice in less than a year,"
said the little old lady.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Aunt Harriet," remarked Mrs.
Gilson, with great lack of warmth.</p>

<p>"Hello, Eva. Sit down on the edge of the porch.
Those chickens have made it awful dirty, though,
haven't they? Bring out some chairs. There's two
chairs that don't go down under you&mdash;often." Aunt
Harriet was very cheerful.</p>

<p>The group lugubriously settled in a circle upon an
assemblage of wind-broken red velvet chairs and
wooden stools. They resembled the aftermath of a
funeral on a damp day.</p>

<p>Claire was the cheerful undertaker, Mrs. Gilson the
grief-stricken widow.</p>

<p>Claire waved at Milt and conversed with Aunt Hatty
in a high brisk voice: "This is the nice boy I met
on the road that I think I told you about, Cousin
Hatty."</p>

<p>The little old lady screwed up the delicate skin
about her eyes, examined Milt, and cackled, "Boy,
there's something wrong here. You don't belong with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
my family. Why, you look like an American. You
haven't got an imitation monocle, and I bet you can't
talk with a New York-London accent. Why, Claire,
I'm ashamed of you for bringing a human being into
the Boltwood-Gilson-Saxton tomb and expecting&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then was the smile of Mrs. Gilson lost forever.
It was simultaneously torpedoed, mined, scuttled, and
bombed. It went to the bottom without a ripple, while
Mrs. Gilson snapped, "Aunt Hatty, please don't be
vulgar."</p>

<p>"Me?" croaked the little old lady. She puffed at
her pipe, and dropped her elbows on her knees. "My,
ain't it hard to please some folks."</p>

<p>"Cousin Hatty, I want Milt to know about our
families. I love the dear old stories," Claire begged
prettily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gilson snarled. "Claire, really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do shut up, Eva, and don't be so bossy!"
yelped the dear little old lady, in sudden and dismaying
rage. "I'll talk if I want to. Have they been
bullying you, Claire? Or your boy? I tell you, boy,
these families are fierce. I was brought up in
Brooklyn&mdash;went through all the schools&mdash;used to be
able to misplay the piano and mispronounce French
with the best of 'em. Then Gene's pa and I came
West together&mdash;he had an idea he'd get rich robbing
the Injuns of their land. And we went broke. I took
in washing. I learned a lot. I learned a Gilson was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
just the same common stuff as a red-shirt miner, when
he was up against it. But Gene's pa succeeded&mdash;there
was something about practically stealing a fur schooner&mdash;but
I never was one to tattle on my kin. Anyway,
by the time Gene come along, his pa was rich, and that
means aristocratic.</p>

<p>"This aristocracy west of Pittsburgh is just twice
as bad as the snobbery in Boston or New York, because
back there, the families have had their wealth
long enough&mdash;some of 'em got it by stealing real
estate in 1820, and some by selling Jamaica rum and
niggers way back before the Revolutionary War&mdash;they've
been respectable so long that they know mighty
well and good that nobody except a Britisher is going
to question their blue blood&mdash;and oh my, what good
blueing third-generation money does make. But out
here in God's Country, the marquises of milling and
the barons of beef are still uneasy. Even their pretty
women, after going to the best hair-dressers and
patronizing the best charities, sometimes get scared
lest somebody think they haven't either brains or
breeding.</p>

<p>"So they're nasty to all low pussons like you and
me, to make sure we understand how important they
are. But lands, I know 'em, boy. I'm kept pensioned
up here, out of the way, but I read the social notes in
the papers and I chuckle&mdash;&mdash; When there's a big reception
and I read about Mrs. Vogeland's pearls, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
her beautiful daughter-in-law, I remember how she
used to run a boarding-house for miners&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I guess it's just as shoddy in the East if you
go far enough back. Claire, you're a nice comforting
body, and I hate to say it, but the truth is, your
great-grandfather was an hostler, and made his first
money betting on horses. Now, my, I oughtn't to tell
that. Do you mind, dearie?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit. Isn't it delightful that this is such a
democratic country, with no castes," said Claire.</p>

<p>At this, the first break in the little old lady's undammable
flood, Mrs. Gilson sprang up, yammering,
"The rest of you may stay as long as you like, but
if I'm to be home in time to dress for dinner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I must be going," babbled Saxton.</p>

<p>Milt noted that his lower lip showed white tooth-marks.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that all of them rather ignored
the little old lady for a moment. Milt was apologetically
hinting, "I don't really think Bill and I'd better
come to dinner this evening, Mrs. Gilson. Thanks a
lot but&mdash;&mdash; It's kind of sudden."</p>

<p>Claire again took charge. "Not at all, Milt. Of
course you're coming. It was Eva herself who invited
you. I'm sure she'll be delighted."</p>

<p>"Charmed," said Mrs. Gilson, with the expression
of one who has swallowed castor oil and doubts the
unity of the universe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>There was a lack of ease about the farewells to Aunt
Harriet. As they all turned away she beckoned Milt
and murmured, "Did I raise the dickens? I tried to.
It's the only solace besides smoking that a moral old
lady can allow herself, after she gets to be eighty-two
and begins to doubt everything they used to teach her.
Come and see me, boy. Now get out, and, boy, beat
up Gene Gilson. Don't be scared of his wife's hoity-toity
ways. Just sail in."</p>

<p>"I will," said Milt.</p>

<p>He had one more surprise before he reached the
limousine.</p>

<p>Bill McGolwey, who had sat listening to everything
and scratching his cheek in a puzzled way, seized Milt's
sleeve and rumbled:</p>

<p>"Good-by, old hoss. I'm not going to butt in on
your game and get you in Dutch. Gosh, I never supposed
you had enough class to mingle with elittys like
this gang, but I know when I'm in wrong. You were
too darn decent to kick me out. Do it myself. You're
best friend I ever had and&mdash;&mdash; Good luck, old man!
God bless you!"</p>

<p>Bill was gone, running, stumbling, fleeing past Aunt
Harriet's cottage, off into a sandy hilltop vacancy.
The last Milt saw of him was when, on the skyline,
Bill stopped for a glance back, and seemed to be digging
his knuckles into his eyes.</p>

<p>Then Milt turned resolutely, marched down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
stairs, said to his hosts with a curious quietness,
"Thank you for asking me to dinner, but I'm afraid
I can't come. Claire, will you walk a few blocks with
me?"</p>

<p>During the half minute it had taken to descend the
steps, Milt had reflected, with an intensity which
forgot Bill, that he had been selfish; that he had
thought only of the opinion of these "nice people"
regarding himself, instead of understanding that it
was his duty to save Claire from their enervating
niceness. Not that he phrased it quite in this way.
What he had been muttering was:</p>

<p>"Rotten shame&mdash;me so scared of folks' clothes that
I don't stand up to 'em and keep 'em from smothering
Claire. Lord, it would be awful if she settled down to
being a Mrs. Jeff Saxton. Got to save her&mdash;not for
myself&mdash;for her."</p>

<p>It may have been Aunt Harriet, it may have been
Milt's resolution, but Mrs. Gilson answered almost
meekly, "Well, if you think&mdash;&mdash; Would you like to
walk, Claire?"</p>

<p>As he tramped off with Claire, Milt demanded,
"Glad to escape?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I'm glad you refused dinner. It really
has been wearing, this trial by food."</p>

<p>"This is the last time I'll dare to meet the Gilsons."</p>

<p>"And I'll have to be going back East. I hope the
Gilsons will forgive me, some day."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>"I'm afraid you didn't win them over by Aunt
Hatty!"</p>

<p>"No. They're probably off me for life. Oh, these
horrible social complications&mdash;worse than any real
danger&mdash;fire or earthquake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, these complications&mdash;they don't exist! We
just make 'em, like we make rules for a card game.
What the deuce do we care about the opinions of people
we don't like? And who appointed these people to a
fixed social position? Did the president make Saxton
High Cockalorum of Dress-Suits or something?
Why, these are just folks, the same as kings and coal-heavers.
There's no army we've got to fight. There's
just you and me&mdash;you and I&mdash;and if we stick together,
then we have all society, we <i>are</i> all society!"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, but, Milt dear, I don't want to be an outcast."</p>

<p>"You won't be. In the long run, if you don't take
these aristocrats seriously, they'll be all the more impressed
by you."</p>

<p>"No. That sounds cheering, in stories and these
optimistic editorials in the magazines, but it isn't true.
And you don't know how pleasant it is to be In. I've
always been more or less on the inside, and thought
outsiders dreadful. But&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I don't care! I
don't care! With you&mdash;I'm happy. That's all I know
and all I want to know. I've just grown up. I've
just learned the greatest wisdom&mdash;to know when I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
happy. But, Milt dear&mdash;&mdash; I say this because I love
you. Yes, I do love you. No, don't kiss me. Yes,
it is too&mdash;&mdash; It's <i>far</i> too public. And I want to talk
seriously. You can't have any idea how strong social
distinctions are. Don't despise them just because you
don't know them."</p>

<p>"No. I won't. I'll learn. Probably America will
get into the war. I'll be an engineering officer. I'll
learn this social dope from the college-boy officers.
And I'll come to Brooklyn with shoulder-straps and
bells on and&mdash;&mdash; Will you be waiting?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash; But, Milt! If the war comes, you
must be very careful not to get shot!"</p>

<p>"All right, if, you insist. Good Lord, Claire. I
don't know what put it into my head but&mdash;&mdash; Do you
realize that a miracle has happened? We're no longer
Miss Boltwood and a fellow named Daggett. We
have been, even when we've liked each other, up to
today. Always there's been a kind of fence between
us. We had to explain and defend ourselves and
scrap&mdash;&mdash; But now we're <i>us</i>, and the rest of the
world has disappeared, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And nothing else matters," said Claire.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />
THE BEGINNING OF A STORY</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It</span> was the farewell to Claire and Jeff Saxton, a
picnic in the Cascades, near Snoqualmie Falls&mdash;a
decent and decidedly Milt-less fiesta. Mrs. Gilson was
going to show Claire that they were just as hardy
adventurers as that horrid Daggett person. So she
didn't take the limousine, but merely the seven-passenger
Locomobile with the special body.</p>

<p>They were ever so rough and wild. They had no
maid. The chauffeur was absolutely the only help to
the Gilsons, Claire, Jeff, and the temporarily and ejaculatorily
nature-loving Mrs. Betz in the daring task of
setting out two folding camp-tables, covering them
with a linen cloth, and opening the picnic basket.
Claire had to admit that she wished that she could
steal the picnic basket for Milt. There were vacuum
bottles of hot coffee. There were sandwiches of
anchovy and <i>pat&eacute; de foie gras</i>. There were cream
cakes with almonds hidden in the suave cream, and
there was a chicken salad with huge chunks of pure
white meat wallowing in a sea of mayonnaise.</p>

<p>When the gorging was done and the cigarettes
brought out (the chauffeur passed a spirit lamp),
they stretched on rubber blankets, and groaned a little,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
and spoke well of nature and the delights of roughing
it.</p>

<p>"What is it? What's wrong? They're so&mdash;oh, so
polite. They don't mean what they say and they don't
dare to say what they mean. Is that it?" worried
Claire.</p>

<p>She started. She discovered that she was looking
at a bristle of rope-colored hair and a grin projected
from the shelter of a manzanita bush.</p>

<p>"For the&mdash;&mdash;" she gasped. She was too startled to
be able to decide what was for-the. She spoke judiciously
to Jeff Saxton about Upper Montclair, the
subway, and tennis. She rose to examine the mountains,
strolled away, darted down a gully, and pounced
on Milt Daggett with:</p>

<p>"How in heaven's name&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Found out where you-all were going. Look!
Got a bug! Rented it. Come on! Let's duck! Drive
back with me!" At the end of the gully was a new
Teal bug, shinier than the ancient lost chariot, but
equally gay and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Can't. Like to, but&mdash;&mdash; Be awfully rude to them.
Won't do that&mdash;not more than is good for their souls&mdash;even
for you. Now don't be sulky."</p>

<p>"I won't. Nev' be sulky again, because you're
crazy about me, and I don't have to be sulky."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am, am I! Good heavens, the inconceivable
conceit of the child!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>She turned her back. He darted to her, caught her
hands behind her, kissed her hair, and whispered,
"You are!"</p>

<p>"I am not!"</p>

<p>"Well then, you're not. Lord, you're sweet! Your
hair smells like cinnamon and clean kittens. You'd
rather go bumping off in my flivver than sailing in that
big Loco they've got there."</p>

<p>"Yes," defiantly, "I would, and I'm ashamed of
myself. I'm a throw-back to my horrid ancestor, the
betting hostler."</p>

<p>"Probably. I'm a throw-back to my ancestor the
judge. I'll train you to meet my fine friends."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;upon&mdash;my&mdash;word&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; Oh, do stop
being idiotic. We talk like children. You reduce me
to the rank of a gibbering schoolgirl. And I like it!
It's so&mdash;oh, I don't know&mdash;so darn human, I suppose.
Now hurry&mdash;kiss me, and get out, before they suspect."</p>

<p>"Listen."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I'll accidentally meet your car along the road.
Invite you to ride. All right?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do. Oh, we <i>are</i> two forlorn babes in the
woods! G'-by."</p>

<p>She sauntered back to the picnic, and observed,
"What is that purple flower up on the mountain side?"</p>

<p>The big car was sedately purring back when it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
insulted by an intermediate host of a machine that
came jumping out of a side road. The vulgar driver
hailed them with uncouth howling. The Gilsons'
chauffeur stopped, annoyed.</p>

<p>"Why, hello folks," bawled the social bandit.</p>

<p>"Oh. How do you do," refuted Mrs. Gilson.</p>

<p>Jeff Saxton turned a ripe purple.</p>

<p>"How do you like my new bug, Claire? Awful
little object. But I can make fifty an hour. Come and
try it, Claire, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;&mdash;" Claire was obviously shocked by the
impropriety of the suggestion. She looked at Mrs.
Gilson, who was breathing as though she was just
going under the ether. Claire said doubtfully,
"Well&mdash;&mdash; If you can get me right back to the
house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure," agreed Milt.</p>

<p>When the Loco was gone, Milt drove the bug to
the side of the road, yanked up the emergency brake,
and carefully kissed the girl who was snuggled down
into the absurd low tin-sided seat.</p>

<p>"Do we have to get back soon?" he begged.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care if we never get back. Let's shoot
up into the mountains. Side road. Let's pretend
we're driving across the continent again."</p>

<p>Firs dashing by&mdash;rocks in the sunshine&mdash;clouds
jaunty beyond the inviting mouth of a mountain pass&mdash;even
the ruts and bumps and culverts&mdash;she seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
a part of them all. In the Gilsons' huge cars she had
been shut off from the road, but in this tiny bug, so
close to earth, she recovered the feeling of struggle,
of triumph over difficulties, of freedom unbounded.
And she could be herself, good or bad, ignorant or
wise, with this boy beside her. All of which she
expressed in the most eloquent speech she had ever
uttered, namely:</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Milt</i>&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>And, to herself, "Golly, it's such a relief not to have
to try to be gracious and aphoristic and repartistic
and everything with Jeff."</p>

<p>And, "But I wonder if I am aphoristic and subtle?
I wonder if when she gets the rice-powder off, Claire
isn't a lot more like Milt than she thought?"</p>

<p>And, aloud again, "Oh, this is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yump. It sure is," Milt agreed.</p>

<p>They had turned from a side-road into a side-side-road.
They crossed an upland valley. The fall rains
had flooded a creek till it had cut across the road,
washed through the thin gravel, left across the road a
shallow violent stream. Milt stopped abruptly at its
margin.</p>

<p>"Here's where we turn back, I guess," he sighed.</p>

<p>"Oh no! Can't we get across? It's only a couple
of feet deep, and gravel bottom," insisted the restored
adventurer.</p>

<p>"Yes, but look at the steep bank. Never get up it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>"I don't care. Let's try it! We can woggle around
and dig it out somehow. I bet you two-bits we can,"
said the delicate young woman whom Mrs. Gilson was
protecting.</p>

<p>"All right. In she goes!"</p>

<p>The bug went in&mdash;shot over the bank, dipped down
till the little hood sloped below them as though they
were looping the loop, struck the rushing water with
a splash which hurled yellow drops over Claire's rose
jersey suit, lumbered ahead, struck the farther bank,
pawed at it feebly, rose two inches, slipped back, and
sat there with the gurgling water all around it, turned
into a motor-boat.</p>

<p>"No can do," grunted Milt. "Scared?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Love it! This is a real camp&mdash;the brush
on the bank, and the stream&mdash;listen to it chuckle under
the running-board."</p>

<p>"Do you like to camp with me?"</p>

<p>"Love it."</p>

<p>"Say! Gee! Never thought&mdash;&mdash; Claire! Got
your transportation back East?"</p>

<p>"My ticket? Yes. Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure you can turn it in and get a refund.
So that's all right."</p>

<p>"Are you going to let me in on the secret?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, might's well. I was just wondering&mdash;&mdash; I
don't think much of wasting all our youth waiting&mdash;&mdash; Two-three
years in engineering school, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
maybe going to war, and starting in on an engineering
job, and me lonely as a turkey in a chicken yard,
and you doing the faithful young lady in Brooklyn&mdash;&mdash; I
think perhaps we might get married tomorrow
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, what do you&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to go back to Brooklyn Gilsonses?"</p>

<p>"No, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear, can't we be crazy once, while we're youngsters?"</p>

<p>"Don't bombard me so! Let me think. One must
be practical, even in craziness."</p>

<p>"I am. I have over a thousand dollars from
the garage, and I can work evenings&mdash;as dear
Jeff suggested! We'd have a two-by-four flat&mdash;&mdash; Claire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, let me think. I suppose I could go to the
university, too, and learn a little about food and babies
and building houses and government. I need to go
to school a lot more than you do. Besides auction
and the piano&mdash;which I play very badly&mdash;and clothes
and how to get hold of tickets for successful plays, I
don't know one single thing."</p>

<p>"Will you marry me, tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Well, uh&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Think of Mrs. Gilson's face when she learns it!
And Saxton, and that Mrs. Betz!"</p>

<p>It was to no spoken sentence but to her kiss that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
added, "Providing we ever get the car out of this
river, that is!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear, and all the romantic ways
I was going to propose! I had the best line about
roses and stars and angels and everything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They always use those, but nobody ever proposed
to me in a bug in a flood before! Oh! Milt! Life
is fun! I never knew it till you kidnapped me. If
you kiss me again like that, we'll both topple overboard.
By the way, <i>can</i> we get the car out?"</p>

<p>"I think so, if we put on the chains. We'll have to
take off our shoes and stockings."</p>

<p>Shyly, turning from him a little, she stripped off her
stockings and pumps, while he changed from a flivver-driver
into a young viking, with bare white neck, pale
hair ruffled about his head, trousers rolled up above his
straight knees&mdash;a young seaman of the crew of Eric
the Red.</p>

<p>They swung out on the running-board, now awash.
With slight squeals they dropped into the cold stream.
Dripping, laughing, his clothes clinging to him, he
ducked down behind the car to get the jack under the
back axle, and with the water gurgling about her and
splashing its exhilarating coldness into her face, she
stooped beside him to yank the stiff new chains over
the rear wheels.</p>

<p>They climbed back into the car, joyously raffish as
a pair of gipsies. She wiped a dab of mud from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
cheek, and remarked with an earnestness and a naturalness
which that Jeff Saxton who knew her so well
would never have recognized as hers:</p>

<p>"Gee, I hope the old bird crawls out now."</p>

<p>Milt let in the reverse, raced the engine, started
backward with a burst of muddy water churned up by
the whirling wheels. They struck the bank, sickeningly
hung there for two seconds, began to crawl up,
up, with a feeling that at any second they would drop
back again.</p>

<p>Then, instantly, they were out on the shore and it
was absurd to think that they had ever been boating
down there in the stream. They washed each other's
muddy faces, and laughed a great deal, and rubbed
their legs with their stockings, and resumed something
of a dull and civilized aspect and, singing sentimental
ballads, turned back, found another road, and started
toward a peak.</p>

<p>"I wonder what lies beyond the top of this climb?"
said Claire.</p>

<p>"More mountains, and more, and more, and we're
going to keep on climbing them forever. At dawn,
we'll still be going on. And that's our life."</p>

<p>"Ye-es, providing we can still buy gas."</p>

<p>"Lord, that's so."</p>

<p>"Speaking of which, did you know that I have
a tiny bit of money&mdash;it's about five thousand dollars&mdash;of
my own?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>"But&mdash;&mdash; That makes it impossible. Young tramp
marrying lady of huge wealth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you don't! I've accepted you. Do you think
I'm going to lose the one real playmate I've ever had?
It was so lonely on the Boltwoods' brown stoop till
Milt came along and whistled impertinently and made
the solemn little girl in frills play marbles and&mdash;&mdash; Watch
out for that turn! Heavens, how I have to
look after you! Is there a class in cooking at your university?
No&mdash;do&mdash;not&mdash;kiss&mdash;me&mdash;on&mdash;a&mdash;turn!"</p>

<p>This is the beginning of the story of Milt and
Claire Daggett.</p>

<p>The prelude over and the curtain risen on the actual
play, they face the anxieties and glories of a changing
world. Not without quarrels and barren hours, not
free from ignorance and the discomfort of finding
that between the mountain peaks they must for long
gray periods dwell in the dusty valleys, they yet start
their drama with the distinction of being able to laugh
together, with the advantage of having discovered
that neither Schoenstrom nor Brooklyn Heights is
quite all of life, with the cosmic importance to the
tedious world of believing in the romance that makes
youth unquenchable.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
