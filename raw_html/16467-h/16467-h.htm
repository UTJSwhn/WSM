    <h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>It is perhaps fitting that the series of volumes comprising <i>The Musician's
    Bookshelf</i> should be inaugurated by the present collection of essays. To the
    majority of English readers the name of that strange and forceful personality, Romain
    Rolland, is known only through his magnificent, intimate record of an artist's life
    and aspirations, embracing ten volumes, <i>Jean-Christophe</i>. This is not the place
    in which to discuss that masterpiece. A few biographical facts concerning the author
    may not, however, be out of place here.</p>
    <p>Romain Rolland is forty-eight years old. He was born on January 29, 1866, at
    Clamecy (Ni&egrave;vre), France. He came very early under the influence of Tolstoy
    and Wagner and displayed a remarkable critical faculty. In 1895 (at the age of
    twenty-nine) we find him awarded the coveted Grand Prix of the Acad&eacute;mie
    Fran&ccedil;aise for his work <i>Histoire de l'Op&eacute;ra en Europe avant Lulli et
    Scarlatti</i>, and in the same year he sustained, before the faculty of the
    Sorbonne&mdash;where he now occupies the chair of musical criticism&mdash;a
    remarkable dissertation on <i>The Origin of</i> <i>the Modern Lyrical
    Drama</i>&mdash;his thesis for the Doctorate. This, in reality, is a vehement protest
    against the indifference for the Art of Music which, up to that time, had always been
    displayed by the University. In 1903 he published a remarkable <i>Life of
    Beethoven</i>, followed by a <i>Life of Hugo Wolf</i> in 1905. The present volume,
    together with its companion, <i>Musiciens d'Autrefois</i>, appeared in 1908. Both
    form remarkable essays and reveal a consummate and most intimate knowledge of the
    life and works of our great contemporaries. A just estimate of a composer's work is
    not to be arrived at without a study of his works and of the conditions under which
    these were produced. To take, for instance, the case of but one of the composers
    treated in this volume, Hector Berlioz. No composer has been so misunderstood, so
    vilified as he, simply because those who have written about him, either wilfully or
    through ignorance, have grossly misrepresented him.</p>
    <p>The essay on Berlioz, in the present volume, reveals a true insight into the
    personality of this unfortunate and great artist, and removes any false
    misconceptions which unsympathetic and superficial handling may have engendered.
    Indeed, the same introspective faculty is displayed in all the other essays which
    form this volume, which, it is believed, will prove of the greatest value not only to
    the professional student, but also to the <i>intelligent listener</i>, for whom the
    present series of volumes has been primarily planned. We hear much, nowadays, of the
    value of "Musical Appreciation." It is high time that something was done to educate
    our audiences and to dispel the hitherto prevalent fallacy that Music need not be
    regarded seriously. We do not want more creative artists, more executants; the world
    is full of them&mdash;good, bad and indifferent&mdash;but we <i>do</i> want more
    <i>intelligent listeners</i>.</p>
    <p>I do not think it is an exaggeration to assert that the majority of listeners at a
    high-class concert or recital are absolutely bored. How can it be otherwise, when the
    composers represented are mere names to them? Why should the general public
    appreciate a Bach fugue, an intricate symphony or a piece of chamber-music? Do we
    professional musicians appreciate the technique of a wonderful piece of sculpture, of
    an equally wonderful feat of engineering or even of a miraculous surgical operation?
    It may be argued that an analogy between sculpture, engineering, surgery and music is
    absurd, because the three former do not appeal to the masses in the same manner as
    music does. Precisely: it is because of this universal appeal on the part of music
    that the public should be educated to <i>listen</i> to <i>good</i> music; that they
    should be given, in a general way, a chance to acquaint themselves with the laws underlying the
    "Beautiful in Music" and should be shown the demands which a right appreciation of
    the Art makes upon the Intellect and the Emotions.</p>
    <p>And, surely, such a "desideratum" may best be effected by a careful perusal of the
    manuals to be included in the present series. It is incontestable that the reader of
    the following pages&mdash;apart from a knowledge of the various musical forms, of
    orchestration, etc.&mdash;all of which will be duly treated in successive
    volumes&mdash;will be in a better position to appreciate the works of the several
    composers to which he may be privileged to listen. The last essay, especially, will
    be read with interest to-day, when we may hope to look forward to a cessation of
    race-hatred and distrust, and to what a writer in the <i>Musical Times</i>
    (September, 1914) has called, "a new sense of the emotional solidarity of mankind.
    From that sense alone," he adds, "can the real music of the future be born."</p>

    <hr style="width: 65%;" />
    <h3><a id="BERLIOZ" name='BERLIOZ'></a>BERLIOZ</h3>
    <h3>I</h3>
    <p>It may seem a paradox to say that no musician is so little known as Berlioz. The
    world thinks it knows him. A noisy fame surrounds his person and his work. Musical
    Europe has celebrated his centenary. Germany disputes with France the glory of having
    nurtured and shaped his genius. Russia, whose triumphal reception consoled him for
    the indifference and enmity of Paris,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
    class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has said, through the voice of Balakirew,
    that he was "the only musician France possessed." His chief compositions are often
    played at concerts; and some of them have the rare quality of appealing both to the
    cultured and the crowd; a few have even reached great popularity. Works have been
    dedicated to him, and he himself has been described and criticised by many writers.
    He is popular even to his face; for his face, like his music, was so striking and
    singular that it seemed to show you his character at a glance. No clouds hide his
    mind and its creations, which, unlike Wagner's, need no initia<a name="page2" id="page2"/>tion to be understood; they
    seem to have no hidden meaning, no subtle mystery; one is instantly their friend or
    their enemy, for the first impression is a lasting one.</p>
    <p>That is the worst of it; people imagine that they understand Berlioz with so very
    little trouble. Obscurity of meaning may harm an artist less than a seeming
    transparency; to be shrouded in mist may mean remaining long misunderstood, but those
    who wish to understand will at least be thorough in their search for the truth. It is
    not always realised how depth and complexity may exist in a work of clear design and
    strong contrasts&mdash;in the obvious genius of some great Italian of the Renaissance
    as much as in the troubled heart of a Rembrandt and the twilight of the North.</p>
    <p>That is the first pitfall; but there are many more that will beset us in the
    attempt to understand Berlioz. To get at the man himself one must break down a wall
    of prejudice and pedantry, of convention and intellectual snobbery. In short, one
    must shake off nearly all current ideas about his work if one wishes to extricate it
    from the dust that has drifted about it for half a century.</p>
    <p>Above all, one must not make the mistake of contrasting Berlioz with Wagner,
    either by sacrificing Berlioz to that Germanic Odin, or by forcibly trying to
    reconcile one to the other. For there are some who condemn Berlioz in the name of
    Wagner's theories; and others who, not liking the sacrifice, seek to make him a
    forerunner of Wagner, or kind of elder brother, whose mission was to clear a way and
    <a name="page3" id="page3"/>prepare a road for a
    genius greater than his own. Nothing is falser. To understand Berlioz one must shake
    off the hypnotic influence of Bayreuth. Though Wagner may have learnt something from
    Berlioz, the two composers have nothing in common; their genius and their art are
    absolutely opposed; each one has ploughed his furrow in a different field.</p>
    <p>The Classical misunderstanding is quite as dangerous. By that I mean the clinging
    to superstitions of the past, and the pedantic desire to enclose art within narrow
    limits, which still flourish among critics. Who has not met these censors of music?
    They will tell you with solid complacence how far music may go, and where it must
    stop, and what it may express and what it must not. They are not always musicians
    themselves. But what of that? Do they not lean on the example of the past? The past!
    a handful of works that they themselves hardly understand. Meanwhile, music, by its
    unceasing growth, gives the lie to their theories, and breaks down these weak
    barriers. But they do not see it, do not wish to see it; since they cannot advance
    themselves, they deny progress. Critics of this kind do not think favourably of
    Berlioz's dramatic and descriptive symphonies. How should they appreciate the boldest
    musical achievement of the nineteenth century? These dreadful pedants and zealous
    defenders of an art that they only understand after it has ceased to live are the
    worst enemies of unfettered genius, and may do more harm than a whole army of
    ignorant people. For in a country like ours, where musical education <a name="page4" id="page4"/>is poor, timidity is great
    in the presence of a strong, but only half-understood, tradition; and anyone who has
    the boldness to break away from it is condemned without judgment. I doubt if Berlioz
    would have obtained any consideration at all from lovers of classical music in France
    if he had not found allies in that country of classical music, Germany&mdash;"the
    oracle of Delphi," "Germania alma parens,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
    class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as he called her. Some of the young
    German school found inspiration in Berlioz. The dramatic symphony that he created
    flourished in its German form under Liszt; the most eminent German composer of
    to-day, Richard Strauss, came under his influence; and Felix Weingartner, who with
    Charles Malherbe edited Berlioz's complete works, was bold enough to write, "In spite
    of Wagner and Liszt, we should not be where we are if Berlioz had not lived." This
    unexpected support, coming from a country of traditions, has thrown the partisans of
    Classic tradition into confusion, and rallied Berlioz's friends.</p>
    <p>But here is a new danger. Though it is natural that Germany, more musical than
    France, should recognise the grandeur and originality of Berlioz's music before
    France, it is doubtful whether the German nature could ever fully understand a soul
    so French in its essence. It is, perhaps, what is exterior in Berlioz, his positive
    originality, that the Germans appreciate. They prefer the <i>Requiem</i> to
    <i>Rom&eacute;o</i>. A Richard Strauss would be attracted by an almost insignificant
    work like the <a name="page5"
    id="page5"/><i>Ouverture du roi Lear</i>; a Weingartner would single out for notice
    works like the <i>Symphonic fantastique</i> and <i>Harold</i>, and exaggerate their
    importance. But they do not feel what is intimate in him. Wagner said over the tomb
    of Weber, "England does you justice, France admires you, but only Germany loves you;
    you are of her own being, a glorious day of her life, a warm drop of her blood, a
    part of her heart...." One might adapt his words to Berlioz; it is as difficult for a
    German really to love Berlioz as it is for a Frenchman to love Wagner or Weber. One
    must, therefore, be careful about accepting unreservedly the judgment of Germany on
    Berlioz; for in that would lie the danger of a new misunderstanding. You see how both
    the followers and opponents of Berlioz hinder us from getting at the truth. Let us
    dismiss them.</p>
    <p>Have we now come to the end of our difficulties? Not yet; for Berlioz is the most
    illusive of men, and no one has helped more than he to mislead people in their
    estimate of him. We know how much he has written about music and about his own life,
    and what wit and understanding he shows in his shrewd criticisms and charming
    <i>M&eacute;moires</i>.
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
 <a name="page6"
    id="page6"/>One would think that such an imaginative and skilful
    writer, accustomed in his profession of critic to express every shade of feeling,
    would be able to tell us more exactly his ideas of art than a Beethoven or a Mozart.
    But it is not so. As too much light may blind the vision, so too much intellect may
    hinder the understanding. Berlioz's mind spent itself in details; it reflected light
    from too many facets, and did not focus itself in one strong beam which would have
    made known his power. He did not know how to dominate either his life or his work; he
    did not even try to dominate them. He was the incarnation of romantic genius, an
    unrestrained force, unconscious of the road he trod. I would not go so far as to say
    that he did not understand himself, but there are certainly times when he is past
    understanding himself. He allows himself to drift where chance will take him,<a
    name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"
    class="fnanchor">[4]</a> like an old Scandinavian pirate laid at the bottom of his
    boat, staring up at the sky; and he dreams and groans and laughs and gives himself up
    to his feverish delusions. He lived with his emotions as uncertainly as he lived with
    his art. In his music, as in his criticisms of music, he often contradicts himself,
    hesitates, and turns back; he is not sure either of his feelings or his thoughts. He
    has poetry in his soul, and strives to write operas; but his admiration wavers
    between Gluck and Meyerbeer. He has a popular genius, but despises the people. He is
    a daring musical revolutionary, <a name="page7"
    id="page7"/>but he allows the control of this musical movement to be
    taken from him by anyone who wishes to have it. Worse than that: he disowns the
    movement, turns his back upon the future, and throws himself again into the past. For
    what reason? Very often he does not know. Passion, bitterness, caprice, wounded
    pride&mdash;these have more influence with him than the serious things of life. He is
    a man at war with himself.</p>
    <p>Then contrast Berlioz with Wagner. Wagner, too, was stirred by violent passions,
    but he was always master of himself, and his reason remained unshaken by the storms
    of his heart or those of the world, by the torments of love or the strife of
    political revolutions. He made his experiences and even his errors serve his art; he
    wrote about his theories before he put them into practice; and he only launched out
    when he was sure of himself, and when the way lay clear before him. And think how
    much Wagner owes to this written expression of his aims and the magnetic attraction
    of his arguments. It was his prose works that fascinated the King of Bavaria before
    he had heard his music; and for many others also they have been the key to that
    music. I remember being impressed by Wagner's ideas when I only half understood his
    art; and when one of his compositions puzzled me, my confidence was not shaken, for I
    was sure that the genius who was so convincing in his reasoning would not blunder;
    and that if his music baffled me, it was I who was at fault. Wagner was really his
    own best friend, his own most trusty champion; and his was the <a name="page8" id="page8"/>guiding hand that led one
    through the thick forest and over the rugged crags of his work.</p>
    <p>Not only do you get no help from Berlioz in this way, but he is the first to lead
    you astray and wander with you in the paths of error. To understand his genius you
    must seize hold of it unaided. His genius was really great, but, as I shall try to
    show you, it lay at the mercy of a weak character.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Everything about Berlioz was misleading, even his appearance. In legendary
    portraits he appears as a dark southerner with black hair and sparkling eyes. But he
    was really very fair and had blue eyes,<a name="FNanchor_5_5"
    id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and Joseph
    d'Ortigue tells us they were deep-set and piercing, though sometimes clouded by
    melancholy or languor.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He had a broad forehead furrowed with
    wrinkles by the time he was thirty, and a thick mane of hair, or, as E.
    Legouv&eacute; puts it, "a large umbrella of hair, projecting like a movable awning
    over the beak of a bird of prey."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page9" id="page9"/>His mouth was well
    cut, with lips compressed and puckered at the corners in a severe fold, and his chin
    was prominent. He had a deep voice,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> but his speech was halting and often
    tremulous with emotion; he would speak passionately of what interested him, and at
    times be effusive in manner, but more often he was ungracious and reserved. He was of
    medium height, rather thin and angular in figure, and when seated he seemed much
    taller than he really was.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He was very restless, and inherited
    from his native land, Dauphin&eacute;, the mountaineer's passion for walking and
    climbing, and the love of a vagabond life, which remained with him nearly to his
    death.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
    class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He had an iron constitution, but he wrecked it by privation
    and excess, by his walks in the rain, and by sleeping out-of-doors in all weathers,
    even when there was snow on the ground.<a name="FNanchor_11_11"
    id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
    <p>But in this strong and athletic frame lived a feverish and sickly soul that was
    dominated and tormented by a morbid craving for love and sympathy: "that imperative
    need of love which is killing me...."<a name="FNanchor_12_12"
    id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> To love,
    to be loved&mdash;he would give up all for that.</p>
    <p><a name="page10" id="page10"/>But his love
    was that of a youth who lives in dreams; it was never the strong, clear-eyed passion
    of a man who has faced the realities of life, and who sees the defects as well as the
    charms of the woman he loves, Berlioz was in love with love, and lost himself among
    visions and sentimental shadows. To the end of his life he remained "a poor little
    child worn out by a love that was beyond him."<a name="FNanchor_13_13"
    id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But this
    man who lived so wild and adventurous a life expressed his passions with delicacy;
    and one finds an almost girlish purity in the immortal love passages of <i>Les
    Troyens</i> or the "<i>nuit sereine"</i> of <i>Rom&eacute;o et Juliette</i>. And
    compare this Virgilian affection with Wagner's sensual raptures. Does it mean that
    Berlioz could not love as well as Wagner? We only know that Berlioz's life was made
    up of love and its torments. The theme of a touching passage in the Introduction of
    the <i>Symphonic fantastique</i> has been recently identified by M. Julien Tiersot,
    in his interesting book,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> with a romance composed by Berlioz
    at the age of twelve, when he loved a girl of eighteen "with large eyes and pink
    shoes"&mdash;Estelle, <i>Stella mentis, Stella matutina</i>. These
    words&mdash;perhaps the saddest he ever wrote&mdash;might serve as an emblem of his
    life, a life that was a prey to love and melancholy, doomed to wringing of the heart
    and awful loneliness; a life lived in a hollow world, among worries that chilled the
    blood; a life that was distasteful and had no solace to offer him in its end.<a
    name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"
    class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He has himself described this terrible "<i>mal de
    l'isolement</i>,"<a name="page11" id="page11"/>
    which pursued him all his life, vividly and minutely.<a name="FNanchor_16_16"
    id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He was
    doomed to suffering, or, what was worse, to make others suffer.</p>
    <p><a name="page12" id="page12"/>Who does not
    know his passion for Henrietta Smithson? It was a sad story. He fell in love with an
    English actress who played Juliet (Was it she or Juliet whom he loved?). He caught
    but a glance of her, and it was all over with him. He cried out, "Ah, I am lost!" He
    desired her; she repulsed him. He lived in a delirium of suffering and passion; he
    wandered about for days and nights like a madman, up and down Paris and its
    neighbourhood, without purpose or rest or relief, until sleep overcame him wherever
    it found him&mdash;among the sheaves in a field near Villejuif, in a meadow near
    Sceaux, on the bank of the frozen Seine near Neuilly, in the snow, and once on a
    table in the Caf&eacute; Cardinal, where he slept for five hours, to the great alarm
    of the waiters, who thought he was dead.<a name="FNanchor_17_17"
    id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
    Meanwhile, he was told slanderous gossip about Henrietta, which he readily believed.
    Then he despised her, and dishonoured her publicly in his <i>Symphonie
    fantastique</i>, paying homage in his bitter resentment to Camille Moke, a pianist,
    to whom he lost his heart without delay.</p>
    <p>After a time Henrietta reappeared. She had now lost her youth and her power; her
    beauty was waning, and she was in debt. Berlioz's passion was at once rekindled. This
    time Henrietta accepted his advances. He made alterations in his symphony, and
    offered it to her in homage of his love. He won her, and married her, with fourteen
    thousand francs debt. He had captured his dream&mdash;Juliet! Ophelia! What was she
    really? A charming Englishwoman, cold, loyal, and sober-minded, who understood
    nothing of his passion; and who, from the time she became his wife, loved him
    jealously and sincerely, and thought to confine him within the narrow world of
    domestic life. But his affections became restive, and he lost his heart to a Spanish
    actress (it was always an actress, a virtuoso, or a part) and left poor Ophelia, and
    went off with Marie Recio, the In&egrave;s of <i>Favorite</i>, the page of <i>Comte
    Ory</i>&mdash;a practical, hard<a name="page13"
    id="page13"/>headed woman, an indifferent singer with a mania for
    singing. The haughty Berlioz was forced to fawn upon the directors of the theatre in
    order to get her parts, to write flattering notices in praise of her talents, and
    even to let her make his own melodies discordant at the concerts he arranged.<a
    name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"
    class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It would all be dreadfully ridiculous if this weakness of
    character had not brought tragedy in its train.</p>
    <p>So the one he really loved, and who always loved him, remained alone, without
    friends, in Paris, where she was a stranger. She drooped in silence and pined slowly
    away, bedridden, paralysed, and unable to speak during eight years of suffering.
    Berlioz suffered too, for he loved her still and was torn with pity&mdash;"pity, the
    most painful of all emotions."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But of what use was this pity? He
    left Henrietta to suffer alone and to die just the same. And, what was worse, as we
    learn from Legouv&eacute;, he let his mistress, the odious Recio, make a scene before
    poor Henrietta.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Recio told him of it and boasted
    about what she had done.</p>
    <p><a name="page14" id="page14"/>And Berlioz did
    nothing&mdash;"How could I? I love her."</p>
    <p>One would be hard upon such a man if one was not disarmed by his own sufferings.
    But let us go on. I should have liked to pass over these traits, but I have no right
    to; I must show you the extraordinary feebleness of the man's character. "Man's
    character," did I say? No, it was the character of a woman without a will, the victim
    of her nerves.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Such people are destined to unhappiness; and if they make other people suffer, one
    may be sure that it is only half of what they suffer themselves. They have a peculiar
    gift for attracting and gathering <a name="page15"
    id="page15"/>up trouble; they savour sorrow like wine, and do not lose
    a drop of it. Life seemed desirous that Berlioz should be steeped in suffering; and
    his misfortunes were so real that it would be unnecessary to add to them any
    exaggerations that history has handed down to us.</p>
    <p>People find fault with Berlioz's continual complaints; and I, too, find in them a
    lack of virility and almost a lack of dignity. To all appearances, he had far fewer
    material reasons for unhappiness than&mdash;I won't say Beethoven&mdash;Wagner and
    other great men, past, present, and future. When thirty-five years old he had
    achieved glory; and Paganini proclaimed him Beethoven's successor. What more could he
    want? He was discussed by the public, disparaged by a Scudo and an Adolphus Adam, and
    the theatre only opened its doors to him with difficulty. It was really splendid!</p>
    <p>But a careful examination of facts, such as that made by M. Julien Tiersot, shows
    the stifling mediocrity and hardship of his life. There were, first of all, his
    material cares. When thirty-six years old "Beethoven's successor" had a fixed salary
    of fifteen hundred francs as assistant keeper of the Conservatoire Library, and not
    quite as much for his contributions to the <i>Debits</i>-contributions which
    exasperated and humiliated him, and were one of the crosses of his life, as they
    obliged him to speak anything but the truth.<a name="FNanchor_22_22"
    id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page16" id="page16"/>That made a
    total of three thousand francs, hardly gained on which he had to keep a wife and
    child&mdash;"<i>m&ecirc;me deux</i>," as M. Tiersot says. He attempted a festival at
    the Opera; the result was three hundred and sixty francs loss. He organised a
    festival at the 1844 Exhibition; the receipts were thirty-two thousand francs, out of
    which he got eight hundred francs. He had the <i>Damnation de Faust</i> performed; no
    one came to it, and he was ruined. Things went better in Russia; but the manager who
    brought him to England became bankrupt. He was haunted by thoughts of rents and
    doctors' bills. Towards the end of his life his financial affairs mended a little,
    and a year before his death he uttered these sad words: "I suffer a great deal, but I
    do not want to die now&mdash;I have enough to live upon."</p>
    <p>One of the most tragic episodes of his life is that of the symphony which he did
    not write because of his poverty. One wonders why the page that finishes his
    <i>M&eacute;moires</i> is not better known, for it touches the depths of human
    suffering.</p>
    <p>At the time when his wife's health was causing him most anxiety, there came to him
    one night an inspiration for a symphony. The first part of it&mdash;an allegro in
    two-four time in A minor&mdash;was ringing in his head. He got up and began to write,
    and then he thought,</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"If I begin this bit, I shall have to write the whole symphony. It will be a big
      thing, and I shall have to spend three or four months over it. That means I shall
      write no more articles and earn no money. And when the symphony is finished<a name="page17" id="page17"/>I shall not be able to
      resist the temptation of having it copied (which will mean an expense of a thousand
      or twelve hundred francs), and then of having it played. I shall give a concert,
      and the receipts will barely cover half the cost. I shall lose what I have not got;
      the poor invalid will lack necessities; and I shall be able to pay neither my
      personal expenses nor my son's fees when he goes on board ship.... These thoughts
      made me shudder, and I threw down my pen, saying, 'Bah! to-morrow I shall have
      forgotten the symphony.' The next night I heard the allegro clearly, and seemed to
      see it written down. I was filled with feverish agitation; I sang the theme; I was
      going to get up ... but the reflections of the day before restrained me; I steeled
      myself against the temptation, and clung to the thought of forgetting it. At last I
      went to sleep; and the next day, on waking, all remembrance of it had, indeed, gone
      for ever."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>That page makes one shudder. Suicide is less distressing. Neither Beethoven nor
    Wagner suffered such tortures. What would Wagner have done on a like occasion? He
    would have written the symphony without doubt&mdash;and he would have been right. But
    poor Berlioz, who was weak enough to sacrifice his duty to love, was, alas! also
    heroic enough to sacrifice his genius to duty.<a name="FNanchor_24_24"
    id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><a name="page18" id="page18"/></p>
    <p>And in spite of all this material misery and the sorrow of being misunderstood,
    people speak of the glory he enjoyed. What did his compeers think of him&mdash;at
    least, those who called themselves such? He knew that Mendelssohn, whom he loved and
    esteemed, and who styled himself his "good friend," despised him and did not
    recognise his genius.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The large-hearted Schumann, who was,
    with the exception of Liszt,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the only person who intuitively felt
    his greatness, admitted that he used sometimes to wonder if he ought to be looked
    upon as "a genius or a musical adventurer."<a name="FNanchor_27_27"
    id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page19" id="page19"/>Wagner, who
    treated his symphonies with scorn before he had even read them,<a
    name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28"
    class="fnanchor">[28]</a> who certainly understood his genius, and who deliberately
    ignored him, threw himself into Berlioz's arms when he met him in London in 1855. "He
    embraced him with fervour, and wept; and hardly had he left him when <i>The Musical
    World</i> published passages from his book, <i>Oper und Drama</i>, where he pulls
    Berlioz to pieces mercilessly."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> In France, the young Gounod, <i>doli
    fabricator Epeus</i>, as Berlioz called him, lavished flattering words upon him, but
    spent his time in finding fault with his compositions,<a name="FNanchor_30_30"
    id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> or in
    trying to supplant him at the theatre. At the Opera he was passed over in favour of a
    Prince Poniatowski.</p>
    <p>He presented himself three times at the Academy, and was beaten the first time by
    Onslow, the second time by Clapisson, and the third time he conquered by a majority
    of one vote against Panseron, Vogel, Leborne, and others, including, as always,
    Gounod. He died before the <i>Damnation de Faust</i> was appreciated in France,
    although it was the most remarkable musical composition France had produced. They
    hissed its performance? Not at all; "they were merely indifferent"&mdash;it is
    Berlioz who tells us this. It passed unnoticed. He died before he had seen <i>Les
    Troyens</i> played in its entirety, though it <a name="page20"
    id="page20"/>was one of the noblest works of the French lyric theatre
    that had been composed since the death of Gluck.<a name="FNanchor_31_31"
    id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But there
    is no need to be astonished. To hear these works to-day one must go to Germany. And
    although the dramatic work of Berlioz has found its Bayreuth&mdash;thanks to Mottl,
    to Karlsruhe and Munich&mdash;and the marvellous <i>Benvenuto Cellini</i> has been
    played in twenty German towns,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and regarded as a masterpiece by
    Weingartner and Richard Strauss, what manager of a French theatre would think of
    producing such works?</p>
    <p>But this is not all. What was the bitterness of failure compared with the great
    anguish of death? Berlioz saw all those he loved die one after the other: his father,
    his mother, Henrietta Smithson, Marie Recio. Then only his son Louis remained.</p>
    <p><a name="page21" id="page21"/>He was the
    captain of a merchant vessel; a clever, good-hearted boy, but restless and nervous,
    irresolute and unhappy, like his father. "He has the misfortune to resemble me in
    everything," said Berlioz; "and we love each other like a couple of twins."<a
    name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33"
    class="fnanchor">[33]</a> "Ah, my poor Louis," he wrote to him, "what should I do
    without you?" A few months afterwards he learnt that Louis had died in far-away
    seas.</p>
    <p>He was now alone.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> There were no more friendly voices;
    all that he heard was a hideous duet between loneliness and weariness, sung in his
    ear during the bustle of the day and in the silence of the night.<a
    name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35"
    class="fnanchor">[35]</a> He was wasted with disease. In 1856, at Weimar, following
    great fatigue, he was seized with an internal malady. It began with great mental
    distress; he used to sleep in the streets. He suffered constantly; he was like "a
    tree without leaves, streaming with rain." At the end of 1861, the disease was in an
    acute stage. He had attacks of pain sometimes lasting thirty hours, during which he
    would writhe in agony in his bed. "I live in the midst of my physical pain,
    overwhelmed with weariness. Death is very slow."<a name="FNanchor_36_36"
    id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page22" id="page22"/>Worst of all,
    in the heart of his misery, there was nothing that comforted him. He believed in
    nothing&mdash;neither in God nor immortality.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"I have no faith.... I hate all philosophy and everything that resembles it,

    <p>And yet he fears the death he invites. It is the strongest, the bitterest, the
    truest feeling he has. No musician since old Roland de Lassus has feared it with that
    intensity. Do you remember Herod's sleepless nights in <i>L'Enfance du Christ</i>, or
    Faust's soliloquy, or the anguish of Cassandra, or the burial of<a name="page24" id="page24"/>Juliette?&mdash;through
    all this you will find the whispered fear of annihilation. The wretched man was
    haunted by this fear, as a letter published by M. Julien Tiersot shows:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"My favourite walk, especially when it is raining, really raining in torrents,
      is the cemetery of Montmartre, which is near my house. I often go there; there is
      much that draws me to it. The day before yesterday I passed two hours in the
      cemetery; I found a comfortable seat on a costly tomb, and I went to sleep....
      Paris is to me a cemetery and her pavements are tomb-stones. Everywhere are
      memories of friends or enemies that are dead.... I do nothing but suffer unceasing
      pain and unspeakable weariness. I wonder night and day if I shall die in great pain
      or with little of it&mdash;I am not foolish enough to hope to die without any pain

    <p>His music is like these mournful words; it is perhaps even more terrible, more
    gloomy, for it breathes death.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> What a contrast: a soul greedy of
    life and preyed upon by death. It is this that makes his life such an awful tragedy.
    When Wagner met Berlioz he heaved a sigh of relief&mdash;he had at last found a man
    more unhappy than himself.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a

    name="page25" id="page25"/></p>
    <p>On the threshold of death he turned in despair to the one ray of light left
    him&mdash;<i>Stella montis</i>, the inspiration of his childish love; Estelle, now
    old, a grandmother, withered by age and grief. He made a pilgrimage to Meylan, near
    Grenoble, to see her. He was then sixty-one years old and she was nearly seventy.
    "The past! the past! O Time! Nevermore! Nevermore!"<a name="FNanchor_47_47"
    id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
    <p>Nevertheless, he loved her, and loved her desperately. How pathetic it is. One has
    little inclination to smile when one sees the depths of that desolate heart. Do you
    think he did not see, as clearly as you or I would see, the wrinkled old face, the
    indifference of age, the "<i>triste raison</i>," in her he idealised? Remember, he
    was the most ironical of men. But he did not wish to see these things, he wished to
    cling to a little love, which would help him to live in the wilderness of life.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"There is nothing real in this world but that which lives in the heart.... My

      I should die in this hell of a Paris if she did not allow me to write to her, and

    <p>Such was the unhappy and irresolute heart that found itself united to one of the
    most daring geniuses in the world. It is a striking example of the difference that
    may exist between genius and greatness&mdash;for the two words are not synonymous.
    When one speaks of greatness, one speaks of greatness of soul, nobility of character,
    firmness of will, and, above all, balance of mind. I can understand how people deny
    the existence of these qualities in Berlioz; but to deny his musical genius, or to
    cavil about his wonderful power&mdash;and that is what they do daily in
    Paris&mdash;is lamentable and ridiculous. Whether he attracts one or not, a
    thimbleful of some of his work, a single part in one of his works, a little bit of
    the <i>Fantastique</i> or the overture of <i>Benvenuto</i>, reveal more
    genius&mdash;I am not afraid to say it&mdash;than all the French music of his
    century. I can understand people arguing about him in a country that produced
    Beethoven and Bach; but with us in France, who can we set up against him? Gluck and
    C&eacute;sar Franck were much greater men, but they were never geniuses of his
    stature. If genius is a creative force, I cannot find more than four or five geniuses
    in the world who rank above him. When I have named Beethoven, Mozart, Bach,<a name="page29" id="page29"/>H&auml;ndel, and Wagner,
    I do not know who else is superior to Berlioz; I do not even know who is his
    equal.</p>
    <p>He is not only a musician, he is music itself. He does not command his familiar
    spirit, he is its slave. Those who know his writings know how he was simply possessed
    and exhausted by his musical emotions. They were really fits of ecstasy or
    convulsions. At first "there was feverish excitement; the veins beat violently and
    tears flowed freely. Then came spasmodic contractions of the muscles, total numbness
    of the feet and hands, and partial paralysis of the nerves of sight and hearing; he
    saw nothing, heard nothing; he was giddy and half faint." And in the case of music
    that displeased him, he suffered, on the contrary, from "a painful sense of bodily
    disquiet and even from nausea."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
    <p>The possession that music held over his nature shows itself clearly in the sudden
    outbreak of his genius.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> His family opposed the idea of his
    becoming a musician; and until he was twenty-two or twenty-three years old his weak
    will sulkily gave way to their wishes. In obedience to his father he began his
    studies in medicine at Paris. One evening he heard <i>Les Dana&iuml;des</i> of
    Salieri. It came upon him like a thunderclap. He ran to the Conservatoire library and
    read Gluck's scores.</p>
    <p><a name="page30" id="page30"/>He forgot to
    eat and drink; he was like a man in a frenzy. A performance of <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en
    Tauride</i> finished him. He studied under Lesueur and then at the Conservatoire. The
    following year, 1827, he composed <i>Les Francs-Juges</i>; two years afterwards the
    <i>Huit sc&egrave;nes de Faust</i>, which was the nucleus of the future
    <i>Damnation</i>;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> three years afterwards, the
    <i>Symphonie fantastique</i> (commenced in 1830).<a name="FNanchor_57_57"
    id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> And he
    had not yet got the <i>Prix de Rome</i>! Add to this that in 1828 he had already
    ideas for <i>Rom&eacute;o et Juliette</i>, and that he had written a part of
    <i>Lelio</i> in 1829. Can one find elsewhere a more dazzling musical debut? Compare
    that of Wagner who, at the same age, was shyly writing <i>Les F&eacute;es,
    D&eacute;fense d'aimer</i>, and <i>Rienzi</i>.</p>
    <p>He wrote them at the same age, but ten years later; for <i>Les F&eacute;es</i>
    appeared in 1833, when Berlioz had already written the <i>Fantastique</i>, the
    <i>Huit sc&egrave;nes de Faust, Lelio</i>, and <i>Harold; Rienzi</i> was only played
    in 1842, after <i>Benvenuto</i> (1835), <i>Le Requiem</i> (1837), <i>Rom&eacute;o</i>
    (1839), <i>La Symphonie fun&egrave;bre et triomphale</i> (1840)&mdash;that is to say,
    when <a name="page31" id="page31"/>Berlioz had
    finished all his great works, and after he had achieved his musical revolution. And
    that revolution was effected alone, without a model, without a guide. What could he
    have heard beyond the operas of Gluck and Spontini while he was at the Conservatoire?
    At the time when he composed the <i>Ouverture des Francs-Juges</i> even the name of
    Weber was unknown to him,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and of Beethoven's compositions he
    had only heard an <i>andante</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
    <p>Truly, he is a miracle and the most startling phenomenon in the history of
    nineteenth-century music. His audacious power dominates all his age; and in the face
    of such a genius, who would not follow Paganini's example, and hail him as
    Beethoven's only successor?<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Who does not see what a poor figure
    the young Wagner cut at that time, working away in laborious and self-satisfied
    mediocrity? But Wagner soon made up for lost ground; for he knew what he wanted, and
    he wanted it obstinately.</p>
    <p>The zenith of Berlioz's genius was reached, when he was thirty-five years old,
    with the <i>Requiem</i> and <i>Rom&eacute;o</i>. They are his two most important
    works, and are two works about which one may feel very differently. For my part, I am
    very fond of the <a name="page32" id="page32"/>
    one, and I dislike the other; but both of them open up two great new roads in art,
    and both are placed like two gigantic arches on the triumphal way of the revolution
    that Berlioz started. I will return to the subject of these works later.</p>
    <p>But Berlioz was already getting old. His daily cares and stormy domestic life,<a
    name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61"
    class="fnanchor">[61]</a> his disappointments and passions, his commonplace and often
    degrading work, soon wore him out and, finally, exhausted his power. "Would you
    believe it?" he wrote to his friend Ferrand, "that which used to stir me to
    transports of musical passion now fills me with indifference, or even disdain. I feel
    as if I were descending a mountain at a great rate. Life is so short; I notice that
    thoughts of the end have been with me for some time past." In 1848, at forty-five
    years old, he wrote in his <i>M&eacute;moires</i>: "I find myself so old and tired
    and lacking inspiration." At forty-five years old, Wagner had patiently worked out
    his theories and was feeling his power; at forty-five he was writing <i>Tristan</i>
    and <i>The Music of the Future</i>. Abused by critics, unknown to the public, "he
    remained calm, in the belief that he would be master of the musical world in fifty
    years' time."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>
    <p>Berlioz was disheartened. Life had conquered him. It was not that he had lost any
    of his artistic mastery; on the contrary, his compositions became more and more
    finished; and nothing in his earlier work attained the pure beauty of some of the
    pages of <i>L'Enfance du Christ</i> (1850-4), or of <i>Les Troyens</i><a name="page33" id="page33"/>(1855-63). But he was
    losing his power; and his intense feeling, his revolutionary ideas, and his
    inspiration (which in his youth had taken the place of the confidence he lacked) were
    failing him. He now lived on the past&mdash;the <i>Huit sc&egrave;nes de Faust</i>
    (1828) held the germs of <i>La Damnation de Faust</i> (1846); since 1833, he had been
    thinking of <i>B&eacute;atrice et B&eacute;n&eacute;dict</i> (1862); the ideas in
    <i>Les Troyens</i> were inspired by his childish worship of Virgil, and had been with
    him all his life. But with what difficulty he now finished his task! He had only
    taken seven months to write <i>Rom&eacute;o</i>, and "on account of not being able to
    write the <i>Requiem</i> fast enough, he had adopted a kind of musical shorthand";<a
    name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63"
    class="fnanchor">[63]</a> but he took seven or eight years to write <i>Les
    Troyens</i>, alternating between moods of enthusiasm and disgust, and feeling
    indifference and doubt about his work. He groped his way hesitatingly and unsteadily;
    he hardly understood what he was doing. He admired the more mediocre pages of his
    work: the scene of the Laocoon, the finale of the last act of the <i>Les Troyens
    &agrave; Troie</i>, the last scene with Aeneas in <i>Les Troyens &agrave;
    Carthage</i>.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The empty pomposities of Spontini
    mingle with the loftiest conceptions. One might say that his genius became a stranger
    to him: it was the mechanical work of <a name="page34"
    id="page34"/>an unconscious force, like "stalactites in a dripping
    grotto." He had no impetus. It was only a matter of time before the roof of the
    grotto would give way. One is struck with the mournful despair with which he works;
    it is his last will and testament that he is making. And when he has finished it, he
    will have finished everything. His work is ended; if he lived another hundred years
    he would not have the heart to add anything more to it. The only thing that
    remains&mdash;and it is what he is about to do&mdash;is to wrap himself in silence
    and die.</p>
    <p>Oh, mournful destiny! There are great men who have outlived their genius; but with
    Berlioz genius outlived desire. His genius was still there; one feels it in the
    sublime pages of the third act of <i>Les Troyens &agrave; Carthage</i>. But Berlioz
    had ceased to believe in his power; he had lost faith in everything. His genius was
    dying for want of nourishment; it was a flame above an empty tomb. At the same hour
    of his old age the soul of Wagner sustained its glorious flight; and, having
    conquered everything, it achieved a supreme victory in renouncing everything for its
    faith. And the divine songs of Parsifal resounded as in a splendid temple, and
    replied to the cries of the suffering Amfortas by the blessed words: "<i>Selig in
    Glauben! Selig in Liebe</i>!"</p>

    <h3><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h3>
    <p>Berlioz's work did not spread itself evenly over his life; it was accomplished in
    a few years. It was not like the course of a great river, as with Wagner and
    Beethoven; it was a burst of genius, whose flames lit up the whole sky for a little
    while, and then died gradually down.<a name="FNanchor_65_65"
    id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Let me
    try to tell you about this wonderful blaze.</p>
    <p>Some of Berlioz's musical qualities are so striking that it is unnecessary to
    dwell upon them here. His instrumental colouring, so intoxicating and exciting,<a
    name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66"
    class="fnanchor">[66]</a> his extraordinary discoveries concerning timbre, his
    inventions of new nuances (as in the famous combining of flutes and trombones in the
    <i>Hostias et preces</i> of the <i>Requiem</i>, and the curious use of the harmonics
    of violins and harps), and his huge and nebulous orchestra&mdash;all this lends
    itself to the most subtle expression of thought.<a name="FNanchor_67_67"
    id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page36" id="page36"/>Think of the
    effect that such works must have produced at that period. Berlioz was the first to be
    astonished when he heard them for the first time. At the <i>Ouverture des
    Francs-Juges</i> he wept and tore his hair, and fell sobbing on the kettledrums. At
    the performance of his <i>Tuba mirum</i>, in Berlin, he nearly fainted. The composer
    who most nearly approached him was Weber, and, as we have already seen, Berlioz only
    knew him late in life. But how much less rich and complex is Weber's music, in spite
    of its nervous brilliance and dreaming poetry. Above all, Weber is much more mundane
    and more of a classicist; he lacks Berlioz's revolutionary passion and plebeian
    force; he is less expressive and less grand.</p>
    <p>How did Berlioz come to have this genius for orchestration almost from the very
    first? He himself says that his two masters at the Conservatoire taught him nothing
    in point of instrumentation:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"Lesueur had only very limited ideas about the art. Reicha knew the particular
      resources of most of the wind instruments; but I think that he had not very
      advanced ideas on the subject of grouping them."</p>
    </div>
    <p>Berlioz taught himself. He used to read the score of an opera while it was being
    performed.<a name="page37" id="page37"/></p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"It was thus," he says,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> "that I began to get familiar with
      the use of the orchestra, and to know its expression and timbre, as well as the
      range and mechanism of most of the instruments. By carefully comparing the effect
      produced with the means used to produce it, I learned the hidden bond which unites
      musical expression to the special art of instrumentation; but no one put me in the
      way of this. The study of the methods of the three modern masters, Beethoven,
      Weber, and Spontini, the impartial examination of the traditions of instrumentation
      and of little-used forms and combinations, conversations with virtuosi, and the
      effects I made them try on their different instruments, together with a little
      instinct, did the rest for me."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>That he was an originator in this direction no one doubts. And no one disputes, as
    a rule, "his devilish cleverness," as Wagner scornfully called it, or remains
    insensible to his skill and mastery in the mechanism of expression, and his power
    over sonorous matter, which make him, apart from his creative power, a sort of
    magician of music, a king of tone and rhythm. This gift is recognised even by his
    enemies&mdash;by Wagner, who seeks with some unfairness to restrict his genius within
    narrow limits, and to reduce it to "a structure with wheels <a
    name="page38" id="page38"/>of infinite ingenuity and extreme cunning
    ... a marvel of mechanism."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>
    <p>But though there is hardly anyone that Berlioz does not irritate or attract, he
    always strikes people by his impetuous ardour, his glowing romance, and his seething
    imagination, all of which makes and will continue to make his work one of the most
    picturesque mirrors of his age. His frenzied force of ecstasy and despair, his
    fulness of love and hatred, his perpetual thirst for life, which "in the heart of the
    deepest sorrow lights the Catherine wheels and crackers of the wildest joy"<a
    name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71"
    class="fnanchor">[71]</a>&mdash;these are the qualities that stir up the crowds in
    <i>Benvenuto</i> and the armies in the <i>Damnation</i>, that shake earth, heaven,
    and hell, and are never quenched, but remain devouring and "passionate even when the
    subject is far removed from passion, and yet also express sweet and tender sentiments
    and the deepest calm."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a><a
    name="page39" id="page39"/></p>
    <p>Whatever one may think of this volcanic force, of this torrential stream of youth
    and passion, it is impossible to deny them; one might as well deny the sun.</p>
    <p>And I shall not dwell on Berlioz's love of Nature, which, as M. Prudhomme shows
    us, is the soul of a composition like the <i>Damnation</i> and, one might say, of all
    great compositions. No musician, with the exception of Beethoven, has loved Nature so
    profoundly. Wagner himself did not realise the intensity of emotion which she roused
    in Berlioz,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73"
    class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and how this feeling impregnated the music of the
    <i>Damnation</i>, of <i>Rom&eacute;o</i>, and of <i>Les Troyens</i>.</p>
    <p>But this genius had other characteristics which are less well known, though they
    are not less unusual. The first is his sense of pure beauty. Berlioz's exterior
    romanticism must not make us blind to this. He had a Virgilian soul; and if his
    colouring recalls that of Weber, his design has often an Italian suavity. Wagner
    never had this love of beauty in the Latin sense of the word. Who has understood the
    Southern nature, beautiful form, and harmonious movement like Berlioz? Who, since
    Gluck, has recognised so well the secret of classical beauty? Since <i>Orfeo</i> was
    composed, no one has carved in music a bas-relief so perfect as <a name="page40" id="page40"/>the entrance of
    Andromache in the second act of <i>Les Troyens &agrave; Troie</i>. In <i>Les Troyens
    &agrave; Carthage</i>, the fragrance of the Aeneid is shed over the night of love,
    and we see the luminous sky and hear the murmur of the sea. Some of his melodies are
    like statues, or the pure lines of Athenian friezes, or the noble gesture of
    beautiful Italian girls, or the undulating profile of the Albanian hills filled with
    divine laughter. He has done more than felt and translated into music the beauty of
    the Mediterranean&mdash;he has created beings worthy of a Greek tragedy. His
    Cassandre alone would suffice to rank him among the greatest tragic poets that music
    has ever known. And Cassandre is a worthy sister of Wagner's Br&uuml;nnhilde; but she
    has the advantage of coming of a nobler race, and of having a lofty restraint of
    spirit and action that Sophocles himself would have loved.</p>
    <p>Not enough attention has been drawn to the classical nobility from which Berlioz's
    art so spontaneously springs. It is not fully acknowledged that he was, of all
    nineteenth-century musicians, the one who had in the highest degree the sense of
    plastic beauty. Nor do people always recognise that he was a writer of sweet and
    flowing melodies. Weingartner expressed the surprise he felt when, imbued with
    current prejudice against Berlioz's lack of melodic invention, he opened, by chance,
    the score of the overture of <i>Benvenuto</i> and found in that short composition,
    which barely takes ten minutes to play, not one or two, but four or five melodies of
    admirable richness and originality:&mdash;<a name="page41"
    id="page41"/></p>
    <p>"I began to laugh, both with pleasure at having discovered such a treasure, and
    with annoyance at finding how narrow human judgment is. Here I counted five themes,
    all of them plastic and expressive of personality; of admirable workmanship, varied
    in form, working up by degrees to a climax, and then finishing with strong effect.
    And this from a composer who was said by critics and the public to be devoid of
    creative power! From that day on there has been for me another great citizen in the
    republic of art."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>
    <p>Before this, Berlioz had written in 1864:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"It is quite easy for others to convince themselves that, without even limiting
      me to take a very short melody as the theme of a composition&mdash;as the greatest
      musicians have often done&mdash;I have always endeavoured to put a wealth of melody
      into my compositions. One may, of course, dispute the worth of these melodies,
      their distinction, originality, or charm&mdash;it is not for me to judge
      them&mdash;but to deny their existence is either unfair or foolish. They are often
      on a large scale; and an immature or short-sighted musical vision may not clearly
      distinguish their form; or, again, they may be accompanied by secondary melodies
      which, to a limited vision, may veil the form of the principal ones. Or, lastly,
      shallow musicians may find these melodies so unlike the funny little things that
      they call <a name="page42" id="page42"/>
      melodies, that they cannot bring themselves to give the same name to both."<a
      name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75"
      class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>And what a splendid variety there is in these melodies: there is the song in
    Gluck's style (Cassandre's airs), the pure German <i>lied</i> (Marguerite's song,
    "D'amour l'ardente flamme"), the Italian melody, after Bellini, in its most limpid
    and happy form (arietta of Arlequin in <i>Benvenuto</i>), the broad Wagnerian phrase
    (finale of <i>Rom&eacute;o</i>), the folk-song (chorus of shepherds in <i>L'Enfance
    du Christ</i>), and the freest and most modern recitative (the monologues of Faust),
    which was Berlioz's own invention, with its full development, its pliant outline, and
    its intricate nuances.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>
    <p>I have said that Berlioz had a matchless gift for expressing tragic melancholy,
    weariness of life, and the pangs of death. In a general way, one may say that he was
    a great elegist in music. Ambros, who was a very discerning and unbiassed critic,
    said: "Berlioz feels with inward delight and profound emotion what no musician,
    except Beethoven, has felt before." And Heinrich Heine had a keen perception of
    Berlioz's originality when he called him "a colossal nightingale, a lark the size of
    an eagle." The simile is not only picturesque, but of remarkable aptness. For
    Berlioz's colossal force is at the service of a forlorn and tender heart; he has
    nothing of the heroism of Beethoven, or H&auml;ndel, <a
    name="page43" id="page43"/>or Gluck, or even Schubert. He has all the
    charm of an Umbrian painter, as is shown in <i>L'Enfance du Christ</i>, as well as
    sweetness and inward sadness, the gift of tears, and an elegiac passion.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Now I come to Berlioz's great originality, an originality which is rarely spoken
    of, though it makes him more than a great musician, more than the successor of
    Beethoven, or, as some call him, the forerunner of Wagner. It is an originality that
    entitles him to be known, even more fitly than Wagner himself, as the creator of "an
    art of the future," the apostle of a new music, which even to-day has hardly made
    itself felt.</p>
    <p>Berlioz is original in a double sense. By the extraordinary complexity of his
    genius he touched the two opposite poles of his art, and showed us two entirely
    different aspects of music&mdash;that of a great popular art, and that of music made
    free.</p>
    <p>We are all enslaved by the musical tradition of the past. For generations we have
    been so accustomed to carry this yoke that we scarcely notice it. And in consequence
    of Germany's monopoly of music since the end of the eighteenth century, musical
    traditions&mdash;which had been chiefly Italian in the two preceding
    centuries&mdash;now became almost entirely German. We think in German forms: the plan
    of phrases, their development, their balance, and all the rhetoric of music and the
    grammar of composition comes to us from foreign thought, slowly elaborated by German
    masters. That <a name="page44" id="page44"/>
    domination has never been more complete or more heavy since Wagner's victory. Then
    reigned over the world this great German period&mdash;a scaly monster with a thousand
    arms, whose grasp was so extensive that it included pages, scenes, acts, and whole
    dramas in its embrace. We cannot say that French writers have ever tried to write in
    the style of Goethe or Schiller; but French composers have tried and are still trying
    to write music after the manner of German musicians.</p>
    <p>Why be astonished at it? Let us face the matter plainly. In music we have not, so
    to speak, any masters of French style. All our greatest composers are foreigners. The
    founder of the first school of French opera, Lulli, was Florentine; the founder of
    the second school, Gluck, was German; the two founders of the third school were
    Rossini, an Italian, and Meyerbeer, a German; the creators of
    <i>op&eacute;ra-comique</i> were Duni, an Italian, and Gretry, a Belgian; Franck, who
    revolutionised our modern school of opera, was also Belgian. These men brought with
    them a style peculiar to their race; or else they tried to found, as Gluck did, an
    "international" style,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> by which they effaced the more
    individual characteristics of the French spirit. The most French of all these styles
    is the <i>op&eacute;ra-comique</i>, the work of two foreigners, but owing much more
    to the <i>op&eacute;ra-bouffe</i> than is generally admitted, and, in any case,
    representing France very insufficiently.</p>
    <p><a name="page45" id="page45"/>Some more
    rational minds have tried to rid themselves of this Italian and German influence, but
    have mostly arrived at creating an intermediate Germano-Italian style, of which the
    operas of Auber and Ambroise Thomas are a type.</p>
    <p>Before Berlioz's time there was really only one master of the first rank who made
    a great effort to liberate French music: it was Rameau; and, despite his genius, he
    was conquered by Italian art.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>
    <p>By force of circumstance, therefore, French music found itself moulded in foreign
    musical forms. And in the same way that Germany in the eighteenth century tried to
    imitate French architecture and literature, so France in the nineteenth century
    acquired the habit of speaking German in music. As most men speak more than they
    think, even thought itself became Germanised; and it was difficult then to discover,
    through this traditional insincerity, the true and spontaneous form of French musical
    thought.</p>
    <p>But Berlioz's genius found it by instinct. From the first he strove to free French
    music from the oppression of the foreign tradition that was suffocating it.<a
    name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79"
    class="fnanchor">[79]</a><a name="page46"
    id="page46"/></p>
    <p>He was fitted in every way for the part, even by his deficiencies and his
    ignorance. His classical education in music was incomplete. M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns tells
    us that "the past did not exist for him; he did not understand the old composers, as
    his knowledge of them was limited to what he had read about them." He did not know
    Bach. Happy ignorance! He was able to write oratorios like <i>L'Enfance du Christ</i>
    without being worried by memories and traditions of the German masters of oratorio.
    There are men like Brahms who have been, nearly all their life, but reflections of
    the past. Berlioz never sought to be anything but himself. It was thus that he
    created that masterpiece, <i>La Fuite en &Eacute;gypte</i>, which sprang from his
    keen sympathy with the people.</p>
    <p>He had one of the most untrammelled spirits that ever breathed. Liberty was for
    him a desperate necessity. "Liberty of heart, of mind, of soul&mdash;of
    everything.... Real liberty, absolute and immense!"<a name="FNanchor_80_80"
    id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> And this
    passionate love of liberty, which was his misfortune in life, since it deprived him
    of the comfort of any faith, refused him any refuge for his thoughts, robbed him of
    peace, and even of the soft pillow of scepticism&mdash;this "real liberty" formed the
    unique originality and grandeur of his musical conceptions.<a
    name="page47" id="page47"/></p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"Music," wrote Berlioz to C. Lobe, in 1852, "is the most poetic, the most
      powerful, the most living of all arts. She ought to be the freest, but she is not
      yet.... Modern music is like the classic Andromeda, naked and divinely beautiful.
      She is chained to a rock on the shores of a vast sea, and awaits the victorious
      Perseus who shall loose her bonds and break in pieces the chimera called
      Routine."</p>
    </div>
    <p>The business was to free music from its limited rhythms and from the traditional
    forms and rules that enclosed it;<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and, above all, it needed to be free
    from the domination of speech, and to be released from its humiliating bondage to
    poetry. Berlioz wrote to the Princess of Wittgenstein, in 1856:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"I am for free music. Yes, I want music to be proudly free, to be victorious, to
      be supreme. I want her to take all she can, so that there may be no more Alps or
      Pyrenees for her. But she <a name="page48"
      id="page48"/>must achieve her victories by fighting in person, and
      not rely upon her lieutenants. I should like her to have, if possible, good verse
      drawn up in order of battle; but, like Napoleon, she must face the fire herself,
      and, like Alexander, march in the front ranks of the phalanx. She is so powerful
      that in some cases she would conquer unaided; for she has the right to say with
      Medea: 'I, myself, am enough.'"</p>
    </div>
    <p>Berlioz protested vigorously against Gluck's impious theory<a
    name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82"
    class="fnanchor">[82]</a> and Wagner's "crime" in making music the slave of speech.
    Music is the highest poetry and knows no master.<a name="FNanchor_83_83"
    id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> It was
    for Berlioz, therefore, continually to increase the power of expression in pure
    music.</p>
    <p><a name="page49" id="page49"/>And while
    Wagner, who was more moderate and a closer follower of tradition, sought to establish
    a compromise (perhaps an impossible one) between music and speech, and to create the
    new lyric drama, Berlioz, who was more revolutionary, achieved the dramatic symphony,
    of which the unequalled model to-day is still <i>Rom&eacute;o et Juliette</i>.</p>
    <p>The dramatic symphony naturally fell foul of all formal theories. Two arguments
    were set up against it: one derived from Bayreuth, and by now an act of faith; the
    other, current opinion, upheld by the crowd that speaks of music without
    understanding it.</p>
    <p>The first argument, maintained by Wagner, is that music cannot really express
    action without the help of speech and gesture. It is in the name of this opinion that
    so many people condemn <i>a priori</i> Berlioz's <i>Rom&eacute;o</i>. They think it
    childish to try and <i>translate</i> action into music. I suppose they think it less
    childish to <i>illustrate</i> an action by music. Do they think that gesture
    associates itself very happily with music? If only they would try to root up this
    great fiction, which has bothered us for the last three centuries; if only they would
    open their eyes and see&mdash;what great men like Rousseau and Tolstoy saw so
    clearly&mdash;the silliness of opera; if only they would see the anomalies of the
    Bayreuth show. In the second act of <i>Tristan</i> there is a celebrated passage,
    where Ysolde, burning with desire, is waiting for Tristan; she sees him come at last,
    and from afar she waves her scarf to the accompaniment of a phrase repeated several
    times by the orchestra. I cannot express the effect produced on me by that
    <i>imitation</i> (for it is nothing else) of a series of sounds by a series of
    gestures; I can never see it without indignation or without laughing.<a name="page50" id="page50"/>The curious thing is
    that when one hears this passage at a concert, one sees the gesture. At the theatre
    either one does not "see" it, or it appears childish. The natural action becomes
    stiff when clad in musical armour, and the absurdity of trying to make the two agree
    is forced upon one. In the music of <i>Rheingold</i> one pictures the stature and
    gait of the giants, and one sees the lightning gleam and the rainbow reflected on the
    clouds. In the theatre it is like a game of marionettes; and one feels the impassable
    gulf between music and gesture. Music is a world apart. When music wishes to depict
    the drama, it is not real action which is reflected in it, it is the ideal action
    transfigured by the spirit, and perceptible only to the inner vision. The worst
    foolishness is to present two visions&mdash;one for the eyes and one for the spirit.
    Nearly always they kill each other.</p>
    <p>The other argument urged against the symphony with a programme is the pretended
    classical argument (it is not really classical at all). "Music," they say, "is not
    meant to express definite subjects; it is only fitted for vague ideas. The more
    indefinite it is, the greater its power, and the more it suggests." I ask, What is an
    indefinite art? What is a vague art? Do not the two words contradict each other? Can
    this strange combination exist at all? Can an artist write anything that he does not
    clearly conceive? Do people think he composes at random as his genius whispers to
    him? One must at least say this: A symphony of Beethoven's is a "definite" work down
    to its innermost folds; and Beethoven <a name="page51"
    id="page51"/>had, if not an exact knowledge, at least a clear
    intuition of what he was about. His last quartets are descriptive symphonies of his
    soul, and very differently carried out from Berlioz's symphonies. Wagner was able to
    analyse one of the former under the name of "A Day with Beethoven." Beethoven was
    always trying to translate into music the depths of his heart, the subtleties of his
    spirit, which are not to be explained clearly by words, but which are as definite as
    words&mdash;in fact, more definite; for a word, being an abstract thing, sums up many
    experiences and comprehends many different meanings. Music is a hundred times more
    expressive and exact than speech; and it is not only her right to express particular
    emotions and subjects, it is her duty. If that duty is not fulfilled, the result is
    not music&mdash;it is nothing at all.</p>
    <p>Berlioz is thus the true inheritor of Beethoven's thought. The difference between
    a work like <i>Rom&eacute;o</i> and one of Beethoven's symphonies is that the former,
    it would seem, endeavours to express objective emotions and subjects in music. I do
    not see why music should not follow poetry in getting away from introspection and
    trying to paint the drama of the universe. Shakespeare is as good as Dante. Besides,
    one may add, it is always Berlioz himself that is discovered in his music: it is his
    soul starving for love and mocked at by shadows which is revealed through all the
    scenes of <i>Rom&eacute;o</i>.</p>
    <p>I will not prolong a discussion where so many things must be left unsaid. But I
    would suggest <a name="page52" id="page52"/>
    that, once and for all, we get rid of these absurd endeavours to fence in art. Do not
    let us say: Music can.... Music cannot express such-and-such a thing. Let us say
    rather, If genius pleases, everything is possible; and if music so wishes, she may be
    painting and poetry to-morrow. Berlioz has proved it well in his
    <i>Rom&eacute;o</i>.</p>
    <p>This <i>Rom&eacute;o</i> is an extraordinary work: "a wonderful isle, where a
    temple of pure art is set up." For my part, not only do I consider it equal to the
    most powerful of Wagner's creations, but I believe it to be richer in its teaching
    and in its resources for art&mdash;resources and teaching which contemporary French
    art has not yet fully turned to account. One knows that for several years the young
    French school has been making efforts to deliver our music from German models, to
    create a language of recitative that shall belong to France and that the
    <i>leitmotif</i> will not overwhelm; a more exact and less heavy language, which in
    expressing the freedom of modern thought will not have to seek the help of the
    classical or Wagnerian forms. Not long ago, the <i>Schola Cantorum</i> published a
    manifesto that proclaimed "the liberty of musical declamation ... free speech in free
    music ... the triumph of natural music with the free movement of speech and the
    plastic rhythm of the ancient dance"&mdash;thus declaring war on the metrical art of
    the last three centuries.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>
    <p>Well, here is that music; you will nowhere find a more perfect model. It is true
    that many <a name="page53" id="page53"/>who
    profess the principles of this music repudiate the model, and do not hide their
    disdain for Berlioz. That makes me doubt a little, I admit, the results of their
    efforts. If they do not feel the wonderful freedom of Berlioz's music, and do not see
    that it was the delicate veil of a very living spirit, then I think there will be
    more of archaism than real life in their pretensions to "free music." Study, not only
    the most celebrated pages of his work, such as the <i>Sc&egrave;ne d'amour</i> (the
    one of all his compositions that Berlioz himself liked best),<a name="FNanchor_85_85"
    id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> <i>La
    Tristesse de Rom&eacute;o</i>, or <i>La F&ecirc;te des Capulet</i> (where a spirit
    like Wagner's own unlooses and subdues again tempests of passion and joy), but take
    less well-known pages, such as the <i>Scherzetto chant&eacute; de la reine Mab</i>,
    or the <i>R&eacute;veil de Juliette</i>, and the music describing the death of the
    two lovers.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86"
    class="fnanchor">[86]</a> In the one what light grace there is, in the other what
    vibrating passion, and in both of them what freedom and apt expression of ideas. The
    language is magnificent, of wonderful clearness and simplicity; not a word too much,
    and not a word that does not reveal an unerring pen. In nearly all the big works of
    Berlioz before 1845 (that is up to the <i>Damnation</i>) you will find this nervous
    precision and sweeping liberty.</p>
    <p>Then there is the freedom of his rhythms. Schumann, who was nearest to Berlioz of
    all musicians <a name="page54" id="page54"/>of
    that time, and, therefore, best able to understand him, had been struck by this since
    the composition of the <i>Symphonic fantastique</i>,<a name="FNanchor_87_87"
    id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> He
    wrote:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"The present age has certainly not produced a work in which similar times and
      rhythms combined with dissimilar times and rhythms have been more freely used. The
      second part of a phrase rarely corresponds with the first, the reply to the
      question. This anomaly is characteristic of Berlioz, and is natural to his southern
      temperament."</p>
    </div>
    <p>Far from objecting to this, Schumann sees in it something necessary to musical
    evolution.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"Apparently music is showing a tendency to go back to its beginnings, to the
      time when the laws of rhythm did not yet trouble her; it seems that she wishes to
      free herself, to regain an utterance that is unconstrained, and raise herself to
      the dignity of a sort of poetic language."</p>
    </div>
    <p>And Schumann quotes these words of Ernest Wagner: "He who shakes off the tyranny
    of time and delivers us from it will, as far as one can see, give back freedom to
    music."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88"
    class="fnanchor">[88]</a><a name="page55"
    id="page55"/></p>
    <p>Remark also Berlioz's freedom of melody. His musical phrases pulse and flow like
    life itself. "Some phrases taken separately," says Schumann, "have such an intensity
    that they will not bear harmonising&mdash;<i>as in many ancient
    folk-songs</i>&mdash;and often even an accompaniment spoils their fulness."<a
    name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89"
    class="fnanchor">[89]</a> These melodies so correspond with the emotions, that they
    reproduce the least thrills of body and mind by their vigorous workings-up and
    delicate reliefs, by splendid barbarities of modulation and strong and glowing
    colour, by gentle gradations of light and shade or imperceptible ripples of thought,
    which flow over the body like a steady tide. It is an art of peculiar sensitiveness,
    more delicately expressive than that of Wagner; not satisfying itself with the modern
    tonality, but going back to old modes&mdash;a rebel, as M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns remarks,
    to the polyphony which had governed music since Bach's day, and which is perhaps,
    after all, "a heresy destined to disappear."<a name="FNanchor_90_90"
    id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>
    <p>How much finer, to my idea, are Berlioz's recitatives, with their long and winding
    rhythms,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91"
    class="fnanchor">[91]</a> than<a name="page56"
    id="page56"/>Wagner's declamations, which&mdash;apart from the climax
    of a subject, where the air breaks into bold and vigorous phrases, whose influence
    elsewhere is often weak&mdash;limit themselves to the quasi-notation of spoken
    inflections, and jar noisily against the fine harmonies of the orchestra. Berlioz's
    orchestration, too, is of a more delicate temper, and has a freer life than Wagner's,
    flowing in an impetuous stream, and sweeping away everything in its course; it is
    also less united and solid, but more flexible; its nature is undulating and varied,
    and the thousand imperceptible impulses of the spirit and of action are reflected
    there. It is a marvel of spontaneity and caprice.</p>
    <p>In spite of appearances, Wagner is a classicist compared with Berlioz; he carried
    on and perfected the work of the German classicists; he made no innovations; he is
    the pinnacle and the close of one evolution of art. Berlioz began a new art; and one
    finds in it all the daring and gracious ardour of youth. The iron laws that bound the
    art of Wagner are not to be found in Berlioz's early works, which give one the
    illusion of perfect freedom.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>
    <a name="page57" id="page57"/>
    <p>As soon as the profound originality of Berlioz's music has been grasped, one
    understands why it encountered, and still encounters, so much secret hostility. How
    many accomplished musicians of distinction and learning, who pay honour to artistic
    tradition, are incapable of understanding Berlioz because they cannot bear the air of
    liberty breathed by his music. They are so used to thinking in German, that Berlioz's
    speech upsets and shocks them. I can well believe it. It is the first time a French
    musician has dared to think in French; and that is the reason why I warned you of the
    danger of accepting too meekly German ideas about Berlioz. Men like Weingartner,
    Richard Strauss, and Mottl&mdash;thoroughbred musicians&mdash;are, without doubt,
    able to appreciate Berlioz's genius better and more quickly than we French musicians.
    But I rather mistrust the kind of appreciation they feel for a spirit so opposed to
    their own. It is for France and French people to learn to read his thoughts; they
    <a name="page58" id="page58"/>are intimately
    theirs, and one day will give them their salvation.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Berlioz's other great originality lay in his talent for music that was suited to
    the spirit of the common people, recently raised to sovereignty, and the young
    democracy. In spite of his aristocratic disdain, his soul was with the masses. M.
    Hippeau applies to him Taine's definition of a romantic artist: "the plebeian of a
    new race, richly gifted, and filled with aspirations, who, having attained for the
    first time the world's heights, noisily displays the ferment of his mind and heart."
    Berlioz grew up in the midst of revolutions and stories of Imperial achievement. He
    wrote his cantata for the <i>Prix de Rome</i> in July, 1830, "to the hard, dull noise
    of stray bullets, which whizzed above the roofs, and came to flatten themselves
    against the wall near his window."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> When he had finished this cantata,
    he went, "pistol in hand, to play the blackguard in Paris with the <i>sainte
    canaille</i>." He sang the <i>Marseillaise</i>, and made "all who had a voice and
    heart and blood in their veins"<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> sing it too. On his journey to Italy
    he travelled from Marseilles to Livourne with Mazzinian conspirators, who were going
    to take part in the insurrection of Modena and Bologna. Whether he was conscious of
    it or not, he was the musician of revolutions; his sympathies were with the people.
    <a name="page59" id="page59"/>Not only did he
    fill his scenes in the theatre with swarming and riotous crowds, like those of the
    Roman Carnival in the second act of <i>Benvenuto</i> (anticipating by thirty years
    the crowds of <i>Die Meistersinger</i>), but he created a music of the masses and a
    colossal style. His model here was Beethoven; Beethoven of the Eroica, of the C
    minor, of the A, and, above all, of the Ninth Symphony. He was Beethoven's follower
    in this as well as other things, and the apostle who carried on his work.<a
    name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95"
    class="fnanchor">[95]</a> And with his understanding of material effects and sonorous
    matter, he built edifices, as he says, that were "Babylonian and Ninevitish,"<a
    name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96"
    class="fnanchor">[96]</a> "music after Michelangelo,"<a name="FNanchor_97_97"
    id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> "on an
    immense scale."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page60" id="page60"/>It was the
    <i>Symphonie fun&egrave;bre et triomphale</i> for two orchestras and a choir, and the
    <i>Te Deum</i> for orchestra, organ, and three choirs, which Berlioz loved (whose
    finale <i>Judex crederis</i> seemed to him the most effective thing he had ever
    written<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99"
    class="fnanchor">[99]</a>), as well as the <i>Imp&eacute;riale</i>, for two
    orchestras and two choirs, and the famous <i>Requiem</i>, with its "four orchestras
    of brass instruments, placed round the main orchestra and the mass of voices, but
    separated and answering one another at a distance." Like the <i>Requiem</i>, these
    compositions are often crude in style and of rather commonplace sentiment, but their
    grandeur is overwhelming. This is not due only to the hugeness of the means employed,
    but also to "the breadth of the style and to the formidable slowness of some of the
    progressions&mdash;whose final aim one cannot guess&mdash;which gives these
    compositions a strangely gigantic character."<a name="FNanchor_100_100"

    Berlioz has left in these compositions striking examples of the beauty that may
    reveal itself in a crude mass of music. Like the towering Alps, they move one by
    their very immensity. A German critic says: "In these Cyclopean works the composer
    lets the elemental and brute forces of sound and pure rhythm have their fling."<a
    name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101"
    class="fnanchor">[101]</a> It is scarcely music, it is the force of Nature herself.
    Berlioz himself calls his <i>Requiem</i> "a musical cataclysm."<a

    class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page61" id="page61"/>These
    hurricanes are let loose in order to speak to the people, to stir and rouse the dull
    ocean of humanity. The <i>Requiem</i> is a Last Judgment, not meant, like that of the
    Sixtine Chapel (which Berlioz did not care for at all) for great aristocracies, but
    for a crowd, a surging, excited, and rather savage crowd. The <i>Marche de
    Rakoczy</i> is less an Hungarian march than the music for a revolutionary fight; it
    sounds the charge; and Berlioz tells us it might bear Virgil's verses for a
    motto:&mdash;</p>

    <p>When Wagner heard the <i>Symphonic fun&egrave;bre et triomphale</i> he was forced
    to admit Berlioz's "skill in writing compositions that were popular in the best sense
    of the word."</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"In listening to that symphony I had a lively impression that any little street
      boy in a blue blouse and red bonnet would understand it perfectly. I have no
      hesitation in giving precedence to that work over Berlioz's other works; it is big
      and noble from the first note to the last; a fine and eager patriotism rises from
      its first expression of compassion to the final glory of the apotheosis, and keeps
      it from any unwholesome exaggeration. I want gladly to express my conviction that
      that symphony will fire men's courage and will live as long as a nation bears the
      name of France."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a

    <p>How do such works come to be neglected by our Republic? How is it they have not a
    place in our public life? Why are they not part of our great ceremonies? That is what
    one would wonderingly ask oneself if one had not seen, for the last century, the
    indifference of the State to Art. What might not Berlioz have done if the means had
    been given him, or if his works had found a place in the f&ecirc;tes of the
    Revolution? Unhappily, one must add that here again his character was the enemy of
    his genius. As this apostle of musical freedom, in the second part of his life,
    became afraid of himself and recoiled before the results of his own principles, and
    returned to classicism, so this revolutionary fell to sullenly disparaging the people
    and revolutions; and he talks about "the republican cholera," "the dirty and stupid
    republic," "the republic of street-porters and rag-gatherers," "the filthy rabble of
    humanity a hundred times more stupid and animal in its twitchings and revolutionary
    grimacings than the baboons and orang-outangs of Borneo."<a name="FNanchor_105_105"
    id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
    <a name="page63" id="page63"/>What ingratitude!
    He owed to these revolutions, to these democratic storms, to these human tempests,
    the best of all his genius&mdash;and he disowned it all. This musician of a new era
    took refuge in the past.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Well, what did it matter? Whether he wished it or not, he opened out some
    magnificent roads for Art. He has shown the music of France the way in which her
    genius should tread; he has shown her possibilities she had never before dreamed of.
    He has given us a musical utterance at once truthful and expressive, free from
    foreign traditions, coming from the depths of our being, and reflecting our spirit;
    an utterance which responded to his imagination, to his instinct for what was
    picturesque, to his fleeting impressions, and his delicate shades of feeling. He has
    laid the strong foundation of a national and popular music for the greatest republic
    in Europe.</p>
    <p>These are shining qualities. If Berlioz had had Wagner's reasoning power and had
    made the utmost use of his intuitions, if he had had Wagner's will and had shaped the
    inspirations of his genius and welded them into a solid whole, I venture to say that
    he would have made a revolution in music greater than Wagner's own; for Wagner,
    though stronger and more master of himself, was less original and, at bottom, but the
    close of a glorious past.<a name="page64"
    id="page64"/></p>
    <p>Will that revolution still be accomplished? Perhaps; but it has suffered half a
    century's delay. Berlioz bitterly calculated that people would begin to understand
    him about the year 1940.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>
    <p>After all, why be astonished that his mighty mission was too much for him? He was
    so alone.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> As people forsook him, his
    loneliness stood out in greater relief. He was alone in the age of Wagner, Liszt,
    Schumann, and Franck; alone, yet containing a whole world in himself, of which his
    enemies, his friends, his admirers, and he himself, were not quite conscious; alone,
    and tortured by his loneliness. Alone&mdash;the word is repeated by the music of his
    youth and his old age, by the <i>Symphonie fantastique</i> and <i>Les Troyens</i>. It
    is the word I read in the portrait before me as I write these lines&mdash;the
    beautiful portrait of the <i>M&eacute;moires</i>, where his face looks out in sad and
    stern reproach on the age that so misunderstood him.</p>

    <h2><a name="WAGNER" id="WAGNER"></a>WAGNER</h2>
    <h2>"SIEGFRIED"</h2>
    <p>There is nothing so thrilling as first impressions. I remember when, as a child, I
    heard fragments of Wagner's music for the first time at one of old Pasdeloup's
    concerts in the Cirque d'Hiver. I was taken there one dull and foggy Sunday
    afternoon; and as we left the yellow fog outside and entered the hall we were met by
    an overpowering warmth, a dazzling blaze of light, and the murmuring voice of the
    crowd. My eyes were blinded, I breathed with difficulty, and my limbs soon became
    cramped; for we sat on wooden benches, crushed in a narrow space between solid walls
    of human beings. But with the first note of the music all was forgotten, and one fell
    into a state of painful yet delicious torpor. Perhaps one's very discomfort made the
    pleasure keener. Those who know the intoxication of climbing a mountain know also how
    closely it is associated with the discomforts of the climb&mdash;with fatigue and the
    blinding light of the sun, with out-of-breathness, and all the other sensations that
    rouse and stimulate life and make the body tingle, so that the remembrance of it all
    is carved indelibly on the mind. The comfort of a playhouse adds <a name="page66" id="page66"/>nothing to the illusion
    of a play; and it may even be due to the entire inconvenience of the old
    concert-rooms that I owe my vivid recollection of my first meeting with Wagner's
    work.</p>
    <p>How mysterious it was, and what a strange agitation it filled me with! There were
    new effects of orchestration, new timbres, new rhythms, and new subjects; it held the
    wild poetry of the far-away Middle Ages and old legends, it throbbed with the fever
    of our hidden sorrows and desires. I did not understand it very well. How should I?
    The music was taken from works quite unknown to me. It was almost impossible to seize
    the connection of the ideas on account of the poor acoustics of the room, the bad
    arrangement of the orchestra, and the unskilled players&mdash;all of which served to
    break up the musical design and spoil the harmony of its colouring. Passages that
    should have been made prominent were slurred over, and others were distorted by
    faulty time or want of precision. Even to-day, when our orchestras are seasoned by
    years of study, I should often be unable to follow Wagner's thought throughout a
    whole scene if I did not happen to know the score, for the outline of a melody is
    often smothered by the accompaniment, and so its sentiment is lost. If we still find
    obscurity of meaning in Wagner's works you can imagine how much worse it was then.
    But what did it matter? I used to feel myself stirred with passions that were not
    human: some magnetic influence seemed to thrill me with both pleasure and pain, and I
    felt invigorated and happy, for it brought me strength.<a
    name="page67" id="page67"/>It seemed as if my child's heart were torn
    from me and the heart of a hero put in its place.</p>
    <p>Nor was I alone in the experience. On the faces of the people round about me I saw
    the reflection of my own emotions. What was the meaning of it? The audience consisted
    chiefly of poor and commonplace people, whose faces were lined with the wear and tear
    of a life without interest or ideals; their minds were dull and heavy, and yet here
    they responded to the divine spirit of the music. There is no more impressive sight
    than that of thousands of people held spellbound by a melody; it is by turns sublime,
    grotesque, and touching.</p>
    <p>What a place in my life those Sunday concerts held! All the week I lived for those
    two hours; and when they were over I thought about them until the following Sunday.
    The fascination of Wagner's music for youth has often troubled people; they think it
    poisons the thoughts and dulls the activities. But the generation that was then
    intoxicated by Wagner does not seem to have shown signs of demoralisation since. Why
    do not people understand that if we had need of that music it was not because it was
    death to us, but life. Cramped by the artificiality of a town, far from action, or
    nature, or any strong or real life, we expanded under the influence of this noble
    music&mdash;music which flowed from a heart filled with understanding of the world
    and the breath of Nature. In <i>Die Meistersinger</i>, in <i>Tristan</i>, and in
    <i>Siegfried</i>, we went to find the joy, the love, and the vigour that we so
    lacked.<a name="page68" id="page68"/></p>
    <p>At the time when I was feeling Wagner's seductiveness so strongly there were
    always some carping people among my elders ready to quench my admiration and say with
    a superior smile: "That is nothing. One can't judge Wagner at a concert. You must
    hear him in the opera-house at Bayreuth." Since then I have been several times to
    Bayreuth; I have seen Wagner's works performed in Berlin, in Dresden, in Munich, and
    in other German towns, but I have never again felt the old intoxication. People are
    wrong to pretend that closer acquaintance with a fine work adds to one's enjoyment of
    it. It may throw light upon it, but it nips one's imagination and dispels the
    mystery. The puzzling fragments one hears at concerts will take on splendid
    proportions on account of all the mind adds to them. That epic poem of the
    <i>Niebelungen</i> was once like a forest in our dreams, where strange and awful
    beings flashed before our vision and then vanished. Later on, when we had explored
    all its paths, we discovered that order and reason reigned in the midst of this
    apparent jungle; and when we came to know the least wrinkle on the faces of its
    inhabitants, the confusion and emotion of other days no longer filled us.</p>
    <p>But this may be the result of growing older; and if I do not recognise the Wagner
    of other days, it is perhaps because I do not recognise my former self. A work of
    art, and above all a work of musical art, changes with ourselves. <i>Siegfried</i>,
    for example, is for me no longer full of mystery. The qualities in it that strike me
    to-day are its cheerful vigour, its <a name="page69"
    id="page69"/>clearness of form, its virile force and freedom, and the
    extraordinary healthiness of the hero, and, indeed, of the whole work.</p>
    <p>I sometimes think of poor Nietzsche and his passion for destroying the things he
    loved, and how he sought in others the decadence that was really in himself. He tried
    to embody this decadence in Wagner, and, led away by his flights of fancy and his
    mania for paradox (which would be laughable if one did not remember that his whims
    were not hatched in hours of happiness), he denied Wagner his most obvious
    qualities&mdash;his vigour, his determination, his unity, his logic, and his power of
    progress. He amused himself by comparing Wagner's style with that of Goncourt, by
    making him&mdash;with amusing irony&mdash;a great miniaturist painter, a poet of
    half-tones, a musician of affectations and melancholy, so delicate and effeminate in
    style that "after him all other musicians seemed too robust."<a
    name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108"
    class="fnanchor">[108]</a> He has painted Wagner and his time delightfully. We all
    enjoy these little pictures of the Tetralogy, delicately drawn and worked up by the
    aid of a magnifying-glass&mdash;pictures of Wagner, languishing and beautiful, in a
    mournful salon, and pictures of the athletic meetings of the other musicians, who
    were "too robust"! The amusing part is that this piece of wit has been taken
    seriously by certain arbiters of elegance, who are only too happy to be able to run
    counter to any current opinion, whatever it may be.</p>
    <p>I do not say that there may not be a decadent <a
    name="page70" id="page70"/>side in Wagner, revealing
    super-sensitiveness or even hysteria and other modern nervous affections. And if this
    side was lacking he would not be representative of his time, and that is what every
    great artist ought to be. But there is certainly something more in him than
    decadence; and if women and young men cannot see anything beyond it, it only proves
    their inability to get outside themselves. A long time ago Wagner himself complained
    to Liszt that neither the public nor artists knew how to listen to or understand any
    side of his music but the effeminate side: "They do not grasp its strength," he said.
    "My supposed successes," he also tells us, "are founded on misunderstanding. My
    public reputation isn't worth a walnut-shell." And it is true he has been applauded,
    patronised, and monopolised for a quarter of a century by all the decadents of art
    and literature. Scarcely anyone has seen in him a vigorous musician and a classic
    writer, or has recognised him as Beethoven's direct successor, the inheritor of his
    heroic and pastoral genius, of his epic inspirations and battlefield rhythms, of his
    Napoleonic phrases and atmosphere of stirring trumpet-calls.</p>
    <p>Nowhere is Wagner nearer to Beethoven than in <i>Siegfried</i>. In <i>Die
    Walk&uuml;re</i> certain characters, certain phrases of Wotan, of Br&uuml;nnhilde,
    and, especially, of Siegmund, bear a close relationship to Beethoven's symphonies and
    sonatas. I can never play the recitative <i>con espressione e semplice</i> of the
    seventeenth sonata for the piano (Op. 31, No. 2) without being reminded of the
    forests of <i>Die Walk&uuml;re</i><a name="page71"
    id="page71"/>and the fugitive hero. But in <i>Siegfried</i> I find,
    not only a likeness to Beethoven in details, but the same spirit running through the
    work&mdash;both the poem and the music. I cannot help thinking that Beethoven would
    perhaps have disliked <i>Tristan</i>, but would have loved <i>Siegfried</i>; for the
    latter is a perfect incarnation of the spirit of old Germany, virginal and gross,
    sincere and malicious, full of humour and sentiment, of deep feeling, of dreams of
    bloody and joyous battles, of the shade of great oak-trees and the song of birds.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>In my opinion, <i>Siegfried</i>, in spirit and in form, stands alone in Wagner's
    work. It breathes perfect health and happiness, and it overflows with gladness. Only
    <i>Die Meistersinger</i> rivals it in merriment, though even there one does not find
    such a nice balance of poetry and music.</p>
    <p>And <i>Siegfried</i> rouses one's admiration the more when one thinks that it was
    the offspring of sickness and suffering. The time at which Wagner wrote it was one of
    the saddest in his life. It often happens so in art. One goes astray in trying to
    interpret an artist's life by his work, for it is exceptional to find one a
    counterpart of the other. It is more likely that an artist's work will express the
    opposite of his life&mdash;the things that he did not experience. The object of art
    is to fill up what is missing in the artist's experience: "Art begins where life
    leaves off," said Wagner. A man of action is rarely pleased with stimulating works of
    art. Borgia and Sforza <a name="page72"
    id="page72"/>patronised Leonardo. The strong, full-blooded men of the
    seventeenth century; the apoplectic court at Versailles (where Fagon's lancet played
    so necessary a part); the generals and ministers who harassed the Protestants and
    burned the Palatinate&mdash;all these loved pastorales. Napoleon wept at a reading of
    <i>Paul et Virginie</i>, and delighted in the pallid music of Paesiello. A man
    wearied by an over-active life seeks repose in art; a man who lives a narrow,
    commonplace life seeks energy in art. A great artist writes a gay work when he is
    sad, and a sad work when he is gay, almost in spite of himself. Beethoven's symphony
    <i>To Joy</i> is the offspring of his misery; and Wagner's <i>Meistersinger</i> was
    composed immediately after the failure of <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> in Paris. People try
    to find in <i>Tristan</i> the trace of some love-story of Wagner's, but Wagner
    himself says: "As in all my life I have never truly tasted the happiness of love, I
    will raise a monument to a beautiful dream of it: I have the idea of <i>Tristan und
    Isolde</i> in my head." And so it was with his creation of the happy and heedless
    <i>Siegfried</i>.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>The first ideas of <i>Siegfried</i> were contemporary with the Revolution of 1848,
    which Wagner took part in with the same enthusiasm he put into everything else. His
    recognised biographer, Herr Houston Stewart Chamberlain&mdash;who, with M. Henri
    Lichtenberger, has succeeded best in unravelling Wagner's complex soul, though he is
    not without certain <a name="page73"
    id="page73"/>prejudices&mdash;has been at great pains to prove that
    Wagner was always a patriot and a German monarchist. Well, he may have been so later
    on, but it was not, I think, the last phase of his evolution. His actions speak for
    themselves. On 14 June, 1848, in a famous speech to the National Democratic
    Association, Wagner violently attacked the organisation of society itself, and
    demanded both the abolition of money and the extinction of what was left of the
    aristocracy. In <i>Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft</i> (1849) he showed that beyond the
    "local nationalism" were signs of a "supernational universalism." And all this was
    not merely talk, for he risked his life for his ideas. Herr Chamberlain himself
    quotes the account of a witness who saw him, in May, 1849, distributing revolutionary
    pamphlets to the troops who were besieging Dresden. It was a miracle that he was not
    arrested and shot. We know that after Dresden was taken a warrant was out against
    him, and he fled to Switzerland, with a passport on which was a borrowed name. If it
    be true that Wagner later declared that he had been "involved in error and led away
    by his feelings" it matters little to the history of that time. Errors and
    enthusiasms are an integral part of life, and one must not ignore them in a man's
    biography under the pretext that he regretted them twenty or thirty years later, for
    they have, nevertheless, helped to guide his actions and impressed his imagination.
    It was out of the Revolution itself that <i>Siegfried</i> directly sprang.</p>
    <p>In 1848, Wagner was not yet thinking of a<a name="page74"
    id="page74"/>Tetralogy, but of an heroic opera in three acts called
    <i>Siegfried's Tod</i>, in which the fatal power of gold was to be symbolised in the
    treasure of the Niebelungen; and Siegfried was to represent "a socialist redeemer
    come down to earth to abolish the reign of Capital." As the rough draft developed,
    Wagner went up the stream of his hero's life. He dreamed of his childhood, of his
    conquest of the treasure, of the awakening of Br&uuml;nnhilde; and in 1851 he wrote
    the poem of <i>Der Junge Siegfried</i>. Siegfried and Br&uuml;nnhilde represent the
    humanity of the future, the new era that should be realised when the earth was set
    free from the yoke of gold. Then Wagner went farther back still, to the sources of
    the legend itself, and Wotan appeared, the symbol of our time, a man such as you or
    I&mdash;in contrast to Siegfried, man as he ought to be, and one day will be. On this
    subject Wagner says, in a letter to Roeckel: "Look well at Wotan; he is the
    unmistakable likeness of ourselves, and the sum of the present-day spirit, while
    Siegfried is the man we wait and wish for&mdash;the future man whom we cannot create,
    but who will create himself by our annihilation&mdash;the most perfect man I can
    imagine." Finally Wagner conceived the Twilight of the Gods, the fall of the
    Valhalla&mdash;our present system of society&mdash;and the birth of a regenerated
    humanity. Wagner wrote to Uhlig in 1851 that the complete work was to be played after
    the great Revolution.</p>
    <p>The opera public would probably be very astonished to learn that in
    <i>Siegfried</i> they applaud a revolutionary work, expressly directed by Wagner
    against <a name="page75" id="page75"/>this
    detested Capital, whose downfall would have been so dear to him. And he never doubted
    that he was expressing grief in all these pages of shining joy.</p>
    <p>Wagner went to Zurich after a stay in Paris, where he felt "so much distrust for
    the artistic world and horror for the restraint that he was forced to put upon
    himself" that he was seized with a nervous malady which nearly killed him. He
    returned to work at <i>Der Junge Siegfried</i>, and he says it brought him great
    joy.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"But I am unhappy in not being able to apply myself to anything but music. I
      know I am feeding on an illusion, and that reality is the only thing worth having.
      My health is not good, and my nerves are in a state of increasing weakness. My
      life, lived entirely in the imagination and without sufficient action, tires me so,
      that I can only work with frequent breaks and long intervals of rest; otherwise I
      pay the penalty with long and painful suffering.... I am very lonely. I often wish
      for death.</p>
      <p>"While I work I forget my troubles; but the moment I rest they come flocking
      about me, and I am very miserable. What a splendid life is an artist's! Look at it!
      How willingly would I part with it for a week of real life.</p>
      <p>"I can't understand how a really happy man could think of serving art. If we
      enjoyed life, we should have no need of art. When the present has nothing more to
      offer us we cry out our needs <a name="page76"
      id="page76"/>by means of art. To have my youth again and my health,
      to enjoy nature, to have a wife who would love me devotedly, and fine
      children&mdash;for this I would give up <i>all my art</i>. Now I have said
      it&mdash;give me what is left."</p>
    </div>
    <p>Thus the poem of the Tetralogy was written with doubts, as he said, as to whether
    he should abandon art and all belonging to it and become a healthy, normal
    man&mdash;a son of nature. He began to compose the music of the poem while in a state
    of suffering, which every day became more acute.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"My nights are often sleepless; I get out of bed, wretched and exhausted, with
      the thought of a long day before me, which will not bring me a single joy. The
      society of others tortures me, and I avoid it only to torture myself. Everything I
      do fills me with disgust. It can't go on for ever. I can't stand such a life any
      longer. I will kill myself rather than live like this.... I don't believe in
      anything, and I have only one desire&mdash;to sleep so soundly that human misery
      will exist no more for me. I ought to be able to get such a sleep somehow; it
      should not be really difficult."</p>
    </div>
    <p>For distraction he went to Italy; Turin, Genoa, Spezia, and Nice. But there, in a
    strange world, his loneliness seemed so frightful that he became very depressed, and
    made all haste back to Zurich. It was there he wrote the happy music of <i>Das
    Rheingold</i>. He began the score of <i>Die Walk&uuml;re</i> at a time when his
    normal condition was one of suffering.<a name="page77"
    id="page77"/>Then he discovered Schopenhauer, whose philosophy only
    helped to confirm and crystallise his instinctive pessimism. In the spring of 1855 he
    went to London to give concerts; but he was ill there, and this fresh contact with
    the world only served to annoy him further. He had some difficulty in again taking up
    <i>Die Walk&uuml;re</i>; but he finished it at last in spite of frequent attacks of
    facial erysipelas, for which he afterwards had to undergo a hydropathic cure at
    Geneva. He began the score of <i>Siegfried</i> towards the end of 1856, while the
    thought of Tristan was stirring within him. In <i>Tristan</i> he wished to depict
    love as "a dreadful anguish"; and this idea obsessed him so completely that he could
    not finish <i>Siegfried</i>. He seemed to be consumed by a burning fever; and,
    abandoning <i>Siegfried</i> in the middle of the second act, he threw himself madly
    into <i>Tristan</i>. "I want to gratify my desire for love," he says, "until it is
    completely satiated; and in the folds of the black flag that floats over its
    consummation I wish to wrap myself and die."<a name="FNanchor_109_109"

    <i>Siegfried</i> was not finished until 5 February, 1871, at the end of the
    Franco-Prussian war&mdash;that is fourteen years later, after several
    interruptions.</p>
    <p>Such is, in a few words, the history of this heroic idyll. It is perhaps as well
    to remind the public now and then that the hours of distraction they enjoy by means
    of art may represent years of suffering for the artist.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <a name="page78" id="page78"/>
    <p>Do you know the amusing account Tolstoy gave of a performance of <i>Siegfried</i>?
    I will quote it from his book, <i>What is Art</i>?&mdash;</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"When I arrived, an actor in tight-fitting breeches was seated before an object
      that was meant to represent an anvil. He wore a wig and false beard; his white and
      manicured hands had nothing of the workman about them; and his easy air, prominent
      belly, and flabby muscles readily betrayed the actor. With an absurd hammer he
      struck&mdash;as no one else would ever strike&mdash;a fantastic-looking
      sword-blade. One guessed he was a dwarf, because when he walked he bent his legs at
      the knees. He cried out a great deal, and opened his mouth in a queer fashion. The
      orchestra also emitted peculiar noises like several beginnings that had nothing to
      do with one another. Then another actor appeared with a horn in his belt, leading a
      man dressed up as a bear, who walked on all-fours. He let loose the bear on the
      dwarf, who ran away, but forgot to bend his knees this time. The actor with the
      human face represented the hero, Siegfried. He cried out for a long time, and the
      dwarf replied in the same way. Then a traveller arrived&mdash;the god Wotan. He had
      a wig, too; and, settling himself down with his spear, in a silly attitude, he told
      Mimi all about things he already knew, but of which the audience was ignorant. Then
      Siegfried seized some bits that were supposed to represent pieces of a sword, and
      sang:<a name="page79" id="page79"/></p>
      <p>'Heaho, heaho, hoho! Hoho, hoho, hoho, hoho! Hoheo, haho, haheo, hoho!' And that
      was the end of the first act. It was all so artificial and stupid that I had great
      difficulty in sitting it out. But my friends begged me to stay, and assured me that
      the second act would be better.</p>
      <p>"The next scene represented a forest. Wotan was waking up the dragon. At first
      the dragon said, 'I want to go to sleep'; but eventually he came out of his grotto.
      The dragon was represented by two men clothed in a green skin with some scales
      stuck about it. At one end of the skin they wagged a tail, and at the other end
      they opened a crocodile's mouth, out of which came fire. The dragon, which ought to
      have been a frightful beast&mdash;and perhaps he would have frightened children
      about five years old&mdash;said a few words in a bass voice. It was so childish and
      feeble that one was astonished to see grown-up people present; even thousands of
      so-called cultured people looked on and listened attentively, and went into
      raptures. Then Siegfried arrived with his horn. He lay down during a pause, which
      is reputed to be very beautiful; and sometimes he talked to himself, and sometimes
      he was quite silent. He wanted to imitate the song of the birds, and cut a rush
      with his horn, and made a flute out of it. But he played the flute badly, and so he
      began to blow his horn. The scene is intolerable, and there is not the least trace
      of music in it. I was annoyed to see three thousand people round about me,
      listening <a name="page80" id="page80"/>
      submissively to this absurdity and dutifully admiring it.</p>
      <p>"With some courage I managed to wait for the next scene&mdash;Siegfried's fight
      with the dragon. There were roarings and flames of fire and brandishings of the
      sword. But I could not stand it any longer; and I fled out of the theatre with a
      feeling of disgust that I have not yet forgotten."</p>
    </div>
    <p>I admit I cannot read this delightful criticism without laughing; and it does not
    affect me painfully like Nietzsche's pernicious and morbid irony. It used to be a
    grief to me that two men whom I loved with an equal affection, and whom I reverenced
    as the finest spirits in Europe, remained strangers and hostile to each other. I
    could not bear the thought that a genius, hopelessly misunderstood by the crowd,
    should be bent on making his solitude more bitter and narrow by refusing, with a sort
    of jealous waywardness, to be reconciled to his equals, or to offer them the hand of
    friendship. But now I think that perhaps it was better so. The first virtue of genius
    is sincerity. If Nietzsche had to go out of his way <i>not</i> to understand Wagner,
    it is natural, on the other hand, that Wagner should be a closed book to Tolstoy; it
    would be almost surprising if it were otherwise. Each one has his own part to play,
    and has no need to change it. Wagner's wonderful dreams and magic intuition of the
    inner life are not less valuable to us than Tolstoy's pitiless truth, in which he
    exposes modern society and tears away the veil of hypocrisy with which she covers
    <a name="page81" id="page81"/>herself. So I
    admire <i>Siegfried</i>, and at the same time enjoy Tolstoy's satire; for I like the
    latter's sturdy humour, which is one of the most striking features of his realism,
    and which, as he himself noticed, makes him closely resemble Rousseau. Both men show
    us an ultra-refined civilisation, and both are uncompromising apostles of a return to
    nature.</p>
    <p>Tolstoy's rough banter recalls Rousseau's sarcasm about an opera of Rameau's. In
    the <i>Nouvelle H&eacute;lo&iuml;se</i>, he rails in a similar fashion against the
    sadly fantastic performances at the theatre. It was, even then, a question of
    monsters, "of dragons animated by a blockhead of a Savoyard, who had not enough
    spirit for the beast."</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"They assured me that they had a tremendous lot of machinery to make all this
      movement, and they offered several times to show it to me; but I felt no curiosity
      about little effects achieved by great efforts.... The sky is represented by some
      blue rags suspended from sticks and cords, like a laundry display.... The chariots
      of the gods and goddesses are made of four joists in a frame, suspended by a thick
      rope, as a swing might be. Then a plank is stuck across the joists, and on this is
      seated a god. In front of him hangs a piece of daubed cloth, which serves as a
      cloud upon which his splendid chariot may rest.... The theatre is furnished with
      little square trap-doors which, opening as occasion requires, show that the demons
      can be let loose from the cellars.<a name="page82"
      id="page82"/>When the demons have to fly in the air, dummies of
      brown cloth are substituted, or sometimes real chimney-sweeps, who swing in the
      air, suspended by cords, until they are gloriously lost in the rag sky....</p>
      <p>"But you can have no idea of the dreadful cries and roarings with which the
      theatre resounds.... What is so extraordinary is that these howlings are almost the
      only things that the audience applaud. By the way they clap their hands one would
      take them to be a lot of deaf creatures, who were so delighted to catch a few
      piercing sounds now and then that they wanted the actors to do them all over again.
      I am quite sure that people applaud the bawling of an actress at the opera as they
      would a mountebank's feats of skill at a fair&mdash;one suffers while they are
      going on, but one is so delighted to see them finish without an accident that one
      willingly demonstrates one's pleasure.... With these beautiful sounds, as true as
      they are sweet, those of the orchestra blend very worthily. Imagine an unending
      clatter of instruments without any melody; a lingering and endless groaning among
      the bass parts; and the whole the most mournful and boring thing that I ever heard
      in my life. I could not put up with it for half an hour without getting a violent
      headache.</p>
      <p>"All this forms a sort of psalmody, possessing neither tune nor time. But if by
      any chance a lively air is played, there is a general stamping; the audience is set
      in motion, and follows, with a <a name="page83"
      id="page83"/>great deal of trouble and noise, some performer in the
      orchestra. Delighted to feel for a few moments the rhythm that is so lacking, they
      torment the ear, the voice, the arms, the legs, and all the body, to chase after a
      tune that is ever ready to escape them...."</p>
    </div>
    <p>I have quoted this rather long passage to show how the impression made by one of
    Rameau's operas on his contemporaries resembled that made by Wagner on his enemies.
    It was not without reason that Rameau was said to be Wagner's forerunner, as Rousseau
    was Tolstoy's forerunner.</p>
    <p>In reality, it was not against <i>Siegfried</i> itself that Tolstoy's criticism
    was directed; and Tolstoy was closer than he thought to the spirit of this drama. Is
    not Siegfried the heroic incarnation of a free and healthy man, sprung directly from
    Nature? In a sketch of <i>Siegfried</i>, written in 1848, Wagner says:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"To follow the impulses of my heart is my supreme law; what I can accomplish by
      obeying my instincts is what I ought to do. Is that voice of instinct cursed or
      blessed? I do not know; but I yield to it, and never force myself to run counter to
      my inclination."</p>
    </div>
    <p>Wagner fought against civilisation by quite other methods than those employed by
    Tolstoy; and if the efforts of the two were equally great, the practical result
    is&mdash;one must really say it&mdash;as poor on one side as on the other.<a name="page84" id="page84"/></p>
    <p>What Tolstoy's raillery is really aimed at is not Wagner's work, but the way in
    which his work was represented. The splendours of the setting do not hide the
    childishness of the ideas behind them: the dragon Fafna, Fricka's rams, the bear, the
    serpent, and all the Valhalla menagerie have always been ridiculous. I will only add
    that the dragon's failure to be terrifying was not Wagner's fault, for he never
    attempted to depict a terrifying dragon. He gave it quite clearly, and of his own
    choice, a comic character. Both the text and the music make Fafner a sort of ogre, a
    simple creature, but, above all, a grotesque one.</p>
    <p>Besides, I cannot help feeling that scenic reality takes away rather than adds to
    the effect of these great philosophical fairylands. Malwida von Meysenbug told me
    that at the Bayreuth festival of 1876, while she was following one of the <i>Ring</i>
    scenes very attentively with her opera-glasses, two hands were laid over her eyes,
    and she heard Wagner's voice say impatiently: "Don't look so much at what is going
    on. Listen!" It was good counsel. There are dilettanti who pretend that at a concert
    the best way to enjoy Beethoven's last works&mdash;where the sonority is
    defective&mdash;is to stop the ears and read the score. One might say with less of a
    paradox that the best way to follow a performance of Wagner's operas is to listen
    with the eyes shut. So perfect is the music, so powerful its hold on the imagination,
    that it leaves nothing to be desired; what it suggests to the mind is infinitely
    finer than what the eyes may see. I have never shared the <a
    name="page85" id="page85"/>opinion that Wagner's works may be best
    appreciated in the theatre. His works are epic symphonies. As a frame for them I
    should like temples; as scenery, the illimitable land of thought; as actors, our
    dreams.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>The first act of <i>Siegfried</i> is one of the most dramatic in the Tetralogy.
    Nothing satisfied me more completely at Bayreuth, both as regards the actors and the
    dramatic effects. Fantastic creatures like Alberich and Mimi, who seem to be out of
    their element in France, are rooted deep down in German imaginations. The Bayreuth
    actors surpassed themselves in making them startlingly lifelike, with a trembling and
    grimacing realism. Burgstaller, who was then making his debut in <i>Siegfried</i>,
    acted with an impetuous awkwardness which accorded well with the part. I remember
    with what zest&mdash;which seemed in no way affected&mdash;he played the hero smith,
    labouring like a true workman, blowing the fire and making the blade glow, dipping it
    in the steaming water, and working it on the anvil; and then, in a burst of Homeric
    gaiety, singing that fine hymn at the end of the first act, which sounds like an air
    by Bach or H&auml;ndel.</p>
    <p>But in spite of all this, I felt how much better it was to dream, or to hear this
    poem of a youthful soul at a concert. It is then that the magic murmurs of the forest
    in the second act speak more directly to the heart. However beautiful the scenery of
    glades <a name="page86" id="page86"/>and woods,
    however cleverly the light is made to change and dance among the trees&mdash;and it
    is manipulated now like a set of organ stops&mdash;it still seems almost wrong to
    listen with open eyes to music that, unaided, can show us a glorious summer's day,
    and make us see the swaying of the tree-tops, and hear the brush of the wind against
    the leaves. Through the music alone the hum and murmur of a thousand little voices is
    about us, the glorious song of the birds floats into the depths of a blue sky; or
    comes a silence, vibrating with invisible life, when Nature, with her mysterious
    smile, opens her arms and hushes all things in a divine sleep.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Wagner left <i>Siegfried</i> asleep in the forest in order to embark on the
    funereal vessel of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i>. But he left Siegfried with some anguish
    of heart. When writing to Liszt in 1857, he says:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"I have taken young Siegfried into the depths of a lonely forest; there I have
      left him under a lime-tree, and said good-bye to him with tears in my eyes. It has
      torn my heart to bury him alive, and I had a hard and painful fight with myself
      before I could do it.... Shall I ever go back to him? No, it is all finished. Don't
      let us speak of it again."</p>
    </div>
    <p>Wagner had reason to be sad. He knew well that he would never find his young
    Siegfried again. He <a name="page87"
    id="page87"/>roused him up ten years later. But all was changed. That
    splendid third act has not the freshness of the first two. Wotan has become an
    important figure, and brought reason and pessimism with him into the drama. Wagner's
    later conceptions were perhaps loftier, and his genius was more master of itself
    (think of the classic dignity in the awakening of Br&uuml;nnhilde); but the ardour
    and happy expression of youth is gone. I know that this is not the opinion of most of
    Wagner's admirers; but, with the exception of a few pages of sublime beauty, I have
    never altogether liked the love scenes at the end of <i>Siegfried</i> and at the
    beginning of <i>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i>. I find their style rather pompous and
    declamatory; and their almost excessive refinement makes them border upon dulness.
    The form of the duet, too, seems cut and dried, and there are signs of weariness in
    it. The heaviness of the last pages of <i>Siegfried</i> recalls <i>Die
    Meistersinger</i>, which is also of that period. It is no longer the same joy nor the
    same quality of joy that is found in the earlier acts.</p>
    <p>Yet it does not really matter, for joy is there, nevertheless; and so splendid was
    the first inspiration of the work that the years have not dimmed its brilliancy. One
    would like to end with <i>Siegfried</i>, and escape the gloomy
    <i>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i>. For those who have sensitive feelings the fourth
    day of the Tetralogy has a depressing effect. I remember the tears I have seen shed
    at the end of the <i>Ring</i>, and the words of a friend, as we left the theatre at
    Bayreuth and descended the hill at night: "I feel as <a
    name="page88" id="page88"/>though I were coming away from the burial
    of someone I dearly loved." It was truly a time of mourning. Perhaps there was
    something incongruous in building such a structure when it had universal death for
    its conclusion&mdash;or at least in making the whole an object of show and
    instruction. <i>Tristan</i> achieves the same end with much more power, as the action
    is swifter. Besides that, the end of <i>Tristan</i> is not without comfort, for life
    there is terrible. But it is not the same in <i>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i>; for in
    spite of the absurdity of the spell which is set upon the love of Siegfried and
    Br&uuml;nnhilde, life with them is happy and desirable, since they are beings capable
    of love, and death appears to be a splendid but awful catastrophe. And one cannot say
    the <i>Ring</i> breathes a spirit of renunciation and sacrifice like <i>Parsifal</i>;
    renunciation and sacrifice are only talked about in the <i>Ring</i>; and, in spite of
    the last transports which impel Br&uuml;nnhilde to the funeral pyre, they are neither
    an inspiration nor a delight. One has the impression of a great gulf yawning at one's
    feet, and the anguish of seeing those one loves fall into it.</p>
    <p>I have often regretted that Wagner's first conception of <i>Siegfried</i> changed
    in the course of years; and in spite of the magnificent <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of
    <i>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i> (which is really more effective in a concert room,
    for the real tragedy ends with Siegfried's death), I cannot help thinking with regret
    how fine a more optimistic poem from this revolutionary of '48 might have been.
    People tell me that it would then have been less true to life.<a name="page89" id="page89"/>But why should it be
    truthful to depict life only as a bad thing? Life is neither good nor bad it is just
    what we make it, and the result of the way in which we look at it. Joy is as real as
    sorrow, and a very fertile source of action. What inspiration there is in the laugh
    of a great man! Let us welcome, therefore, the sparkling if transient gaiety of
    <i>Siegfried</i>.</p>
    <p>Wagner wrote to Malwida von Meysenbug: "I have, by chance, just been reading
    Plutarch's life of Timoleon. That life ended very happily&mdash;a rare and unheard-of
    thing, especially in history. It does one good to think that such a thing is
    possible. It moved me profoundly."</p>
    <p>I feel the same when I hear <i>Siegfried</i>. We are rarely allowed to contemplate
    happiness in great tragic art; but when we may, how splendid it is, and how good for
    one!</p>
    <hr style="width: 65%;" />
    <a name="page90" id="page90"/>
    <h2><a name="TRISTANquot" id="TRISTANquot"></a>"TRISTAN"</h2>
    <p>Tristan towers like a mountain above all other love poems, as Wagner above all
    other artists of his century. It is the outcome of a sublime conception, though the
    work as a whole is far from perfect. Of perfect works there is none where Wagner is
    concerned. The effort necessary for the creation of them was too great to be long
    sustained; for a single work might means years of toil. And the tense emotions of a
    whole drama cannot be expressed by a series of sudden inspirations put into form the
    moment they are conceived. Long and arduous labour is necessary. These giants,
    fashioned like Michelangelo's, these concentrated tempests of heroic force and
    decadent complexity, are not arrested, like the work of a sculptor or painter, in one
    moment of their action; they live and go on living in endless detail of sensation. To
    expect sustained inspiration is to expect what is not human. Genius may reveal what
    is divine; it may call up and catch a glimpse of <i>die M&uuml;tter</i>, but it
    cannot always breathe in the exhausted air of this world. So will must sometimes take
    the place of inspiration; though the will is uncertain and often stumbles in its
    task. That is why we encounter things that jar and jolt in the greatest
    works&mdash;they are the marks of human weakness. Well, perhaps there is less <a name="page91" id="page91"/>weakness in
    <i>Tristan</i> than in Wagner's other dramas&mdash;<i>G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung</i>,
    for instance&mdash;for nowhere else is the effort of his genius more strenuous or its
    flight more dizzy. Wagner himself knew it well. His letters show the despair of a
    soul wrestling with its familiar spirit, which it clutches and holds, only to lose
    again. And we seem to hear cries of pain, and feel his anger and despair.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"I can never tell you what a really wretched musician I am. In my inmost heart I
      know I am a bungler and an absolute failure. You should see me when I say to
      myself, 'It ought to go now,' and sit down to the piano and put together some
      miserable rubbish, which I fling away again like an idiot. I know quite well the
      kind of musical trash I produce.... Believe me, it is no good expecting me to do
      anything decent. Sometimes I really think it was Reissiger who inspired me to write
      <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> and <i>Lohengrin</i>."</p>
    </div>
    <p>This is how Wagner wrote to Liszt when he was finishing this amazing work of art.
    In the same way Michelangelo wrote to his father in 1509: "I am in agony. I have not
    dared to ask the Pope for anything, because my work does not make sufficient progress
    to merit any remuneration. The work is too difficult, and indeed it is not my
    profession. I am wasting my time to no purpose. Heaven help me!" For a year he had
    been working at the ceiling of the Sixtine chapel.</p>
    <p>This is something more than a burst of modesty.<a
    name="page92" id="page92"/>No one had more pride than Michelangelo or
    Wagner; but both felt the defects of their work like a sharp wound. And although
    those defects do not prevent their works from being the glory of the human spirit,
    they are there just the same.</p>
    <p>I do not want to dwell upon the inherent imperfections of Wagner's dramas; they
    are really dramatic or epic symphonies, impossible to act, and gaining nothing from
    representation. This is especially true of <i>Tristan</i>, where the disparity
    between the storm of sentiment depicted, and the cold convention and enforced
    timidity of action on the stage, is such that at certain moments&mdash;in the second
    act, for example&mdash;it pains and shocks one, and seems almost grotesque.</p>
    <p>But while admitting that <i>Tristan</i> is a symphony that is not suitable for
    representation, one also recognises its blemishes and, above all, its unevenness. The
    orchestration in the first act is often rather thin, and the plot lacks solidity.
    There are gaps and unaccountable holes, and melodious lines left suspended in space.
    From beginning to end, lyrical bursts of melody are broken by declamations, or, what
    is worse, by dissertations. Frenzied whirlwinds of passion stop suddenly to give
    place to recitatives of explanation or argument. And although these recitatives are
    nearly always a great relief, although these metaphysical reveries have a character
    of barbarous cunning that one relishes, yet the superior beauty of the movements of
    pure poetry, emotion, and music is so evident, that this musical and philosophical
    drama serves to give one <a name="page93"
    id="page93"/>a distaste for philosophy and drama and everything else
    that cramps and confines music.</p>
    <p>But the musical part of <i>Tristan</i> is not free either from the faults of the
    work as a whole, for it, too, lacks unity. Wagner's music is made up of very diverse
    styles: one finds in it Italianisms and Germanisms and even Gallicisms of every kind;
    there are some that are sublime, some that are commonplace; and at times one feels
    the awkwardness of their union and the imperfections of their form. Then again,
    perhaps two ideas of equal originality come together and spoil each other by making
    too strong a contrast. The fine lamentation of King Mark&mdash;that personification
    of a knight of the Grail&mdash;is treated with such moderation and with so noble a
    scorn for outward show, that its pure, cold light is entirely lost after the glowing
    fire of the duet.</p>
    <p>The work suffers everywhere from a lack of balance. It is an almost inevitable
    defect, arising from its very grandeur. A mediocre work may quite easily be perfect
    of its kind; but it is rarely that a work lofty aim attains perfection. A landscape
    of little dells and smiling meadows is brought more readily into pleasing harmony
    than a landscape of dazzling Alps, torrents, glaciers, and tempests; for the heights
    may sometimes overwhelm the picture and spoil the effect. And so it is with certain
    great pages of <i>Tristan</i>. We may take for example the verses which tell of
    excruciating expectation&mdash;in the second act, Isolde's expectation on the night
    filled with desire; and, in the third act,<a name="page94"
    id="page94"/>Tristan's expectation, as he lies wounded and delirious,
    waiting for the vessel that brings Isolde and death&mdash;or we may take the Prelude,
    that expression of eternal desire that is like a restless sea for ever moaning and
    beating itself upon the shore.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>The quality that touches me most deeply in <i>Tristan</i> is the evidence of
    honesty and sincerity in a man who was treated by his enemies as a charlatan that
    used superficial and grossly material means to arrest and amaze the public eye. What
    drama is more sober or more disdainful of exterior effect than <i>Tristan</i>? Its
    restraint is almost carried to excess. Wagner rejected any picturesque episode in it
    that was irrelevant to his subject. The man who carried all Nature in his
    imagination, who at his will made the storms of the <i>Walk&uuml;re</i> rage, or the
    soft light of Good Friday shine, would not even depict a bit of the sea round the
    vessel in the first act. Believe me, that must have been a sacrifice, though he
    wished it so. It pleased him to enclose this terrible drama within the four walls of
    a chamber of tragedy. There are hardly any choruses; there is nothing to distract
    one's attention from the mystery of human souls; there are only two real
    parts&mdash;those of the lovers; and if there is a third, it belongs to Destiny, into
    whose hands the victims are delivered. What a fine seriousness there is in this love
    play. Its passion remains sombre and stern; there is no laughter in it, only a belief
    which is almost religious, more <a name="page95"
    id="page95"/>religious perhaps in its sincerity than that of
    <i>Parsifal</i>.</p>
    <p>It is a lesson for dramatists to see a man suppressing all frivolous trifling and
    empty episodes in order to concentrate his subject entirely on the inner life of two
    living souls. In that Wagner is our master, a better, stronger, and more profitable
    master to follow, in spite of his mistakes, than all the other literary and dramatic
    authors of his time.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>I see that criticism has filled a larger place in these notes than I meant it to
    do. But in spite of that, I love <i>Tristan</i>; for me and for others of my time it
    has long been an intoxicating draught. And it has never lost anything of its
    grandeur; the years have left its beauty untouched, and it is for me the highest
    point of art reached by anyone since Beethoven's death.</p>
    <p>But as I was listening to it the other evening I could not help thinking: Ah,
    Wagner, you will one day go too, and join Gluck and Bach and Monteverde and
    Palestrina and all the great souls whose names still live among men, but whose
    thoughts are only felt by a handful of the initiated, who try in vain to revive the
    past. You, also, are already of the past, though you were the steady light of our
    youth, the strong source of life and death, of desire and renouncement, whence we
    drew our moral force and our power of resistance against the world. And the world,
    ever greedy for new sensations, goes on its way amid the unceasing ebb and flow of
    its <a name="page96" id="page96"/>desires.
    Already its thoughts have changed, and new musicians are making new songs for the
    future. But it is the voice of a century of tempest that passes with you.</p>

    <p>M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns has had the rare honour of becoming a classic during his
    lifetime. His name, though it was long unrecognised, now commands universal respect,
    not less by his worth of character than by the perfection of his art. No artist has
    troubled so little about the public, or been more indifferent to criticism whether
    popular or expert. As a child he had a sort of physical repulsion for outward
    success:</p>

    <p>Later on, he achieved success by a long and painful struggle, in which he had to
    fight against the kind of stupid criticism that condemned him "to listen to one of

    <p>M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns has now grown old, and his fame has spread abroad, but he has
    not capitulated. Not many years ago he wrote to a German journalist: "I take very
    little notice of either praise or censure, not because I have an exalted idea of my
    own merits (which would be foolish), but because in doing my work, and fulfilling the
    function of my nature, as an apple-tree grows apples, I have no need to trouble
    myself with other people's views."<a name="FNanchor_113_113"
    id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a><a name="page99" id="page99"/></p>
    <p>Such independence is rare at any time; but it is very rare in our day, when the
    power of public opinion is tyrannical; and it is rarest of all in France, where
    artists are perhaps more sociable than in other countries. Of all qualities in an
    artist it is the most precious; for it forms the foundation of his character, and is
    the guarantee of his conscience and innate strength. So we must not hide it under a
    bushel.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>The significance of M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns in art is a double one, for one must judge
    him from the inside as well as the outside of France. He stands for something
    exceptional in French music, something which was almost unique until just lately:
    that is, a great classical spirit and a fine breadth of musical culture&mdash;German
    culture, we must say, since the foundation of all modern art rests on the German
    classics. French music of the nineteenth century is rich in clever artists,
    imaginative writers of melody, and skilful dramatists; but it is poor in true
    musicians, and in good and solid workmanship. Apart from two or three splendid
    exceptions, our composers have too much the character of gifted amateurs who compose
    music as a pastime, and regard it, not as a special form of thought, but as a sort of
    dress for literary ideas. Our musical education is superficial: it may be got for a
    few years, in a formal way, at a Conservatoire, but it is not within reach of all;
    the child does not breathe music as, in a way, he breathes the atmosphere of <a name="page100" id="page100"/>literature and
    oratory; and although nearly everyone in France has an instinctive feeling for
    beautiful writing, only a very few people care for beautiful music. From this arise
    the common faults and failings in our music. It has remained a luxurious art; it has
    not become, like German music, the poetical expression of the people's thought.</p>
    <p>To bring this about we should need a combination of conditions that are very rare
    in France; though such conditions went to the making of Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns. He
    had not only remarkable natural talent, but came of a family of ardent musicians, who
    devoted themselves to his education. At five years of age he was nourished on the
    orchestral score of <i>Don Juan</i>;<a name="FNanchor_114_114"
    id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> as a
    little boy</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>"De dix ans, d&eacute;licat, fr&ecirc;le, le teint jaunet,<br />
        </span> <span>Mais confiant, na&iuml;f, plein d'ardeur et de joie,"<a

    <p>he "measured himself against Beethoven and Mozart" by playing in a public concert;
    at sixteen years of age he wrote his <i>Premi&egrave;re Symphonie</i>. As he grew
    older he soaked himself in the music of Bach and H&auml;ndel, and was able to compose
    at will after the manner of Rossini, Verdi, Schumann, and Wagner.<a
    name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116"
    class="fnanchor">[116]</a> He has written excellent music in all styles&mdash;the
    Grecian style, and that of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. His
    compositions are of every kind: masses, grand operas, <a
    name="page101" id="page101"/>light operas, cantatas, symphonies,
    symphonic poems; music for the orchestra, the organ, the piano, the voice, and
    chamber music. He is the learned editor of Gluck and Rameau; and is thus not only an
    artist, but an artist who can talk about his art. He is an unusual figure in
    France&mdash;one would have thought rather to find his home in Germany.</p>
    <p>In Germany, however, they make no mistake about him. There, the name of Camille
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns stands for the French classical spirit, and is thought worthiest to
    represent us in music from the time of Berlioz until the appearance of the young
    school of C&eacute;sar Franck&mdash;though Franck himself is as yet little known in
    Germany. M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns possesses, indeed, some of the best qualities of a
    French artist, and among them the most important quality of all&mdash;perfect
    clearness of conception. It is remarkable how little this learned artist is bothered
    by his learning, and how free he is from all pedantry. Pedantry is the plague of
    German art, and the greatest men have not escaped it. I am not speaking of Brahms,
    who was ravaged with it, but of delightful geniuses like Schumann, or of powerful
    ones like Bach. "This unnatural art wearies one like the sanctimonious salon of some
    little provincial town; it stifles one, it is enough to kill one."<a
    name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117"
    class="fnanchor">[117]</a> "Saint-Sa&euml;ns is not a pedant," wrote Gounod; "he has
    <a name="page102" id="page102"/>remained too
    much of a child and become too clever for that." Besides, he has always been too much
    of a Frenchman.</p>
    <p>Sometimes Saint-Sa&euml;ns reminds me of one of our eighteenth-century writers.
    Not a writer of the <i>Encyclop&eacute;die</i>, nor one of Rousseau's camp, but
    rather of Voltaire's school. He has a clearness of thought, an elegance and precision
    of expression, and a quality of mind that make his music "not only noble, but very
    noble, as coming of a fine race and distinguished family."<a name="FNanchor_118_118"
    id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>
    <p>He has also excellent discernment, of an unemotional kind; and he is "calm in
    spirit, restrained in imagination, and keeps his self-control even in the midst of
    the most disturbing emotions."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> This discernment is the enemy of
    anything approaching obscurity of thought or mysticism; and its outcome was that
    curious book, <i>Probl&egrave;mes et Myst&egrave;res</i>&mdash;a misleading title,
    for the spirit of reason reigns there and makes an appeal to young people to protect
    "the light of a menaced world" against "the mists of the North, Scandinavian gods,
    Indian divinities, Catholic miracles, Lourdes, spiritualism, occultism, and
    obscurantism."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>
    <p>His love and need of liberty is also of the eighteenth century. One may say that
    liberty is his only passion. "I am passionately fond of liberty," he wrote.<a
    name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121"
    class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page103" id="page103"/>And he has
    proved it by the absolute fearlessness of his judgments on art; for not only has he
    reasoned soundly against Wagner, but dared to criticise the weaknesses of Gluck and
    Mozart, the errors of Weber and Berlioz, and the accepted opinions about Gounod; and
    this classicist, who was nourished on Bach, goes so far as to say: "The performance
    of works by Bach and H&auml;ndel to-day is an idle amusement," and that those who
    wish to revive their art are like "people who would live in an old mansion that has
    been uninhabited for centuries."<a name="FNanchor_122_122"
    id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> He
    went even further; he criticised his own work and contradicted his own opinions. His
    love of liberty made him form, at different periods, different opinions of the same
    work. He thought that people had a right to change their opinions, as sometimes they
    deceived themselves. It seemed to him better boldly to admit an error than to be the
    slave of consistency. And this same feeling showed itself in other matters besides
    art: in ethics, as is shown by some verses which he addressed to a young friend,
    urging him not to be bound by a too rigid austerity:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>"Je sens qu'une triste chim&egrave;re<br />
        </span> <span>A toujours assombri ton &acirc;me: la Vertu...."<a
        name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123"
        class="fnanchor">[123]</a><br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>and in metaphysics also, where he judges religions, faith, and the Gospels with a
    quiet freedom of thought, seeking in Nature alone the basis of morals and
    society.<a name="page104" id="page104"/></p>
    <p>Here are some of his opinions, taken at random from <i>Probl&egrave;mes et
    Myst&egrave;res</i>:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"As science advances, God recedes."</p>
      <p>"The soul is only a medium for the expression of thought."</p>
      <p>"The discouragement of work, the weakening of character, the sharing of one's
      goods under pain of death&mdash;this is the Gospel teaching on the foundation of
      society."</p>
      <p>"The Christian virtues are not social virtues."</p>
      <p>"Nature is without aim: she is an endless circle, and leads us nowhere."</p>
    </div>
    <p>His thoughts are unfettered and full of love for humanity and a sense of the
    responsibility of the individual. He called Beethoven "the greatest, the only really
    great artist," because he upheld the idea of universal brotherhood. His mind is so
    comprehensive that he has written books on philosophy, on the theatre, on classical
    painting,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> as well as scientific essays,<a
    name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125"
    class="fnanchor">[125]</a> volumes of verse, and even plays.<a
    name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126"
    class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>
    <p>He has been able to take up all sorts of things, I will not say with equal skill,
    but with discernment and undeniable ability. He shows a type of mind rare among
    artists and, above all, among musicians. The two principles that he enunciates and
    himself <a name="page105" id="page105"/>follows
    out are: "Keep free from all exaggeration" and "Preserve the soundness of your mind's
    health."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> They are certainly not the
    principles of a Beethoven or a Wagner, and it would be rather difficult to find a
    noted musician of the last century who had applied them. They tell us, without need
    of comment, what is distinctive about M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns, and what is defective in
    him. He is not troubled by any sort of passion. Nothing disturbs the clearness of his
    reason. "He has no prejudices; he takes no side"<a name="FNanchor_128_128"
    id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128"
    class="fnanchor">[128]</a>&mdash;one might add, not even his own, since he is not
    afraid to change his views&mdash;"he does not pose as a reformer of anything"; he is
    altogether independent, perhaps almost too much so. He seems sometimes as if he did
    not know what to do with his liberty. Goethe would have said, I think, that he needed
    a little more of the devil in him.</p>
    <p>His most characteristic mental trait seems to be a languid melancholy, which has
    its source in a rather bitter feeling of the futility of life;<a
    name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129"
    class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and this is accompanied by fits of weariness which are not
    altogether healthy, followed by capricious moods and nervous gaiety, and a freakish
    liking for burlesque and mimicry. It is his eager, restless spirit that makes him
    rush about the world writing Breton and Auvergnian rhapsodies, Persian songs,
    Algerian suites, Portuguese barcarolles, Danish, Russian, or Arabian caprices,
    souvenirs of Italy, African fan<a name="page106"
    id="page106"/>tasias, and Egyptian concertos; and, in the same way,
    he roams through the ages, writing Greek tragedies, dance music of the sixteenth and
    seventeenth centuries, and preludes and fugues of the eighteenth. But in all these
    exotic and archaic reflections of times and countries through which his fancy
    wanders, one recognises the gay, intelligent countenance of a Frenchman on his
    travels, who idly follows his inclinations, and does not trouble to enter very deeply
    into the spirit of the people he meets, but gleans all he can, and then reproduces it
    with a French complexion&mdash;after the manner of Montaigne in Italy, who compared
    Verona to Poitiers, and Padua to Bordeaux, and who, when he was in Florence, paid
    much less attention to Michelangelo than to "a very strangely shaped sheep, and an
    animal the size of a large mastiff, shaped like a cat and striped with black and
    white, which they called a tiger."</p>
    <p>From a purely musical point of view there is some resemblance between M.
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns and Mendelssohn. In both of them we find the same intellectual
    restraint, the same balance preserved among the heterogeneous elements of their work.
    These elements are not common to both of them, because the time, the country, and the
    surroundings in which they lived are not the same; and there is also a great
    difference in their characters. Mendelssohn is more ingenuous and religious; M.
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns is more of a dilettante and more sensuous. They are not so much
    kindred spirits by their science as good company by a common purity of taste, a sense
    of <a name="page107" id="page107"/>rhythm, and
    a genius for method, which gave all they wrote a neo-classic character.</p>
    <p>As for the things that directly influenced M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns, they are so
    numerous that it would be difficult and rather bold of me to pretend to be able to
    pick them out. His remarkable capacity for assimilation has often moved him to write
    in the style of Wagner or Berlioz, of H&auml;ndel or Rameau, of Lulli or Charpentier,
    or even of some English harpsichord or clavichord player of the sixteenth century,
    like William Byrd&mdash;whose airs are introduced quite naturally in the music of
    <i>Henry VIII</i>; but we must remember that these are deliberate imitations, the
    amusements of a virtuoso, about which M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns never deceives himself. His
    memory serves him as he pleases, but he is never troubled by it.</p>
    <p>As far as one can judge, M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns' musical ideas are infused with the
    spirit of the great classics belonging to the end of the eighteenth century&mdash;far
    more, whatever people may say, with the spirit of Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart, than
    with the spirit of Bach. Schumann's seductiveness also left its mark upon him, and he
    has felt the influence of Gounod, Bizet, and Wagner. But a stronger influence was
    that of Berlioz, his friend and master,<a name="FNanchor_130_130"
    id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and,
    above all, that of Liszt. We must stop at this last name.</p>
    <p>M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns has good reason for liking Liszt, for Liszt was also a lover
    of freedom, and had shaken off traditions and pedantry, and scorned German <a name="page108" id="page108"/>routine; and he liked
    him, too, because his music was a reaction from the stiff school of Brahms.<a
    name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131"
    class="fnanchor">[131]</a> He was enthusiastic about Liszt's work, and was one of the
    earliest and most ardent champions of that new music of which Liszt was the leading
    spirit&mdash;of that "programme" music which Wagner's triumph seemed to have nipped
    in the bud, but which has suddenly and gloriously burst into life again in the works
    of Richard Strauss. "Liszt is one of the great composers of our time," wrote M.
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns; "he has dared more than either Weber, or Mendelssohn, or Schubert,
    or Schumann. He has created the symphonic poem. He is the deliverer of instrumental
    music.... He has proclaimed the reign of free music."<a name="FNanchor_132_132"
    id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> This
    was not said impulsively in a moment of enthusiasm; M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns has always
    held this opinion. All his life he has remained faithful to his admiration of
    Liszt&mdash;since 1858, when he dedicated a <i>Veni Creator</i> to "the Abb&eacute;
    Liszt," until 1886, when, a few months after Liszt's death, he dedicated his
    masterpiece, the <i>Symphonic avec orgue</i>, "To the memory of Franz Liszt."<a
    name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133"
    class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>
    <p>"<a name="page109" id="page109"/>People have
    not hesitated to scoff at what they call my weakness for Liszt's works. But even if
    the feelings of affection and gratitude that he inspired in me did come like a prism
    and interpose themselves between my eyes and his face, I do not see anything greatly
    to be regretted in it.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> I had not yet felt the charm of
    his personal fascination, I had neither heard nor seen him, and I did not owe him
    anything at all, when my interest was gripped in reading his first symphonic poems;
    and when later they pointed the way which was to lead to <i>La Danse macabre</i>,
    <i>Le Rouet d'Omphale</i>, and other works of the same nature, I am sure that my
    judgment was not biassed by any prejudice in his favour, and that I alone was
    responsible for what I did."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>
    <p>This influence seems to me to explain some of M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns' work. Not only
    is this influence evident in his symphonic poems&mdash;some of his best
    work&mdash;but it is to be found in his suites for orchestra, his fantasias, and his
    rhapsodies, where the descriptive and narrative element is strong. "Music should
    charm unaided," said M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns; "but its effect is much finer when we use
    our imagination and let it flow in some particular channel, thus <a name="page110" id="page110"/>imaging the music. It
    is then that all the faculties of the soul are brought into play for the same end.
    What art gains from this is not greater beauty, but a wider field for its
    scope&mdash;that is, a greater variety of form and a larger liberty."<a
    name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136"
    class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>And so we find that M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns has taken part in the vigorous attempt of
    modern German symphony writers to bring into music some of the power of the other
    arts: poetry, painting, philosophy, romance, drama&mdash;the whole of life. But what
    a gulf divides them and him! A gulf made up, not only of diversities of style, but of
    the difference between two races and two worlds. Beside the frenzied outpourings of
    Richard Strauss, who flounders uncertainly between mud and debris and genius, the
    Latin art of Saint-Sa&euml;ns rises up calm and ironical. His delicacy of touch, his
    careful moderation, his happy grace, "which enters the soul by a thousand little
    paths,"<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> bring with them the pleasures of
    beautiful speech and honest thought; and we cannot but feel their charm. Compared
    with the restless and troubled art of to-day, his music strikes us by its calm, its
    tranquil harmonies, its velvety modulations, its crystal clearness, its smooth and
    flowing style, and an elegance that cannot be put into words. Even his classic
    coldness does us good by its reaction against the exaggerations, sincere as they are,
    of the new school. At times one feels oneself carried<a
    name="page111" id="page111"/>back to Mendelssohn, even to Spontini
    and the school of Gluck. One seems to be travelling in a country that one knows and
    loves; and yet in M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns' works one does not find any direct resemblance
    to the works of other composers; for with no one are reminiscences rarer than with
    this master who carries all the old masters in his mind&mdash;it is his spirit that
    is akin to theirs. And that is the secret of his personality and his value to us; he
    brings to our artistic unrest a little of the light and sweetness of other times. His
    compositions are like fragments of another world.</p>
    <p>"From time to time," he said, in speaking of <i>Don Giovanni</i>, "in the sacred
    earth of Hellene we find a fragment, an arm, the debris of a torso, scratched and
    damaged by the ravages of time; it is only the shadow of the god that the sculptor's
    chisel once created; but the charm is somehow still there, the sublime style is
    radiant in spite of everything."<a name="FNanchor_138_138"
    id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>
    <p>And so with this music. It is sometimes a little pale, a little too restrained;
    but in a phrase, in a few harmonies, there will shine out a clear vision of the
    past.</p>

      <p>"I consider that criticism is useless, I would even say that it is harmful....
      Criticism generally means the opinion some man or other holds about another
      person's work. How can that opinion help forward the growth of art? It is
      interesting to know the ideas, even the erroneous ideas, of geniuses and men of
      great talent, such as Goethe, Schumann, Wagner, Sainte-Beuve, and Michelet, when
      they wish to indulge in criticism; but it is of no interest at all to know whether
      Mr. So-and-so likes, or does not like, such-and-such dramatic or musical work."<a
      name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139"
      class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>So writes M. Vincent d'Indy.</p>
    <p>After such an expression of opinion one imagines that a critic ought to feel some
    embarrassment in writing about M. Vincent d'Indy. And I myself ought to be the more
    concerned in the matter, for in the number of the review where the above was written
    the only other opinions expressed with equal conviction belonged to the author of
    this book. There is only one thing to be done&mdash;to copy M. d'Indy's example; for
    that forsworn enemy of criticism is himself a keen critic.<a
    name="page113" id="page113"/></p>
    <p>It is not altogether on M. d'Indy's musical gifts that I want to dwell. It is
    known that in Europe to-day he is one of the masters of dramatic musical expression,
    of orchestral colouring, and of the science of style. But that is not the end of his
    attainments; he has artistic originality, which springs from something deeper still.
    When an artist has some worth, you will find it not only in his work but in his
    being. So we will endeavour to explore M. d'Indy's being.</p>
    <p>M. d'Indy's personality is not a mysterious one. On the contrary, it is open and
    clear as daylight; and we see this in his musical work, in his artistic activities,
    and in his writings. To his own writings we may apply the exception of his rule about
    criticism in favour of a small number of men whose thoughts are interesting even when
    they are erroneous. It would be a pity indeed not to know M. d'Indy's
    thoughts&mdash;even the erroneous ones; for they let us catch a glimpse, not only of
    the ideas of an eminent artist, but of certain surprising characteristics of the
    thought of our time. M. d'Indy has closely studied the history of his art; but the
    chief interest of his writings lies rather in their unconscious expression of the
    spirit of modern art than in what they tell us about the past.</p>
    <p>M. d'Indy is not a man hedged in by the boundaries of his art; his mind is open
    and well fertilised. Musicians nowadays are no longer entirely absorbed in their
    notes, but let their minds go out to other interests. And it is not one of the least
    interesting phenomena of French music to-day that gives us these learned and
    thoughtful composers, who are <a name="page114"
    id="page114"/>conscious of what they create, and bring to their art a
    keen critical faculty, like that of M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns, M. Dukas, or M. d'Indy. From
    M. d'Indy we have had scholarly editions of Rameau, Destouches, and Salomon de Rossi.
    Even in the middle of rehearsals of <i>L'&Eacute;tranger</i> at Brussels he was
    working at a reconstruction of Monteverde's <i>Orfeo</i>. He has published selections
    of folk-songs with critical notes, essays on Beethoven's predecessors, a history of
    Musical Composition, and debates and lectures. This fine intellectual culture is not,
    however, the most remarkable of M. d'Indy's characteristics, though it may have been
    the most remarked. Other musicians share this culture with him; and his real
    distinction lies in his moral and almost religious qualities, and it is this side of
    him that gives him an unusual interest for us among other contemporary artists.</p>

    <p>We must consider a little this singular book, where a living science and a Gothic
    spirit are closely intermingled (I use the word "Gothic" in its best sense; I know it
    is the highest praise one can give M. d'Indy). This work has not received the
    attention it deserves. It is a record of the spirit of contemporary art; and if it
    stands rather apart from other writings, it should not be allowed to pass unnoticed
    on that account.</p>
    <p>In this book, Faith is shown to be everything&mdash;the beginning and the end. We
    learn how it fans the flame of genius, nourishes thought, directs work, <a name="page116" id="page116"/>and governs even the
    modulations and the style of a musician. There is a passage in it that one would
    think was of the thirteenth century; it is curious, but not without dignity:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"One should have an aim in the progressive march of modulations, as one has in
      the different stages of life. The reason, instincts, and faith that guide a man in
      the troubles of his life also guide the musician in his choice of modulations. Thus
      useless and contradictory modulations, an undecided balance between light and
      shade, produce a painful and confusing impression on the hearer, comparable to that
      which a poor human being inspires when he is feeble and inconsistent, buffeted
      between the East and the West in the course of his unhappy life, without an aim and
      without belief."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>This book seems to be of the Middle Ages by reason of a sort of scholastic spirit
    of abstraction and classification.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"In artistic creation, seven faculties are called into play by the soul: the
      Imagination, the Affections, the Understanding, the Intelligence, the Memory, the
      Will, and the Conscience."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>And again its mediaeval spirit is shown by an extraordinary symbolism, which
    discovers in every<a name="page117"
    id="page117"/>thing (as far as I understand it) the imprint of divine
    mysteries, and the mark of God in Three Persons in such things as the beating of the
    heart and ternary rhythms&mdash;"an admirable application of the principle of the
    Unity of the Trinity"!<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>
    <p>From these remote times comes also M. d'Indy's method of writing history, not by
    tracing facts back to laws, but by deducing, on the contrary, facts from certain
    great general ideas, which have once been admitted, but not proved by frequent
    recurrence, such as: "The origin of art is in religion"<a name="FNanchor_144_144"
    id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144"
    class="fnanchor">[144]</a>&mdash;a fact which is anything but certain. From this
    reasoning it follows that folk-songs are derived from Gregorian chants, and not the
    Gregorian chants from the folk-songs&mdash;as I would sooner believe. The history of
    art may thus become a sort of history of the world in moral achievement. One could
    divide it into two parts: the world before the coming of Pride, and after it.</p>
    <p>"Subdued by the Christian faith, that formidable enemy of man, Pride, rarely
    showed itself in the soul of an artist in the Middle Ages. But with the weakening of
    religious belief, with the spirit of the Reformation applying itself almost at the
    same time to every branch of human learning, we see Pride reappear, and watch its
    veritable Renaissance."<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a><a
    name="page118" id="page118"/></p>
    <p>Finally, this Gothic spirit shows itself&mdash;in a less original way, it is
    true&mdash;in M. d'Indy's religious antipathies, which, in spite of the author's
    goodness of heart and great personal tolerance, constantly break out against the two
    faiths that are rivals to his own; and to them he attributes all the faults of art
    and all the vices of humanity. Each has its offence. Protestantism is made
    responsible for the extremes of individualism;<a name="FNanchor_146_146"
    id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> and
    Judaism, for the absurdities of its customs and the weakness of its moral sense.<a
    name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147"
    class="fnanchor">[147]</a> I do not know which of the two is the more soundly
    belaboured; the second has the privilege of being so, not only in writing, but in
    pictures.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The worst of it is, these
    antipathies are apt to spoil the fairness of M. d'Indy's artistic judgment. It goes
    without saying that the Jewish musicians are treated with scant consideration; and
    even the great Protestant musicians, giants in their art, do not escape rebuke. If
    Goudimel is mentioned, it is because he was Palestrina's master, and his achievement
    of "turning the Calvinist psalms into chorales" is dismissed as being of little
    importance.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page119" id="page119"/>
    H&auml;ndel's oratorios are spoken of as "chilling, and, frankly speaking,
    tedious."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Bach himself escapes with this
    qualification: "If he is great, it is not because of, but in spite of the dogmatic
    and parching spirit of the Reformation."<a name="FNanchor_151_151"

    <p>I will not try to play the part of judge; for a man is sufficiently judged by his
    own writings. And, after all, it is rather interesting to meet people who are sincere
    and not afraid to speak their minds. I will admit that I rather enjoy&mdash;a little
    perversely, perhaps&mdash;some of these extreme opinions, where the writer's
    personality stands strongly revealed.</p>
    <p>So the old Gothic spirit still lives among us, and informs the mind of one of our
    best-known artists, and also, without doubt, the minds of hundreds of those who
    listen to him and admire him. M. Louis Laloy has shown the persistence of certain
    forms of plain-song in M. Debussy's <i>Pell&eacute;as</i>; and in a dim sense of
    far-away kinship he finds the cause of the mysterious charm that such music holds for
    some of us.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> This learned paradox is possible.
    Why not? The mixtures of race and the vicissitudes of history have given us so full
    and complex a soul that we may very well find its beginnings there, if it pleases
    us&mdash;or the beginnings of quite other things. Of beginnings there is no end; the
    choice is quite <a name="page120" id="page120"/>
    embarrassing, and I imagine one's inclination has as much to do with the matter as
    one's temperament.</p>
    <p>However that may be, M. d'Indy hails from the Middle Ages, and not from antiquity
    (which does not exist for him<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>), or from the Renaissance, which
    he confounds with the Reformation (though the two sisters are enemies) in order to
    crush it the better.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> "Let us take for models," he

    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>In this return to the Gothic spirit, in this awakening of faith, there is a
    name&mdash;a modern one this time&mdash;that they are fond of quoting at the
    <i>Schola</i>; it is that of C&eacute;sar Franck, under whose direction the little
    Conservatoire in the Rue Saint-Jacques was placed. And indeed they could quote no
    better name than that of this simple-hearted man. Nearly all who came into contact
    with him felt his irresistible charm&mdash;a charm that has perhaps a great deal to
    do with the influence that his works still have on French music to-day. None has felt
    Franck's power, both morally and musically, more than M. Vincent d'Indy; and none
    holds a more profound reverence for the man whose pupil he was for so long.</p>
    <p><a name="page121" id="page121"/>The first
    time I saw M. d'Indy was at a concert of the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale</i>,
    in the Salle Pleyel, in 1888. They were playing several of Franck's works; among
    others, for the first time, his admirable <i>Th&egrave;me, fugue, et variation</i>,
    for the harmonium and pianoforte, a composition in which the spirit of Bach is
    mingled with a quite modern tenderness. Franck was conducting, and M. d'Indy was at
    the pianoforte. I shall always remember his reverential manner towards the old
    musician, and how careful he was to follow his directions; one would have said he was
    a diligent and obedient pupil. It was a touching homage from one who had already
    proved himself a master by works like <i>Le Chant de la cloche</i>,
    <i>Wallenstein</i>, <i>La Symphonie sur un th&egrave;me montagnard</i>, and who was
    perhaps at that time better known and more popular than C&eacute;sar Franck himself.
    Since then twenty years have passed, and I still see M. d'Indy as I saw him that
    evening; and, whatever may happen in the future, his memory for me will be always
    associated with that of the grand old artist, presiding with his fatherly smile over
    the little gathering of the faithful.</p>
    <p>Of all the characteristics of Franck's fine moral nature, the most remarkable was
    his religious faith. It must have astonished the artists of his time, who were even
    more destitute of such a thing than they are now. It made itself felt in some of his
    followers, especially in those who were near the master's heart, as M. d'Indy was.
    The religious thought of the latter reflects in some degree the thought of his
    master; though the shape of that thought may have undergone unconscious alteration. I
    do not <a name="page122" id="page122"/>know if
    Franck altogether fits the conception people have of him to-day. I do not want to
    introduce personal memories of him here. I knew him well enough to love him, and to
    catch a glimpse of the beauty and sincerity of his soul; but I did not know him well
    enough to discover the secrets of his mind. Those who had the happiness of being his
    intimate friends seem always to represent him as a mystic who shut himself away from
    the spirit of his time. I hope at some future date one of his friends will publish
    some of the conversations that he had with him, of which I have heard. But this man
    who had so strong a faith was also very independent. In his religion he had no
    doubts: it was the mainspring of his life; though faith with him was much more a
    matter of feeling than a matter of doctrine. But all was feeling with Franck, and
    reason made little appeal to him. His religious faith did not disturb his mind, for
    he did not measure men and their works by its rules; and he would have been incapable
    of putting together a history of art according to the Bible. This great Catholic had
    at times a very pagan soul; and he could enjoy without a qualm the musical
    dilettantism of Renan and the sonorous nihilism of Leconte de Lisle. There were no
    limits to his vast sympathies. He did not attempt to criticise the thing he
    loved&mdash;understanding was already in his heart. Perhaps he was right; and perhaps
    there was more trouble in the depths of his heart than the valiant serenity of its
    surface would lead us to believe.</p>
    <p>His faith too.... I know how dangerous it is to <a
    name="page123" id="page123"/>interpret a musician's feelings by his
    music; but how can we do otherwise when we are told by Franck's followers that the
    expression of the soul is the only end and aim of music? Do we find his faith, as
    expressed through his music always full of peace and calm?<a name="FNanchor_156_156"
    id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> I
    ask those who love that music because they find some of their own sadness reflected
    there. Who has not felt the secret tragedies that some of his musical passages
    enfold&mdash;those short, characteristically abrupt phrases which seem to rise in
    supplication to God, and often fall back in sadness and in tears? It is not all light
    in that soul; but the light that is there does not affect us less because it shines
    from afar,</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">

        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>And so Franck seems to me to differ from M. d'Indy in that he has not the latter's
    urgent desire for clearness.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Clearness is the distinguishing quality of M. d'Indy's mind. There are no shadows
    about him. His ideas and his art are as clear as the look that gives so much youth to
    his face. For him to examine, <a name="page124"
    id="page124"/>to arrange, to classify, to combine, is a necessity. No
    one is more French in spirit. He has sometimes been taxed with Wagnerism, and it is
    true that he has felt Wagner's influence very strongly. But even when this influence
    is most apparent it is only superficial: his true spirit is remote from Wagner's. You
    may find in <i>Fervaal</i> a few trees like those in <i>Siegfried's</i> forest; but
    the forest itself is not the same; broad avenues have been cut in it, and daylight
    fills the caverns of the Niebelungs.</p>
    <p>This love of clearness is the ruling factor of M. d'Indy's artistic nature. And
    this is the more remarkable, for his nature is far from being a simple one. By his
    wide musical education and his constant thirst for knowledge he has acquired a very
    varied and almost contradictory learning. It must be remembered that M. d'Indy is a
    musician familiar with the music of other countries and other times; all kinds of
    musical forms are floating in his mind; and he seems sometimes to hesitate between
    them. He has arranged these forms into three principal classes, which seem to him to
    be models of musical art: the decorative art of the singers of plain-song, the
    architectural art of Palestrina and his followers, and the expressive art of the
    great Italians of the seventeenth century.<a name="FNanchor_158_158"
    id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> But
    in doing this is not his eclecticism trying to reconcile arts that are naturally
    disunited? Again, we must remember that M. d'Indy has had direct or indirect contact
    with some of the greatest musical personalities of our time: with Wagner, Liszt,
    Brahms, and C&eacute;sar Franck.</p>
    <p><a name="page125" id="page125"/>And he has
    been readily attracted by them; for he is not one of those egotistic geniuses whose
    thoughts are fixed on his own interests, nor has he one of those carnivorous minds
    that sees nothing, looks for nothing, and relishes nothing, unless it may be
    afterwards useful to it. His sympathies are readily with others, he is happy in
    giving homage to their greatness, and quick to appreciate their charm. He speaks
    somewhere of the "irresistible need of transformation" that every artist feels.<a
    name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159"
    class="fnanchor">[159]</a> But in order to escape being overwhelmed by conflicting
    elements and interests, one should have great force of feeling or will, in order to
    be able to eliminate what is not necessary, and choose out and transform what is. M.
    d'Indy eliminates hardly anything; he makes use of it. In his music he exercises the
    qualities of an army general: understanding of his purpose and the patience to attain
    it, a perfect knowledge of the means at his disposal, the spirit of order, and
    command over his work and himself. Despite the variety of the materials he employs,
    the whole is always clear. One might almost reproach him with being too clear; he
    seems to simplify too much.</p>
    <p>Nothing helps one to grasp the essence of M. d'Indy's personality more than his
    last dramatic work. His personality shows itself plainly in all his compositions, but
    nowhere is it more evident than in <i>L'&Eacute;tranger</i>.<a
    name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160"
    class="fnanchor">[160]</a><a name="page126"
    id="page126"/></p>
    <p>The scene of <i>L'&Eacute;tranger</i> is laid in France, by the sea, whose
    murmuring calm we hear in a symphonic introduction. The fishermen are coming back to
    port; the fishing has been bad. But one among them, "a man about forty years old,
    with a sad and dignified air," has been more fortunate than the others. The fishermen
    envy him, and vaguely suspect him of sorcery. He tries to enter into friendly
    conversation with them, and offers his catch to a poor family. But in vain; his
    advances are repulsed and his generosity is eyed with suspicion. He is a
    stranger&mdash;the Stranger.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Evening falls, and the angelus
    rings. Some work-girls come trooping out of their workshop, singing a merry
    folk-song.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> One of the young girls, Vita,
    goes up to the Stranger and speaks to him, for she alone, of all the village, is his
    friend. The two feel themselves drawn together by a secret sympathy. Vita confides
    artlessly in the unknown man; they love each other though they do not admit it. The
    Stranger tries to repress his feelings; for Vita is young and already affianced, and
    he thinks that he has no right to claim her. But Vita, offended by his coldness,
    <a name="page127" id="page127"/>seeks to wound
    him, and succeeds. In the end he betrays himself. "Yes, he loves her, and she knew it
    well. But now that he has told her so, he will never see her again; and he bids her
    good-bye."</p>
    <p>That is the first act. Up to this point we seem to be witnessing a very human and
    realistic drama&mdash;the ordinary story of the man who tries to do good and receives
    ingratitude, and the sad tragedy of old age that comes to a heart still young and
    unable to resign itself to growing old. But the music puts us on our guard. We had
    heard its religious tone when the Stranger was speaking, and it seemed to us that we
    recognised a liturgical melody in the principal theme. What secret is being hidden
    from us? Are we not in France? Yet, in spite of the folk-song and a passing breath of
    the sea, the atmosphere of the Church and C&eacute;sar Franck is evident. Who is this
    Stranger?</p>
    <p>He tells us in the second act.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"My name? I have none. I am He who dreams; I am He who loves. I have passed
      through many countries, and sailed on many seas, loving the poor and needy,
      dreaming of the happiness of the brotherhood of man."</p>
      <p>"Where have I seen you?&mdash;for I know you."</p>
      <p>"Where? you ask. But everywhere: under the warm sun of the East, by the white
      oceans of the Pole.... I have found you everywhere, for you are Beauty itself, you
      are immortal Love!"</p>
    </div>
    <p>The music is not without a certain nobility, and <a
    name="page128" id="page128"/>bears the imprint of the calm, strong
    spirit of belief. But I was sorry that the story was only about a mere entity when I
    had been getting interested in a man. I can never understand the attraction of this
    kind of symbolism. Unless it is allied to sublime powers of creation in metaphysics
    or morals&mdash;such as that possessed by a Goethe or an Ibsen&mdash;I do not see
    what such symbolism can add to life, though I see very well what it takes away from
    it. But it is, after all, a matter of taste; and, anyway, there is nothing in this
    story to astonish us greatly. This transition from realism to symbolism is something
    in opera with which we have grown only too familiar since the time of Wagner.</p>
    <p>But the story does not stop there; for we leave symbolic abstractions to enter a
    still more extraordinary domain, which is removed even farther still from
    realities.</p>
    <p>There had been some talk at the beginning of an emerald that sparkled in the
    Stranger's cap; and this emerald now takes its turn in the action of the piece. "It
    had sparkled formerly in the bows of the boat that carried the body of Lazarus, the
    friend of our Master, Jesus; and the boat had safely reached the port of the
    Phoceans&mdash;without a helm or sails or oars. For by this miraculous stone a clean
    and upright heart could command the sea and the winds." But now that the Stranger has
    done amiss, by falling a victim to passion, its power is gone; so he gives it to
    Vita.</p>
    <p>Then follows a real scene in fairyland. Vita stands before the sea and invokes it
    in an incan<a name="page129" id="page129"/>
    tation full of weird and beautiful vocal music: "O sea! Sinister sea with your angry
    charm, gentle sea with your kiss of death, hear me!" And the sea replies in a song.
    Voices mingle with the orchestra in a symphony of increasing anger. Vita swears she
    will give herself to no one but the Stranger. She lifts the emerald above her head,
    and it shines with a lurid light. "'Receive, O sea, as a token of my oath, the sacred
    stone, the holy emerald! Then may its power be no longer invoked, and none may know
    again its protecting virtue. Jealous sea, take back your own, the last offering of a
    betrothed!' With an impressive gesture she throws the emerald into the waves, and a
    dark green light suddenly shines out against the black sky. This supernatural light
    slowly spreads over the water until it reaches the horizon, and the sea begins to
    roll in great billows." Then the sea takes up its song in an angrier tone; the
    orchestra thunders, and the storm bursts.</p>
    <p>The boats put hurriedly back to land, and one of them seems likely to be dashed to
    pieces on the shore. The whole village turns out to watch the disaster; but the men
    refuse to risk their lives in aid of the shipwrecked crew. Then the Stranger gets
    into a boat, and Vita jumps in after him. The squall redoubles in violence. A wave of
    enormous height breaks on the jetty, flooding the scene with a dazzling green light.
    The crowd recoil in fear. There is a silence; and an old fisherman takes off his
    woollen cap and intones the <i>De Profundis</i>. The villagers take up the
    chant....<a name="page130" id="page130"/></p>
    <p>One may see by this short account what a heterogeneous work it is. Two or three
    quite different worlds are brought into it: the realism of the bourgeois characters
    of Vita's mother and lover is mixed up with symbolisms of Christianity, represented
    by the Stranger, and with the fairy-tale of the magic emerald and the voices of the
    ocean. This complexity, which is evident enough in the poem, is even more evident in
    the music, where a union of different arts and different ideas is attempted. We get
    the art of the folk-song, religious art, the art of Wagner, the art of Franck, as
    well as a note of familiar realism (which is something akin to the Italian
    <i>op&eacute;ra-bouffe</i>) and descriptions of sensation that are quite personal. As
    there are only two short acts, the rapidity of the action only serves to accentuate
    this impression. The changes are very abrupt: we are hurried from a world of human
    beings to a world of abstract ideas, and then taken from an atmosphere of religion to
    a land of fairies. The work is, however, clear enough from a musical point of view.
    The more complex the elements that M. d'Indy gathers round him the more anxious he is
    to bring them into harmony. It is a difficult task, and is only possible when the
    different elements are reduced to their simplest expression and brought down to their
    fundamental qualities&mdash;thus depriving them of the spice of their individuality.
    M. d'Indy puts different styles and ideas on the anvil, and then forges them
    vigorously. It is natural that here and there we should see the mark of the hammer,
    the imprint of his determination; but it is only by <a
    name="page131" id="page131"/>his determination that he welded the
    work into a solid whole.</p>
    <p>Perhaps it is determination that brings unity now and then into M. d'Indy's
    spirit. With reference to this, I will dwell upon one point only, since it is
    curious, and seems to me to be of general artistic interest. M. d'Indy writes his own
    poems for his "<i>actions musicales</i>"&mdash;Wagner's example, it seems, has been
    catching. We have seen how the harmony of a work may suffer through the dual gifts of
    its author; though he may have thought to perfect his composition by writing both
    words and music. But an artist's poetical and musical gifts are not necessarily of
    the same order. A man has not always the same kind of talent in other arts that he
    has in the art which he has made his own&mdash;I am speaking not only of his
    technical skill, but of his temperament as well. Delacroix was of the Romantic school
    in painting, but in literature his style was Classic. We have all known artists who
    were revolutionaries in their own sphere, but conservative and behind the times in
    their opinions about other branches of art. The double gift of poetry and music is in
    M. d'Indy up to a certain point. But is his reason always in agreement with his
    heart?<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page132" id="page132"/>Of course
    his nature is too dignified to let the quarrel be shown openly. His heart obeys the
    commands of his reason, or compromises with it, and by seeming respectful of
    authority saves appearances. His reason, represented here by the poet, likes simple,
    realistic, and relevant action, together with moral or even religious teaching. His
    heart, represented by the musician, is romantic; and if he followed it altogether he
    would wander off to any subject that enabled him to indulge in his love of the
    picturesque, such as the descriptive symphony, or even the old form of opera.</p>
    <p>For myself, I am in sympathy with his heart; and I find his heart is in the right,
    and his reason in the wrong. There is nothing that M. d'Indy has made more his own
    than the art of painting landscapes in music. There is one page in <i>Fervaal</i> at
    the beginning of Act II which calls up misty mountain tops covered with pine forests;
    there is another page in <i>L'&Eacute;tranger</i> where one sees strange lights
    glimmering on the sea while a storm is brooding.<a name="FNanchor_164_164"
    id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> I
    should like to see M. d'Indy give himself up freely, in spite of all theories, to
    this descriptive lyricism, in which he so excels; or I wish at least he would seek
    inspiration in a subject where both his religious beliefs and his imagination could
    find satisfaction: a subject such as one of the beautiful episodes of the Golden
    Legend, or the one which <i>L'&Eacute;tranger</i> itself recalls&mdash;the romantic
    voyage of the Magdalen in Provence. But it is foolish to wish an artist to <a name="page133" id="page133"/>do anything but the
    thing he likes; he is the best judge of what pleases him.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>In this sketchy portrait I must not forget one of the finest of this composer's
    gifts&mdash;his talent as a teacher of music. Everything has fitted M. d'Indy for
    this part. By his knowledge and his precise, orderly mind he must be a perfect
    teacher of composition. If I submit some question of harmony or melodic phrasing to
    his analysis, the result is the essence of clear, logical reasoning; and if the
    reasoning is a little dry and simplifies the thing almost too much, it is still very
    illuminating and from the hand of a master of French prose. And in this I find him
    exercising the same consistent instinct of good sense and sincerity, the same art of
    development, the same seventeenth and eighteenth century principles of classic
    rhetoric that he applies to his music. In truth, M. d'Indy could write a musical
    <i>Discourse on Style</i>, if he wished.</p>
    <p>But, above all, he is gifted with the moral qualities of a teacher&mdash;the
    vocation for teaching, first of all. He has a firm belief in the absolute duty of
    giving instruction in art, and, what is rarer still, in the efficacious virtue of
    that teaching. He readily shares Tolstoy's scorn, which he sometimes quotes, of the
    foolishness of art for art's sake.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"At the bottom of art is this essential condition&mdash;teaching. The aim of art
      is neither gain nor glory; the true aim of art is to teach, to <a name="page134" id="page134"/>elevate gradually
      the spirit of humanity; in a word, to serve in the highest
      sense&mdash;'<i>dienen</i>' as Wagner says by the mouth of the repentant Kundry, in
      the third act of Parsifal."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>There is in this a mixture of Christian humility and aristocratic pride. M. d'Indy
    has a sincere desire for the welfare of humanity, and he loves the people; but he
    treats them with an affectionate kindness, at once protective and tolerant; he
    regards them as children that must be led.<a name="FNanchor_166_166"
    id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>
    <p>The popular art that he extols is not an art belonging to the people, but that of
    an aristocracy interested in the people. He wishes to enlighten them, to mould them,
    to direct them, by means of art. Art is the source of life; it is the spirit of
    progress; it gives the most precious of possessions to the soul&mdash;liberty. And no
    one enjoys this liberty more than the artist. In a lecture to the <i>Schola</i> he
    said:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"What makes the name of 'artist' so splendid is that the artist is
      free&mdash;absolutely free. Look about you, and tell me if from this point of view
      there is any career finer than that of an artist who is conscious of his mission?
      The Army? The Law? The University? Politics?"</p>
    </div>
    <p>And then follows a rather cold appreciation of these different careers.<a name="page135" id="page135"/></p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"There is no need to mention the excessive bureaucracy and officialism which is
      the crying evil of this country. We find everywhere submission to rules and
      servitude to the State. But what government, pope, emperor, or president could
      oblige an artist to think and write against his will? Liberty&mdash;that is the
      true wealth and the most precious inheritance of the artist, the liberty to think,
      and the liberty that no one has the power to take away from us&mdash;that of doing
      our work according to the dictates of our conscience."</p>
    </div>
    <p>Who does not feel the infectious warmth and beauty of these spirited words? How
    this force of enthusiasm and sincerity must grip all young and eager hearts. "There
    are two qualities," says M. d'Indy, on the last page of <i>Cours de Composition</i>,
    "which a master should try to encourage and develop in the spirit of the pupil, for
    without them science is useless; these qualities are an unselfish love of art and
    enthusiasm for good work." And these two virtues radiate from M. d'Indy's personality
    as they do from his writings; that is his power.</p>
    <p>But the best of his teaching lies in his life. One can never speak too highly of
    his disinterested devotion for the good of art. As if it were not enough to put all
    his might into his own creations, M. d'Indy gives his time and the results of his
    study unsparingly to others. Franck gave lessons in order to be able to live; M.
    d'Indy gives them for the pleasure of instructing, and to serve his art and aid <a name="page136" id="page136"/>artists. He directs
    schools, and accepts and almost seeks out the most thankless, though the most
    necessary, kinds of teaching. Or he will apply himself devoutly to the study of the
    past and the resuscitation of some old master. And he seems to take so much pleasure
    in training young minds to appreciate music, or in repairing the injustices of
    history to some fine but forgotten musician, that he almost forgets about himself. To
    what work or to what worker, worthy of interest, or seeming to be so, has he ever
    refused his advice and help? I have known his kindness personally, and I shall always
    be sincerely grateful for it.</p>
    <p>His devotion and his faith have not been in vain. The name of M. d'Indy will be
    associated in history, not only with fine works, but with great works: with the
    <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale de Musique</i>, of which he is president; with the
    <i>Schola Cantorum</i>, which he founded with Charles Bordes, and which he directs;
    with the young French school of music, a group of skilful artists and innovators, to
    whom he is a kind of elder brother, giving them encouragement by his example and
    helping them through the first hard years of struggle; and, lastly, with an awakening
    of music in Europe, with a movement which, after the death of Wagner and Franck,
    attracted the interest of the world by its revival of the art of the Middle Ages and
    the Renaissance. M. d'Indy has been the chief representative of all this artistic
    evolution in France. By his deeds, by his example, and by his spirit, he was among
    the first to stir up interest in the musical education of France to-day.<a name="page137" id="page137"/>He has done more for
    the advancement of our music than the entire official teaching of the Conservatoires
    A day will come when, by the force of things and in spite of all resistance, such a
    man will take the place that belongs to him at the head of the organisation of music
    in France.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>I have tried to unearth M. d'Indy's strongest characteristics, and I think I have
    found them in his faith and in his activity, I am only too aware of the pitfalls that
    have beset me in this attempt; it is always difficult to criticise a man's
    personality, and it is most difficult when he is alive and still in the midst of his
    development. Every man is a mystery, not only to others, but to himself. There is
    something very presumptuous about pretending to know anyone who does not quite know
    himself. And yet one cannot live without forming opinions; it is a necessity of life.
    The people we see and know (or say we know), our friends, and those we love, are
    never what we think them. Often they are not at all like the portrait we conjure up;
    for we walk among the phantoms of our hearts. But still one must go on having
    opinions, and go on constructing and creating things, if we do not want to become
    impotent through inertia. Error is better than doubt, provided we err in good faith;
    and the main thing is to speak out the thing that one really feels and believes. I
    hope M. d'Indy will forgive me if I have gone far wrong, and that he will see in
    these pages a sincere effort to understand him and a keen <a
    name="page138" id="page138"/>sympathy with himself, and even with his
    ideas, though I do not always share them. But I have always thought that in life a
    man's opinions go for very little, and that the only thing that matters is the man
    himself. Freedom of spirit is the greatest happiness one can know; one must be sorry
    for those who have not got it. And there is a secret pleasure in rendering homage to
    another's splendid creed, even though it is one that we do not ourselves profess.</p>

    <h2><a name="RICHARD_STRAUSS" id="RICHARD_STRAUSS"></a>RICHARD STRAUSS</h2>
    <p>The composer of <i>Heldenleben</i> is no longer unknown to Parisians. Every year
    at Colonne's or Chevillard's we see his tall, thin silhouette reappear in the
    conductor's desk. There he is with his abrupt and imperious gestures, his wan and
    anxious face, his wonderfully clear eyes, restless and penetrating at the same time,
    his mouth shaped like a child's, a moustache so fair that it is nearly white, and
    curly hair growing like a crown above his high round forehead.</p>
    <p>I should like to try to sketch here the strange and arresting personality of the
    man who in Germany is considered the inheritor of Wagner's genius&mdash;the man who
    has had the audacity to write, after Beethoven, an Heroic Symphony, and to imagine
    himself the hero.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Richard Strauss is thirty-four years old.<a name="FNanchor_167_167"
    id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> He
    was born in Munich on 11 June, 1864. His father, a well-known virtuoso, was first
    horn in the Royal orchestra, and his mother was a daughter of the brewer Pschorr. He
    was brought up among musical surroundings. At four years old he played the piano, and
    at six he composed little dances,<a name="page140"
    id="page140"/><i>Lieder</i>, sonatas, and even overtures for the
    orchestra. Perhaps this extreme artistic precocity has had something to do with the
    feverish character of his talents, by keeping his nerves in a state of tension and
    unduly exciting his mind. At school he composed choruses for some of Sophocles'
    tragedies. In 1881, Hermann Levi had one of the young collegian's symphonies
    performed by his orchestra. At the University he spent his time in writing
    instrumental music. Then B&uuml;low and Radecke made him play in Berlin; and
    B&uuml;low, who became very fond of him, had him brought to Meiningen as
    <i>Musikdirector</i>. From 1886 to 1889 he held the same post at the
    <i>Hoftheater</i> in Munich. From 1889 to 1894 he was <i>Kapellmeister</i> at the
    <i>Hoftheater</i> in Weimar. He returned to Munich in 1894 as
    <i>Hofkapellmeister</i>, and in 1897 succeeded Hermann Levi. Finally, he left Munich
    for Berlin, where at present he conducts the orchestra of the Royal Opera.</p>
    <p>Two things should be particularly noted in his life: the influence of Alexander
    Ritter&mdash;to whom he has shown much gratitude&mdash;and his travels in the south
    of Europe. He made Ritter's acquaintance in 1885. This musician was a nephew of
    Wagner's, and died some years ago. His music is practically unknown in France, though
    he wrote two well-known operas, <i>Fauler Hans</i> and <i>Wem die Krone</i>? and was
    the first composer, according to Strauss, to introduce Wagnerian methods into the
    <i>Lied</i>. He is often discussed in B&uuml;low's and Liszt's letters. "Before I met
    him," says Strauss, "I had been brought up on strictly classical lines; I had lived
    <a name="page141" id="page141"/>entirely on
    Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and had just been studying Mendelssohn, Chopin,
    Schumann, and Brahms. It is to Ritter alone I am indebted for my knowledge of Liszt
    and Wagner; it was he who showed me the importance of the writings and works of these
    two masters in the history of art. It was he who by years of lessons and kindly
    counsel made me a musician of the future (<i>Zukunftsmusiker</i>), and set my feet on
    a road where now I can walk unaided and alone. It was he also who initiated me in
    Schopenhauer's philosophy."</p>
    <p>The second influence, that of the South, dates from April, 1886, and seems to have
    left an indelible impression upon Strauss. He visited Rome and Naples for the first
    time, and came back with a symphonic fantasia called <i>Aus Italien</i>. In the
    spring of 1892, after a sharp attack of pneumonia, he travelled for a year and a half
    in Greece, Egypt, and Sicily. The tranquillity of these favoured countries filled him
    with never-ending regret. The North has depressed him since then, "the eternal grey
    of the North and its phantom shadows without a sun."<a name="FNanchor_168_168"
    id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> When
    I saw him at Charlottenburg, one chilly April day, he told me with a sigh that he
    could compose nothing in winter, and that he longed for the warmth and light of
    Italy. His music is infected by that longing; and it makes one feel how his spirit
    suffers in the gloom of Germany, and ever yearns for the colours, the laughter, and
    the joy of the South.</p>
    <p><a name="page142" id="page142"/>Like the
    musician that Nietzsche dreamed of,<a name="FNanchor_169_169"
    id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> he
    seems "to hear ringing in his ears the prelude of a deeper, stronger music, perhaps a
    more wayward and mysterious music; a music that is super-German, which, unlike other
    music, would not die away, nor pale, nor grow dull beside the blue and wanton sea and
    the clear Mediterranean sky; a music super-European, which would hold its own even by
    the dark sunsets of the desert; a music whose soul is akin to the palm trees; a music
    that knows how to live and move among great beasts of prey, beautiful and solitary; a
    music whose supreme charm is its ignorance of good and evil. Only from time to time
    perhaps there would flit over it the longing of the sailor for home, golden shadows,
    and gentle weaknesses; and towards it would come flying from afar the thousand tints
    of the setting of a moral world that men no longer understood; and to these belated
    fugitives it would extend its hospitality and sympathy." But it is always the North,
    the melancholy of the North, and "all the sadness of mankind," mental anguish, the
    thought of death, and the tyranny of life, that come and weigh down afresh his spirit
    hungering for light, and force it into feverish speculation and bitter argument.
    Perhaps it is better so.</p>

    <p>Richard Strauss is both a poet and a musician. These two natures live together in
    him, and each <a name="page143" id="page143"/>
    strives to get the better of the other. The balance is not always well maintained;
    but when he does succeed in keeping it by sheer force of will the union of these two
    talents, directed to the same end, produces an effect more powerful than any known
    since Wagner's time. Both natures have their source in a mind filled with heroic
    thoughts&mdash;a rarer possession, I consider, than a talent for either music or
    poetry. There are other great musicians in Europe; but Strauss is something more than
    a great musician, for he is able to create a hero.</p>
    <p>When one talks of heroes one is thinking of drama. Dramatic art is everywhere in
    Strauss's music, even in works that seem least adapted to it, such as his
    <i>Lieder</i> and compositions of pure music. It is most evident in his symphonic
    poems, which are the most important part of his work. These poems are: <i>Wanderers
    Sturmlied</i> (1885), <i>Aus Italien</i> (1886), <i>Macbeth</i> (1887), <i>Don
    Juan</i> (1888), <i>Tod und Verkl&auml;rung</i> (1889), <i>Guntram</i> (1892-93),
    <i>Till Eulenspiegel</i> (1894), <i>Also sprach Zarathustra</i> (1895), <i>Don
    Quixote</i> (1897), and <i>Heldenleben</i> (1898).<a name="FNanchor_170_170"
    id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>
    <p>I shall not say much about the four first works, where the mind and manner of the
    artist is taking shape. The <i>Wanderers Sturmlied</i> (the song of a traveller
    during a storm, op. 14) is a vocal sextette with an orchestral accompaniment, whose
    subject is taken from a poem of Goethe's. It was written before Strauss met Ritter,
    and its construction is <a name="page144"
    id="page144"/>after the manner of Brahms, and shows a rather affected
    thought and style. <i>Aus Italien</i> (op. 16) is an exuberant picture of impressions
    of his tour in Italy, of the ruins at Rome, the seashore at Sorrento, and the life of
    the Italian people. <i>Macbeth</i> (op. 23) gives us a rather undistinguished series
    of musical interpretations of poetical subjects. <i>Don Juan</i> (op. 20) is much
    finer, and translates Lenau's poem into music with bombastic vigour, showing us the
    hero who dreams of grasping all the joy of the world, and how he fails, and dies
    after he has lost faith in everything.</p>
    <p><i>Tod und Verkl&auml;rung</i> ("Death and Transfiguration," op. 24<a
    name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171"
    class="fnanchor">[171]</a>) marks considerable progress in Strauss's thought and
    style. It is still one of the most stirring of Strauss's works, and the one that is
    conceived with the most perfect unity. It was inspired by a poem of Alexander
    Ritter's, and I will give you an idea of its subject.</p>
    <p>In a wretched room, lit only by a nightlight, a sick man lies in bed. Death draws
    near him in the midst of awe-inspiring silence. The unhappy man seems to wander in
    his mind at times, and to find comfort in past memories. His life passes before his
    eyes: his innocent childhood, his happy youth, the struggles of middle age, and his
    efforts to attain the splendid goal of his desires, which always eludes him. He had
    been striving all his life for this goal, and at last thought it was within reach,
    when Death, in a voice of thunder, cries, suddenly, "Stop!" And <a name="page145" id="page145"/>even now in his agony
    he struggles desperately, being set upon realising his dream; but the hand of Death
    is crushing life out of his body, and night is creeping on. Then resounds in the
    heavens the promise of that happiness which he had vainly sought for on
    earth&mdash;Redemption and Transfiguration.</p>
    <p>Richard Strauss's friends protested vigorously against this orthodox ending; and
    Seidl,<a name="FNanchor_171a_171a" id="FNanchor_171a_171a"></a><a href="#Footnote_171a_171a"
    class="fnanchor">[171a]</a>
 Jorisenne,<a name="FNanchor_171b_171b" id="FNanchor_171b_171b"></a><a href="#Footnote_171b_171b"
    class="fnanchor">[171b]</a> and Wilhelm Mauke<a name="FNanchor_171c_171c" id="FNanchor_171c_171c"></a><a href="#Footnote_171c_171c" class="fnanchor">[171c]</a>
    pretended that the subject was something
    loftier, that it was the eternal struggle of the soul against its lower self and its
    deliverance by means of art. I shall not enter into that discussion, though I think
    that such a cold and commonplace symbolism is much less interesting than the struggle
    with death, which one feels in every note of the composition. It is a classical work,
    comparatively speaking; broad and majestic and almost like Beethoven in style. The
    realism of the subject in the hallucinations of the dying man, the shiverings of
    fever, the throbbing of the veins, and the despairing agony, is transfigured by the
    purity of the form in which it is cast. It is realism after the manner of the
    symphony in C minor, where Beethoven argues with Destiny. If all suggestion of a
    programme is taken away, the symphony still remains intelligible and impressive by
    its harmonious expression of feeling.</p>
    <p><a name="page146" id="page146"/>Many German
    musicians think that Strauss has reached the highest point of his work in <i>Tod und
    Verkl&auml;rung</i>. But I am far from agreeing with them, and believe myself that
    his art has developed enormously as the result of it. It is true it is the summit of
    one period of his life, containing the essence of all that is best in it; but
    <i>Heldenleben</i> marks the second period, and is its corner-stone. How the force
    and fulness of his feeling has grown since that first period! But he has never
    re-found the delicate and melodious purity of soul and youthful grace of his earlier
    work, which still shines out in <i>Guntram</i>, and is then effaced.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Strauss has directed Wagner's dramas at Weimar since 1889. While breathing their
    atmosphere he turned his attention to the theatre, and wrote the libretto of his
    opera <i>Guntram</i>. Illness interrupted his work, and he was in Egypt when he took
    it up again. The music of the first act was written between December, 1892, and
    February, 1893, while travelling between Cairo and Luxor; the second act was finished
    in June, 1893, in Sicily; and the third act early in September, 1893, in Bavaria.
    There is, however, no trace of an oriental atmosphere in this music. We find rather
    the melodies of Italy, the reflection of a mellow light, and a resigned calm. I feel
    in it the languid mind of the convalescent, almost the heart of a young girl whose
    tears are ready to flow, though she is smiling a little at her own sad dreams. It
    seems to me that Strauss must have a secret affection for this work, which <a name="page147" id="page147"/>owes its inspiration
    to the undefinable impressions of convalescence. His fever fell asleep in it, and
    certain passages are full of the caressing touch of nature, and recall Berlioz's
    <i>Les Troyens</i>. But too often the music is superficial and conventional, and the
    tyranny of Wagner makes itself felt&mdash;a rare enough occurrence in Strauss's other
    works. The poem is interesting; Strauss has put much of himself into it, and one is
    conscious of the crisis that unsettled his broad-minded but often self-satisfied and
    inconsistent ideas.</p>
    <p>Strauss had been reading an historical study of an order of
    <i>Minnes&auml;nger</i> and mystics, which was founded in Austria in the Middle Ages
    to fight against the corruption of art, and to save souls by the beauty of song. They
    called themselves <i>Streiter der Liebe</i> ("Warriors of Love"). Strauss, who was
    imbued at that time with neo-Christian ideas and the influence of Wagner and Tolstoy,
    was carried away by the subject, and took Guntram from the <i>Streiter der Liebe</i>,
    and made him his hero.</p>
    <p>The action takes place in the thirteenth century, in Germany. The first act gives
    us a glade near a little lake. The country people are in revolt against the nobles,
    and have just been repulsed. Guntram and his master Friedhold distribute alms among
    them, and the band of defeated men then take flight into the woods. Left alone,
    Guntram begins to muse on the delights of springtime and the innocent awakening of
    Nature. But the thought of the misery that its beauty hides weighs upon him. He
    thinks of men's evil doing, of human suffering, and <a
    name="page148" id="page148"/>of civil war. He gives thanks to Christ
    for having led him to this unhappy country, kisses the cross, and decides to go to
    the court of the tyrant who is the cause of all the trouble, and make known to him
    the Divine revelation. At that moment Freihild appears. She is the wife of Duke
    Robert, who is the cruellest of all the nobles, and she is horrified by all that is
    happening around her; life seems hateful to her, and she wishes to drown herself. But
    Guntram prevents her; and the pity that her beauty and trouble had at first aroused
    changes unconsciously into love when he recognises her as the beloved princess and
    sole benefactress of the unhappy people. He tells her that God has sent him to her
    for her salvation. Then he goes to the castle, where he believes himself to be sent
    on the double mission of saving the people&mdash;and Freihild.</p>
    <p>In the second act, the princes celebrate their victory in the Duke's castle. After
    some pompous talk on the part of the official <i>Minnes&auml;nger</i>, Guntram is
    invited to sing. Discouraged beforehand by the wickedness of his audience, and
    feeling that he can sing to no purpose, he hesitates and is on the point of leaving
    them. But Freihild's sadness holds him back, and for her sake he sings. His song is
    at first calm and measured, and expresses the melancholy that fills him in the midst
    of a feast which celebrates triumphant power. He then loses himself in dreams, and
    sees the gentle figure of Peace moving among the company. He describes her lovingly
    and with youthful tenderness, which approaches ecstasy as he draws a picture of the
    <a name="page149" id="page149"/>ideal life of
    humanity made free. Then he paints War and Death, and the disorder and darkness that
    they spread over the world. He addresses himself directly to the Prince; he shows him
    his duty, and how the love of his people would be his recompense; he threatens him
    with the hate of the unhappy who are driven to despair; and, finally, he urges the
    nobles to rebuild the towns, to liberate their prisoners, and to come to the aid of
    their subjects. His song is ended amid the profound emotion of his audience. Duke
    Robert, feeling the danger of these outspoken words, orders his men to seize the
    singer; but the vassals side with Guntram. At this juncture news is brought that the
    peasants have renewed the attack. Robert calls his men to arms, but Guntram, who
    feels that he will be supported by those around him, orders Robert's arrest. The Duke
    draws his sword, but Guntram kills him. Then a sudden change comes over Guntram's
    spirit, which is explained in the third act. In the scene that follows he speaks no
    word, his sword falls from his hand, and he lets his enemies again assume their
    authority over the crowd; he allows himself to be bound and taken to prison, while
    the band of nobles noisily disperses to fight against the rebels. But Freihild is
    full of an unaffected and almost savage joy at her deliverance by Guntram's sword.
    Love for Guntram fills her heart, and her one desire is to save him.</p>
    <p>The third act takes place in the prison of the ch&acirc;teau; and it is a
    surprising, uncertain, and very curious act. It is not a logical result of the action
    <a name="page150" id="page150"/>that has
    preceded it. One feels a sudden commotion in the poet's ideas, a crisis of feeling
    which disturbed him even as he wrote, and a difficulty which he did not succeed in
    solving. The new light towards which he was beginning to move appears very clearly.
    Strauss was too advanced in the composition of his work to escape the neo-Christian
    renouncement which had to finish the drama; he could only have avoided that by
    completely remodelling his characters. So Guntram rejects Freihild's love. He sees he
    has fallen, even as the others, under the curse of sin. He had preached charity to
    others when he himself was full of egoism; he had killed Robert rather to satisfy his
    instinctive and animal jealousy than to deliver the people from a tyrant. So he
    renounces his desires, and expiates the sin of being alive by retirement from the
    world. But the interest of the act does not lie in this anticipated
    <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>, which since <i>Parsifal</i> has become rather common; it
    lies in another scene, which has evidently been inserted at the last moment, and
    which is uncomfortably out of tune with the action, though in a singularly grand way.
    This scene gives us a dialogue between Guntram and his former companion, Friedhold.<a
    name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172"
    class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page151" id="page151"/>Friedhold
    had initiated him in former days, and he now comes to reproach him for his crime, and
    to bring him before the Order, who will judge him. In the original version of the
    poem Guntram complies, and sacrifices his passion to his vow. But while Strauss had
    been travelling in the East he had conceived a sudden horror for this Christian
    annihilation of will, and Guntram revolts along with him, and refuses to submit to
    the rules of his Order. He breaks his lute&mdash;a symbol of false hope in the
    redemption of humanity through faith&mdash;and rouses himself from the glorious
    dreams in which he used to believe, for he sees they are shadows that are scattered
    by the light of real life. He does not abjure his former vows; but he is not the same
    man he was when he made them. While his experience was immature he was able to
    believe that a man ought to submit himself to rules, and that life should be governed
    by laws. A single hour has enlightened him. Now he is free and alone&mdash;alone with
    his spirit. "I alone can lessen my suffering; I alone can expiate my crime. Through
    myself alone God speaks to me; to me alone God speaks. <i>Ewig einsam</i>." It is the
    proud awakening of individualism, the powerful pessimism of the Super-man. Such an
    expression of feeling gives the character of action to renouncement and even to
    negation itself, for it is a strong affirmation of the will.</p>
    <p>I have dwelt rather at length on this drama on account of the real value of its
    thought and, above all, on account of what one may call its autobiographical
    interest. It was at this time that Strauss's mind began to take more definite form.
    His further experience will develop that form still more, but without making any
    important change in it.</p>
    <p><i>Guntram</i> was the cause of bitter disappointment to its author. He did not
    succeed in getting it pro<a name="page152"
    id="page152"/>duced at Munich, for the orchestra and singers declared
    that the music could not be performed. It is even said that they got an eminent
    critic to draw up a formal document, which they sent to Strauss, certifying that
    <i>Guntram</i> was not meant to be sung. The chief difficulty was the length of the
    principal part, which took up by itself, in its musings and discourses, the
    equivalent of an act and a half. Some of its monologues, like the song in the second
    act, last half an hour on end. Nevertheless, <i>Guntram</i> was performed at Weimar
    on 16 May, 1894. A little while afterwards Strauss married the singer who played
    Freihild, Pauline de Ahna, who had also created Elizabeth in <i>Tannh&auml;user</i>
    at Bayreuth, and who has since devoted herself to the interpretation of her husband's
    <i>Lieder</i>.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>But the rancour of his failure at the theatre still remained with Strauss, and he
    turned his attention again to the symphonic poem, in which he showed more and more
    marked dramatic tendencies, and a soul which grew daily prouder and more scornful.
    You should hear him speak in cold disdain of the theatre-going public&mdash;"that
    collection of bankers and tradespeople and miserable seekers after pleasure"&mdash;to
    know the sore that this triumphant artist hides. For not only was the theatre long
    closed to him, but, by an additional irony, he was obliged to conduct musical rubbish
    at the opera in Berlin, on account of the poor taste in music&mdash;really of Royal
    origin&mdash;that prevailed there.<a name="page153"
    id="page153"/></p>
    <p>The first great symphony of this new period was <i>Till Eulenspiegel's lustige
    Streiche, nach alter Schelmenweise, in Rondeauform</i> ("Till Eulenspiegel's Merry
    Pranks, according to an old legend, in rondeau form"), op. 28.<a
    name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173"
    class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Here his disdain is as yet only expressed by witty
    bantering, which scoffs at the world's conventions. This figure of Till, this devil
    of a joker, the legendary hero of Germany and Flanders, is little known with us in
    France. And so Strauss's music loses much of its point, for it claims to recall a
    series of adventures which we know nothing about&mdash;Till crossing the market place
    and smacking his whip at the good women there; Till in priestly attire delivering a
    homely sermon; Till making love to a young woman who rebuffs him; Till making a fool
    of the pedants; Till tried and hung. Strauss's liking to present, by musical
    pictures, sometimes a character, sometimes a dialogue, or a situation, or a
    landscape, or an idea&mdash;that is to say, the most volatile and varied impressions
    of his capricious spirit&mdash;is very marked here. It is true that he falls back on
    several popular subjects, whose meaning would be very easily grasped in Germany; and
    that he develops them, not quite in the strict form of a rondeau, as he pretends, but
    still with a certain method, so that apart from a few frolics, which are
    unintelligible without a programme, the whole has real musical unity. This symphony,
    which is a great favourite in Germany, seems to me less original than some of his
    other compositions. It sounds rather <a name="page154"
    id="page154"/>like a refined piece of Mendelssohn's, with curious
    harmonies and very complicated instrumentation.</p>
    <p>There is much more grandeur and originality in his <i>Also sprach Zarathustra,
    Tondichtung frei, nach Nietzsche</i> ("Thus spake Zarathustra, a free Tone-poem,
    after Nietzsche"), op. 30.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Its sentiments are more broadly
    human, and the programme that Strauss has followed never loses itself in picturesque
    or anecdotic details, but is planned on expressive and noble lines. Strauss protests
    his own liberty in the face of Nietzsche's. He wishes to represent the different
    stages of development that a free spirit passes through in order to arrive at that of
    Super-man. These ideas are purely personal, and are not part of some system of
    philosophy. The sub-titles of the work are: <i>Von den Hinterweltern</i> ("Of
    Religious Ideas"), <i>Von der grossen Sehnsucht</i> ("Of Supreme Aspiration"), <i>Von
    den Freuden und Leidenschaften</i> ("Of Joys and Passions"), <i>Das Grablied</i>
    ("The Grave Song"), <i>Von der Wissenschaft</i> ("Of Knowledge"), <i>Der
    Genesende</i> ("The Convalescent"&mdash;the soul delivered of its desires), <i>Das
    Tanzlied</i> ("Dancing Song"), <i>Nachtlied</i> ("Night Song"). We are shown a man
    who, worn out by trying to solve the riddle of the universe, seeks refuge in
    religion. Then he revolts against ascetic ideas, and gives way madly to his passions.
    But he is quickly sated and disgusted and, weary to death, he tries science, but
    rejects it again, and succeeds in ridding himself of the uneasiness its knowledge
    <a name="page155" id="page155"/>brings by
    laughter&mdash;the master of the universe&mdash;and the merry dance, that dance of
    the universe where all the human sentiments enter hand-in-hand&mdash;religious
    beliefs, unsatisfied desires, passions, disgust, and joy. "Lift up your hearts on
    high, my brothers! Higher still! And mind you don't forget your legs! I have
    canonised laughter. You super-men, learn to laugh!"<a name="FNanchor_175_175"
    id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> And
    the dance dies away and is lost in ethereal regions, and Zarathustra is lost to sight
    while dancing in distant worlds. But if he has solved the riddle of the universe for
    himself, he has not solved it for other men; and so, in contrast to the confident
    knowledge which fills the music, we get the sad note of interrogation at the end.</p>
    <p>There are few subjects that offer richer material for musical expression. Strauss
    has treated it with power and dexterity; he has preserved unity in this chaos of
    passions, by contrasting the <i>Sehnsucht</i> of man with the impassive strength of
    Nature. As for the boldness of his conceptions, I need hardly remind those who heard
    the poem at the Cirque d'&eacute;t&eacute; of the intricate "Fugue of Knowledge," the
    trills of the wood wind and the trumpets that voice Zarathustra's laugh, the dance of
    the universe, and the audacity of the conclusion which, in the key of B major,
    finishes up with a note of interrogation, in C natural, repeated three times.</p>
    <p>I am far from thinking that the symphony is without a fault. The themes are of
    unequal value: some are quite commonplace; and, in a general way, <a name="page156" id="page156"/>the working up of the
    composition is superior to its underlying thought. I shall come back later on to
    certain faults in Strauss's music; here I only want to consider the overflowing life
    and feverish joy that set these worlds spinning.</p>
    <p><i>Zarathustra</i> shows the progress of scornful individualism in
    Strauss&mdash;"the spirit that hates the dogs of the populace and all that abortive
    and gloomy breed; the spirit of wild laughter that dances like a tempest as gaily on
    marshes and sadness as it does in fields."<a name="FNanchor_176_176"
    id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> That
    spirit laughs at itself and at its idealism in the <i>Don Quixote</i> of 1897,
    <i>fantastische Variationen uber ein Thema ritterlichen Charakters</i> ("Don Quixote,
    fantastic variations on a theme of knightly character"), op. 35; and that symphony
    marks, I think, the extreme point to which programme music may be carried. In no
    other work does Strauss give better proof of his prodigious cleverness, intelligence,
    and wit; and I say sincerely that there is not a work where so much force is expended
    with so great a loss for the sake of a game and a musical joke which lasts forty-five
    minutes, and has given the author, the executants, and the public a good deal of
    tiring work. These symphonic poems are most difficult to play on account of the
    complexity, the independence, and the fantastic caprices of the different parts.
    Judge for yourself what the author expects to get out of the music by these few
    extracts from the programme:&mdash;</p>
    <p><a name="page157" id="page157"/>The
    introduction represents Don Quixote buried in books of chivalrous romance; and we
    have to see in the music, as we do in little Flemish and Dutch pictures, not only Don
    Quixote's features, but the words of the books he reads. Sometimes it is the story of
    a knight who is righting a giant, sometimes the adventures of a knight-errant who has
    dedicated himself to the services of a lady, sometimes it is a nobleman who has given
    his life in fulfilment of a vow to atone for his sins. Don Quixote's mind becomes
    confused (and our own with it) over all these stories; he is quite distracted. He
    leaves home in company with his squire. The two figures are drawn with great spirit;
    the one is an old Spaniard, stiff, languishing, distrustful, a bit of a poet, rather
    undecided in his opinions but obstinate when his mind is once made up; the other is a
    fat, jovial peasant, a cunning fellow, given to repeating himself in a waggish way
    and quoting droll proverbs&mdash;translated in the music by short-winded phrases that
    always return to the point they started from. The adventures begin. Here are the
    windmills (trills from the violins and wood wind), and the bleating army of the grand
    emperor, Alifanfaron (tremolos from the wood wind); and here, in the third variation,
    is a dialogue between the knight and his squire, from which we are to guess that
    Sancho questions his master on the advantages of a chivalrous life, for they seem to
    him doubtful. Don Quixote talks to him of glory and honour; but Sancho has no thought
    for it. In reply to these grand words he urges the superiority of sure profits, fat
    meals, and sounding money.<a name="page158"
    id="page158"/>Then the adventures begin again. The two companions fly
    through the air on wooden horses; and the illusion of this giddy voyage is given by
    chromatic passages on the flutes, harps, kettledrums, and a "windmachine," while "the
    tremolo of the double basses on the key-note shows that the horses have never left
    the earth."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>
    <p>But I must stop. I have said enough to show the fun the author is indulging in.
    When one hears the work one cannot help admiring the composer's technical knowledge,
    skill in orchestration, and sense of humour. And one is all the more surprised that
    he confines himself to the illustration of texts<a name="FNanchor_178_178"
    id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> when
    he is so capable of creating comic and dramatic matter without it. Although <i>Don
    Quixote</i> is a marvel of skill and a very wonderful work, in which Strauss has
    developed a suppler and richer style, it marks, to my mind, a progress in his
    technique and a backward step in his mind, for he seems to have adopted the decadent
    conceptions of an art suited to playthings and trinkets to please a frivolous and
    affected society.</p>
    <p>In <i>Heldenleben</i> ("The Life of a Hero"), op. 40,<a name="FNanchor_179_179"
    id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> he
    recovers himself, and with a stroke of his wings reaches the summits. Here there is
    no foreign text for the music to study or illustrate or transcribe. Instead, there is
    lofty passion and an heroic will <a name="page159"
    id="page159"/>gradually developing itself and breaking down all
    obstacles. Without doubt Strauss had a programme in his mind, but he said to me
    himself: "You have no need to read it. It is enough to know that the hero is there
    fighting against his enemies." I do not know how far that is true, or if parts of the
    symphony would not be rather obscure to anyone who followed it without the text; but
    this speech seems to prove that he has understood the dangers of the literary
    symphony, and that he is striving for pure music.</p>
    <p><i>Heldenleben</i> is divided into six chapters: The Hero, The Hero's Adversaries,
    The Hero's Companion, The Field of Battle, The Peaceful Labours of the Hero, The
    Hero's Retirement from the World, and the Achievement of His Ideal. It is an
    extraordinary work, drunken with heroism, colossal, half barbaric, trivial, and
    sublime. An Homeric hero struggles among the sneers of a stupid crowd, a herd of
    brawling and hobbling ninnies. A violin solo, in a sort of concerto, describes the
    seductions, the coquetry, and the degraded wickedness of woman. Then strident
    trumpet-blasts sound the attack; and it is beyond me to give an idea of the terrible
    charge of cavalry that follows, which makes the earth tremble and our hearts leap;
    nor can I describe how an iron determination leads to the storming of towns, and all
    the tumultuous din and uproar of battle&mdash;the most splendid battle that has ever
    been painted in music. At its first performance in Germany I saw people tremble as
    they listened to it, and some rose up suddenly and made violent <a name="page160" id="page160"/>gestures quite
    unconsciously. I myself had a strange feeling of giddiness, as if an ocean had been
    upheaved, and I thought that for the first time for thirty years Germany had found a
    poet of Victory.</p>
    <p><i>Heldenleben</i> would be in every way one of the masterpieces of musical
    composition if a literary error had not suddenly cut short the soaring flight of its
    most impassioned pages, at the supreme point of interest in the movement, in order to
    follow the programme; though, besides this, a certain coldness, perhaps weariness,
    creeps in towards the end. The victorious hero perceives that he has conquered in
    vain: the baseness and stupidity of men have remained unaltered. He stifles his
    anger, and scornfully accepts the situation. Then he seeks refuge in the peace of
    Nature. The creative force within him flows out in imaginative works; and here
    Richard Strauss, with a daring warranted only by his genius, represents these works
    by reminiscences of his own compositions, and <i>Don Juan, Macbeth, Tod und
    Verkl&auml;rung, Till, Zarathustra, Don Quixote, Guntram</i>, and even his
    <i>Lieder</i>, associate themselves with the hero whose story he is telling. At times
    a storm will remind this hero of his combats; but he also remembers his moments of
    love and happiness, and his soul is quieted. Then the music unfolds itself serenely,
    and rises with calm strength to the closing chord of triumph, which is placed like a
    crown of glory on the hero's head.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt that Beethoven's ideas have often inspired, stimulated, and
    guided Strauss's own ideas. One feels an indescribable reflection of <a name="page161" id="page161"/>the first
    <i>Heroic</i> and of the <i>Ode to Joy</i> in the key of the first part (E flat); and
    the last part recalls, even more forcibly, certain of Beethoven's <i>Lieder</i>. But
    the heroes of the two composers are very different: Beethoven's hero is more
    classical and more rebellious; and Strauss's hero is more concerned with the exterior
    world and his enemies, his conquests are achieved with greater difficulty, and his
    triumph is wilder in consequence. If that good Oulibicheff pretends to see the
    burning of Moscow in a discord in the first <i>Heroic</i>, what would he find here?
    What scenes of burning towns, what battlefields! Besides that there is cutting scorn
    and a mischievous laughter in <i>Heldenleben</i> that is never heard in Beethoven.
    There is, in fact, little kindness in Strauss's work; it is the work of a disdainful
    hero.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>In considering Strauss's music as a whole, one is at first struck by the diversity
    of his style. The North and the South mingle; and in his melodies one feels the
    attraction of the sun. Something Italian had crept into <i>Tristan</i>; but how much
    more of Italy there is in the work of this disciple of Nietzsche. The phrases are
    often Italian and their harmonies ultra-Germanic. Perhaps one of the greatest charms
    of Strauss's art is that we are able to watch the rent in the dark clouds of German
    polyphony, and see shining through it the smiling line of an Italian coast and the
    gay dancers on its shore. This is not merely a vague analogy. It <a name="page162" id="page162"/>would be easy, if
    idle, to notice unmistakable reminiscences of France and Italy even in Strauss's most
    advanced works, such as <i>Zarathustra</i> and <i>Heldenleben</i>. Mendelssohn,
    Gounod, Wagner, Rossini, and Mascagni elbow one another strangely. But these
    disparate elements have a softer outline when the work is taken as a whole, for they
    have been absorbed and controlled by the composer's imagination.</p>
    <p>His orchestra is not less composite. It is not a compact and serried mass like
    Wagner's Macedonian phalanxes; it is parcelled out and as divided as possible. Each
    part aims at independence and works as it thinks best, without apparently troubling
    about the other parts. Sometimes it seems, as it did when reading Berlioz, that the
    execution must result in incoherence, and weaken the effect. But somehow the result
    is very satisfying. "Now doesn't that sound well?" said Strauss to me with a smile,
    just after he had finished conducting <i>Heldenleben</i>.<a name="FNanchor_180_180"
    id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>
    <p>But it is especially in Strauss's subjects that caprice and a disordered
    imagination, the enemy of all reason, seem to reign. We have seen that these <a name="page163" id="page163"/>poems try to express
    in turn, or even simultaneously, literary texts, pictures, anecdotes, philosophical
    ideas, and the personal sentiments of the composer. What unity is there in the
    adventures of Don Quixote or Till Eulenspiegel? And yet unity is there, not in the
    subjects, but in the mind that deals with them. And these descriptive symphonies with
    their very diffuse literary life are vindicated by their musical life, which is much
    more logical and concentrated. The caprices of the poet are held in rein by the
    musician. The whimsical Till disports himself "after the old form of rondeau," and
    the folly of Don Quixote is told in "ten variations on a chivalrous theme, with an
    introduction and finale." In this way, Strauss's art, one of the most literary and
    descriptive in existence, is strongly distinguished from others of the same kind by
    the solidarity of its musical fabric, in which one feels the true musician&mdash;a
    musician brought up on the great masters, and a classic in spite of everything.</p>
    <p>And so throughout that music a strong unity is felt among the unruly and often
    incongruous elements. It is the reflection, so it seems to me, of the soul of the
    composer. Its unity is not a matter of what he feels, but a matter of what he wishes.
    His emotion is much less interesting to him than his will, and it is less intense,
    and often quite devoid of any personal character. His restlessness seems to come from
    Schumann, his religious feeling from Mendelssohn, his voluptuousness from Gounod or
    the Italian masters, his passion from<a name="page164"
    id="page164"/>Wagner.<a name="FNanchor_181_181"
    id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> But
    his will is heroic, dominating, eager, and powerful to a sublime degree. And that is
    why Richard Strauss is noble and, at present, quite unique. One feels in him a force
    that has dominion over men.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>It is through this heroic side that he may be considered as an inheritor of some
    of Beethoven's and Wagner's thought. It is this heroic side which makes him a
    poet&mdash;one of the greatest perhaps in modern Germany, who sees herself reflected
    in him and in his hero. Let us consider this hero.</p>
    <p>He is an idealist with unbounded faith in the power of the mind and the liberating
    virtue of art. This idealism is at first religious, as in <i>Tod und
    Verkl&auml;rung</i>, and tender and compassionate as a woman, and full of youthful
    illusions, as in <i>Guntram</i>. Then it becomes vexed and indignant with the
    baseness of the world and the difficulties it encounters. Its scorn increases, and
    becomes sarcastic <i>(Till Eulenspiegel)</i>; it is exasperated with years of
    conflict, and, in increasing bitterness, develops into a contemptuous heroism. How
    Strauss's laugh whips and stings us in <i>Zarathustra</i>! How his will bruises and
    cuts us in <i>Heldenleben</i>! Now that he has proved his power by victory, his pride
    knows no limit; he is elated and is unable to see that his lofty visions have become
    realities. But the people <a name="page165"
    id="page165"/>whose spirit he reflects see it. There are germs of
    morbidity in Germany to-day, a frenzy of pride, a belief in self, and a scorn for
    others that recalls France in the seventeenth century. "<i>Dem Deutschen geh&ouml;rt
    die Welt</i>" ("Germany possesses the world") calmly say the prints displayed in the
    shop windows in Berlin. But when one arrives at this point the mind becomes
    delirious. All genius is raving mad if it comes to that; but Beethoven's madness
    concentrated itself in himself, and imagined things for his own enjoyment. The genius
    of many contemporary German artists is an aggressive thing, and is characterised by
    its destructive antagonism. The idealist who "possesses the world" is liable to
    dizziness. He was made to rule over an interior world. The splendour of the exterior
    images that he is called upon to govern dazzles him; and, like Caesar, he goes
    astray. Germany had hardly attained the position of empire of the world when she
    found Nietzsche's voice and that of the deluded artists of the <i>Deutsches
    Theater</i> and the <i>Secession</i>. Now there is the grandiose music of Richard
    Strauss.</p>
    <p>What is all this fury leading to? What does this heroism aspire to? This force of
    will, bitter and strained, grows faint when it has reached its goal, or even before
    that. It does not know what to do with its victory. It disdains it, does not believe
    in it, or grows tired of it.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>
    <p>Like Michelangelo's <i>Victory</i>, it has set its knee on <a name="page166" id="page166"/>the captive's back,
    and seems ready to despatch him. But suddenly it stops, hesitates, and looks about
    with uncertain eyes, and its expression is one of languid disgust, as though
    weariness had seized it.</p>
    <p>And this is how the work of Richard Strauss appears to me up to the present.
    Guntram kills Duke Robert, and immediately lets fall his sword. The frenzied laugh of
    Zarathustra ends in an avowal of discouraged impotence. The delirious passion of Don
    Juan dies away in nothingness. Don Quixote when dying forswears his illusions. Even
    the Hero himself admits the futility of his work, and seeks oblivion in an
    indifferent Nature. Nietzsche, speaking of the artists of our time, laughs at "those
    Tantaluses of the will, rebels and enemies of laws, who come, broken in spirit, and
    fall at the foot of the cross of Christ." Whether it is for the sake of the Cross or
    Nothingness, these heroes renounce their victories in disgust and despair, or with a
    resignation that is sadder still. It was not thus that Beethoven overcame his
    sorrows. Sad adagios make their lament in the middle of his symphonies, but a note of
    joy and triumph is always sounded at the end. His work is the triumph of a conquered
    hero; that of Strauss is the defeat of a conquering hero. This irresoluteness of the
    will can be still more clearly seen in contemporary German literature, and in
    particular in the author of <i>Die versunkene Glocke</i>. But it is more striking in
    Strauss, because he is more heroic. And so we get all this display of superhuman
    will, and the end is only "My desire is gone!"</p>
    <p><a name="page167" id="page167"/>In this lies
    the undying worm of German thought&mdash;I am speaking of the thought of the choice
    few who enlighten the present and anticipate the future. I see an heroic people,
    intoxicated by its triumphs, by its great riches, by its numbers, by its force, which
    clasps the world in its great arms and subjugates it, and then stops, fatigued by its
    conquest, and asks: "Why have I conquered?"</p>
    <hr style="width: 65%;" />
    <a name="page168" id="page168"/>
    <h2><a name="HUGO_WOLF" id="HUGO_WOLF"></a>HUGO WOLF</h2>
    <p>The more one learns of the history of great artists, the more one is struck by the
    immense amount of sadness their lives enclose. Not only are they subjected to the
    trials and disappointments of ordinary life&mdash;which affect them more cruelly
    through their greater sensitiveness&mdash;but their surroundings are like a desert,
    because they are twenty, thirty, fifty, or even hundreds of years in advance of their
    contemporaries; and they are often condemned to despairing efforts, not to conquer
    the world, but to live.</p>
    <p>These highly-strung natures are rarely able to keep up this incessant struggle for
    very long; and the finest genius may have to reckon with illness and misery and even
    premature death. And yet there were people like Mozart and Schumann and Weber who
    were happy in spite of everything, because they had been able to keep their soul's
    health and the joy of creation until the end; and though their bodies were worn out
    with fatigue and privation, a light was kept burning which sent its rays far into the
    darkness of their night. There are worse destinies; and Beethoven, though he was
    poor, shut up within himself, and deceived in his affections, was far from being the
    most unhappy of men. In his case, he possessed nothing but himself; <a name="page169" id="page169"/>but he possessed
    himself truly, and reigned over the world that was within him; and no other empire
    could ever be compared with that of his vast imagination, which stretched like a
    great expanse of sky, where tempests raged. Until his last day the old Prometheus in
    him, though fettered by a miserable body, preserved his iron force unbroken. When
    dying during a storm, his last gesture was one of revolt; and in his agony he raised
    himself on his bed and shook his fist at the sky. And so he fell, struck down by a
    single blow in the thick of the fight.</p>
    <p>But what shall be said of those who die little by little, who outlive themselves,
    and watch the slow decay of their souls?</p>
    <p>Such was the fate of Hugo Wolf, whose tragic destiny has assured him a place apart
    in the hell of great musicians.<a name="FNanchor_183_183"
    id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>He was born at Windischgratz in Styria, 13 March, 1860. He was the fourth son of a
    currier&mdash;a currier-musician, like old Veit Bach, the baker-musician, and Haydn's
    father, the wheelwright-musician. Philipp Wolf played the violin, the guitar, and the
    piano, and used to have little quintet parties at his <a
    name="page170" id="page170"/>house, in which he played the first
    violin, Hugo the second violin, Hugo's brother the violoncello, an uncle the horn,
    and a friend the tenor violin. The musical taste of the country was not properly
    German. Wolf was a Catholic; and his taste was not formed, like that of most German
    musicians, by books of chorales. Besides that, in Styria they were fond of playing
    the old Italian operas of Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti. Later on, Wolf used to
    like to think that he had a few drops of Latin blood in his veins; and all his life
    he had a predilection for the great French musicians.</p>
    <p>His term of apprenticeship was not marked by anything brilliant. He went from one
    school to another without being kept long anywhere. And yet he was not a worthless
    lad; but he was always very reserved, little caring to be intimate with others, and
    passionately devoted to music. His father naturally did not want him to take up music
    as a profession; and he had the same struggles that Berlioz had. Finally he succeeded
    in getting permission from his family to go to Vienna, and he entered the
    Conservatoire there in 1875. But he was not any the happier for it, and at the end of
    two years he was sent away for being unruly.</p>
    <p>What was to be done? His family was ruined, for a fire had demolished their little
    possessions. He felt the silent reproaches of his father already weighing upon
    him&mdash;for he loved his father dearly, and remembered the sacrifices he had made
    for him. He did not wish to return to his own province; indeed he could not
    return&mdash;that would have been <a name="page171"
    id="page171"/>death. It was necessary that this boy of seventeen
    should find some means of earning a livelihood and be able to instruct himself at the
    same time. After his expulsion from the Conservatoire he attended no other school; he
    taught himself. And he taught himself wonderfully; but at what a cost! The suffering
    he went through from that time until he was thirty, the enormous amount of energy he
    had to expend in order to live and cultivate the fine spirit of poetry that was
    within him&mdash;all this effort and toil was, without doubt, the cause of his
    unhappy death. He had a burning thirst for knowledge and a fever for work which made
    him sometimes forget the necessity for eating and drinking.</p>
    <p>He had a great admiration for Goethe, and was infatuated by Heinrich von Kleist,
    whom he rather resembles both in his gifts and in his life; he was an enthusiast
    about Grillparzer and Hebbel at a time when they were but little appreciated; and he
    was one of the first Germans to discover the worth of M&ouml;rike, whom, later on, he
    made popular in Germany. Besides this, he read English and French writers. He liked
    Rabelais, and was very partial to Claude Tillier, the French novelist of the
    provinces, whose <i>Oncle Benjamin</i> has given pleasure to so many German
    provincial families, by bringing before them, as Wolf said, the vision of their own
    little world, and helping them by his own jovial good humour to bear their troubles
    with a smiling face. And so little Wolf, with hardly enough to eat, found the means
    of learning both French and English, <a name="page172"
    id="page172"/>in order better to appreciate the thoughts of foreign
    artists.</p>
    <p>In music he learned a great deal from his friend Schalk,<a name="FNanchor_184_184"
    id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> a
    professor at the Vienna Conservatoire; but, like Berlioz, he got most of his
    education from the libraries, and spent months in reading the scores of the great
    masters. Not having a piano, he used to carry Beethoven's sonatas to the Prater Park
    in Vienna and study them on a bench in the open air. He soaked himself in the
    classics&mdash;in Bach and Beethoven, and the German masters of the
    <i>Lied</i>&mdash;Schubert and Schumann. He was one of the young Germans who was
    passionately fond of Berlioz; and it is due to Wolf that France was afterwards
    honoured in the possession of this great artist, whom French critics, whether of the
    school of Meyerbeer, Wagner, Franck, or Debussy, have never understood. He was also
    early a friend of old Anton Bruckner, whose music we do not know in France, neither
    his eight symphonies, nor his <i>Te Deum</i>, nor his masses, nor his cantatas, nor
    anything else of his fertile work. Bruckner had a sweet and modest character, and an
    endearing, if rather childish, personality. He was rather crushed all his life by the
    Brahms party; but, like Franck in France, he gathered round him new and original
    talent to fight the academic art of his time.</p>
    <p>But of all these influences, the strongest was that of Wagner. Wagner came to
    Vienna in 1875 to <a name="page173"
    id="page173"/>conduct <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> and <i>Lohengrin</i>.
    There was then among the younger people a fever of enthusiasm similar to that which
    <i>Werther</i> had caused a century before. Wolf saw Wagner. He tells us about it in
    his letters to his parents. I will quote his own words, and though they make one
    smile, one loves the impulsive devotion of his youth; and they make one feel, too,
    that a man who inspires such an affection, and who can do so much good by a little
    sympathy, is to blame when he does not befriend others&mdash;above all if he has
    suffered, like Wagner, from loneliness and the want of a helping hand. You must
    remember that this letter was written by a boy of fifteen.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"I have been to&mdash;guess whom?... to the master, Richard Wagner! Now I will
      tell you all about it, just as it happened. I will copy the words down exactly as I
      wrote them in my note-book.</p>
      <p>"On Thursday, 9 December, at half-past ten, I saw Richard Wagner for the second
      time at the Hotel Imperial, where I stayed for half an hour on the staircase,
      awaiting his arrival (I knew that on that day he would conduct the last rehearsal
      of his <i>Lohengrin</i>). At last the master came down from the second floor, and I
      bowed to him very respectfully while he was yet some distance from me. He thanked
      me in a very friendly way. As he neared the door I sprang forward and opened it for
      him, upon which he looked fixedly at me for a few seconds, and then went on his way
      to <a name="page174" id="page174"/>the
      rehearsal at the Opera. I ran as fast as I could, and arrived at the Opera sooner
      than Richard Wagner did in his cab. I bowed to him again, and I wanted to open the
      door of his cab for him; but as I could not get it open, the coachman jumped down
      from his seat and did it for me. Wagner said something to the coachman&mdash;I
      think it was about me. I wanted to follow him into the theatre, but they would not
      let me pass.</p>
      <p>"I often used to wait for him at the Hotel Imperial; and on this occasion I made
      the acquaintance of the manager of the hotel, who promised that he would interest
      himself on my behalf. Who was more delighted than I when he told me that on the
      following Saturday afternoon, 11 December, I was to come and find him, so that he
      could introduce me to Mme. Cosima's maid and Richard Wagner's valet! I arrived at
      the appointed hour. The visit to the lady's maid was very short. I was advised to
      come the following day, Sunday, 12 December, at two o'clock. I arrived at the right
      hour, but found the maid and the valet and the manager still at table.... Then I
      went with the maid to the master's rooms, where I waited for about a quarter of an
      hour until he came. At last Wagner appeared in company with Cosima and Goldmark. I
      bowed to Cosima very respectfully, but she evidently did not think it worth while
      to honour me with a single glance. Wagner was going into his room without paying
      any attention to me, when the maid said to him in a beseeching voice: 'Ah,<a name="page175" id="page175"/>Herr Wagner, it is
      a young musician who wishes to speak to you; he has been waiting for you a long
      time.'</p>
      <p>"He then came out of his room, looked at me, and said: 'I have seen you before,
      I think. You are....'</p>
      <p>"Probably he wanted to say, 'You are a fool.'</p>
      <p>"He went in front of me and opened the door of the reception-room, which was
      furnished in a truly royal style. In the middle of the room was a couch covered in
      velvet and silk. Wagner himself was wrapped in a long velvet mantle bordered with
      fur.</p>
      <p>"When I was inside the room he asked me what I wanted."</p>
    </div>
    <p>Here Hugo Wolf, to excite the curiosity of his parents, broke off his story and
    put "To be continued in my next." In his next letter he continues:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"I said to him: 'Highly honoured master, for a long time I have wanted to hear
      an opinion on my compositions, and it would be....'</p>
      <p>"Here the master interrupted me and said: 'My dear child, I cannot give you an
      opinion of your compositions; I have far too little time; I can't even get my own
      letters written. I understand nothing at all about music <i>(Ich verstehe gar
      nichts von der Musik</i>).'</p>
      <p>"I asked the master whether I should ever be able really to do anything, and he
      said to me: 'When I was your age and composing music, no <a
      name="page176" id="page176"/>one could tell me then whether I
      should ever do anything great. You could at most play me your compositions on the
      piano; but I have no time to hear them. When you are older, and when you have
      composed bigger works, and if by chance I return to Vienna, you shall show me what
      you have done. But that is no use now; I cannot give you an opinion of them
      yet.'</p>
      <p>"When I told the master that I took the classics as models, he said: 'Good,
      good. One can't be original at first.' And he laughed, and then said, 'I wish you,
      dear friend, much happiness in your career. Go on working steadily, and if I come
      back to Vienna, show me your compositions.'</p>
      <p>"Upon that I left the master, profoundly moved and impressed."</p>
    </div>
    <p>Wolf and Wagner did not see each other again. But Wolf fought unceasingly on
    Wagner's behalf. He went several times to Bayreuth, though he had no personal
    intercourse with the Wagner family; but he met Liszt, who, with his usual goodness,
    wrote him a kind letter about a composition that he had sent him, and showed him what
    alterations to make in it.</p>
    <p>Mottl and the composer, Adalbert de Goldschmidt, were the first friends to aid him
    in his years of misery, by finding him some music pupils. He taught music to little
    children of seven and eight years old; but he was a poor teacher, and found giving
    lessons was a martyrdom. The money he earned hardly served to feed him, and he only
    ate <a name="page177" id="page177"/>once a
    day&mdash;Heaven knows how. To comfort himself he read Hebbel's Life; and for a time
    he thought of going to America. In 1881 Goldschmidt got him the post of second
    <i>Kapellmeister</i> at the Salzburg theatre. It was his business to rehearse the
    choruses for the operettas of Strauss and Mill&ouml;cker. He did his work
    conscientiously, but in deadly weariness; and he lacked the necessary power of making
    his authority felt. He did not stay long in this post, and came back to Vienna.</p>
    <p>Since 1875 he had been writing music: <i>Lieder</i>, sonatas, symphonies,
    quartets, etc., and already his <i>Lieder</i> held the most important place. He also
    composed in 1883 a symphonic poem on the <i>Penthesilea</i> of his friend Kleist.</p>
    <p>In 1884 he succeeded in getting a post as musical critic. But on what a paper! It
    was the <i>Salonblatt</i>&mdash;a mundane journal filled with articles on sport and
    fashion news. One would have said that this little barbarian was put there for a
    wager. His articles from 1884 to 1887 are full of life and humour. He upholds the
    great classic masters in them: Gluck, Mozart, Beethoven, and&mdash;Wagner; he defends
    Berlioz; he scourges the modern Italians, whose success at Vienna was simply
    scandalous; he breaks lances for Bruckner, and begins a bold campaign against Brahms.
    It was not that he disliked or had any prejudice against Brahms; he took a delight in
    some of his works, especially his chamber music, but he found fault with his
    symphonies and was shocked by the carelessness of the declamation in his
    <i>Lieder</i> and, in general, could not bear his want <a
    name="page178" id="page178"/>of originality and power, and found him
    lacking in joy and fulness of life. Above all, he struck at him as being the head of
    a party that was spitefully opposed to Wagner and Bruckner and all innovators. For
    all that was retrograde in music in Vienna, and all that was the enemy of liberty and
    progress in art and criticism, was giving Brahms its detestable support by gathering
    itself about him and spreading his fame abroad; and though Brahms was really far
    above his party as an artist and a man, he had not the courage to break away from
    it.</p>
    <p>Brahms read Wolf's articles, but his attacks did not seem to stir his apathy. The
    "Brahmines," however, never forgave Wolf. One of his bitterest enemies was Hans von
    B&uuml;low, who found anti-Brahmism "the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost&mdash;which
    shall not be forgiven."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Some years later, when Wolf
    succeeded in getting his own compositions played, he had to submit to criticisms like
    that of Max Kalbeck, one of the leaders of "Brahmism" at Vienna:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"Herr Wolf has lately, as a reporter, raised an irresistible laugh in musical
      circles. So someone suggested he had better devote himself to composition. The last
      products of his muse show that this well-meant advice was bad. He ought to go back
      to reporting."</p>
    </div>
    <p>An orchestral society in Vienna gave Wolf's <i>Penthesilea</i> a trial reading;
    and it was rehearsed, <a name="page179"
    id="page179"/>in disregard of all good taste, amid shouts of
    laughter. When it was finished, the conductor said: "Gentlemen, I ask your pardon for
    having allowed this piece to be played to the end; but I wanted to know what manner
    of man it is that dares to write such things about the master, Brahms."</p>
    <p>Wolf got a little respite from his miseries by going to stay a few weeks in his
    own country with his brother-in-law, Strasser, an inspector of taxes.<a
    name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186"
    class="fnanchor">[186]</a> He took with him his books, his poets, and began to set
    them to music.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>He was now twenty-seven years old, and had as yet published nothing. The years of
    1887 and 1888 were the most critical ones of his life. In 1887 he lost his father
    whom he loved so much, and that loss, like so many of his other misfortunes, gave
    fresh impulse to his energies. The same year, a generous friend called Eckstein
    published his first collection of <i>Lieder</i>. Wolf up to that time had been
    smothered, but this publication stirred the life in him, and was the means of
    unloosing his genius. Settled at Perchtoldsdorf, near Vienna, in February, 1888, in
    absolute peace, he wrote in three months fifty-three <i>Lieder</i> to the words of
    Eduard M&ouml;rike, the pastor-poet of Swabia, who died in 1875, and who,
    misunderstood and laughed at during his lifetime, is now covered with honour, and
    univer<a name="page180" id="page180"/>sally
    popular in Germany. Wolf composed his songs in a state of exalted joy and almost
    fright at the sudden discovery of his creative power.</p>
    <p>In a letter to Dr. Heinrich Werner, he says:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"It is now seven o'clock in the evening, and I am so happy&mdash;oh, happier
      than the happiest of kings. Another new <i>Lied</i>! If you could hear what is
      going on in my heart!... the devil would carry you away with pleasure!...</p>
      <p>"Another two new <i>Lieder</i>! There is one that sounds so horribly strange
      that it frightens me. There is nothing like it in existence. Heaven help the
      unfortunate people who will one day hear it!...</p>
      <p>"If you could only hear the last <i>Lied</i> I have just composed you would only
      have one desire left&mdash;to die.... Your happy, happy Wolf."</p>
    </div>
    <p>He had hardly finished the <i>M&ouml;rike-Lieder</i> when he began a series of
    <i>Lieder</i> on poems of Goethe. In three months (December, 1888, to February, 1889)
    he had written all the <i>Goethe-Liederbuch</i>&mdash;fifty-one <i>Lieder</i>, some
    of which are, like <i>Prometheus</i>, big dramatic scenes.</p>
    <p>The same year, while still at Perchtoldsdorf, after having published a volume of
    Eichendorff <i>Lieder</i>, he became absorbed in a new cycle&mdash;the
    <i>Spanisches-Liederbuch</i>, on Spanish poems translated by Heyse. He wrote these
    forty-four songs in the same ecstasy of gladness:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"What I write now, I write for the future.... Since Schubert and<a name="page181" id="page181"/>Schumann there has
      been nothing like it!"</p>
    </div>
    <p>In 1890, two months after he had finished the <i>Spanisches-Liederbuch</i>, he
    composed another cycle of <i>Lieder</i> on poems called <i>Alten Weisen</i>, by the
    great Swiss writer Gottfried Keller. And lastly, in the same year, he began his
    <i>Italienisches-Liederbuch</i>, on Italian poems, translated by Geibel and
    Heyse.</p>
    <p>And then&mdash;then there was silence.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>The history of Wolf is one of the most extraordinary in the history of art, and
    gives one a better glimpse of the mysteries of genius than most histories do.</p>
    <p>Let us make a little <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i>. Wolf at twenty-eight years old
    had written practically nothing. From 1888 to 1890 he wrote, one after another, in a
    kind of fever, fifty-three M&ouml;rike <i>Lieder</i>, fifty-one Goethe <i>Lieder</i>,
    forty-four Spanish <i>Lieder</i>, seventeen Eichendorff <i>Lieder</i>, a dozen Keller
    <i>Lieder</i>, and the first Italian <i>Lieder</i>&mdash;that is about two hundred
    <i>Lieder</i>, each one having its own admirable individuality.</p>
    <p>And then the music stops. The spring has dried up. Wolf in great anguish wrote
    despairing letters to his friends. To Oskar Grohe, on 2 May, 1891, he wrote:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"I have given up all idea of composing. Heaven knows how things will finish.
      Pray for my poor soul."</p>
    </div>
    <p><a name="page182" id="page182"/>And to
    Wette, on 13 August, 1891, he says:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"For the last four months I have been suffering from a sort of mental
      consumption, which makes me very seriously think of quitting this world for
      ever.... Only those who truly live should live at all. I have been for some time
      like one who is dead. I only wish it were an apparent death; but I am really dead
      and buried; though the power to control my body gives me a seeming life. It is my
      inmost, my only desire, that the flesh may quickly follow the spirit that has
      already passed. For the last fifteen days I have been living at Traunkirchen, the
      pearl of Traunsee.... All the comforts that a man could wish for are here to make
      my life happy&mdash;peace, solitude, beautiful scenery, invigorating air, and
      everything that could suit the tastes of a hermit like myself.<a
      name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187"
      class="fnanchor">[187]</a> And yet&mdash;and yet, my friend, I am the most
      miserable creature on earth. Everything around me breathes peace and happiness,
      everything throbs with life and fulfils its functions.... I alone, oh God!... I
      alone live like a beast that is deaf and senseless. Even reading hardly serves to
      distract me now, though I bury myself in books in my despair. As for composition,
      that is finished; I can no longer bring to mind the meaning of a harmony or a
      melody, and I almost begin to doubt if the compositions that bear my name are
      really mine. Good God! what <a name="page183"
      id="page183"/>is the use of all this fame? What is the good of
      these great aims if misery is all that lies at the end of it?...</p>
      <p>"<i>Heaven gives a man complete genius or no genius at all. Hell has given me
      everything by halves</i>.</p>
      <p>"O unhappy man, how true, how true it is! In the flower of your life you went to
      hell; into the evil jaws of destiny you threw the delusive present and yourself
      with it. O Kleist!"</p>
    </div>
    <p>Suddenly, at D&ouml;bling, on 29 November, 1891, the stream of Wolf's genius
    flowed again, and he wrote fifteen Italian <i>Lieder</i>, sometimes several in one
    day. In December it stopped again; and this time for five years. These Italian
    melodies show, however, no trace of any effort, nor a greater tension of mind than is
    shown in his preceding works. On the contrary, they have the air of being the
    simplest and most natural work that Wolf ever did. But the matter is of no real
    consequence, for when Wolf's genius was not stirring within him he was useless. He
    wished to write thirty-three Italian <i>Lieder</i>, but he had to stop after the
    twenty-second, and in 1891 he published one volume only of the
    <i>Italienisches-Liederbuch</i>. The second volume was completed in a month, five
    years later, in 1896.</p>
    <p>One may imagine the tortures that this solitary man suffered. His only happiness
    was in creation, and he saw his life cease, without any apparent cause, for years
    together, and his genius come and go, and return for an instant, and then go
    again.<a name="page184" id="page184"/>Each time
    he must have anxiously wondered if it had gone for ever, or how long it would be
    before it came back again. In letters to Kaufmann on 6 August, 1891, and 26 April,
    1893, he says:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"You ask me for news of my opera.<a name="FNanchor_188_188"
      id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
      Good Heavens! I should be content if I could write the tiniest little
      <i>Liedchen</i>. And an opera, now?... I firmly believe that it is all over with
      me.... I could as well speak Chinese as compose anything. It is horrible.... What I
      suffer from this inaction I cannot tell you. I should like to hang myself."</p>
    </div>
    <p>To Hugo Faisst he wrote on 21 June, 1894:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"You ask me the cause of my great depression of spirit, and would pour balm on
      my wounds. Ah yes, if you only could! But no herb grows that could cure my
      sickness; only a god could help me. If you can give me back my inspirations, and
      wake up the familiar spirit that is asleep in me, and let him possess me anew, I
      will call you a god and raise altars to your name. My cry is to gods and not to
      men; the gods alone are fit to pronounce my fate. But however it may end, even if
      the worst comes, I will bear it&mdash;yes, even if no ray of sunshine lightens my
      life again.... And with that we will, once for all, turn the page and have done
      with this dark chapter of my life."</p>
    </div>
    <a name="page185" id="page185"/>
    <p>This letter&mdash;and it is not the only one&mdash;recalls the melancholy stoicism
    of Beethoven's letters, and shows us sorrows that even the unhappy Beethoven did not
    know. And yet how can we tell? Perhaps Beethoven, too, suffered similar anguish in
    the sad days that followed 1815, before the last sonatas, the <i>Missa Solemnis</i>,
    and the Ninth Symphony had awaked to life in him.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>In March, 1895, Wolf lived once more, and in three months had written the piano
    score of <i>Corregidor</i>. For many years he had been attracted towards the stage,
    and especially towards light opera. Enthusiast though he was for Wagner's work, he
    had declared openly that it was time for musicians to free themselves from the
    Wagnerian <i>Musik-Drama</i>. He knew his own gifts, and did not aspire to take
    Wagner's place. When one of his friends offered him a subject for an opera, taken
    from a legend about Buddha, he declined it, saying that the world did not yet
    understand the meaning of Buddha's doctrines, and that he had no wish to give
    humanity a fresh headache. In a letter to Grohe, on 28 June, 1890, he says:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"Wagner has, by and through his art, accomplished such a mighty work of
      liberation that we may rejoice to think that it is quite useless for us to storm
      the skies, since he has conquered them for us. It is much wiser to seek out a
      pleasant nook in this lovely heaven. I want to find a little <a name="page186" id="page186"/>place there for
      myself, not in a desert with water and locusts and wild honey, but in a merry
      company of primitive beings, among the tinkling of guitars, the sighs of love, the
      moonlight, and such-like&mdash;in short, in a quite ordinary
      <i>op&eacute;ra-comique</i>, without any rescuing spectre of Schopenhauerian
      philosophy in the background."</p>
    </div>
    <p>After having sought the libretto of an opera from the whole world, from poets
    ancient and modern,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> and after having tried to write
    one himself, he finally took that of Madame Rosa Mayreder, an adaptation of a Spanish
    novelette of Don Pedro de Alarc&oacute;n. This was <i>Corregidor</i>, which, after
    having been refused by other theatres, was played in June, 1896, at Mannheim. The
    work was not a success in spite of its musical qualities, and the poorness of the
    libretto helped on its failure.</p>
    <p>But the main thing was that Wolf's creative genius had returned. In April, 1896,
    he wrote straight away the twenty-two songs of the second volume of the
    <i>Italienisches-Liederbuch</i>. At Christmas his friend M&uuml;ller sent him some of
    Michelangelo's poems, translated into German by Walter Robert-Tornow; and Wolf,
    deeply moved by their beauty, decided at once to devote a whole volume of
    <i>Lieder</i> to them. In 1897 he composed the first three melodies. At the same time
    he was also working at a new opera,<a name="page187"
    id="page187"/><i>Manuel Venegas</i>, a poem by Moritz Hoernes,
    written after the style of Alarc&oacute;n. He seemed full of strength and happiness
    and confidence in his renewed health. M&uuml;ller was speaking to him of the
    premature death of Schubert, and Wolf replied, "A man is not taken away before he has
    said all he has to say."</p>
    <p>He worked furiously, "like a steam-engine," as he said, and was so absorbed in the
    composition of <i>Manuel Venegas</i> (September, 1897) that he went without rest, and
    had hardly time to take necessary food. In a fortnight he had written fifty pages of
    the pianoforte score, as well as the <i>motifs</i> for the whole work, and the music
    of half the first act.</p>
    <p>Then madness came. On 20 September he was seized while he was working at the great
    recitative of Manuel Venegas in the first act.</p>
    <p>He was taken to Dr. Svetlin's private hospital in Vienna, and remained there until
    January, 1898. Happily he had devoted friends who took care of him and made up for
    the indifference of the public; for what he had earned himself would not have enabled
    him even to die in peace. When Schott, the publisher, sent him in October, 1895, his
    royalties for the editions of his <i>Lieder</i> of M&ouml;rike, Goethe, Eichendorff,
    Keller, Spanish poetry, and the first volume of Italian poetry, their total for five
    years came to eighty-six marks and thirty-five pfennigs! And Schott calmly added that
    he had not expected so good a result. So it was Wolf's friends, and especially Hugo
    Faisst, who not only saved him from misery by their unobtrusive and often secret
    <a name="page188" id="page188"/>generosity, but
    spared him the horror of destitution in his last misfortunes.</p>
    <p>He recovered his reason, and was sent in February, 1898, for a voyage to Trieste
    and Venetia to complete his cure and prevent him from thinking of work. The
    precaution was unnecessary; for he says in a letter to Hugo Faisst, written in the
    same month:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"There is no need for you to trouble yourself or fear that I shall overdo
      things. A real distaste for work has taken possession of me, and I believe I shall
      never write another note. My unfinished opera has no more interest for me, and
      music altogether is hateful. You see what my kind friends have done for me! I
      cannot think how I shall be able to exist in this state.... Ah, happy Swabians! one
      may well envy you. Greet your beautiful country for me, and be warmly greeted
      yourself by your unhappy and worn-out friend, Hugo Wolf."</p>
    </div>
    <p>When he returned to Vienna, however, he seemed to be a little better, and had
    apparently regained his health and cheerfulness. But to his own astonishment he had
    become, as he says in a letter to Faisst, a quiet, sedate, and silent man, who wished
    more and more to be alone. He did not compose anything fresh, but revised his
    Michelangelo <i>Lieder</i>, and had them published. He made plans for the winter, and
    rejoiced in the thought of passing it in the country near Gmunden, "in perfect quiet,
    undis<a name="page189" id="page189"/>turbed,
    and living only for art." In his last letter to Faisst, 17 September, 1898, he
    says:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"I am quite well again now, and have no more need of any cures. You would need
      them more than I."</p>
    </div>
    <p>Then came a fresh seizure of madness, and this time all was finished.</p>
    <p>In the autumn of 1898 Wolf was taken to an asylum at Vienna. At first he was able
    to receive a few visits and to enjoy a little music by playing duets with the
    director of the establishment, who was himself a musician and a great admirer of
    Wolf's works. He was even able in the spring to take a few walks out of doors with
    his friends and an attendant. But he was beginning not to recognise things or people
    or even himself. "Yes," he would say, sighing, "if only I were Hugo Wolf!" From the
    middle of 1899 his malady grew rapidly worse, and general paralysis followed. At the
    beginning of 1900 his speech was affected, and, finally, in August, 1901, all his
    body. At the beginning of 1902 all hope was given up by the doctors; but his heart
    was still sound, and the unhappy man dragged out his life for another year. He died
    on 16 February, 1903, of peripneumonia.</p>
    <p>He was given a magnificent funeral, which was attended by all the people who had
    done nothing for him while he was alive. The Austrian State, the town of Vienna, his
    native town Windischgratz, the Conservatoire that had expelled him, the<a name="page190" id="page190"/><i>Gesellschaft der
    Musikfreunde</i> who had been so long unfriendly to his works, the Opera that had
    been closed to him, the singers that had scorned him, the critics that had scoffed at
    him&mdash;they were all there. They sang one of his saddest melodies,
    <i>Resignation</i>, a setting of a poem of Eichendorff's, and a chorale by his old
    friend Bruckner, who had died several years before him. His faithful friends, Faisst
    at the head of them, took care to have a monument erected to his memory near those of
    Beethoven and Schubert.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Such was his life, cut short at thirty-seven years of age&mdash;for one cannot
    count the five years of complete madness. There are not many examples in the art
    world of so terrible a fate. Nietzsche's misfortune is nowhere beside this, for
    Nietzsche's madness was, to a certain extent, productive, and caused his genius to
    flash out in a way that it never would have done if his mind had been balanced and
    his health perfect. Wolf's madness meant prostration. But one may see how, even in
    the space of thirty-seven years, his life was strangely parcelled out. For he did not
    really begin his creative work until he was twenty-seven years old; and as from 1890
    to 1895 he was condemned to five years' silence, the sum total of his real life, his
    productive life, is only four or five years. But in those few years he got more out
    of life than the greater part of artists do in a long career, and in his work he left
    the imprint of a person<a name="page191"
    id="page191"/>ality that no one could forget after once having known
    it.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Wolf's work consists chiefly, as we have already seen, of <i>Lieder</i>, and these
    <i>Lieder</i> are characterised by the application to lyrical music of principles
    established by Wagner in the domain of drama. That does not mean he imitated Wagner.
    One finds here and there in Wolf's music Wagnerian forms, just as elsewhere there are
    evident reminiscences of Berlioz. It is the inevitable mark of his time, and each
    great artist in his turn contributes his share to the enrichment of the language that
    belongs to us all. But the real Wagnerism of Wolf is not made up of these unconscious
    resemblances; it lies in his determination to make poetry the inspiration of music.
    "To show, above all," he wrote to Humperdinck in 1890, "that poetry is the true
    source of my music."</p>
    <p>When a man is both a poet and a musician, like Wagner, it is natural that his
    poetry and music should harmonise perfectly. But when it is a matter of translating
    the soul of other poets into music, special gifts of mental subtlety and an abounding
    sympathy are needed. These gifts were possessed by Wolf in a very high degree. No
    musician has more keenly savoured and appreciated the poets. "He was," said one of
    his critics, G. K&uuml;hl, "Germany's greatest psychologist in music since Mozart."
    There was nothing laboured about his psychology. Wolf was incapable of setting to
    <a name="page192" id="page192"/>music poetry
    that he did not really love. He used to have the poetry he wished to translate read
    over to him several times, or in the evening he would read it aloud to himself. If he
    felt very stirred by it he lived apart with it, and thought about it, and soaked
    himself in its atmosphere; then he went to sleep, and the next morning he was able to
    write the <i>Lied</i> straight away. But some poems seemed to sleep in him for years,
    and then would suddenly awake in him in a musical form. On these occasions he would
    cry out with happiness. "Do you know?" he wrote to M&uuml;ller, "I simply shouted
    with joy." M&uuml;ller said he was like an old hen after it had laid an egg.</p>
    <p>Wolf never chose commonplace poems for his music&mdash;which is more than can be
    said of Schubert or Schumann. He did not use anything written by contemporary poets,
    although he was in sympathy with some of them, such as Liliencron, who hoped very
    much to be translated into music by him. But he could not do it; he could not use
    anything in the work of a great poet unless he became so intimate with it that it
    seemed to be a part of him.</p>
    <p>What strikes one also in the <i>Lieder</i> is the importance of the pianoforte
    accompaniment and its independence of the voice. Sometimes the voice and the
    pianoforte express the contrast that so often exists between the words and the
    thought of the poem; at other times they express two personalities, as in his setting
    of Goethe's <i>Prometheus</i>, where the accompaniment represents Zeus sending out
    his thunderbolts, and the voice interprets<a name="page193"
    id="page193"/>Titan; or again, he may depict, as in the setting of
    Eichendorff's <i>Serenade</i>, a student in love in the accompaniment, while the song
    is the voice of an old man who is listening to it and thinking of his youth. But in
    whatever he is describing, the pianoforte and the voice have always their own
    individuality. You cannot take anything away from his <i>Lieder</i> without spoiling
    the whole; and it is especially so with his instrumental passages, which give us the
    beginning and end of his emotion, and which circle round it and sum it up. The
    musical form, following closely the poetic form, is extremely varied. It may
    sometimes express a fugitive thought, a brief record of a poetic impression or some
    little action, or it may be a great epic or dramatic picture. M&uuml;ller remarks
    that Wolf put more into a poem than the poet himself&mdash;as in the
    <i>Italienisches-Liederbuch</i>. It is the worst reproach they can make about him,
    and it is not an ordinary one. Wolf excelled especially in setting poems which
    accorded with his own tragic fate, as if he had some presentiment of it. No one has
    better expressed the anguish of a troubled and despairing soul, such as we find in
    the old harp-player in <i>Wilhelm Meister</i>, or the splendid nihility of certain
    poems of Michelangelo.</p>
    <p>Of all his collections of <i>Lieder</i>, the 53 <i>Gedichte von Eduard
    M&ouml;rike, komponiert f&uuml;r eine Singstimme und Klavier</i> (1888), the first
    published, is the most popular. It gained many friends for Wolf, not so much among
    artists (who are always in the minority) as among those critics who are the best and
    most disinterested of all&mdash;the homely, honest people who <a name="page194" id="page194"/>do not make a
    profession of art, but enjoy it as their spiritual daily bread. There are a number of
    these people in Germany, whose hard lives are beautified by their love of music. Wolf
    found these friends in all parts, but he found most of them in Swabia. At Stuttgart,
    at Mannheim, at Darmstadt, and in the country round about these towns he became very
    popular&mdash;the only popular musician since Schubert and Schumann. All classes of
    society unite in loving him. "His <i>Lieder</i>," says Herr Decsey, "are on the
    pianos of even the poorest houses, by the side of Schubert's <i>Lieder</i>."
    Stuttgart became for Wolf, as he said himself, a second home. He owes this
    popularity, which is without parallel in Swabia, to the people's passionate love of
    <i>Lieder</i> and, above all, of the poetry of M&ouml;rike, the Swabian pastor, who
    lives again in Wolf's songs. Wolf has set to music a quarter of M&ouml;rike's poems,
    he has brought M&ouml;rike into his own, and given him one of the first places among
    German poets. Such was really his intention, and he said so when he had a portrait of
    M&ouml;rike put on the title-page of the songs. Whether the reading of his poetry
    acted as a balm to Wolf's unquiet spirit, or whether he became conscious of his
    genius for the first time when he expressed this poetry in music, I do not know; but
    he felt deep gratitude towards it, and wished to show it by beginning the first
    volume with that fine and rather Beethoven-like song, <i>Der Genesende an die
    Hoffnung</i> ("The Convalescent's Ode to Hope").</p>
    <p>The fifty-one <i>Lieder</i> of the <i>Goethe-Liederbuch</i> (1888-89) were
    composed in groups of <i>Lieder</i>: the<a name="page195"
    id="page195"/><i>Wilhelm Meister Lieder</i>, the <i>Divan (Suleika)
    Lieder</i>, etc. Wolf even tried to identify himself with the poet's line of thought;
    and in this we often find him in rivalry with Schubert. He avoided using the poems in
    which he thought Schubert had exactly conveyed the poet's meaning, as in
    <i>Geheimes</i> and <i>An Schwager Kronos</i>; but he told M&uuml;ller that there
    were times when Schubert did not understand Goethe at all, because he concerned
    himself with translating their general lyrical thought rather than with showing the
    real nature of Goethe's characters. The peculiar interest of Wolf's <i>Lieder</i> is
    that he gives each poetic figure its individual character. The Harpist and Mignon are
    traced with marvellous insight and restraint; and in some passages Wolf shows that he
    has re-discovered Goethe's art of presenting a whole world of sadness in a single
    word. The serenity of a great soul soars over the chaos of passions.</p>
    <p>The <i>Spanisches-Liederbuch nach Heyse und Geibel</i> (1889-90) had already
    inspired Schumann, Brahms, Cornelius, and others. But none had tried to give it its
    rough and sensual character. M&uuml;ller shows how Schumann, especially, robbed the
    poems of their true nature. Not only did he invest them with his own sentimentalism,
    but he calmly arranged poems of the most marked individual character to be sung by
    four voices, which makes them quite absurd; and, worse than this, he changed the
    words and their sense when they stood in his way. Wolf, on the contrary, steeped
    himself in this melancholy and voluptuous world, and would not let anything <a name="page196" id="page196"/>draw him from it; and
    out of it he produced, as he himself said proudly, some masterpieces. The ten
    religious songs that come at the beginning of the collection suggest the delusions of
    mysticism, and weep tears of blood; they are distressing to the ear and mind alike,
    for they are the passionate expression of a faith that puts itself on the rack. By
    the side of them one finds smiling visions of the Holy Family, which recall Murillo.
    The thirty-four folk-songs are brilliant, restless, whimsical, and wonderfully varied
    in form. Each represents a different subject, a personality drawn with incisive
    strokes, and the whole collection overflows with life. It is said that the
    <i>Spanisches-Liederbuch</i> is to Wolf's work what <i>Tristan</i> is to Wagner's
    work.</p>
    <p>The <i>Italienisches-Liederbuch</i> (1890-96) is quite different. The character of
    the songs is very restrained, and Wolf's genius here approached a classic clearness
    of form. He was always seeking to simplify his musical language, and said that if he
    wrote anything more, he wished it to be like Mozart's writings. These <i>Lieder</i>
    contain nothing that is not absolutely essential to their subject; so the melodies
    are very short, and are dramatic rather than lyrical. Wolf gave them an important
    place in his work: "I consider them," he wrote to Kaufmann, "the most original and
    perfect of my compositions."</p>
    <p>As for the <i>Michelangelo Gedichten</i> (1897), they were interrupted by the
    outbreak of his malady, and he had only time to write four, of which he suppressed
    one. Their associations are pathetic when one remembers the tragic time at which they
    were com<a name="page197" id="page197"/>posed;
    and, by a sort of prophetic instinct, they exhale heaviness of spirit and mournful
    pride. The second melody is perhaps more beautiful than anything else Wolf wrote; it
    is truly his death-song:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span><i>Alles endet, was entstehet.<br />
        </i></span> Alles, alles rings vergehet.<a name="FNanchor_190_190"
        id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190"
        class="fnanchor">[190]</a><br />
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>And it is a dead man that sings:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span><i>Menschen waren wir ja auch,<br />
        </i></span> Froh und traurig, so wie Ihr.<br />
         <span>Und nun sind wir leblos hier,<br />
        </span> <span>Sind nur Erde, wie Ihr sehet.
<a name="FNanchor_191_191"
        id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191"
        class="fnanchor">[191]</a></span><br />
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>At the moment he was writing this song, in the short respite he had from his
    illness, he himself was nearly a dead man.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>As soon as Wolf was really dead his genius was recognised all over Germany. His
    sufferings pro<a name="page198" id="page198"/>
    voked an almost excessive reaction in his favour. <i>Hugo-Wolf-Vereine</i> were
    founded everywhere; and to-day we have publications, collections of letters,
    souvenirs, and biographies in abundance. It is a case of who can cry loudest that he
    always understood the genius of the unhappy artist, and work himself into the
    greatest fury against his traducers. A little later, and monuments and statues will
    spring up all over.</p>
    <p>I doubt if Wolf with his rough, sincere nature would have found much consolation
    in this tardy homage if he could have foreseen it. He would have said to his
    posthumous admirers: "You are hypocrites. It is not for me that you raise those
    statues; it is for yourselves. It is that you may make speeches, form committees, and
    delude yourselves and others that you were my friends. Where were you when I had need
    of you? You let me die. Do not play a comedy round my grave. Look rather around you,
    and see if there are not other Wolfs who are struggling against your hostility or
    your indifference. As for me, I have come safe to port."</p>

    <h2><a name="DON_LORENZO_PEROSI" id="DON_LORENZO_PEROSI"></a>DON LORENZO PEROSI</h2>
    <p>The winter that held Italian thought in its cold clasp is over, and great trees
    that seemed to be asleep are putting out new life in the sun. Yesterday it was poetry
    that awaked, and to-day it is music&mdash;the sweet music of Italy, calm in its
    passion and sadness, and artless in its knowledge. Are we really witnessing the
    return of its spring? Is it the incoming of some great tide of melody, which will
    wash away the gloom and doubt of our life to-day? As I was reading the oratorios of
    this young priest of Piedmont, I thought I heard, far away, the song of the children
    of old Greece: "The swallow has come, has come, bringing the gay seasons and glad
    years.</p>
    <p>"&#904;&#945;&#961; &#7972;&#948;&#951;" I welcome the coming of Don Lorenzo
      Perosi with great hope.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>The abb&eacute; Perosi, the precentor of St. Mark's chapel at Venice and the
    director of the Sistine chapel, is twenty-six years old.<a name="FNanchor_192_192"
    id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> He
    is short in stature and of youthful appearance, with a head a little too big for his
    body, and open and regular features lighted up by intelligent black eyes, his only
    peculiarity being a projecting underlip. <a name="page200"
    id="page200"/>He is simple-hearted and modest, and has a friendly
    warmth of affection. When he is conducting the orchestra his striking silhouette, his
    slow and awkward gestures in expressive passages, and his na&iuml;ve movements of
    passion at dramatic moments, bring to mind one of Fra Angelico's monks.</p>
    <p>For the last eighteen months Don Perosi has been working at a cycle of twelve
    oratorios descriptive of the life of Christ. In this short time he has finished four:
    <i>The Passion</i>, <i>The Transfiguration</i>, <i>The Resurrection of Lazarus</i>,
    <i>The Resurrection of Christ</i>. Now he is at work on the fifth&mdash;<i>The
    Nativity</i>.</p>
    <p>These compositions alone place him in the front rank of contemporary musicians.
    They abound in faults; but their qualities are so rare, and his soul shines so
    clearly through them, and such fine sincerity breathes in them, that I have not the
    courage to dwell on their weaknesses. So I shall content myself with remarking, in
    passing, that the orchestration is inadequate and awkward, and that the young
    musician should strive to make it fuller and more delicate; and though he shows great
    ease in composition, he is often too impetuous, and should resist this tendency; and
    that, lastly, there are sometimes traces of bad taste in the music and reminiscences
    of the classics&mdash;all of which are the sins of youth, which age will certainly
    cure.</p>
    <p>Each of the oratorios is really a descriptive mass, which from beginning to end
    traces out one dominating thought. Don Perosi said to me: "The mistake of artists
    to-day is that they attach themselves too much to details and neglect the whole. They
    <a name="page201" id="page201"/>begin by
    carving ornaments, and forget that the most important thing is the unity of their
    work, its plan and general outline. The outline must first of all be beautiful."</p>
    <p>In his own musical architecture one finds well-marked airs, numerous recitatives,
    Gregorian or Palestrinian choruses, chorales with developments and variations in the
    old style, and intervening symphonies of some importance.</p>
    <p>The whole work is to be preceded by a grand prelude, very carefully worked out, to
    which Don Perosi attaches particular worth. He wishes, he says, that his building
    shall have a beautiful door elaborately carved after the fashion of the artists of
    the Renaissance and Gothic times. And so he means to compose the prelude after the
    rest of the oratorio is finished, when he is able to think about it in undisturbed
    peace. He wishes to concentrate a moral atmosphere in it, the very essence of the
    soul and passions of his sacred drama. He also confided to me that of all he has yet
    composed there is nothing he likes better than the introductions to <i>The
    Transfiguration</i> and <i>The Resurrection of Christ</i>.</p>
    <p>The dramatic tendency of these oratorios is very marked, and it is chiefly on that
    account that they have conquered Italy. In spite of some passages which have strayed
    a little in the direction of opera, or even melodrama, the music shows great depth of
    feeling. The figures of the women especially are drawn with delicacy; and in the
    second part of <i>Lazarus</i>, Mary's air, "Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother
    had not died," recalls something <a name="page202"
    id="page202"/>of Gluck's <i>Orfeo</i> in its heart-broken sadness.
    And again, in the same oratorio, when Jesus gives the order to raise the stone from
    the tomb, Martha's speech, "Domine, jam foetet," is very expressive of her sadness,
    fear, and shame, and human horror. I should like to quote one more passage, the most
    moving of all, which is found in the <i>Resurrection of Christ</i>, when Mary
    Magdalene is beside the tomb of Christ; here, in her speech with the angels, in her
    touching lamentation, and in the words of the Evangelist, "And when she had thus
    said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was
    Jesus," we hear a melody filled with tenderness, and seem to see Christ's eyes
    shining as they rest on Mary before she has recognised Him.</p>
    <p>It is not, however, Perosi's dramatic genius that strikes me in his work; it is
    rather his peculiar mournfulness, which is indescribable, his gift of pure poetry,
    and the richness of his flowing melody. However deep the religious feeling in the
    music may be, the music itself is often stronger still, and breaks in upon the drama
    that it may express itself freely. Take, for instance, the fine symphonic passage
    that follows the arrival of Jesus and His friends at Martha and Mary's house, after
    the death of their brother (p. 12 <i>et seq.</i> of <i>Lazarus</i>). It is true the
    orchestra expresses regrets and sighs, the excesses of sorrow mingled with words of
    consolation and faith, in a sort of languishing funeral march that is feminine and
    Christian in character. This, according to the composer, is a picture he has painted
    of the persons in the drama before he makes <a name="page203"
    id="page203"/>them speak. But, in spite of himself, the result is a
    flood of pure music, and his soul sings its own song of joy and sadness. Sometimes
    his spirit, in its na&iuml;ve and delicate charm, recalls that of Mozart; but his
    musical visions are always dominated and directed by a religious strength like that
    of Bach. Even the portions where the dramatic feeling is strongest are really little
    symphonies, such as the music that describes the miracle in <i>The
    Transfiguration</i>, and the illness of Lazarus. In the latter great depth of
    suffering is expressed; indeed, sadness could not have been carried farther even by
    Bach, and the same serenity of mind runs through its despair.</p>
    <p>But what joy there is when these deeds of faith have been performed&mdash;when
    Jesus has cured the possessed man, or when Lazarus has opened his eyes to the light.
    The heart of the multitude overflows perhaps in rather childish thanksgiving; and at
    first it seemed to me expressed in a commonplace way. But did not the joy of all
    great artists so express itself?&mdash;the joy of Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach, who,
    when once they had thrown their cares aside, knew how to amuse themselves like the
    rest of the populace. And the simple phrase at the beginning soon assumes fuller
    proportions, the harmonies gain in richness, a glowing ardour fills the music, and a
    chorale blends with the dances in triumphant majesty.</p>
    <p>All these works are radiant with a happy ease of expression. <i>The Passion</i>
    was finished in September, 1897, <i>The Transfiguration</i> in February, 1898.<a name="page204" id="page204"/><i>Lazarus</i> in
    June, 1898, and <i>The Resurrection of Christ</i> in November, 1898. Such an output
    of work takes us back to eighteenth-century musicians.</p>
    <p>But this is not the only resemblance between the young musician and his
    predecessors. Much of their soul has passed into his. His style is made up of all
    styles, and ranges from the Gregorian chant to the most modern modulations. All
    available materials are used in this work. This is an Italian characteristic. Gabriel
    d'Annunzio threw into his melting-pot the Renaissance, the Italian painters, music,
    the writers of the North, Tolstoy, Dosto&iuml;evsky, Maeterlinck, and our French
    writers, and out of it he drew his wonderful poems. So Don Perosi, in his
    compositions, welds together the Gregorian chant, the musical style of the
    contrapuntists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Palestrina, Roland,
    Gabrieli, Carissimi, Sch&uuml;tz, Bach, H&auml;ndel, Gounod, Wagner&mdash;I was going
    to say C&eacute;sar Franck, but Don Perosi told me that he hardly knew this composer
    at all, though his style bears some resemblance to Franck's.</p>
    <p>Time does not exist for Don Perosi. When he courteously wished to praise French
    musicians, the first name he chose&mdash;as if it were that of a
    contemporary&mdash;was that of Josquin, and then that of Roland de Lassus, who seems
    to him so great and profound a musician that he admires him most of all. And Don
    Perosi's universality of style is a trait that is Catholic as well as Italian. He
    expresses his mind quite clearly on the subject. "Great artists formerly," he says,
    "were more <a name="page205" id="page205"/>
    eclectic than ourselves, and less fettered by their nationalities. Josquin's school
    has peopled all Europe. Roland has lived in Flanders, in Italy, and in Germany. With
    them the same style expressed the same thought everywhere. We must do as they did. We
    must try to recreate a universal art in which the resources of all countries and all
    times are blended."</p>
    <p>As a matter of fact, I do not think this is quite correct. I rather doubt if
    Josquin and Roland were eclectic at all; for they did not really combine the styles
    of different countries, but thrust upon other countries the style that the
    Franco-Flemish school had just created, a style which they themselves were enriching
    daily. But Don Perosi's idea deserves our appreciation, and one must praise his
    endeavour to create a universal style. It would be a good thing for music if
    eclecticism, thus understood, could bring back some of the equilibrium that has been
    lost since Wagner's death; it would be a benefit to the human spirit, which might
    then find in the unity of art a powerful means of bringing about the unity of mind.
    Our aim should be to efface the differences of race in art, so that it may become a
    tongue common to all peoples, where the most opposite ideas may be reconciled. We
    should all join in working to build the cathedral of European art. And the place of
    the director of the Sistine chapel among the first builders is very plain.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <a name="page206" id="page206"/>
    <p>Don Perosi sat down to the piano and played me the <i>Te Deum</i> of <i>The
    Nativity</i>, which he had written the day before. He played very sweetly, with
    youthful gaiety, and sang the choral parts in an undertone. Every now and then he
    would look at me, not for praise, but to see if we were sharing the same thoughts. He
    would look me well in the face with his quiet eyes, then turn back to his score, and
    then look at me again. And I felt a comforting calm radiating from him and his music,
    from its happy harmony and the full and rhythmic serenity of its spirit. And how
    pleasant it was after the tempests and convulsions of art in these later days. Can we
    not tear ourselves away from that romantic suffering in music which was begun by
    Beethoven? After a century of battles, of revolutions, and of political and social
    strife, whose pain has found its reflection in art, let us begin to build a new city
    of art, where men may gather together in brotherly love for the same ideal. However
    Utopian that hope may sound now, let us think of it as a symptom of new directions of
    thought, and let us hope that Don Perosi may be one of those who will bring into
    music that divine peace, that peace which Beethoven craved for in despair at the end
    of his <i>Missa Solemnis</i>, that joy that he sang about but never knew.</p>

    <h2><a name="FRENCH_AND_GERMAN_MUSIC" id="FRENCH_AND_GERMAN_MUSIC"></a>FRENCH AND
    GERMAN MUSIC</h2>
    <p>In May, 1905, the first musical festival of Alsace-Lorraine took place at
    Strasburg. It was an important artistic event, and meant the bringing together of two
    civilisations that for centuries had been at variance on the soil of Alsace, more
    anxious for dispute than for mutual understanding.</p>
    <p>The official programme of the <i>f&ecirc;tes musicales</i> laid stress on the
    reconciliatory purpose of its organisers, and I quote these words from the programme
    book, drawn up by Dr. Max Bendiner, of Strasburg:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"Music may achieve the highest of all missions: she may be a bond between
      nations, races, and states, who are strangers to one another in many ways; she may
      unite what is disunited, and bring peace to what is hostile.... No country is more
      suited for her friendly aid than Alsace-Lorraine, that old meeting-place of people,
      where from time immemorial the North and South have exchanged their material and
      their spiritual wealth; and no place is readier to welcome her than Strasburg, an
      old town built by the Romans, which has remained to this day a centre of spiritual
      life. All great intellectual currents have left their mark on the people of
      Alsace-Lorraine; and so they have been destined to play the part <a name="page208" id="page208"/>of mediator between
      different times and different peoples; and the East and the West, the past and the
      present, meet here and join hands. In such festivals as this, it is not a matter of
      gaining aesthetic victories; it is a matter of bringing together all that is great
      and noble and eternal in the art of different times and different nations."</p>
    </div>
    <p>It was a splendid ambition for Alsace&mdash;the eternal field of battle&mdash;to
    wish to inaugurate these European Olympian games. But in spite of good intentions,
    this meeting of nations resulted in a fight, on musical ground, between two
    civilisations and two arts&mdash;French art and German art. For these two arts
    represent to-day all that is truly alive in European music.</p>
    <p>Such jousts are very stirring, and may be of great service to all combatants. But,
    unhappily, France was very indifferent in the matter. It was the duty of our
    musicians and critics to attend an international encounter like this, and to see that
    the conditions of the combat were fair. By that I mean our art should be represented
    as it ought to be, so that we may learn something from the result. But the French
    public does nothing at such a time; it remains absorbed in its concerts at Paris,
    where everyone knows everyone else so well that they are not able and do not dare to
    criticise freely. And so our art is withering away in an atmosphere of coteries,
    instead of seeking the open air and enjoying a vigorous fight with foreign art. For
    the majority of our critics would rather deny the existence of <a name="page209" id="page209"/>foreign art than try
    to understand it. Never have I regretted their indifference more than I did at the
    Strasburg festival, where, in spite of the unfavourable conditions in which French
    art was represented through our own carelessness, I realised what its force might
    have been if we had been interested spectators in the fight.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Perfect eclecticism had been exercised in the making up of the programme. One
    found mixed together the names of Mozart, Wagner, and Brahms; C&eacute;sar Franck and
    Gustave Charpentier; Richard Strauss and Mahler. There were French singers like
    Cazeneuve and Daraux, and French and Italian virtuosi like Henri Marteau and
    Ferruccio Busoni, together with German, Austrian, and Scandinavian artists. The
    orchestra (the <i>Strassb&uuml;rger St&auml;dtische Orchester</i>) and the choir,
    which was formed of different <i>Chorvereine</i> of Strasburg, were conducted by
    Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, and Camille Chevillard. But the names of these famous
    <i>Kapellmeister</i> must not let us forget the man who was really the soul of the
    concerts&mdash;Professor Ernst M&uuml;nch, of Strasburg, an Alsatian, who conducted
    all the rehearsals, and who effaced himself at the last moment, and left all the
    honours to the conductors of foreign orchestras. Professor M&uuml;nch, who is also
    organist at Saint-Guillaume, has done more than anyone else for music in Strasburg,
    and has trained excellent choirs (the "<i>Choeurs de Saint-Guillaume</i>") there, and
    organised splendid <a name="page210"
    id="page210"/>concerts of Bach's music with the aid of another
    Alsatian, Albert Schweitzer, whose name is well known to musical historians. The
    latter is director of the clerical college of St. Thomas (<i>Thomasstift</i>), a
    pastor, an organist, a professor at the University of Strasburg, and the author of
    interesting works on theology and philosophy. Besides this he has written a now
    famous book, <i>Jean-Sebastien Bach</i>, which is doubly remarkable: first, because
    it is written in French (though it was published in Leipzig by a professor of the
    University of Strasburg), and secondly, because it shows an harmonious blend of the
    French and German spirit, and gives fresh life to the study of Bach and the old
    classic art. It was very interesting to me to make the acquaintance of these people,
    born on Alsatian soil, and representing the best Alsatian culture and all that was
    finest in the two civilisations.</p>

    <p>M. Chevillard alone represented our French musicians at the festival; and they
    could have made no better choice of a conductor. But Germany had delegated her two
    greatest composers, Strauss and Mahler, to come to conduct their newest compositions.
    And I think it would not have been too much to set up one of our own foremost
    composers to combat the glory which these two enjoy in their own country.</p>
    <p>M. Chevillard had been asked to conduct, not one of the works of our recent
    masters, like Debussy or<a name="page212"
    id="page212"/>Dukas, whose style he renders to perfection, but
    Franck's <i>Les B&eacute;atitudes</i>, a work whose spirit he does not, to my mind,
    quite understand. The mystic tenderness of Franck escapes him, and he brings out only
    what is dramatic. And so that performance of <i>Les B&eacute;atitudes</i>, though in
    many respects fine, left an imperfect idea of Franck's genius.</p>
    <p>But what seemed inconceivable, and what justly annoyed M. Chevillard, was that the
    whole of <i>Les B&eacute;atitudes</i> was not given, but only a section of them. And
    on this subject I shall take the liberty of recommending that French artists who are
    guests at similar festivals should not in future agree to a programme with their eyes
    shut, but have their own wishes considered, or refuse their help. If French musicians
    are to be given a place in German <i>Musikfeste</i>, French people must be allowed to
    choose the works that are to represent them. And, above all, a French conductor must
    not be brought from Paris, and find on his arrival a mutilated score and an arbitrary
    choice of a few fragments that are not even whole in themselves. For they played five
    out of the eight <i>B&eacute;atitudes</i>, and cuts had been made in the third and
    eighth <i>B&eacute;atitudes</i>. That showed a want of respect for art, for works
    should be given as they are, or not at all.</p>
    <p>And it would have been more seemly if in this three-day festival the organisers
    had had the courteousness to devote the first day to French music, and had set aside
    one whole concert for it. But, without doubt, they had carefully sand<a name="page213" id="page213"/>wiched the French
    works in between German works to weaken their effect, and lessen the probable (and
    actual) enthusiasm with which French music would be received in the presence of the
    Statthalter of Alsace-Lorraine by a section of the Alsatian public. In addition to
    this, and by a choice that neither myself nor anyone else in Strasburg could believe
    was dictated by musical reasons, the German work chosen to end the evening was the
    final scene from <i>Die Meistersinger</i>, with its ringing couplet from Hans Sachs,
    in which he denounces foreign insincerity and foreign frivolity (<i>W&auml;lschen
    Dunst mit w&auml;lschen Tand</i>). This lack of courtesy&mdash;though the words were
    really nonsense when this very concert was given to show that foreign art could not
    be ignored&mdash;would not be worth while raking up if it did not further serve to
    show how regrettable is the indifference of French artists who take part in these
    festivals. And this mistake would never have occurred if they had taken care to
    acquaint themselves with the programme beforehand and put their veto upon it.</p>
    <p>I have mentioned this little incident partly because my views were shared by many
    Alsatians in the audience, who expressed their annoyance to me afterwards. But,
    putting it aside, our French artists ought not to have consented to let our music be
    represented by a mutilated score of <i>Les B&eacute;atitudes</i> and by Charpentier's
    <i>Impressions d'Italie</i>, for the latter, though a brilliantly clever work, is not
    of the first rank, and was too easily crushed by one of Wagner's most stupendous
    compositions.<a name="page214" id="page214"/>If
    people wish to institute a joust between French and German art, let it be a fair one,
    I repeat; let Wagner be matched with Berlioz, and Strauss with Debussy, and Mahler
    with Dukas or Magnard.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Such were the conditions of the combat; and they were, whether intentionally or
    not, unfavourable to France. And yet to the eyes of an impartial observer the result
    was full of hope and encouragement for us.</p>
    <p>I have never bothered myself in art with questions of nationality. I have not even
    concealed my preference for German music; and I consider, even to-day, that Richard
    Strauss is the foremost musical composer in Europe. Having said this, I am freer to
    speak of the strange impression that I had at the Strasburg festival&mdash;an
    impression of the change that is coming over music, and the way that French art is
    silently setting about taking the place of German art.</p>
    <p>"<i>W&auml;lschen Dunst und w&auml;lschen Tand</i>...." How that reproachful
    speech seems to be misplaced when one is listening to the honest thought expressed in
    C&eacute;sar Franck's music. In <i>Les B&eacute;atitudes</i>, nothing, or next to
    nothing, was done for art's sake. It is the soul speaking to the soul. As Beethoven
    wrote, at the end of his mass in D, "<i>Vom Herzen ... zu Herzen</i>!" ("It comes
    from the heart to go to the heart"). I know no one but Franck in the last century,
    unless it is Beethoven, who has possessed in so high a degree the virtue of being
    himself and speaking <a name="page215"
    id="page215"/>only the truth without thought of his public. Never
    before has religious faith been expressed with such sincerity. Franck is the only
    musician besides Bach who has really <i>seen</i> the Christ, and who can make other
    people see him too. I would even venture to say that his Christ is simpler than
    Bach's; for Bach's thoughts are often led away by the interest of developing his
    subject, by certain habits of composition, and by repetitions and clever devices,
    which weaken his strength. In Franck's music we get Christ's speech itself, unadorned
    and in all its living force. And in the wonderful harmony between the music and the
    sacred words we hear the voice of the world's conscience. I once heard someone say to
    Mme. Cosima Wagner that certain passages in <i>Parsifal</i>, particularly the chorus
    "<i>Durch Mitleid wissend</i>," had a quality that was truly religious and the force
    of a revelation. But I find a greater force and a more truly Christian spirit in
    <i>Les B&eacute;atitudes</i>.</p>
    <p>And here is an astonishing thing. At this German musical festival it was a
    Frenchman who represented not only serious music moulded in a classical form, but a
    religious spirit and the spirit of the Gospels. The characters of two nations have
    been reversed. The Germans have so changed that they are only able to appreciate this
    seriousness and religious faith with difficulty. I watched the audience on this
    occasion; they listened politely, a little astonished and bored, as if to say, "What
    business has this Frenchman with depth and piety of soul?"<a
    name="page216" id="page216"/></p>
    <p>"There is no doubt," said Henri Lichtenberger, who sat by me at the concert, "our
    music is beginning to bore the Germans."</p>
    <p>It was only the other day that German music enjoyed the privilege of boring us in
    France.</p>
    <p>And so, to make up for the austere grandeur of <i>Les B&eacute;atitudes</i> they
    had it immediately followed by Gustave Charpentier's <i>Impressions d'Italie</i>. You
    should have seen the relief of the audience. At last they were to have some French
    music&mdash;as Germans understand it. Charpentier is, of all living French musicians,
    the most liked in Germany; he is indeed the only one who is popular with artists and
    the general public alike. Shall I say that the sincere pleasure they take in his
    orchestration and the gay life of his subjects is enhanced a little by a slight
    disdain for French frivolity&mdash;<i>w&auml;lschen Tand</i>?</p>
    <p>"Now listen to that," said Richard Strauss to me during the third movement of
    <i>Impressions d'Italie</i>; "that is the true music of Montmartre, the utterance of
    fine words ... Liberty!... Love!... which no one believes."</p>
    <p>And on the whole he found the music quite charming, and, without doubt, in the
    depths of his heart approved of this Frenchman according to conventional notions that
    are current in Germany alone. Strauss is really very fond of Charpentier, and was his
    patron in Berlin; and I remember how he showed childish delight in <i>Louise</i> when
    it was first performed in Paris.</p>
    <p>But Strauss, and most other Germans, are quite on the wrong track when they try to
    persuade <a name="page217" id="page217"/>
    themselves that this amusing French frivolity is still the exclusive property of
    France. They really love it because it has become German; and they are quite
    unconscious of the fact. The German artists of other times did not find much pleasure
    in frivolity; but I could have easily shown Strauss his liking for it by taking
    examples from his own works. The Germans of to-day have but little in common with the
    Germans of yesterday.</p>
    <p>I am not speaking of the general public only, The German public of to-day are
    devotees of Brahms and Wagner, and everything of theirs seems good to them; they have
    no discrimination, and, while they applaud Wagner and encore Brahms, they are, in
    their hearts, not only frivolous, but sentimental and gross. The most striking thing
    about this public is their cult of power since Wagner's death. When listening to the
    end of <i>Die Meistersinger</i> I felt how the haughty music of the great march
    reflected the spirit of this military nation of shop-keepers, bursting with rude
    health and complacent pride.</p>
    <p>The most remarkable thing of all is that German artists are gradually losing the
    power of understanding their own splendid classics and, in particular, Beethoven.
    Strauss, who is very shrewd and knows exactly his own limitations, does not willingly
    enter Beethoven's domain, though he feels his spirit in a much more living way than
    any of the other German <i>Kapellmeister</i>. At the Strasburg festival he contented
    himself with conducting, besides his own symphony, the <i>Oberon Overture</i> and a
    Mozart <a name="page218" id="page218"/>
    concerto. These performances were interesting; a personality like his is so curious
    that it is quite amusing to find it coming out in the works he conducts. But how
    Mozart's features took on an offhand and impatient air; and how the rhythms were
    accentuated at the expense of the melodic grace. In this case, however, Strauss was
    dealing with a concerto, where a certain liberty of interpretation is allowed. But
    Mahler, who was less discreet, ventured upon conducting the whole of the Beethoven
    concert. And what can be said of that evening? I will not speak of the <i>Concerto
    for pianoforte, in G major</i>, which Busoni played with a brilliant and superficial
    execution that took away all breadth from the work; it is enough to note that his
    interpretation was enthusiastically received by the public. German artists were not
    responsible for that performance; but they were responsible for that fine cycle of
    <i>Lieder, An die entfernte Geliebte</i>, which was bellowed by a Berlin tenor at the
    top of his voice, and for the <i>Choral Symphony</i>, which was, for me, an
    unspeakable performance. I could never have believed that a German orchestra
    conducted by the chief <i>Kapellmeister</i> of Austria could have committed such
    misdeeds. The time was incredible: the scherzo had no life in it; the adagio was
    taken in hot haste without leaving a moment for dreams; and there were pauses in the
    finale which destroyed the development of the theme and broke the thread of its
    thought. The different parts of the orchestra fell over one another, and the whole
    was uncertain and lacking in balance. I once <a name="page219"
    id="page219"/>severely criticised the neo-classic stiffness of
    Weingartner; but I should have appreciated his healthy equilibrium and his effort to
    be exact after hearing this neurasthenic rendering of Beethoven. No; we can no longer
    hear Beethoven and Mozart in Germany to-day, we can only hear Mahler and Strauss.
    Well, let it be so. We will resign ourselves. The past is past. Let us leave
    Beethoven and Mozart, and speak of Mahler and Strauss.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Gustav Mahler is forty-six years old.<a name="FNanchor_193_193"
    id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> He
    is a kind of legendary type of German musician, rather like Schubert, and half-way
    between a school-master and a clergyman. He has a long, clean-shaven face, a pointed
    skull covered with untidy hair, a bald forehead, a prominent nose, eyes that blink
    behind his glasses, a large mouth and thin lips, hollow cheeks, a rather tired and
    sarcastic expression, and a general air of asceticism. He is excessively nervous, and
    silhouette caricatures of him, representing him as a cat in convulsions in the
    conductor's desk, are very popular in Germany.</p>
    <p>He was born at Kalischt in Bohemia, and became a pupil of Anton Bruckner at
    Vienna, and afterwards <i>Hofoperndirecktor</i> ("Director of the Opera") there. I
    hope one day to study this artist's work in greater detail, for he is second only to
    Strauss as a composer in Germany, and the principal musician of South Germany.</p>
    <p>His most important work is a suite of sym<a name="page220"
    id="page220"/>phonies; and it was the fifth symphony of this suite
    that he conducted at the Strasburg festival. The first symphony, called <i>Titan</i>,
    was composed in 1894. The construction of the whole is on a massive and gigantic
    scale; and the melodies on which these works are built up are like rough-hewn blocks
    of not very good quality, but imposing by reason of their size, and by the obstinate
    repetition of their rhythmic design, which is maintained as if it were an obsession.
    This heaping-up of music both crude and learned in style, with harmonies that are
    sometimes clumsy and sometimes delicate, is worth considering on account of its bulk.
    The orchestration is heavy and noisy; and the brass dominates and roughly gilds the
    rather sombre colouring of the great edifice. The underlying idea of the composition
    is neo-classic, and rather spongy and diffuse. Its harmonic structure is composite:
    we get the style of Bach, Schubert, and Mendelssohn fighting that of Wagner and
    Bruckner; and, by a decided liking for canon form, it even recalls some of Franck's
    work. The whole is like a showy and expensive collection of bric-&agrave;-brac.</p>
    <p>The chief characteristic of these symphonies is, generally speaking, the use of
    choral singing with the orchestra. "When I conceive a great musical painting (<i>ein
    grosses musikalisches Gem&auml;lde</i>)," says Mahler, "there always comes a moment
    when I feel forced to employ speech (<i>das Wort</i>) as an aid to the realisation of
    my musical conception."</p>
    <p>Mahler has got some striking effects from this combination of voices and
    instruments, and he did <a name="page221"
    id="page221"/>well to seek inspiration in this direction from
    Beethoven and Liszt. It is incredible that the nineteenth century should have put
    this combination to so little use; for I think the gain may be poetical as well as
    musical.</p>
    <p>In the <i>Second Symphony in C minor</i>, the first three parts are purely
    instrumental; but in the fourth part the voice of a contralto is heard singing these
    sad and simple words:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>"<i>Der Mensch liegt in gr&ouml;sster Noth!</i><br />
        </span> <span><i>Der Mensch liegt in gr&ouml;sster Pein!</i><br />
        </span> <span><i>Je lieber m&ouml;cht ich im Himmel sein</i>!"<a
        name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194"
        class="fnanchor">[194]</a><br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The soul strives to reach God with the passionate cry:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>"<i>Ich bin von Gott und will wieder zu Gott</i>."<a
        name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195"
        class="fnanchor">[195]</a><br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Then there is a symphonic episode (<i>Der Rufer in der W&uuml;ste</i>), and we
    hear "the voice of one crying in the wilderness" in fierce and anguished tones. There
    is an apocalyptic finale where the choir sing Klopstock's beautiful ode on the
    promise of the Resurrection:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>"<i>Aufersteh'n, ja, aufersteh'n wirst du, mein Staub, nach</i><br />
        </span> <span><i>kurzer Ruh</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_196_196"
        id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196"
        class="fnanchor">[196]</a><br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The law is proclaimed with:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>"<i>Was entstanden ist, dass mus vergehen,</i><br />
        </span> <span><i>Was vergangen, auferstehen</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_197_197"
        id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197"
        class="fnanchor">[197]</a><br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p><a name="page222" id="page222"/>And all the
    orchestra, the choirs, and the organ, join in the hymn of Eternal Life.</p>
    <p>In the <i>Third Symphony</i>, known as <i>Ein Sommermorgentraum</i> ("A Summer
    Morning's Dream"), the first and the last parts are for the orchestra alone; the
    fourth part contains some of the best of Mahler's music, and is an admirable setting
    of Nietzsche's words:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>"<i>O Mensch! O Mensch! Gib Acht! gib Acht!</i><br />
        </span> <span class="poem"><i>Was spricht die tiefe Mitternacht</i>?"<a
        name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198"
        class="fnanchor">[198]</a><br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The fifth part is a gay and stirring chorus founded on a popular legend.</p>
    <p>In the <i>Fourth Symphony in G major</i>, the last part alone is sung, and is of
    an almost humorous character, being a sort of childish description of the joys of
    Paradise.</p>
    <p>In spite of appearances, Mahler refuses to connect these choral symphonies with
    programme-music. Without doubt he is right, if he means that his music has its own
    value outside any sort of programme; but there is no doubt that it is always the
    expression of a definite <i>Stimmung</i>, of a conscious mood; and the fact is,
    whether he likes it or not, that <i>Stimmung</i> gives an interest to his music far
    beyond that of the music itself. His personality seems to me far more interesting
    than his art.</p>
    <p>This is often the case with artists in Germany; Hugo Wolf is another example of
    it. Mahler's <a name="page223" id="page223"/>
    case is really rather curious. When one studies his works one feels convinced that he
    is one of those rare types in modern Germany&mdash;an egoist who feels with
    sincerity. Perhaps his emotions and his ideas do not succeed in expressing themselves
    in a really sincere and personal way; for they reach us through a cloud of
    reminiscences and an atmosphere of classicism. I cannot help thinking that Mahler's
    position as director of the Opera, and his consequent saturation in the music that
    his calling condemns him to study, is the cause of this. There is nothing more fatal
    to a creative spirit than too much reading, above all when it does not read of its
    own free will, but is forced to absorb an excessive amount of nourishment, the larger
    part of which is indigestible. In vain may Mahler try to defend the sanctuary of his
    mind; it is violated by foreign ideas coming from all parts, and instead of being
    able to drive them away, his conscience, as conductor of the orchestra, obliges him
    to receive them and almost embrace them. With his feverish activity, and burdened as
    he is with heavy tasks, he works unceasingly and has no time to dream. Mahler will
    only be Mahler when he is able to leave his administrative work, shut up his scores,
    retire within himself, and wait patiently until he has become himself again&mdash;if
    it is not too late.</p>
    <p>His <i>Fifth Symphony</i>, which he conducted at Strasburg, convinced me, more
    than all his other works, of the urgent necessity of adopting this course. In this
    composition he has not allowed <a name="page224"
    id="page224"/>himself the use of the choruses, which were one of the
    chief attractions of his preceding symphonies. He wished to prove that he could write
    pure music, and to make his claim surer he refused to have any explanation of his
    composition published in the concert programme, as the other composers in the
    festival had done; he wished it, therefore, to be judged from a strictly musical
    point of view. It was a dangerous ordeal for him.</p>
    <p>Though I wished very much to admire the work of a composer whom I held in such
    esteem, I felt it did not come out very well from the test. To begin with, this
    symphony is excessively long&mdash;it lasts an hour and a half&mdash;though there is
    no apparent justification for its proportions. It aims at being colossal, and mainly
    achieves emptiness. The <i>motifs</i> are more than familiar. After a funeral march
    of commonplace character and boisterous movement, where Beethoven seems to be taking
    lessons from Mendelssohn, there comes a scherzo, or rather a Viennese waltz, where
    Chabrier gives old Bach a helping hand. The adagietto has a rather sweet
    sentimentality. The rondo at the end is presented rather like an idea of Franck's,
    and is the best part of the composition; it is carried out in a spirit of mad
    intoxication and a chorale rises up from it with crashing joy; but the effect of the
    whole is lost in repetitions that choke it and make it heavy. Through all the work
    runs a mixture of pedantic stiffness and incoherence; it moves along in a desultory
    way, and suffers from abrupt checks in the course of its development and from
    super<a name="page225" id="page225"/>fluous
    ideas that break in for no reason at all, with the result that the whole hangs
    fire.</p>
    <p>Above all, I fear Mahler has been sadly hypnotised by ideas about
    power&mdash;ideas that are getting to the head of all German artists to-day. He seems
    to have an undecided mind, and to combine sadness and irony with weakness and
    impatience, to be a Viennese musician striving after Wagnerian grandeur. No one
    expresses the grace of <i>L&auml;ndler</i> and dainty waltzes and mournful reveries
    better than he; and perhaps no one is nearer the secret of Schubert's moving and
    voluptuous melancholy; and it is Schubert he recalls at times, both in his good
    qualities and certain of his faults. But he wants to be Beethoven or Wagner. And he
    is wrong; for he lacks their balance and gigantic force. One saw that only too well
    when he was conducting the <i>Choral Symphony</i>.</p>
    <p>But whatever he may be, or whatever disappointment he may have brought me at
    Strasburg, I will never allow myself to speak lightly or scoffingly of him. I am
    confident that a musician with so lofty an aim will one day create a work worthy of
    himself.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Richard Strauss is a complete contrast to Mahler. He has always the air of a
    heedless and discontented child. Tall and slim, rather elegant and supercilious, he
    seems to be of a more refined race than most other German artists of to-day.
    Scornful, <i>blas&eacute;</i> with success, and very exacting, his bearing towards
    other musicians has nothing of Mahler's <a name="page226"
    id="page226"/>winning modesty. He is not less nervous than Mahler,
    and while he is conducting the orchestra he seems to indulge in a frenzied dance
    which follows the smallest details of his music&mdash;music that is as agitated as
    limpid water into which a stone has been flung. But he has a great advantage over
    Mahler; he knows how to rest after his labours. Both excitable and sleepy by nature,
    his highly-strung nerves are counterbalanced by his indolence, and there is in the
    depths of him a Bavarian love of luxury. I am quite sure that when his hours of
    intense living are over, after he has spent an excessive amount of energy, he has
    hours when he is only partially alive. One then sees his eyes with a vague and sleepy
    look in them; and he is like old Rameau, who used to walk about for hours as if he
    were an automaton, seeing nothing and thinking of nothing.</p>
    <p>At Strasburg Strauss conducted his <i>Sinfonia Domestica</i>, whose programme
    seems boldly to defy reason, and even good taste. In the symphony he pictures himself
    with his wife and his boy (<i>"Meiner lieben Frau und unserm Jungen gewidmet"</i>).
    "I do not see," said Strauss, "why I should not compose a symphony about myself; I
    find myself quite as interesting as Napoleon or Alexander." Some people have replied
    that everybody else might not share his interest. But I shall not use that argument;
    it is quite possible for an artist of Strauss's worth to keep us entertained. What
    grates upon me more is the way in which he speaks of himself. The disproportion
    between his subject <a name="page227"
    id="page227"/>and the means he has of expressing it is too strong.
    Above all, I do not like this display of the inner and secret self. There is a want
    of reticence in this <i>Sinfonia Domestica</i>. The fireside, the sitting-room, and
    the bedchamber, are open to all-comers. Is this the family feeling of Germany to-day?
    I admit that the first time I heard the work it jarred upon me for purely moral
    reasons, in spite of the liking I have for its composer. But afterwards I altered my
    first opinion, and found the music admirable. Do you know the programme?</p>
    <p>The first part shows you three people: a man, a woman, and a child. The man is
    represented by three themes: a <i>motif</i> full of spirit and humour, a thoughtful
    <i>motif</i>, and a <i>motif</i> expressing eager and enthusiastic action. The woman
    has only two themes: one expressing caprice, and the other love and tenderness. The
    child has a single <i>motif</i>, which is quiet, innocent, and not very defined in
    character; its real value is not shown until it is developed.... Which of the two
    parents is he like? The family sit round him and discuss him. "He is just like his
    father" (<i>Ganz der Papa</i>), say the aunts. "He is the image of his mother"
    (<i>Ganz die Mama</i>), say the uncles.</p>
    <p>The second part of the symphony is a scherzo which represents the child at play;
    there are terribly noisy games, games of Herculean gaiety, and you can hear the
    parents talking all over the house. How far we seem from Schumann's good little
    children and their simple-hearted families! At last the child is put to bed; they
    rock him to <a name="page228" id="page228"/>
    sleep, and the clock strikes seven. Night comes. There are dreams and some uneasy
    sleep. Then a love scene.... The clock strikes seven in the morning. Everybody wakes
    up, and there is a merry discussion. We hear a double fugue in which the theme of the
    man and the theme of the woman contradict each other with exasperating and ludicrous
    obstinacy; and the man has the last word. Finally there is the apotheosis of the
    child and family life.</p>
    <p>Such a programme serves rather to lead the listener astray than to guide him. It
    spoils the idea of the work by emphasising its anecdotal and rather comic side. For
    without doubt the comic side is there, and Strauss has warned us in vain that he did
    not wish to make an amusing picture of married life, but to praise the sacredness of
    marriage and parenthood; but he possesses such a strong vein of humour that it cannot
    help getting the better of him. There is nothing really grave or religious about the
    music, except when he is speaking of the child; and then the rough merriment of the
    man grows gentle, and the irritating coquetry of the woman becomes exquisitely
    tender. Otherwise Strauss's satire and love of jesting get the upper hand, and reach
    an almost epic gaiety and strength.</p>
    <p>But one must forget this unwise programme, which borders on bad taste and at times
    on something even worse. When one has succeeded in forgetting it one discovers a
    well-proportioned symphony in four parts&mdash;Allegro, Scherzo, Adagio, and Finale
    in fugue form&mdash;and one of the finest works in contem<a
    name="page229" id="page229"/>porary music. It has the passionate
    exuberance of Strauss's preceding symphony, <i>Heldenleben</i>, but it is superior in
    artistic construction; one may even say that it is Strauss's most perfect work since
    <i>Tod und Verkl&auml;rung</i> ("Death and Transfiguration"), with a richness of
    colouring and technical skill that <i>Tod und Verkl&auml;rung</i> did not possess.
    One is dazzled by the beauty of an orchestration which is light and pliant, and
    capable of expressing delicate shades of feeling; and this struck me the more after
    the solid massiveness of Mahler's orchestration, which is like heavy unleavened
    bread. With Strauss everything is full of life and sinew, and there is nothing
    wasted. Possibly the first setting-out of his themes has rather too schematic a
    character; and perhaps the melodic utterance is rather restricted and not very lofty;
    but it is very personal, and one finds it impossible to disassociate his personality
    from these vigorous themes that burn with youthful ardour, and cut the air like
    arrows, and twist themselves in freakish arabesques. In the adagio depicting night,
    there is, though in very bad taste, much seriousness and reverie and stirring
    emotion. The fugue at the end is of astonishing sprightliness; and is a mixture of
    colossal jesting and heroic pastoral poetry worthy of Beethoven, whose style it
    recalls in the breadth of its development. The final apotheosis is filled with life;
    its joy makes the heart beat. The most extravagant harmonic effects and the most
    abominable discords are softened and almost disappear in the wonderful combination of
    <i>timbres</i>. It is the work of a strong and sensual <a
    name="page230" id="page230"/>artist, the true heir of the Wagner of
    the <i>Meistersinger</i>.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>Upon the whole, these works make one see that, in spite of their apparent
    audacity, Strauss and Mahler are beginning to make a surreptitious retreat from their
    early standpoint, and are abandoning the symphony with a programme. Strauss's last
    work will lose nothing by calling itself quite simply <i>Sinfonia Domestica</i>,
    without adding any further information. It is a true symphony; and the same may be
    said of Mahler's composition. But Strauss and Mahler are already reforming
    themselves, and are coming back to the model of the classic symphony.</p>
    <p>But there are more important conclusions to be drawn from a hearing of this kind.
    The first is that Strauss's talent is becoming more and more exceptional in the music
    of his country. With all his faults, which are considerable, Strauss stands alone in
    his warmth of imagination, in his unquenchable spontaneity and perpetual youth. And
    his knowledge and his art are growing every day in the midst of other German art
    which is growing old. German music in general is showing some grave symptoms. I will
    not dwell on its neurasthenia, for it is passing through a crisis which will teach it
    wisdom; but I fear, nevertheless, that this excessive nervous excitement will be
    followed by torpor. What is really disquieting is that, in spite of all the talent
    that still abounds, Germany is fast losing her <a
    name="page231" id="page231"/>chief musical endowments. Her melodic
    charm has nearly disappeared. One could search the music of Strauss, Mahler, or Hugo
    Wolf, without finding a melody of any real value, or of any true originality, outside
    its application to a text, or a literary idea, and its harmonic development. And
    besides that, German music is daily losing its intimate spirit; there are still
    traces of this spirit in Wolf, thanks to his exceptionally unhappy life; but there is
    very little of it in Mahler, in spite of all his efforts to concentrate his mind on
    himself; and there is hardly any at all in Strauss, although he is the most
    interesting of the three composers. German musicians have no longer any depth.</p>
    <p>I have said that I attribute this fact to the detestable influence of the theatre,
    to which nearly all these artists are attached as <i>Kapellmeister</i>, or directors
    of opera. To this they owe the melodramatic character of their music, even though it
    is on the surface only&mdash;music written for show, and aiming chiefly at
    effect.</p>
    <p>More baneful even than the influence of the theatre is the influence of success.
    These musicians have nowadays too many facilities for having their music played. A
    work is played almost before it is finished, and the musician has no time to live
    with his work in solitude and silence. Besides this, the works of the chief German
    musicians are supported by tremendous booming of some kind or another: by their
    <i>Musikfeste</i>, by their critics, their press, and their "Musical Guides"
    (<i>Musikf&uuml;hrer</i>), which are apologetic explanations of their works,
    scattered <a name="page232" id="page232"/>
    abroad in millions to set the fashion for the sheep-like public. And with all this a
    musician grows soon contented with himself, and comes to believe any favourable
    opinion about his work. What a difference from Beethoven, who, all his life, was
    hammering out the same subjects, and putting his melodies on the anvil twenty times
    before they reached their final form. That is where Mahler is so lacking. His
    subjects are a rather vulgarised edition of some of Beethoven's ideas in their
    unfinished state. But Mahler gets no further than the rough sketch.</p>
    <p>And, lastly, I want to speak of the greatest danger of all that menaces music in
    Germany; <i>there is too much music in Germany</i>. This is not a paradox. There is
    no worse misfortune for art than a super-abundance of it. The music is drowning the
    musicians. Festival succeeds festival: the day after the Strasburg festival there was
    to be a Bach festival at Eisenach; and then, at the end of the week, a Beethoven
    festival at Bonn. Such a plethora of concerts, theatres, choral societies, and
    chamber-music societies, absorbs the whole life of the musician. When has he time to
    be alone to listen to the music that sings within him? This senseless flood of music
    invades the sanctuaries of his soul, weakens its power, and destroys its sacred
    solitude and the treasures of its thought.</p>
    <p>You must not think that this excess of music existed in the old days in Germany.
    In the time of the great classic masters, Germany had hardly any institutions for the
    giving of regular concerts, and choral performances were hardly known. In <a name="page233" id="page233"/>the Vienna of Mozart
    and Beethoven there was only a single association that gave concerts, and no
    <i>Chorvereine</i> at all, and it was the same with other towns in Germany. Does the
    wonderful spread of musical culture in Germany during the last century correspond
    with its artistic creation? I do not think so; and one feels the inequality between
    the two more every day.</p>
    <p>Do you remember Goethe's ballad of <i>Der Zauberlehrling</i> (<i>L'Apprenti
    Sorcier</i>) which Dukas so cleverly made into music? There, in the absence of his
    master, an apprentice set working some magic spells, and so opened sluice-gates that
    no one could shut; and the house was flooded.</p>
    <p>This is what Germany has done. She has let loose a flood of music, and is about to
    be drowned in it.</p>

    <h2><a name="CLAUDE_DEBUSSY" id="CLAUDE_DEBUSSY"></a>CLAUDE DEBUSSY</h2>
    <h4>PELL&Eacute;AS ET M&Eacute;LISANDE</h4>
    <p>The first performance of <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> in Paris, on
    April 30th, 1902, was a very notable event in the history of French music; its
    importance can only be compared with that of the first performance of Lully's
    <i>Cadmus et Hermione</i>, Rameau's <i>Hippolyte et Aricie</i>, and Quick's
    <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Aulide</i>; and it may be looked upon as one of the three or
    four red-letter days in the calendar of our lyric stage.<a name="FNanchor_199_199"
    id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>
    <p>The success of <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> is due to many things.
    Some of them are trivial, such as fashion, which has certainly played its part here
    as it has in all other successes, though it is a relatively weak part; some of them
    are more important, and arise from something innate in the spirit of French genius;
    and there are also moral and aesthetic reasons for its success, and, in the widest
    sense, purely musical reasons.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>In speaking of the moral reasons of the success <a
    name="page235" id="page235"/>of <i>Pell&eacute;as et
    M&eacute;lisande</i>, I would like to draw your attention to a form of thought which
    is not confined to France, but which is common nowadays in a section of the more
    distinguished members of European society, and which has found expression in
    <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i>. The atmosphere in which Maeterlinck's
    drama moves makes one feel the melancholy resignation of the will to Fate. We are
    shown that nothing can change the order of events; that, despite our proud illusions,
    we are not master of ourselves, but the servant of unknown and irresistible forces,
    which direct the whole tragicomedy of our lives. We are told that no man is
    responsible for what he likes and what he loves&mdash;that is if he knows what he
    likes and loves&mdash;and that he lives and dies without knowing why.</p>
    <p>These fatalistic ideas, reflecting the lassitude of the intellectual aristocracy
    of Europe, have been wonderfully translated into music by Debussy; and when you feel
    the poetic and sensual charm of the music, the ideas become fascinating and
    intoxicating, and their spirit is very infectious. For there is in all music an
    hypnotic power which is able to reduce the mind to a state of voluptuous
    submission.</p>
    <p>The cause of the artistic success of <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> is
    of a more specially French character, and marks a reaction that is at once
    legitimate, natural, and inevitable; I would even say it is vital&mdash;a reaction of
    French genius against foreign art, and especially against Wagnerian art and its
    awkward representatives in France.<a name="page236"
    id="page236"/></p>
    <p>Is the Wagnerian drama perfectly adapted to German genius? I do not think so; but
    that is a question which I will leave German musicians to decide. For ourselves, we
    have the right to assert that the form of Wagnerian drama is antipathetic to the
    spirit of French people&mdash;to their artistic taste, to their ideas about the
    theatre, and to their musical feeling. This form may have forced itself upon us, and,
    by the right of victorious genius, may have strongly influenced the French mind, and
    may do so again; but nothing will ever make it anything but a stranger in our
    land.</p>
    <p>It is not necessary to dwell upon the differences of taste. The Wagnerian ideal
    is, before everything else, an ideal of power. Wagner's passional and intellectual
    exaltation and his mystic sensualism are poured out like a fiery torrent, which
    sweeps away and burns all before it, taking no heed of barriers. Such an art cannot
    be bound by ordinary rules; it has no need to fear bad taste&mdash;and I commend it.
    But it is easy to understand that other ideals exist, and that another art might be
    as expressive by its proprieties and niceties as by its richness and force. And this
    former art&mdash;our own&mdash;is not so much a reaction against Wagnerian art as a
    reaction against its caricatures in France and the consequent abuse of an
    ill-regulated power.</p>
    <p>Genius has a right to be what it will&mdash;to trample underfoot, if it wishes,
    taste and morals and the whole of society. But when those who are not geniuses wish
    to do the same thing they only make themselves ridiculous and odious. There have been
    <a name="page237" id="page237"/>too many monkey
    Wagners in France. During the last ten or twenty years scarcely one French musician
    has escaped Wagner's influence. One understands only too well the revolt of the
    French mind, in the name of naturalness and good taste, against exaggerations and
    extremes of passion, whether sincere or not. <i>Pell&eacute;as et
    M&eacute;lisande</i> came as a manifestation of this revolt. It is an uncompromising
    reaction against over-emphasis and excess, and against anything that oversteps the
    limits of the imagination. This distaste of exaggerated words and sentiments results
    in what is like a fear of showing the feelings at all, even when they are most deeply
    stirred. With Debussy the passions almost whisper; and it is by the imperceptible
    vibrations of the melodic line that the love in the hearts of the unhappy couple is
    shown, by the timid "Oh, why are you going?" at the end of the first act, and the
    quiet "I love you, too," in the last scene but one. Think of the wild lamentations of
    the dying Ysolde, and then of the death of M&eacute;lisande, without cries and
    without words.</p>
    <p>From a scenic point of view, <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> is also
    quite opposed to the Bayreuth ideal. The vast proportions&mdash;almost immoderate
    proportions&mdash;of the Wagnerian drama, its compact structure and the intense
    concentration of mind which from beginning to end holds these enormous works and
    their ideology together, and which is often displayed at the expense of the action
    and even the emotions, are as far removed as they can be from the French love of
    clear, logical, and temperate action. The <a name="page238"
    id="page238"/>little pictures of <i>Pell&eacute;as et
    M&eacute;lisande</i>, small and sharply cut, each marking without stress a new stage
    in the evolution of the drama, are built up in quite a different way from those of
    the Wagnerian theatre.</p>
    <p>And, as if he wished to accentuate this antagonism, the author of
    <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> is now writing a <i>Tristan</i>, whose plot
    is taken from an old French poem, the text of which has been recently brought to
    light by M. B&eacute;dier. In its calm and lofty strain it is a wonderful contrast to
    Wagner's savage and pedantic, though sublime poem.</p>
    <p>But it is especially by the manner in which they conceive the respective
    relationships of poetry and music to opera that the two composers differ. With
    Wagner, music is the kernel of the opera, the glowing focus, the centre of
    attraction; it absorbs everything, and it stands absolutely first. But that is not
    the French conception. The musical stage, as we conceive it in France (if not what we
    actually possess), should present such a combination of the arts as go to make an
    harmonious whole. We demand that an equal balance shall be kept between poetry and
    music; and if their equilibrium must be a little upset, we should prefer that poetry
    was not the loser, as its utterance is more conscious and rational. That was Gluck's
    aim; and because he realised it so well he gained a reputation among the French
    public which nothing will destroy. Debussy's strength lies in the methods by which he
    has approached this ideal of musical temperateness and disinterestedness, and in the
    way he has placed his <a name="page239"
    id="page239"/>genius as a composer at the service of the drama. He
    has never sought to dominate Maeterlinck's poem, or to swallow it up in a torrent of
    music; he has made it so much a part of himself that at the present time no Frenchman
    is able to think of a passage in the play without Debussy's music singing at the same
    time within him.</p>
    <p>But apart from all these reasons that make the work important in the history of
    opera, there are purely musical reasons for its success, which are of deeper
    significance still.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> <i>Pell&eacute;as et
    M&eacute;lisande</i> has brought about a reform in the dramatic music of France. This
    reform is concerned with several things, and, first of all, with recitative.</p>
    <p>In France we have never had&mdash;apart from a few attempts in
    <i>op&eacute;ra-comique</i>&mdash;a recitative that exactly expressed our natural
    speech. Lully and Rameau took for their model the high-flown declamation of the
    tragedy stage of their time. And French opera for the past twenty years has chosen a
    more dangerous model still&mdash;the declamation of Wagner, with its vocal leaps and
    its resounding and heavy accentuation. Nothing could be more displeasing in French.
    All people of taste suffered from it, though they did not admit it. At this time,
    Antoine, G&eacute;mier, and Guitry were making theatrical declamation more natural,
    and this made the exaggerated declamation of the French opera appear more ridiculous
    and more archaic still. And so a <a name="page240"
    id="page240"/>reform in recitative was inevitable. Jean-Jacques
    Rousseau had foreseen it in the very direction in which Debussy<a
    name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201"
    class="fnanchor">[201]</a> has accomplished it. He showed in his <i>Lettre sur la
    musique fran&ccedil;aise</i> that there was no connection between the inflections of
    French speech, "whose accents are so harmonious and simple," and "the shrill and
    noisy intonations" of the recitative of French opera. And he concluded by saying that
    the kind of recitative that would best suit us should "wander between little
    intervals, and neither raise nor lower the voice very much; and should have little
    sustained sound, no noise, and no cries of any description&mdash;nothing, indeed,
    that resembled singing, and little inequality in the duration or value of the notes,
    or in their intervals." This is the very definition of Debussy's recitative.</p>
    <p>The symphonic fabric of <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> differs just as
    widely from Wagner's dramas. With Wagner it is a living thing that springs from one
    great root, a system of interlaced phrases whose powerful growth puts out branches in
    every direction, like an oak. Or, to take another simile, it is like a painting,
    which though it has not been executed at a single sitting, yet gives us that
    impression; and, in spite of the retouching and altering to which it has been
    subjected, still has the effect of a compact whole, of an indestructible amalgam,
    from <a name="page241" id="page241"/>which
    nothing can be detached. Debussy's system, on the contrary, is, so to speak, a sort
    of classic impressionism&mdash;an impressionism that is refined, harmonious, and
    calm; that moves along in musical pictures, each of which corresponds to a subtle and
    fleeting moment of the soul's life; and the painting is done by clever little strokes
    put in with a soft and delicate touch. This art is more allied to that of Moussorgski
    (though without any of his roughness) than that of Wagner, in spite of one or two
    reminiscences of <i>Parsifal</i>, which are only extraneous traits in the work. In
    <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> one finds no persistent <i>leitmotifs</i>
    running through the work, or themes which pretend to translate into music the life of
    characters and types; but, instead, we have phrases that express changing feelings,
    that change with the feelings. More than that, Debussy's harmony is not, as it was
    with Wagner and all the German school, a fettered harmony, tightly bound to the
    despotic laws of counterpoint; it is, as Laloy<a name="FNanchor_202_202"
    id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> has
    said, a harmony that is first of all harmonious, and has its origin and end in
    itself.</p>
    <p>As Debussy's art only attempts to give the impression of the moment, without
    troubling itself with what may come after, it is free from care, and takes its fill
    in the enjoyment of the moment. In the garden of harmonies it selects the most
    beautiful flowers; for sincerity of expression takes a second <a name="page242" id="page242"/>place with it, and
    its first idea is to please. In this again it interprets the aesthetic sensualism of
    the French race, which seeks pleasure in art, and does not willingly admit ugliness,
    even when it seems to be justified by the needs of the drama and of truth. Mozart
    shared the same thought: "Music," he said, "even in the most terrible situations,
    ought never to offend the ear; it should charm it even there; and, in short, always
    remain music."</p>
    <p>As for Debussy's harmonic language, his originality does not consist, as some of
    his foolish admirers have said, in the invention of new chords, but in the new use he
    makes of them. A man is not a great artist because he makes use of unresolved
    sevenths and ninths, consecutive major thirds and ninths, and harmonic progressions
    based on a scale of whole tones; one is only an artist when one makes them say
    something. And it is not on account of the peculiarities of Debussy's style&mdash;of
    which one may find isolated examples in great composers before him, in Chopin, Liszt,
    Chabrier, and Richard Strauss&mdash;but because with Debussy these peculiarities are
    an expression of his personality, and because <i>Pell&eacute;as et
    M&eacute;lisande</i>, "the land of ninths," has a poetic atmosphere which is like no
    other musical drama ever written.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the orchestration is purposely restrained, light, and divided, for Debussy
    has a fine disdain for those orgies of sound to which Wagner's art has accustomed us;
    it is as sober and polished as a fine classic phrase of the latter part of the
    seventeenth century. <i>Ne quid nimis</i> ("Nothing superfluous")<a name="page243" id="page243"/>is the artist's
    motto. Instead of amalgamating the <i>timbres</i> to get a massive effect, he
    disengages their separate personalities, as it were, and delicately blends them
    without changing their individual nature. Like the impressionist painters of to-day,
    he paints with primary colours, but with a delicate moderation that rejects anything
    harsh as if it were something unseemly.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <p>I have given more than enough reasons to account for the success of
    <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> and the place that its admirers give it in
    the history of opera. There is every reason to believe that the composer has not been
    as acutely conscious of his musico-dramatic reform as his disciples have been. The
    reform with him has a more instinctive character; and that is what gives it its
    strength. It responds to an unconscious yet profound need of the French spirit. I
    would even venture to say that the historical importance of Debussy's work is greater
    than its artistic value. His personality is not without faults, and the gravest are
    perhaps negative faults&mdash;the absence of certain qualities, and even of the
    strong and extravagant faults which made the heroes of the art world, like Beethoven
    and Wagner. His voluptuous nature is at once changeable and precise; and his dreams
    are as clear and delicate as the art of a poet of the Pleiades in the sixteenth
    century, or of a Japanese painter. But among all his gifts he has a quality which I
    have not found so evident in any other musician&mdash;except perhaps Mozart; and this
    <a name="page244" id="page244"/>quality is a
    genius for good taste. Debussy has it in excess, so that he almost sacrifices the
    other elements of art to it, until the passionate force of his music, even its very
    life, seems to be impoverished. But one must not deceive oneself; that impoverishment
    is only apparent, and in all his work there are evidences that his passion is only
    veiled. It is only the trembling of the melodic line, or the orchestration which,
    like a shadow passing before the eyes, tells us of the drama that is being played in
    the hearts of his characters. This lofty shame of emotion is something as rare in
    opera as a Racine tragedy is in poetry&mdash;they are works of the same order, and
    both of them perfect flowers of the French spirit. Anyone who lives in foreign parts
    and is curious to know what France is like and understand her genius should study
    <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> as they would study Racine's
    <i>B&eacute;r&eacute;nice</i>.</p>
    <p>Not that Debussy's art entirely represents French genius any more than Racine's
    does; for there is quite another side to it which is not represented there; and that
    side is heroic action, the intoxication of reason and laughter, the passion for
    light, the France of Rabelais, Moli&egrave;re, Diderot, and in music, we will
    say&mdash;for want of better names&mdash;the France of Berlioz and Bizet. To tell the
    truth, that is the France I prefer. But Heaven preserve me from ignoring the other!
    It is the balance between these two Frances that makes French genius. In our
    contemporary music, <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i> is at one end of the
    pole of our art and <i>Carmen</i> is at the other. The one is all on the surface, all
    life, with no <a name="page245" id="page245"/>
    shadows, and no underneath. The other is below the surface, bathed in twilight, and
    enveloped in silence. And this double ideal is the alternation between the gentle
    sunlight and the faint mist that veils the soft, luminous sky of the Isle of
    France.</p>

    <h2>THE AWAKENING: A SKETCH OF THE MUSICAL
    MOVEMENT IN PARIS SINCE 1870</h2>
    <a name="page246" id="page246"/>
    <p>It is not possible in a few pages to give an account of forty years of active and
    fruitful life without many omissions, and also without a certain dryness entailed by
    lists of names. But I have purposely abstained from trying to arouse interest by any
    artifices of writing and treatment, as I wish to let deeds speak for themselves.</p>
    <p>I want to show, by this simple account, the splendid efforts made by musicians in
    France since 1870, and the growth of the faith and energy that has recreated French
    music. Such an awakening seems to me a fine thing to look upon, and very comforting.
    But few people in France realise it, outside a handful of musicians. It is to the
    public at large I dedicate these pages, so that they may know what a generation of
    artists with large hearts <a name="page247"
    id="page247"/>and strong determination have done for the honour of
    our race. The nation must not be allowed to forget what she owes to some of her
    sons.</p>
    <p>But you must not accuse me of contradicting myself if in another work, which will
    appear at the same time as this one,<a name="FNanchor_203_203"
    id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> I
    indulge in some sarcasm over the failings and absurdities of French music to-day. I
    think that for the last ten years French musicians have rather imprudently and
    prematurely proclaimed their victory, and that, in a general way, their
    works&mdash;apart from three or four&mdash;are not worth as much as their endeavours.
    But their endeavours are heroic; and I know nothing finer in the whole history of
    France. May they continue! But that is only possible by practising a
    virtue&mdash;modesty. The completion of a part is not the completion of the
    whole.</p>
    <br />
     <a name='paris' id='paris'></a>
    <h4>PARIS AND MUSIC</h4>
    <p>The nature of Paris is so complex and unstable that one feels it is presumptuous
    to try to define it. It is a city so highly-strung, so ingrained with fickleness, and
    so changeable in its tastes, that a book that truly describes it at the moment it is
    written is no longer accurate by the time it is published. And then, there is not
    only one Paris; there are two or three Parises&mdash;fashionable Paris, middle-class
    Paris, intellectual Paris, vulgar Paris&mdash;all living side by side, but
    intermingling very little. If you do not know the little towns within the great<a name="page248" id="page248"/>Town, you cannot know
    the strong and often inconsistent life of this great organism as a whole.</p>
    <p>If one wishes to get an idea of the musical life of Paris, one must take into
    account the variety of its centres and the perpetual flow of its thought&mdash;a
    thought which never stops, but is always over-shooting the goal for which it seemed
    bound. This incessant change of opinion is scornfully called "fashion" by the
    foreigner. And there is, without doubt, in the artistic aristocracy of Paris, as in
    all great towns, a herd of idle people on the watch for new fashions&mdash;in art, as
    well as in dress&mdash;who wish to single out certain of them for no serious reason
    at all. But, in spite of their pretensions, they have only an infinitesimal share in
    the changes of artistic taste. The origin of these changes is in the Parisian brain
    itself&mdash;a brain that is quick and feverish, always working, greedy of knowledge,
    easily tired, grasping to-day the splendours of a work, seeing to-morrow its defects,
    building up reputations as rapidly as it pulls them down, and yet, in spite of all
    its apparent caprices, always logical and sincere. It has its momentary infatuations
    and dislikes, but no lasting prejudices; and, by its curiosity, its absolute liberty,
    and its very French habit of criticising everything, it is a marvellous barometer,
    sensitive to all the hidden currents of thought in the soul of the West, and often
    indicating, months in advance, the variations and disturbances of the artistic and
    political world.</p>
    <p>And this barometer is registering what is happening just now in the world of
    music, where a move<a name="page249"
    id="page249"/>ment has been making itself felt in France for several
    years, whose effect other nations&mdash;perhaps more musical nations&mdash;will not
    feel till later. For the nations that have the strongest artistic traditions are not
    necessarily those that are likely to develop a new art. To do that one must have a
    virgin soil and spirits untrammelled by a heritage from the past. In 1870 no one had
    a lighter heritage to bear than French musicians; for the past had been forgotten,
    and such a thing as real musical education did not exist.</p>
    <p>The musical weakness of that time was a very curious thing, and has given many
    people the impression that France has never been a musical nation. Historically
    speaking, nothing could be more wrong. Certainly there are races more gifted in music
    than others; but often the seeming differences of race are really the differences of
    time; and a nation appears great or little in its art according to what period of its
    history we consider. England was a musical nation until the Revolution of 1688;
    France was the greatest musical nation in the sixteenth century; and the recent
    publications of M. Henry Expert have given us a glimpse of the originality and
    perfection of the Franco-Belgian art during the Renaissance. But without going back
    as far as that, we find that Paris was a very musical town at the time of the
    Restoration, at the time of the first performance of Beethoven's symphonies at the
    Conservatoire, and the first great works of Berlioz, and the Italian Opera. In
    Berlioz's <i>M&eacute;moires</i> you can read about the enthusiasm, the tears, <a name="page250" id="page250"/>and the feeling, that
    the performances of Gluck's and Spontini's operas aroused; and in the same book one
    sees clearly that this musical warmth lasted until 1840, after which it died down
    little by little, and was succeeded by complete musical apathy in the second
    Empire&mdash;an apathy from which Berlioz suffered cruelly, so that one may even say
    he died crushed by the indifference of the public. At this time Meyerbeer was
    reigning at the Opera. This incredible weakening of musical feeling in France, from
    1840 to 1870, is nowhere better shown than in its romantic and realistic writers, for
    whom music was an hermetically sealed door. All these artists were "<i>visuels</i>,"
    for whom music was only a noise. Hugo is supposed to have said that Germany's
    inferiority was measured by its superiority in music.<a name="FNanchor_204_204"
    id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> "The
    elder Dumas detested," Berlioz says, "even bad music."<a name="FNanchor_205_205"
    id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> The
    journal of the Goncourts calmly reflects the almost universal scorn of literary men
    for music. In a conversation which took place in 1862 between Goncourt and
    Th&eacute;ophile Gautier, Goncourt said:</p>
    <p>"We confessed to him our complete infirmity, our musical deafness&mdash;we who, at
    the most, only liked military music."<a name="page251"
    id="page251"/></p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"Well," said Gautier, "what you tell me pleases me very much. I am like you; I
      prefer silence to music. I have only just succeeded, after having lived part of my
      life with a singer, in being able to tell good music from bad; but it is all the
      same to me."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>And he added:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"But it is a very curious thing that all other writers of our time are like
      this. Balzac hated music. Hugo could not stand it. Even Lamartine, who himself is
      like a piano to be hired or sold, holds it in horror!"</p>
    </div>
    <p>It needed a complete upheaval of the nation&mdash;a political and moral
    upheaval&mdash;to change that frame of mind. Some indication of the change was making
    itself felt in the last years of the second Empire. Wagner, who suffered from the
    hostility or indifference of the public in 1860, at the time when
    <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> was performed at the Opera, had already found, however, a few
    understanding people in Paris who discerned his genius and sincerely admired him. The
    most interesting of the writers who first began to understand musical emotion is
    Charles Baudelaire. In 1861, Pasdeloup gave the first <i>Concerts populaires de
    musique classique</i> at the Cirque d'Hiver. The Berlioz Festival, organised by M.
    Reyer, on March 23rd, 1870, a year after Berlioz's death, revealed to France the
    grandeur of its greatest musical genius, and was the beginning of a campaign of
    public reparation to his memory.</p>
    <p><a name="page252" id="page252"/>The
    disasters of the war in 1870 regenerated the nation's artistic spirit. Music felt its
    effect immediately.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> On February 24th, 1871, the
    <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale de Musique</i> was instituted to propagate the
    works of French composers; and in 1873 the <i>Concerts de l'Association
    artistique</i> were started under M. Colonne's direction; and these concerts, besides
    making people acquainted with the classic composers of symphonies and the masters of
    the young French school, were especially devoted to the honouring of Berlioz, whose
    triumph reached its summit about 1880.<a name="FNanchor_208_208"
    id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>
    <p>At this time Wagner's success, in its turn, began to make itself felt. For this M.
    Lamoureux, whose concerts began in 1882, was chiefly responsible. Wagner's influence
    considerably helped forward the progress of French art, and aroused a love for music
    in people other than musicians; and, by his all-embracing personality and the vast
    domain of his work in art, not only engaged the interest of the musical world, but
    that of <a name="page253" id="page253"/>the
    theatrical world, and the world of poetry and the plastic arts. One may say that from
    1885 Wagner's work acted directly or indirectly on the whole of artistic thought,
    even on the religious and intellectual thought of the most distinguished people in
    Paris. And a curious historical witness of its world-wide influence and momentary
    supremacy over all other arts was the founding of the <i>Revue
    Wagn&eacute;rienne</i>, where, united by the same artistic devotion, were found
    writers and poets such as Verlaine, Mallarm&eacute;, Swinburne, Villiers de l'Isle
    Adam, Huysmans, Richepin, Catulle Mend&egrave;s, &Eacute;douard Rod, Stuart Merrill,
    Ephraim Mikha&euml;l, etc., and painters like Fantin-Latour, Jacques Blanche, Odilon
    Redon; and critics like Teodor de Wyzewa, H.S. Chamberlain, Hennequin, Camille
    Beno&icirc;t, A. Ernst, de Fourcaud, Wilder, E. Schur&eacute;, Soubies, Malherbe,
    Gabriel Mourey, etc. These writers not only discussed musical subjects, but judged
    painting, literature, and philosophy, from a Wagnerian point of view. Hennequin
    compared the philosophic systems of Herbert Spencer and Wagner. Teodor de Wyzewa made
    a study of Wagnerian literature&mdash;not the literature that commentated and the
    paintings that illustrated Wagner's works, but the literature and the painting that
    were inspired by Wagner's principles&mdash;from Egyptian statuary to Degas's
    paintings, from Homer's writings to those of Villiers de l'Isle Adam! In a word, the
    whole universe was seen and judged by the thought of Bayreuth. And though this folly
    scarcely lasted more than three or four years&mdash;the length of the life of that
    little magazine&mdash;<a name="page254"
    id="page254"/>Wagner's genius dominated nearly the whole of French
    art for ten or twelve years.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> An ardent musical propaganda by
    means of concerts was carried on among the public; and the young intellectuals of the
    day were won over. But the finest service that Wagnerism rendered to French art was
    that it interested the general public in music; although the tyranny its influence
    exercised became, in time, very stifling.</p>
    <p>Then, in 1890, there were signs of a movement that was in revolt against its
    despotism. The great wind from the East began to drop, and veered to the North.
    Scandinavian and Russian influences were making themselves felt. An exaggerated
    infatuation for Grieg, though limited to a small number of people, was an indication
    of the change in public taste. In 1890, C&eacute;sar Franck died in Paris. Belgian by
    birth and temperament, and French in feeling and by musical education, he had
    remained outside the Wagnerian movement in his own serene and fecund solitude. To his
    intellectual greatness and the charm his personal genius held for the little band of
    friends who knew and revered him he added the authority of his knowledge.
    Unconsciously he brought back to us the soul of Sebastian Bach, with its infinite
    richness and depth; and through this he found himself the head of a school (without
    having wished it) and the greatest teacher of contemporary French music. After his
    death, his <a name="page255" id="page255"/>name
    was the means of rallying together the younger school of musicians. In 1892, the
    <i>Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais</i>, under the direction of M. Charles Bordes,
    reinstated to honour and popularised Gregorian and Palestrinian music; and, following
    the initiative of their director, the <i>Schola Cantorum</i> was founded in 1894 for
    the revival of religious music. Ambition grew with success; and from the
    <i>Schola</i> sprang the <i>&Eacute;cole Sup&eacute;rieure de Musique</i>, under the
    direction of Franck's most famous pupil, M. Vincent d'Indy. This school, founded on a
    solid knowledge, not only of the classics, but of the primitives in music, took from
    its very beginning in 1900 a frankly national character, and was in some ways opposed
    to German art. At the same time, performances of Bach and seventeenth-and
    eighteenth-century music became more and more frequent; and more intimate
    relationship with the artists of other countries, repeated visits of the great
    <i>Kapellmeister</i>, foreign virtuosi and composers (especially Richard Strauss),
    and, lastly, of Russian composers, completed the education of the Parisian musical
    public, who, after repeated rebukes from the critics, became conscious of the
    awakening of a national personality, and of an impatient desire to free itself from
    German tutelage. By turns it gratefully and warmly received M. Bruneau's <i>Le
    R&ecirc;ve</i> (1891), M. d'Indy's <i>Fervaal</i> (1898), M. Gustave Charpentier's
    <i>Louise</i> (1900)&mdash;all of which seemed like works of liberation. But, as a
    matter of fact, these lyric dramas were by no means free from foreign influences, and
    especially <a name="page256" id="page256"/>from
    Wagnerian influences. M. Debussy's <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i>, in
    1902, seemed to mark more truly the emancipation of French music. From this time on,
    French music felt that it had left school, and claimed to have founded a new art,
    which reflected the spirit of the race, and was freer and suppler than the Wagnerian
    art. These ideas, which were seized upon and enlarged by the press, brought about
    rather quickly a conviction in French artists of France's superiority in music. Is
    that conviction justified? The future alone can tell us. But one may see by this
    brief outline of events how real is the evolution of the musical spirit in France
    since 1870, in spite of the apparent contradictions of fashion which appear on the
    surface of art. It is the spirit of France that is, after long oppression and by a
    patient but eager initiation, realising its power and wishing to dominate in its
    turn.</p>
    <p>I wanted at first to trace the broad line of the movement which for the last
    thirty years has been affecting French music; and now I shall consider the musical
    institutions that have had their share in this movement. You will not be surprised if
    I ignore some of the most celebrated, which have lost their interest in it, in order
    that I may consider those that are the true authors of our regeneration.</p>
    <br />
     <a name='before' id='before'></a>
    <h4>MUSICAL INSTITUTIONS BEFORE 1870</h4>
    <p>It is not by any means the oldest and most celebrated musical institutions which
    have taken the largest share in this evolution of music in the last thirty
    years.<a name="page257" id="page257"/></p>
    <p>The <i>Acad&eacute;mie des Beaux-Arts</i>, where six chairs are reserved for the
    musical section, could have played a very important part in the musical organisation
    of France by the authority of its name, and by the many prizes that it gives for
    composition and criticism, especially by the <i>Prix de Rome</i>, which it awards
    every year. But it does not play its part well, partly because of the antiquated
    statutes that govern it, by which a handful of musicians are associated with a great
    number of painters, sculptors, and architects, who are ignorant of music and mock at
    the musicians, as they did in the time of Berlioz; and partly because it is the
    custom of the Academy that the little group of musicians shall be trained in a very
    conservative way. One of the names of these musicians is justly celebrated&mdash;that
    of M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns; but there are others whose fame is of poorer quality, and
    others still who have no fame at all. And the whole forms a little group, which
    though it does not put any actual obstacles in the way of the progress of art, yet
    does not look upon it favourably, but remains rather apart in an indifferent or even
    hostile spirit.</p>
    <p>The <i>Conservatoire national de Musique et de D&eacute;clamation</i>, which dates
    from the last years of the <i>Ancien R&eacute;gime</i> and the Revolution, was
    designed by its patriotic and-democratic origin to serve the cause of national art
    and free progress.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page258" id="page258"/>It was for a
    long time the corner-stone of the edifice of music in Paris. But although it has
    always numbered in its ranks many illustrious and devoted professors&mdash;among whom
    it recognised, a little late, the founder of the young French school, C&eacute;sar
    Franck&mdash;and though the majority of artists who have made a name in French music
    have received its teaching, and the list of laureates of Rome who have come from its
    composition classes includes all the heads of the artistic movement to-day in all its
    diversity, and ranges from M. Massenet to M. Bruneau, and from M. Charpentier to M.
    Debussy&mdash;in spite of all this, it is no secret that, since 1870, the official
    action with regard to the movement amounts to almost nothing; though we must at least
    do it justice, and say that it has not hindered it.<a name="FNanchor_211_211"
    id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>
    <p>But if the spirit of this academy has often destroyed the effect of the excellent
    teaching there, by making success in academic competitions the chief aim of the
    professors and their pupils, yet a certain freedom <a
    name="page259" id="page259"/>has always reigned in the institution.
    And though this freedom is mainly the result of indifference, it has, however,
    permitted the more independent temperaments to develop in peace&mdash;from Berlioz to
    M. Ravel. One should be grateful for this. But such virtues are too negative to give
    the Conservatoire a high place in the musical history of the Third Republic; and it
    is only lately, under the direction of M. Gabriel Faur&eacute;, that it has
    endeavoured, not without difficulty, to get back its place at the head of French art,
    which it had lost, and which others had taken.</p>
    <p>The <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Concerts du Conservatoire</i>, founded in 1828
    under the direction of Habeneck, has had its hour of glory in the musical history of
    Paris. It was through this society that Beethoven's greatness was revealed to
    France.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> It was at the Conservatoire that
    the early important works of Berlioz were first given: <i>La Fantastique</i>,
    <i>Harold</i>, and <i>Rom&eacute;o et Juliette</i>. It was there, nearer our own
    time, that Saint-Sa&euml;ns's <i>Symphonie avec Orgue</i> and C&eacute;sar Franck's
    <i>Symphonie</i> were played for the first time. But for a long time the
    Conservatoire seemed to take its name too literally, and to restrict its sphere to
    that of a museum for classical music.</p>
    <p><a name="page260" id="page260"/>In later
    years, however, the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Concerts</i>, with M. Marty, began
    to consider new works. Its orchestra, composed of eminent instrumentalists, enjoys a
    classical fame; though it is now no longer alone in the excellence of its
    performances, and has perhaps lost a little the secret that it claimed to possess for
    the interpretation of great classical works. It excels in works of a neo-classic
    character, like those of M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns, which are stronger in style and taste
    than in life and passion. The Conservatoire concerts have also a relative superiority
    over other concerts in Paris in the performance of choral works, which up to the
    present have been very second-rate. But these concerts are not easy of access for the
    general public, as the number of seats for sale is very limited. And so the society
    is representative of a little public whose taste is, broadly speaking, conservative
    and official; and the noise of the strife outside its doors only reaches its ears
    slowly, and with a deadened sound.</p>
    <p>The influence of the Conservatoire is, in music especially, an influence of the
    past and of the Government. One may say much the same of the Opera. This ancient
    association, which bears the imposing name of <i>Acad&eacute;mie nationale de
    Musique</i> and dates from 1669, is a sort of national institution which is more
    concerned with the history of official art than with living art. The satire with
    which Jean-Jacques describes, in his <i>Nouvelle H&eacute;lo&iuml;se</i>, the stiff
    solemnity and mournful pomp of its performances has not lost much of its truth. What
    is lacking in the Opera to-day is the enthusiasm that <a
    name="page261" id="page261"/>accompanied its former musical struggles
    in the times of the "<i>Encyclop&eacute;distes</i>" and the "<i>guerre des
    coins</i>." The great battles of art are now fought outside its doors; and it has
    become by degrees a showy <i>salon</i>, a little faded perhaps, where the public is
    more interested in itself than in the performance. In spite of the enormous sums that
    it swallows up every year (nearly four million francs),<a name="FNanchor_213_213"
    id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> only
    one or two new pieces are produced in a year, and they are rarely works that are
    representative of the modern school. And though it has at last admitted Wagner's
    dramas into its repertory, one can no longer consider these works, half a century
    old, to be in the vanguard of music. The most esteemed masters of the French school,
    such as Massenet, Reyer, Chausson, and Vincent d'Indy, had to seek refuge in the
    Th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la Monnaie at Brussels before they could get their works
    received at the Opera in Paris. And the classical composers fare no better. Neither
    <i>Fidelio</i> nor Gluck's tragedies&mdash;with the exception of <i>Armide</i>, which
    was put on under pressure of fashion&mdash;are represented; and when by chance they
    give <i>Freisch&uuml;tz</i> or <i>Don Juan</i>, one wonders if it would not have been
    better to let them rest in oblivion, rather than treat them sacrilegiously by adding,
    cutting, introducing ballets and new recitatives, and deforming their style so as to
    bring them "up to date."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page262" id="page262"/>In spite of
    the changes of taste and the campaign of the press, the Opera has remained to this
    day as it was in the time of Meyerbeer and Gounod and their disciples. But it would
    be foolish to pretend that it has not its public. The receipts show well enough that
    <i>Faust</i> is in greater favour than <i>Siegfried</i> or <i>Tristan</i>, not to
    speak of the more recent works of the new French school, which cannot be acclimatised
    there.</p>
    <p>Without doubt, the enormous stage at the Opera does not lend itself well to modern
    musical dramas, which are intimate and concentrated, and would be lost in its immense
    space, which is more adapted for formal processions like the marches in the
    <i>Proph&egrave;te</i> and <i>A&iuml;da</i>. Besides this, there is the conventional
    acting of the majority of the singers, the dull lifelessness of the choruses, the
    defective acoustics, and the exaggerated utterance and gestures of the actors,
    demanded by the great dimensions of the place&mdash;all of which is a serious
    obstacle to the conception of a living and simple art. But the chief obstacle will
    always lie in the very nature of such a theatre&mdash;a theatre of luxury and vanity,
    created for a set of snobs, whose least interest is the music, who have not enough
    intellect to create a fashion, but who servilely follow every fashion after it is
    thirty years old. Such a theatre no longer counts in the history of French music; and
    its next directors will need a vast amount of ingenuity and energy to get a semblance
    of life into such a dead colossus.<a name="page263"
    id="page263"/></p>
    <p>But it is quite another affair with the Op&eacute;ra-Comique. This theatre has
    taken a very active part in the development of modern music. Without renouncing its
    classic traditions, or its delightful repertory of the old
    <i>op&eacute;ra-comiques</i>, it has had understanding enough, under the judicious
    management of M. Albert Carr&eacute;, to hold itself open for any interesting
    productions in dramatic music. It takes no side among the different schools; and the
    representatives of the old-fashioned light opera with their songs elbow the leaders
    of the advanced school. No association has done more important work, among musical
    dramas as well as musical comedies, during the last twenty years. In this theatre,
    which produced <i>Carmen</i> in 1875, <i>Manon</i> in 1884, and the <i>Roi d'Ys</i>
    in 1888, were played the principal dramas of M. Bruneau, as well as M. Charpentier's
    <i>Louise</i>, M. Debussy's <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i>, and M. Dukas's
    <i>Ariane et Barbebleue</i>. It may seem astonishing that such works should have
    found a place at the Op&eacute;ra-Comique and not at the Opera. But if two musical
    theatres of different kinds exist, one of which pretends to have the monopoly of
    great art, while the other with a simpler and more intimate character seeks only to
    please, it is always the latter that has a better chance of development and of making
    new discoveries; for the first is oppressed by traditions that become ever stiffer
    and more pedantic, while the other with its simplicity and lack of pretension is able
    to accommodate itself to any manner of life. How many artists have revolu<a name="page264" id="page264"/>tionised their times
    while they were merely looked upon as people who amused! Frescobaldi and Philipp
    Emanuel Bach brought fresh life to art, but were scorned by the so-called
    representatives of fine art; Mozart's <i>opere buffe</i> have more of truth and life
    in them than his <i>opere serie</i>; and there is as much dramatic power in an
    <i>op&eacute;ra-comique</i> like <i>Carmen</i> as in all the repertory of grand Opera
    to-day. And so the Op&eacute;ra-Comique theatre has become the home of the boldest
    experiments in musical drama. The most daring or the most violent ventures into
    musical realism, after the manner of Charpentier or Bruneau, and the subtle fantasies
    of a delicate art of dreams, like that of Debussy, have found a welcome there. It has
    also been open to various kinds of foreign art: Humperdinck's <i>H&auml;nsel und
    Gretel</i>, Verdi's <i>Falstaff</i>, the works of Puccini, Mascagni, and the young
    Italian school, Richard Strauss's <i>Feuersnot</i>, Rimsky-Korsakow's
    <i>Sn&eacute;gourotchka</i>, have all been played. And they have even given the
    classic masterpieces of opera there: <i>Fidelio</i>, <i>Orfeo</i>, <i>Alceste</i>,
    the two <i>Iphig&eacute;nies</i>; and taken more pains with them and mounted them
    with more pious zeal than they do at the Opera. The operas themselves are more at
    home there, too, for the size of the theatre is more like that of the
    eighteenth-century theatres. It is true that the stage rather lacks depth; but the
    ingenuity of the director and the admirable scenic artists he employs has succeeded
    in making one forget this defect, and accomplished marvels. No theatre in Paris has
    more artistic staging, and some of the scenery that has been <a
    name="page265" id="page265"/>designed lately is a masterpiece of its
    kind. The Op&eacute;ra-Comique has also the advantage of excellent conductors, and
    one of them, M. Messager, who is now Director, has, by his clever interpretations,
    greatly contributed to the success of the works of the new school.</p>

    <h4>NEW MUSICAL INSTITUTIONS</h4>
    <h4>1. <i>The Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale</i></h4>
    <p>Before 1870, French music had already in the Opera and the Op&eacute;ra-Comique
    (without counting the various endeavours of the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Lyrique) an
    outlet which was nearly enough for the needs of her dramatic productions. Even when
    musical taste was most decadent, the works of Gounod, Ambroise Thomas, and
    Mass&eacute;, had always upheld the name of French <i>op&eacute;ra-comique</i>. But
    what was almost entirely lacking was an outlet for symphonic music and chamber-music.
    "Before 1870," wrote M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns in <i>Harmonie et M&eacute;lodie</i>, "a
    French composer who was foolish enough to venture on to the ground of instrumental
    music had no other means of getting his works performed than by himself arranging a
    concert for them." Such was Berlioz's case; for he had to gather together an
    orchestra and hire a room each time he wished to get a hearing for his great
    symphonies. The financial result was often disastrous: the performance of the
    <i>Damnation de Faust</i> in 1846 was, for example, a complete failure, and he had to
    give it up. The Conservatoire, which was formerly more hospitable, <a name="page266" id="page266"/>rather reluctantly
    performed a portion of <i>L'Enfance du Christ</i>; but it gave young composers no
    encouragement.</p>
    <p>The first man who attempted to make the symphony popular, M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns
    tells us in his <i>Portraits et Souvenirs</i>, was Seghers, a dissentient member of
    the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Concerts du Conservatoire</i>, who during several
    years (1848-1854) was conductor of the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de
    Sainte-C&eacute;cile</i>, which had its quarters in a room in the rue de la
    Chauss&eacute;e d'Antin. There he had performed Mendelssohn's <i>Symphonie
    Italienne</i>, the overtures to <i>Tannh&auml;user</i> and <i>Manfred</i>, Berlioz's
    <i>Fuite en &Eacute;gypte</i>, and Gounod's and Bizet's early, works. But lack of
    money cut short his efforts.</p>
    <p>Pasdeloup took up the work. After having been conductor for the
    <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des jeunes artistes du Conservatoire</i> since 1851, in the
    Salle Herz, he founded, in 1861, at the Cirque d'Hiver, with the financial support of
    a rich moneylender, the first <i>Concerts populaires de musique classique</i>.
    Unhappily, says M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns, Pasdeloup, even up to 1870, made an almost
    exclusive selection of German classical works. He raised an impenetrable barrier
    before the young French school, and the only French works he played were symphonies
    by Gounod and Gouvy, and the overtures of <i>Les Francs-Juges</i> and <i>La
    Muette</i>. It was impossible to set up a rival society against him; and an exclusive
    monopoly in music was, therefore, held by him. According to M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns he
    was a mediocre musician, and had, in spite of his passion for music, "immense <a name="page267" id="page267"/>incapacity." In
    <i>Harmonie et M&eacute;lodie</i> M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns says: "The few chamber-music
    societies that existed were also closed to all new-comers; their programmes only
    contained the names of undisputed celebrities, the writers of classic symphonies. In
    those times one had really to be devoid of all common sense to write music."</p>
    <p>A new generation was growing up, however,&mdash;a generation that was serious and
    thoughtful, that was more attracted by pure music than by the theatre, that was
    filled with a burning desire to found a national art. To this generation M.
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns and M. Vincent d'Indy belong. The war of 1870 strengthened these
    ideas about music, and, while the war was still raging, there sprang from them the
    <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale de Musique</i>.</p>
    <p>One must speak of this society with respect, for it was the cradle and sanctuary
    of French art.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> All that was great in French
    music from 1870 to 1900 found a home there. Without it, the greater part of the works
    that are the honour of our music would never have been played; perhaps they would not
    ever have been written. The Society possessed the rare merit of being able to
    anticipate public opinion by ten or eleven years, and in some ways it has formed the
    public mind and obliged it to honour those whom the Society had already recognised as
    great musicians.</p>
    <p><a name="page268" id="page268"/>The two
    founders of the Society were Romaine Bussine, professor of Singing at the
    Conservatoire, and M. Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns. And, following their initiative,
    C&eacute;sar Franck, Ernest Guiraud, Massenet, Garcin, Gabriel Faur&eacute;, Henri
    Duparc, Th&eacute;odore Dubois, and Taffanel, joined forces with them, and at a
    meeting on 25 February, 1871, agreed to found a musical society that should give
    hearings to the works of living French composers exclusively. The first meetings were
    interrupted by the doings of the Commune; but they began again in October, 1871. The
    Society's early statutes were drawn up by Alexis de Castillon, a military officer and
    a talented composer, who, after having served in the war of 1870 at the head of the
    <i>mobiles</i> of Eure-et-Loire, was one of the founders of French chamber-music, and
    died prematurely in 1873, aged thirty-five. It was these statutes, signed by
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns, Castillon, and Garcin, that gave the Society its title of
    <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale de Musique</i>, and its device, "<i>Ars
    gallica</i>." This is what the statutes say about the aims of the Society:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"The aim of the Society is to aid the production and the popularisation of all
      serious musical works, whether published or unpublished, of French composers; to
      encourage and bring to light, so far as is in its power, all musical endeavour,
      whatever form it may take, on condition that there is evidence of high, artistic
      aspiration on the part of the author.... It is in brotherly love, with complete
      forgetfulness of self, and with the firm intention of aiding one <a name="page269" id="page269"/>another as far as
      they can, that the members of the Society will co-operate, each in his own sphere
      of action, for the study and performance of the works which they shall be called
      upon to select and to interpret."</p>
    </div>
    <p>The first Committee was made up as follows: President, Bussine; Vice-President,
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns; Secretary, Alexis de Castillon; Under-Secretary, Jules Garcin;
    Treasurer, Lenepveu. The members of the Committee were: C&eacute;sar Franck,
    Th&eacute;odore Dubois, E. Guiraud, Fissot, Bourgault-Ducoudray, Faur&eacute;, and
    Lalo.</p>
    <p>The first concert was given on 25 November, 1871, in the Salle Pleyel; and it is
    worthy of note that the first work played was a trio of C&eacute;sar Franck's. Since
    then the Society has given three hundred and fifty performances of chamber-music or
    orchestral works. The best known French composers and virtuosi have taken part as
    executants, among others: C&eacute;sar Franck, Saint-Sa&euml;ns, Massenet, Bizet,
    Vincent d'Indy, Faur&eacute;, Chabrier, Guiraud, Debussy, Lekeu, Lamoureux,
    Chevillard, Taffanel, Widor, Messager, Di&eacute;mer, Sarasate, Risler, Cortot,
    Ysaye, etc. And among the compositions that have been played for the first time it is
    enough to mention the following:</p>
    <p>C&eacute;sar Franck: Nearly the whole of his works, including his Sonata, Trio,
    Quartette, Quintette, Symphonic Variations, Preludes and Fugues, Mass,
    <i>R&eacute;demption</i>, <i>Psyche</i>, and a part of <i>Les
    B&eacute;atitudes</i>.</p>
    <p>Saint-Sa&euml;ns: <i>Pha&eacute;ton</i>, <i>Second Symphony</i>, Sonatas,<a name="page270" id="page270"/>Persian Melodies, the
    <i>Rapsodie d'Auvergne</i>, and a quartette.</p>
    <p>Vincent d'Indy: The trilogy of <i>Wallenstein</i>, the <i>Po&ecirc;me des
    Montagues</i>, the <i>Symphonie sur un th&egrave;me montagnard</i>, and
    quartettes.</p>
    <p>Chabrier: Part of <i>Gwendoline</i>.</p>
    <p>Lalo: Fragments of the <i>Roi d'Ys</i>, Rhapsodies and Symphonies.</p>
    <p>Bruneau: <i>Penth&eacute;sil&eacute;e</i>, <i>La Belle au Bois Dormant</i>.</p>
    <p>Chausson: <i>Viviane</i>, <i>H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</i>, <i>La Temp&ecirc;te</i>, a
    quartette and a symphony.</p>
    <p>Debussy: <i>La Damoiselle &eacute;lue</i>, the <i>Pr&eacute;lude &agrave;
    l'apr&egrave;s-midi d'un faune</i>, a quartette, pieces for the pianoforte, and
    melodies.</p>
    <p>Dukas: <i>L'Apprenti Sorcier</i>, and a sonata for the pianoforte.</p>
    <p>Lekeu: <i>Androm&egrave;de</i>.</p>
    <p>Alberic Magnard: Symphonies and a quartette.</p>
    <p>Ravel: <i>Sch&eacute;h&eacute;razade</i>, <i>Histoires Naturelles</i>, etc.</p>
    <p>Saint-Sa&euml;ns was director with Bussine until 1886. But from 1881 the influence
    of Franck and his disciples became more and more felt; and Saint-Sa&euml;ns began to
    lose interest in the efforts of the new school. In 1886 there was a division of
    opinion about a proposition of Vincent d'Indy's to introduce the works of classical
    masters and foreign composers into the programmes. This proposition was adopted; but
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns and Bussine sent in their resignations. Franck then became the true
    president, although he refused the title; and after his death, in 1890, Vincent
    d'Indy took his place. Under these two directors a quite important place <a name="page271" id="page271"/>was given to old and
    classical music by composers such as Palestrina, Vittoria, Josquin, Bach,
    H&auml;ndel, Rameau, Gluck, Beethoven, Schumann, Liszt, and Brahms. Foreign
    contemporary music only occupied a very limited place. Wagner's name only appears
    once, in a transcription of the <i>Venusberg</i> for the pianoforte; and Richard
    Strauss's name figures only against his Quartette. Grieg had his hour of popularity
    there about 1887, as well as the Russians&mdash;Moussorgski, Borodine,
    Rimsky-Korsakow, Liadow, and Glazounow&mdash;whom M. Debussy has perhaps helped to
    make known to us. At the present moment the Society seems more exclusively French
    than ever; and the influence of M. Vincent d'Indy and the school of Franck is
    predominant. That is only natural; the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale</i> most
    truly earned its title to glory by discerning C&eacute;sar Franck's genius; for the
    Society was a little sanctuary where the great artist was honoured at a time when he
    was ignored or laughed at by the rest of the world. This character of a sanctuary was
    kept even after victory. In its general programme of 1903-1904, the Society reminded
    us with pride that it had remained faithful to the promises made in 1871; and it
    added that if, in order to permit its members to keep abreast of the general progress
    of art, it had little by little allowed classical masterpieces and modern foreign
    works of interest on its programmes, it had, however, always kept its guest-chamber
    open, and shaped many a future reputation there.</p>
    <p>Nothing is truer. The <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale</i> is indeed <a name="page272" id="page272"/>a guest-chamber,
    where for the past thirty years a guest-chamber art and guest-chamber opinions have
    been formed; and from it some of the profoundest and most poetic French music has
    been derived, such as Franck's and Debussy's chamber-music. But its atmosphere is
    becoming daily more rarefied. That is a danger. It is to be feared that this art and
    thought may be absorbed by the decadent subtleties or pedantic scholasticism which is
    apt to accompany all coteries&mdash;in short, that its music will be salon-music
    rather than chamber-music. Even the Society itself seems to have felt this at times;
    and at different periods has sought contact with the general public, and put itself
    into direct communication with it. "It becomes more and more necessary," wrote M.
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns, "that French composers should find something intermediate between
    an intimate hearing of their music and a performance of it before the general
    public&mdash;something which would not be a speculative thing like a big concert, but
    which would be analogous to the artistic attraction of an exhibition of painting, and
    which would dare everything. It is a new aim for the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
    Nationale</i>." But it does not seem that it has yet attained this goal, nor that it
    is near attaining it, despite some not quite happy attempts.</p>
    <p>But at least the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale</i> has gloriously achieved
    the task it set itself. In thirty years it has created in Paris a little centre of
    earnest composers of symphonies and chamber-music, and a cultured public that seems
    able to understand them.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <a name="page273" id="page273"/>
    <h4>2. <i>The Grand Symphony Concerts</i></h4>
    <p>Although it was an urgent matter that young French composers should unite to
    withstand the general indifference of the public, it was more urgent still that that
    indifference should be attacked, and that music should be brought within reach of
    ordinary people. It was a matter of taking up and completing Pasdeloup's work in a
    more artistic and more modern spirit.</p>
    <p>A publisher of music, Georges Hartmann, feeling the forces that were drawing
    together in French art, gathered about him the greater part of the talented men of
    the young school&mdash;Franck, Bizet, Saint-Sa&euml;ns, Massenet, Delibes, Lalo, A.
    de Castillon, Th. Dubois, Guiraud, Godard, Paladilhe, and Jonci&egrave;res&mdash;and
    undertook to produce their works in public. He rented the Od&eacute;on theatre, and
    got together an orchestra, the conductorship of which he entrusted to M.
    &Eacute;douard Colonne. And on 2 March, 1873, the <i>Concert National</i> was
    inaugurated in a musical matin&eacute;e, where M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns played his
    <i>Concerto in G minor</i> and Mme. Viardot sang Schubert's <i>Roi des Aulnes</i>. In
    the first year six ordinary concerts were given, and, besides that, two sacred
    concerts with choirs, at which C&eacute;sar Franck's <i>R&eacute;demption</i> and
    Massenet's <i>Marie-Magdeleine</i> were performed. In 1874 the Od&eacute;on was
    abandoned for the Ch&acirc;telet. This venture attracted some attention, and the
    concerts were patronised by the public; but the financial results were not <a name="page274" id="page274"/>great.<a
    name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216"
    class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Hartmann was discouraged and wished to give the whole
    thing up. But M. &Eacute;douard Colonne conceived the idea of turning his orchestra
    into a society, and of continuing the work under the name of <i>Association
    Artistique</i>. Among the artist-founders were MM. Bruneau, Benjamin Godard, and Paul
    Hillemacher. Its early days were full of struggle; but owing to the perseverance of
    the Association all obstacles were finally overcome. In 1903 a festival was held to
    celebrate its thirtieth anniversary. During these thirty years it had given more than
    eight hundred concerts, and had performed the works of about three hundred composers,
    of which half were French. The four composers most frequently heard at the
    Ch&acirc;telet were Saint-Sa&euml;ns, Wagner, Beethoven, and Berlioz.<a
    name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217"
    class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>
    <p>Berlioz is almost the exclusive property of the Ch&acirc;telet. Not only have they
    performed his works there more frequently than anywhere else,<a
    name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218"
    class="fnanchor">[218]</a> but they are better understood there than in other places.
    The Colonne orchestra and its conductor, gifted with great warmth of
    spirit,&mdash;though it is sometimes a little intemperate&mdash;are rather bothered
    by works of a classic nature and by those that show contemplative feeling; but they
    give wonderful ex<a name="page275"
    id="page275"/>pression to Berlioz's tumultuous romanticism, his
    poetic enthusiasm, and the bright and delicate colouring of his paintings and his
    musical landscapes. Although Berlioz has his place at the Chevillard and
    Conservatoire concerts, it is to the Ch&acirc;telet that his followers flock; and
    their enthusiasm has not been affected by the campaign that for several years has
    been directed against Berlioz by some French critics under the influence of the
    younger musical party&mdash;the followers of d'Indy and Debussy.</p>
    <p>It is also at the Ch&acirc;telet that the keenest musical passion has been
    preserved in the public, even to this day. Thanks to the size of the theatre, which
    is one of the largest in Paris, and to the great number of cheap seats, you may
    always find there a number of young students who make the most interested kind of
    public possible. And the music is something more than a pleasure to them&mdash;it is
    a necessity. There are some that make great sacrifices in order to have a seat at the
    Sunday concerts. And many of these young men and women live all the week on the
    thought of forgetting the world for a few hours in musical enjoyment. Such a public
    did not exist in France before 1870. It is to the honour of the Ch&acirc;telet and
    the Pasdeloup concerts to have created it.</p>
    <p>&Eacute;douard Colonne has done more than educate musical taste in France; for no
    one has worked harder than he to break down the barriers that separated the French
    public from the art of other lands; and, at the same time, he has himself helped
    <a name="page276" id="page276"/>to make French
    art known to foreigners. When he himself was conducting concerts all over Europe he
    entrusted the conductorship at the Ch&acirc;telet to the great German
    <i>Kapellmeister</i> and to foreign composers&mdash;to Richard Strauss, Grieg,
    Tschaikowsky, Hans Richter, Hermann Levi, Mottl, Nikisch, Mengelberg, Siegfried
    Wagner, and many others. No other conductor has done so much for Parisian music
    during the last thirty years; and we must not forget it.<a name="FNanchor_219_219"

    <p>The Lamoureux concerts have had from the beginning a very different character from
    the Colonne concerts. That difference lies partly in the personality of the two
    conductors, and partly in the fact that the Lamoureux concerts, although of later
    date than the Colonne concerts by less than ten years, represent a new generation in
    music. The progress of the musical public was singularly rapid: hardly had they
    explored the rich treasure-house of Berlioz's music than they were making discoveries
    in the world of Wagner. And in that world they needed a new guide, who had intimate
    knowledge of Wagner's art and of German art in general. Charles Lamoureux was that
    guide. In 1873 he conducted special performances of Bach and H&auml;ndel, given by
    the <i>Societ&eacute; de l'Harmonie sacr&eacute;e</i>. After leaving the
    conductorship of the Opera, he inaugurated, on 21 October, 1881, at the
    Ch&acirc;teau-d'Eau theatre, the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Nouveaux Concerts</i>.
    These concerts had at first very comprehensive programmes of <a
    name="page277" id="page277"/>every kind of music and every kind of
    school. At the first concert there were works of Beethoven, H&auml;ndel, Gluck,
    Sacchini, Cimarosa, and Berlioz. In the first year Lamoureux had Beethoven's <i>Ninth
    Symphony</i> performed, as well as a large part of <i>Lohengrin</i>, and numerous
    works of young French musicians. Various compositions of Lalo, Vincent d'Indy, and
    Chabrier, were performed there for the first time. But it was especially to the study
    of Wagner's works that Lamoureux most gladly devoted himself. It was he who gave the
    first hearings of Wagner in their entirety in France, such as the first and second
    act of <i>Tristan</i>, in 1884-1885. The Wagnerian battle was still going on at that
    time, as the notice printed at the head of the programme of <i>Tristan</i> shows.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"The management of the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Nouveaux Concerts</i> is
      desirous of avoiding any disturbance during the performance of the second act of
      <i>Tristan</i>, and urgently and respectfully begs that the audience will abstain
      from giving any mark of their approval or disapproval before the end of the
      act."</p>
    </div>
    <p>The same year, in the Eden theatre, to which the concerts had been transferred,
    Lamoureux conducted, for the first time in Paris, the first act of the
    <i>Walk&uuml;re</i>. In these concerts the tenor, Van Dyck, made his
    <i>d&eacute;but</i>; later, he was one of the leading performers at Bayreuth. In
    1886-1887 Lamoureux rehearsed and conducted the only <a
    name="page278" id="page278"/>performance of <i>Lohengrin</i> at the
    Eden theatre. Disturbances in the streets prevented further performances. Lamoureux
    then established himself in the concert-room of the Cirque des Champs
    &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, where for eleven years he has given what are called the
    <i>Concerts-Lamoureux</i>. He continued to spread the knowledge of Wagner's works,
    and has sometimes had the help of some of the most celebrated of the Bayreuth
    artists, among others, that of Mme. Materna and Lilli Lehmann. At the end of the
    season of 1897 Lamoureux wished to disband his orchestra in order to conduct concerts
    abroad. But the members of the orchestra decided to remain together under the name of
    the <i>Association des Concerts-Lamoureux</i>, with Lamoureux's son-in-law, M.
    Camille Chevillard, as conductor. But Lamoureux was not long before he returned to
    the conductorship of the concerts, which had now returned to the Ch&acirc;teau-d'Eau
    theatre; and a few months before his death, in 1899, he conducted the first
    performance of <i>Tristan</i> at the Nouveau theatre. And so he had the happiness of
    being present at the complete triumph of the cause for which he had fought so
    stubbornly for nearly twenty years.<a name="FNanchor_220_220"
    id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>
    <p>Lamoureux's performances of Wagner's works have been among the best that have ever
    been given. He had a regard for the work as a whole and a care for its details, to
    which the Colonne orchestra did not quite attain. On the other hand, Lamoureux's
    <a name="page279" id="page279"/>defect was the
    exuberant liveliness with which he interpreted compositions of a romantic nature. He
    did not fully understand these works; and although he knew much more about classic
    art than his rival, he rendered its letter rather than its spirit, and paid such
    sedulous attention to detail that music like Beethoven's lost its intensity and its
    life. But both his talents and his defects fitted him to be an excellent interpreter
    of the young neo-Wagnerian school, the principal representatives of which in France
    were then M. Vincent d'Indy and M. Emmanuel Chabrier. Lamoureux had need, to a
    certain extent, to be himself directed either by the living traditions of Bayreuth,
    or by the thought of modern and living composers; and the greatest service he
    rendered to French music was his creation, thanks to his extreme care for material
    perfection, of an orchestra that was marvellously equipped for symphonic music.</p>
    <p>This seeking for perfection has been carried on by his successor, M. Camille
    Chevillard, whose orchestra is even more refined still. One may say, I think, that it
    is to-day the best in Paris. M. Chevillard is more attracted by pure music than
    Lamoureux was; and he rightly finds that dramatic music has been occupying too large
    a place in Parisian concerts. In a letter published by the <i>Mercure de France</i>,
    in January, 1903, he reproaches the educators of public taste with having fostered a
    liking for opera, and with not having awakened a respect for pure music: "Any four
    bars from one of Mozart's quartettes have," he says, "a greater <a name="page280" id="page280"/>educational value
    than a showy scene from an opera." No one in Paris conducts classic works better than
    he, especially the works that possess clean, plastic beauty; and in Germany itself it
    would be difficult to find anyone who would give a more delicate interpretation of
    some of H&auml;ndel's and Mozart's symphonic works. His orchestra has kept, moreover,
    the superiority that it had already acquired in its repertory of Wagner's works. But
    M. Chevillard has communicated a warmth and energy of rhythm to it that it did not
    possess before. His interpretations of Beethoven, even if they are somewhat
    superficial, are very full of life. Like Lamoureux, he has hardly caught the spirit
    of French romantic works&mdash;of Berlioz, and still less of Franck and his school;
    and he seems to have but lukewarm sympathy for the more recent developments of French
    music. But he understands well the German romantic composers, especially Schumann,
    for whom he has a marked liking; and he tried, though without great success, to
    introduce Liszt and Brahms into France, and was the first among us to attract real
    attention to Russian music, whose brilliant and delicate colouring he excels in
    rendering. And, like M. Colonne, he has brought the great German <i>Kapellmeister</i>
    among us&mdash;Weingartner, Nikisch, and Richard Strauss, the last mentioned having
    directed the first performance in Paris of his symphonic poems, <i>Zarathustra</i>,
    <i>Don Quixote</i>, and <i>Heldenleben</i>, at the Lamoureux concerts.</p>
    <p>Nothing could have better completed the musical <a
    name="page281" id="page281"/>education of the public than this
    continuous defile, for the past ten years, of <i>Kapellmeister</i> and foreign
    virtuosi, and the comparisons that their different styles and interpretations
    afforded. Nothing has better helped forward the improvement of Parisian orchestras
    than the emulation brought about by the meetings between Parisian conductors and
    those of other countries. At present our own conductors are worthy rivals of the best
    in Germany. The string instruments are good; the wood has kept its old French
    superiority; and though the brass is still the weakest part of our orchestras, it has
    made great progress. One may still criticise the grouping of orchestras at concerts,
    for it is often defective; there is a disproportion between the different families of
    instruments and, in consequence, between their different sonorities, some of which
    are too thin and others too dull. But these defects are fairly common all over Europe
    to-day. Unhappily, more peculiar to France is the insufficiency or poor quality of
    the choirs, whose progress has been far from keeping pace with that of the
    orchestras. It is to this side of music that the directors of concerts must now bring
    their efforts to bear.</p>
    <p>The Lamoureux Concerts have not had as stable a dwelling-place as the
    Ch&acirc;telet Concerts. They have wandered about Paris from one room to
    another&mdash;from the Cirque d'Hiver to the Cirque d'&Eacute;t&eacute;, and from the
    Ch&acirc;teau-d'Eau to the Nouveau Th&eacute;&acirc;tre. At the present moment they
    are in the Salle Gaveau, which is much too small for them. In spite of the progress
    of music and musical taste, Paris <a name="page282"
    id="page282"/>has not yet a concert-hall, as the smallest provincial
    towns in Germany have; and this shameful indifference, unworthy of the artistic
    renown of Paris, obliges the symphonic societies to take refuge in circuses or
    theatres, which they share with other kinds of performers, though the acoustics of
    these places are not intended for concerts. And so it happens that for six years the
    Chevillard Concerts have been given at the back of a music-hall, which has the same
    entrance, and which is only separated from the concert-room by a small passage, so
    that the roaring choruses of a <i>danse du venire</i> may mingle with an adagio of
    Beethoven's or a scene from the Tetralogy. Worse than this, the smallness of the
    place into which these concerts have been crammed has been a serious obstacle in the
    way of making them popular. Nevertheless, in the promenade and galleries of the
    Nouveau Th&eacute;&acirc;tre, in later years, arose what may be called a little war
    over concertos. It was rather a curious episode in the history of the musical taste
    of Paris, and merits a few words here. In every country, but especially in those
    countries that are least musical, a virtuoso profits by public favour, often to the
    detriment of the work he is performing; for what is most liked in music is the
    musician. The virtuoso&mdash;whose importance must not be underrated, and who is
    worthy of honour when he is a reverential and sympathetic interpreter of
    genius&mdash;has too often taken a lamentable part, especially in Latin countries, in
    the degrading of musical taste; for empty virtuosity makes a desert of art. The <a name="page283" id="page283"/>fashion of inept
    fantasias and acrobatic variations has, it is true, gone by; but of late years
    virtuosity has returned in an offensive way, and, sheltering itself under the solemn
    classical name of "concertos," it usurped a place of rather exaggerated importance in
    symphony concerts, and especially in M. Chevillard's concerts&mdash;a place which
    Lamoureux would never have given it. Then the younger and more enthusiastic part of
    the public began to revolt; and very soon, with perfect impartiality and quite
    indiscriminately, began to hiss famous and obscure virtuosi alike in their
    performance of any concerto, whether it was splendid or detestable. Nothing found
    favour with them&mdash;neither the playing of Paderewski, nor the music of
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns and the great masters. The management of the concerts went its own
    way and tried in vain to put out the disturbers, and to forbid them entry to the
    concert-room; and the battle went on for a long time, and critics were drawn into it.
    But in spite of its ridiculous excesses, and the barbarism of the methods by which
    the parterre expressed its opinions, that quarrel is not without interest. It proved
    how a passion and enthusiasm for music had been roused in France; and the passion,
    though unjust in its expression, was more fruitful and of far greater worth than
    indifference.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <h4>3. <i>The Schola Cantorum</i></h4>
    <p>The Lamoureux Concerts had served their purpose, and, in their turn, their heroic
    mission came <a name="page284" id="page284"/>to
    an end. They had forced Wagner on Paris; and Paris, as always, had overshot the mark,
    and could swear by no one but Wagner. French musicians were translating Gounod's or
    Massenet's ideas into Wagner's style; Parisian critics repeated Wagner's theories at
    random, whether they understood them or not&mdash;generally when they did not
    understand them. A reaction was inevitable directly Paris was well saturated with
    Wagner; and it came about in 1890, among a chosen few, some of whom had been, and
    were even still, under Wagner's influence. It was at first only a mild reaction, and
    showed itself in a return to the classics of the past and to the great primitives in
    music.</p>
    <p>There had been several attempts in this direction before, but none of them had
    succeeded in making any impression on the mass of the public. In 1843, Joseph
    Napol&eacute;on Ney, Prince of Moszkowa, founded in Paris a society for the
    performance of religious and classical vocal music. This society, which the Prince
    himself conducted in his own house, set itself to perform the vocal works of the
    sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.<a name="FNanchor_221_221"
    id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>
    <p>In 1853, Louis Niedermeyer founded in Paris an <i>&Eacute;cole de musique
    religieuse et classique</i>, which strove "to form singers, organists, choir-masters,
    and composers of music, by the study of the classic works of the great masters of the
    fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth <a name="page285"
    id="page285"/>centuries." This school, subsidised by the State, was a
    nursery for some real musicians. It reckoned among its pupils some noted composers,
    conductors, organists, and historians; among others, M. Gabriel Faur&eacute;, M.
    Andr&eacute; Messager, M. Eug&egrave;ne Gigout, and M. Henry Expert. M.
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns was a professor there, and became its president. Nearly five hundred
    organists, choir-masters, and professors of music of the Conservatoire and other
    French colleges were trained there. But this school, serious in intention, and a
    refuge for the classic spirit in the midst of the prevailing bad taste, did not
    trouble itself about influencing the public, and, in fact, almost ignored it.</p>
    <p>Lamoureux attempted in 1873 to perform the great choral works of Bach and
    H&auml;ndel; and in 1878 the celebrated French organist, M. Alexandre Guilmant,
    ventured to give concerts at the Trocad&eacute;ro for the organ and orchestra, which
    were devoted to religious music of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. But the
    deplorable acoustics of the concert-room had a prejudicial effect on the works that
    were performed there; and the public did not respond very warmly to M. Guilmant's
    efforts, and seemed from the first only to find an historical interest in the
    masterpieces, and to miss their depth and life altogether.</p>
    <p>Then a pupil of Franck's, M. Henry Expert, who began his admirable works on
    Musical History in 1882, laid the foundation of the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; J.S.
    Bach</i>, in order to spread the knowledge of ancient music written between the
    twelfth and eighteenth cen<a name="page286"
    id="page286"/>turies. And he succeeded in interesting in his
    undertaking, not only the principal French musicians, such as C&eacute;sar Franck,
    Saint-Sa&euml;ns, and Gounod, but also foreigners, such as Hans von B&uuml;low,
    Tschaikowsky, Grieg, Sgambati, and Gevaert. Unhappily this society never got farther
    than arranging what it wanted to do, and only sketched out the plans that were
    realised later by Charles Bordes.</p>
    <p>The general public were not really interested in the art of the old musicians
    until the <i>Association des Chanteurs de Saint-Gervais</i> was founded in 1892 by
    Charles Bordes, the choirmaster of the church of Saint-Gervais. The immediate success
    and the noisy renown of the Society were due to other things besides the talent of
    its conductor, who combined with a lively artistic intelligence both common-sense and
    energy and a remarkable gift for organisation&mdash;it was due partly to the help of
    favourable circumstances, partly to the surfeit of Wagnerism, of which I have just
    spoken, and partly to the birth of a new religious art, which had sprung up since the
    death of C&eacute;sar Franck round the memory of that great musician.</p>
    <p>It is not my intention here to write an appreciation of C&eacute;sar Franck's
    genius, but it is not possible to understand the musical movement in Paris of the
    last fifteen years if one does not take into account the importance of his teaching.
    The organ class at the Conservatoire, where in 1872 Franck succeeded his old master
    Benoist, was for a long time, as M. Vincent d'Indy says, "the true centre for the
    <a name="page287" id="page287"/>study of
    Composition at the Conservatoire. Many of his fellow-workers could never bring
    themselves to look upon him as one of themselves, because he had the boldness to see
    in art something other than the means of earning a living. Indeed, C&eacute;sar
    Franck was not of them; and they made him feel this." But the young students made no
    mistake about the matter. "At this time," M. d'Indy also tells us,<a
    name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222"
    class="fnanchor">[222]</a> "that is to say from 1872 to 1876, the three courses of
    Advanced Musical Composition were given by three professors who were not at all
    fitted for their work. One was Victor Mass&eacute;, a composer of simple light operas
    and a man with no understanding of a symphony, who was very frequently ill and had to
    entrust his teaching to one of his pupils; another was Henri Reber, an oldish
    musician with narrow and dogmatic ideas; and the third was Fran&ccedil;ois Bazin, who
    was not capable of distinguishing in his pupil's fugues a false answer from a true
    one, and whose highest title to glory is derived from a composition called <i>Le
    Voyage en Chine</i>. So it is not surprising that C&eacute;sar Franck's teaching,
    founded on that of Bach and Beethoven, but admitting, as well, imagination and all
    new and liberal ideas, did, at that time, draw to him all young minds that had lofty
    ambitions and that were really in love with their art. And so, quite unconsciously,
    the master attracted to himself all the sincere and artistic talent that was
    scattered <a name="page288" id="page288"/>about
    the different classes of the Conservatoire, as well as that of his outside
    pupils."</p>
    <p>Among those who received his direct teaching<a name="FNanchor_223_223"
    id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> were
    Henri Duparc, Alexis de Castillon, Vincent d'Indy, Ernest Chausson, Pierre de
    Br&eacute;ville, Augusta Holmes, Louis de Serres, Charles Bordes, Guy Ropartz, and
    Guillaume Lekeu. And if to these we add the pupils in the organ classes, who also
    came under his influence, we have, among others, Samuel Rousseau, Gabriel
    Piern&eacute;, Auguste Chapuis, Paul Vidal, and Georges Marty; and also the virtuosi
    who were for some time intimate with him, such as Armand Parent and Eug&egrave;ne
    Ysaye, to whom Franck dedicated his violin sonata. And if one thinks, too, of the
    artists who, though not his pupils, felt his power&mdash;artists such as Gabriel
    Faur&eacute;, Alexandre Guilmant, Emmanuel Chabrier, and Paul Dukas&mdash;one may see
    that nearly the whole musical generation of Paris of that time took its inspiration
    from C&eacute;sar Franck. And it was largely with the intention of perpetuating his
    teaching that his pupils, Charles Bordes and Vincent d'Indy, and his friend,
    Alexandre Guilmant, founded in 1894, four years after his death, the <i>Schola
    Cantorum</i>, which has kept his memory alive ever since.</p>
    <p>"Our revered father, Franck," said Vincent d'Indy, in a speech, "is in some ways
    the grandfather of the <i>Schola Cantorum</i>; for it is his system of teaching that
    we apply and try to carry on here."<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224"
    class="fnanchor">[224]</a><a name="page289"
    id="page289"/></p>
    <p>The influence of Franck was twofold: it was artistic and moral. On the one hand he
    was, if I may so put it, an admirable professor of musical architecture; he founded a
    school of symphony and chamber-music such as France had never had before, which in
    certain directions was newer and more daring than that of the German symphony
    writers. And, on the other hand, he exercised by his own character a memorable
    influence over all those who came into contact with him. His profound faith, that
    fine, indulgent, and calm faith, shone round him like a glory. The Catholic party,
    who were awakening to new life in France just then, tried, after his death, to
    identify his ideals with their own. But this was, as we have said elsewhere,<a
    name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225"
    class="fnanchor">[225]</a> to narrow Franck's mind; for its great charm lay in its
    harmonious union of religion and liberty, which never limited its artistic sympathies
    to an exclusive ideal. The composer's son, M. Georges C&eacute;sar-Franck, has in
    vain protested against this monopoly of his father, and says:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"According to certain writers, who wish to reduce everything to a dead level and
      deduce all things from a single cause, C&eacute;sar Franck was a mystic whose true
      domain was religious music. Nothing could be wider of the mark. The public is given
      to generalisations, and is too easily gulled. They will judge a composer on a
      single work, or a group of works, and class him once and for all.... In reality, my
      father was a man of all-round <a name="page290"
      id="page290"/>accomplishments. As a finished musician, he was
      master of every form of composition. He wrote both religious and secular
      music&mdash;melodies, dances, pastorales, oratorios, symphonic poems, symphonies,
      sonatas, trios, and operas. He did not confine his attention to any particular kind
      of work to the exclusion of other kinds; he was able to express himself in any way
      he chose."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>But as what was really religious in him found itself in agreement with a current
    of thought that was rather powerful at that time, it was inevitable that this one
    side of his genius should be first brought to light, and that religious music should
    be the first to benefit by his work. And also one of the early manifestos<a
    name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227"
    class="fnanchor">[227]</a> of the <i>Schola Cantorum</i> dealt with the reform of
    sacred music by carrying it back to great ancient models; and its first decision was
    as follows: "Gregorian chant shall rest for all time the fountain-head and the base
    of the Church's music, and shall constitute the only model by which it may be truly
    judged."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page291" id="page291"/>They added
    to this, however, music <i>&agrave; la Palestrina</i>, and any music that conformed
    to its principles or was inspired by its example. Such archaic ideas would certainly
    never create a new kind of religious music, but at least they have helped to restore
    the old art; and they received their official consecration in the famous letter
    written by Pope Pius X on the Re-form of Sacred Music.</p>
    <p>The achievement of an artistic ideal so restricted as this would not have
    sufficed, however, to assure the success of the <i>Schola Cantorum</i>, nor establish
    its authority with a public that was, whatever people may say, only lukewarm in its
    religion, and that would only interest itself in the religious art of other days as
    it would in a passing fashion. But the spirit of curiosity and the meaning of modern
    life began to weigh little by little with the Schola's principles. After singing
    Palestrinian and Gregorian chants at the Church of Saint-Gervais during Holy Week,
    they played Carissimi, Sch&uuml;tz, and the Italian and German masters of the
    seventeenth century. Then came Bach's cantatas; and their performance, given by M.
    Bordes in the Salle d'Harcourt, attracted large audiences and started the cult of
    this master in Paris. Then they sang Rameau and Gluck; and, finally, all ancient
    music, sacred or secular, was approved. And so this little school, <a name="page292" id="page292"/>which had been
    consecrated to the cult of ancient religious music, and had made so modest a
    beginning,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> developed into a School of Art
    capable of satisfying modern wants; and in 1900, when M. Vincent d'Indy became
    president of the <i>Schola</i>, it was decided to move the school into larger
    premises in the Rue Saint-Jacques.</p>
    <p>The programme of this new school was explained by M. Vincent d'Indy in his
    Inauguration speech on 2 November, 1900, and showed how he based the foundations of
    musical teaching upon history.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"Art, in its journey across the ages, is a microcosm which has, like the world
      itself, successive stages of youth, maturity, and old age; but it never
      dies&mdash;it renews itself perpetually. It is not like a perfect circle; it is
      like a spiral, and in its growth is always mounting higher. I believe in making
      students follow the same path that art itself has followed, so that they shall
      undergo during their term of study the same transformations that music itself has
      undergone during the centuries. In this way they will come out much better armed
      for the difficulties of modern art, since they will have lived, so to speak, the
      life of art, and followed the natural and inevitable order of the forms that made
      up the different epochs of artistic development."</p>
    </div>
    <p><a name="page293" id="page293"/>M. d'Indy
    claims that this system may be applied as successfully to instrumentalists and
    singers as to future composers. "For it is as profitable for them to know," he says,
    "how to sing a liturgic monody properly, or to be able to play a Corelli sonata in a
    suitable style, as it is for composers to study the structure of a motet or a suite."
    M. d'Indy, moreover, obliged all students, without distinction, to attend the
    lectures on vocal music; and, besides that, he instituted a special class to teach
    the conducting of orchestras&mdash;which was something quite new to France. His
    object, as he clearly said, was to give a new form to modern music by means of a
    knowledge of the music of the past.</p>
    <p>On this subject he says:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"Where shall we find the quickening life that will give us fresh forms and
      formulas? The source is not really difficult to discover. Do not let us seek it
      anywhere but in the decorative art of the plain-song singers, in the architectural
      art of the age of Palestrina, and in the expressive art of the great Italians of
      the seventeenth century. It is there, and <i>there alone</i>, that we shall find
      melodic craft, rhythmic cadences, and a harmonic magnificence that is really
      new&mdash;if our modern spirit can only learn how to absorb their nutritious
      essence. And so I prescribe for all pupils in the School the careful study of
      classic forms, because <i>they alone</i> are able to give the elements of a new
      life to our music, which <a name="page294"
      id="page294"/>will be founded on principles that are sane, solid,
      and trustworthy."<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>This fine and intelligent eclecticism was likely to develop a critical spirit, but
    was rather less adapted to form original personalities. In any case, however, it was
    excellent discipline in the formation of musical taste; and, in truth, the
    <i>&Eacute;cole Sup&eacute;rieure de musique</i> of the Rue Saint-Jacques became a
    new Conservatoire, both more modern and more learned than the old Conservatoire, and
    freer, and yet less free, because more self-satisfied. The school developed very
    quickly. From having twenty-one pupils in 1896, it had three hundred and twenty in
    1908. Eminent musicians and professors learned in the history and science of music
    taught there, and M. d'Indy himself took the Composition classes.<a
    name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231"
    class="fnanchor">[231]</a> And in its short career the <i>Schola</i> may already be
    credited with the training of young composers, such as MM. Roussel, D&eacute;odat de
    S&eacute;verac, Gustave Bret, Labey, Samazeuilh, R. de Cast&eacute;ra,
    S&eacute;rieyx, Alquier, Coindreau, Estienne, Le Flem, and Groz; and to these may be
    added M. d'Indy's private pupils, Witkowski, and one of the foremost of modern
    composers, Alberic Magnard.</p>
    <p>Outside the influence that the School exercises by its teaching, its propaganda by
    means of concerts and publications is very active. From its founda<a name="page295" id="page295"/>tion up to 1904 it
    had given two hundred performances in one hundred and thirty provincial towns; more
    than one hundred and fifty concerts in Paris, of which fifty were of orchestral and
    choral music, sixty of organ music, and forty of chamber-music. These concerts have
    been well attended by enthusiastic and appreciative audiences, and have been a school
    for public taste. One does not look for perfect execution there,<a
    name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232"
    class="fnanchor">[232]</a> but for intelligent interpretations and a thirst for a
    fuller knowledge of the great works of the past. They have revived Monteverde's
    <i>Orfeo</i> and his <i>Incoronazione di Poppea</i>, which had been forgotten these
    three centuries; and it was following an interest created by repeated performances of
    Rameau at the <i>Schola</i><a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> that <i>Dardanus</i> was
    performed at Dijon under M. d'Indy's direction, <i>Castor et Pollux</i> at
    Montpellier under M. Charles Bordes' direction, and that in 1908 the Opera at Paris
    gave <i>Hippolyte et Aricie</i>. Branches of the <i>Schola</i> have, been started at
    Lyons, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Avignon, Montpellier, Nancy, &Eacute;pinal,
    Montlu&ccedil;on, Saint-Chamond, and Saint-Jean-de<a
    name="page296" id="page296"/>Luz.<a name="FNanchor_234_234"
    id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> A
    publishing house has been associated with the School at Paris; and from this we get
    Reviews, such as the <i>Tribune de Saint-Gervais</i>; publications of old music, such
    as the <i>Anthologie des ma&icirc;tres religieux primitifs des XVe, XVIe, et XVIIe
    si&egrave;cles</i>, edited by Charles Bordes; the <i>Archives des ma&icirc;tres de
    l'orgue des XVIe, XVIIe, et XVIIIe si&egrave;cles</i>, edited by Alexandre Guilmant
    and Andr&eacute; Pirro; the <i>Concerts spirituels de la Schola</i>, the new editions
    of <i>Orfeo</i>, and the <i>Incoronazione di Poppea</i>, edited by M. Vincent d'Indy;
    and publications of modern music, such as the <i>Collection du chant populaire</i>,
    the <i>R&eacute;pertoire moderne de musique vocale et d'orgue</i>, and, notably, the
    <i>&Eacute;dition mutuelle</i>, published by the composers themselves, whose property
    it is.</p>
    <p>And all this shows such a marvellous activity and gives evidence of such
    whole-hearted enthusiasm that I cannot bring myself to join issue with the critics
    who have lately attacked the <i>Schola</i>, though their attacks have been in some
    degree merited. Pettiness is to be found even in great artists, and imperfection in
    every human work; and defects reveal themselves most clearly after a victory has been
    won. The <i>Schola</i> has not escaped the critical periods that accompany growth,
    through which <a name="page297" id="page297"/>
    every work must pass if it is to triumph and endure. Without doubt, the sudden
    illness and premature retirement of the founder of the work, M. Charles Bordes,
    deprived the <i>Schola</i> of one of its most active forces&mdash;a force that was
    perhaps necessary for the school's successful development. For this man had been the
    school's life and soul, and retired, worn out by the heavy labours which he had borne
    alone during ten years.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>
    <p>But M. d'Indy, like a courageous apostle, has continued the direction of the
    <i>Schola</i> with a firm hand and unwearying care, despite his varied activities as
    composer, professor, and <i>Kapellmeister</i>; and he is one of the surest and most
    reliable guides for a young school of French music. And if his mind is rather given
    to abstractions, and his moods are sometimes rather combative, and certain prejudices
    (which are not always musical ones) make him lean towards ideals of reason and
    immovable faith&mdash;and if at times his followers unconsciously distort his ideas,
    and try to dam the stream which flows from life itself, I am convinced it is only the
    <a name="page298" id="page298"/>passing
    evidence of a reaction, perhaps a natural one, against the exaggerations they have
    encountered, and that the <i>Schola</i> will always know how to avoid the rocks where
    revolutionaries of the past have run aground and become the conservatives of the
    morrow. I hope the <i>Schola</i> will never grow into the kind of aristocratic school
    that builds walls about itself, but will always open wide its doors and welcome every
    new force in music, even to such as have ideals opposed to its own. Its future renown
    and the well-being of French art can only thus be maintained.</p>

    <h4>4. <i>The Chamber-Music Societies</i></h4>
    <p>On parallel lines with the big symphony concerts and the new
    <i>conservatoires</i>, societies were formed to spread the knowledge of, and form a
    taste for, chamber-music. This music, so common in Germany, was almost unknown in
    Paris before 1870. There was nothing but the Maurin Quartette, which gave five or six
    concerts every winter in the Salle Pleyel, and played Beethoven's last quartettes
    there. But these performances only attracted a small number of artists;<a
    name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236"
    class="fnanchor">[236]</a> and so far as the general public was concerned the
    <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des derniers quar<a name="page299"
    id="page299"/>tuors de Beethoven</i> had the reputation for devoting
    itself to a singular and incomprehensible kind of music that had been written by a
    deaf man.</p>
    <p>The true founder of chamber-music concerts in Paris was M. &Eacute;mile Lemoine,
    who started the society called <i>La Trompette</i>. He has given us a history of his
    work in the <i>Revue Musicale</i> (15 October, 1903). He was an engineer at the
    &Eacute;cole Poly-technique; and after he had left school he formed, about 1860, a
    quartette society of earnest amateurs, though they were not very skilled performers.
    This little society continued to meet regularly, and after perfecting itself little
    by little, finally opened its doors to the general public, which attended the
    concerts in gradually increasing numbers. Then <i>La Trompette</i> came into being.
    It prospered from the day that M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns&mdash;who was at that time a young
    man&mdash;made its acquaintance. He was pleased with these gatherings, and became an
    intimate friend of Lemoine; and he interested himself in the society, and induced
    other celebrated artists to take an interest in it, too. Among its early friends were
    MM. Alphonse Duvernoy, Di&eacute;mer, Pugno, Delsart, Breitner, Delaborde, Ch. de
    B&eacute;riot, Fissot, Marsick, Lo&euml;b, R&eacute;my, and Holmann. With such
    patronage, <i>La Trompette</i> soon acquired fame in the musical world, and "it
    represented in classical chamber-music the semi-official part played by the
    <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Concerts du Conservatoire</i> in classical orchestral
    music. Rubinstein, Paderewski, Eug&egrave;ne d'Albert, Hans von B&uuml;low, Arthur de
    Greef, Mme. Essipoff, and Mme. Menter, never missed getting a <a name="page300" id="page300"/>hearing there when
    their tours led them to Paris; and to figure on the programme of <i>La Trompette</i>
    was like the consecration of an artist." Such a society naturally contributed a great
    deal to the spread of classical chamber-music in Paris. M. Lemoine writes:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"Classical music was so little known to the musical public that even the
      audiences of <i>La Trompette</i>, cultured as they were, did not at all understand
      Beethoven's last quartettes; and my friends jeered at my taste for enigmas. This
      only made me the more determined that they should hear one of these great works at
      each concert. And sometimes I would give the same work at two or three concerts
      running if I thought it had not been properly appreciated. In that case I used to
      say before the performance: 'It seems to me that such-and-such a work has not been
      quite understood at the last hearing; and as it is a really marvellous work, I am
      sure that your feeling is that you do not know it sufficiently. So I have included
      it in to-day's programme.'"<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>
    </div>
    <p>These performances of sonatas, trios, and quartettes, were attentively listened to
    by an audience of five or six hundred persons, the greater part of <a name="page301" id="page301"/>them cultured people,
    students from the poly-technics and universities, who formed the kernel of a very
    discerning and enthusiastic public for chamber-music.</p>
    <p>By degrees, following the example of &Eacute;mile Lemoine, other quartette
    societies were formed; and at present they are so numerous that it would be difficult
    to name them all. And then there sprang up the same spirit of intelligent curiosity
    that had induced the French <i>Kapellmeister</i> of the symphony concert societies
    sometimes to introduce their German and Russian colleagues as conductors; and for
    this purpose the <i>Nouvelle Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Philharmonique de Paris</i> was
    founded, in 1901, on the initiative of Dr. Fr&auml;nkel and under the direction of M.
    Emmanuel Rey, to give a hearing in Paris to the principal foreign quartette players.
    And the profit was as great in one case as in the other; and the friendly rivalry
    between French quartette players and those of other countries bore good fruit, and
    gave us a fuller understanding of the inner character of German music.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <h4>5. <i>Musical Learning and the University</i></h4>
    <p>While this movement was going on in the artistic world, scholars were taking their
    share in it, and music was beginning to invade the University.</p>
    <p>But the thing was brought about with some difficulty; for among these serious
    people music did not count as a serious study. Music was thought <a name="page302" id="page302"/>of as an agreeable
    art, a social accomplishment, and the idea of making it the subject of scientific
    teaching must have been received with some amusement. Even up to the present time,
    general histories of Art have refused to accord music a place, so little was thought
    of it; and other arts were indignant at being mentioned in the same breath with it.
    This is illustrated in the eternal dispute among M. Jourdain's masters, when the
    fencing-master says:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"And from this we know what great consideration is due to us in a State; and how
      the science of Fencing is far above all useless sciences, such as dancing and
      music."</p>
    </div>
    <p>The first lectures on Aesthetics and Musical History were not given in France
    until after the war of 1870.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> They were then given at the
    Conservatoire, and, until quite lately, were the only lectures on Music of any
    importance in Paris. Since 1878 they have been given in a very excellent way by M.
    Bourgault-Ducoudray; but, as is only natural in a school of music, their character is
    artistic rather than scientific, and takes the form of a sort of illustration of the
    practical work that is done at the Conservatoire. And as for Parisian musical
    criticism as a whole, it had, thirty years ago, an <a
    name="page303" id="page303"/>almost exclusively literary character,
    and was without technical precision or historical knowledge.</p>
    <p>There again, on the territory of science, as on that of art, a new generation of
    musicians had sprung up since the war, a group of men versed in the history and
    aesthetics of music such as France had never known before. About 1890 the result of
    their labours began to appear. Henry Expert published his fine work, <i>Ma&icirc;tres
    Musiciens de la Renaissance</i>, in which he revived a whole century of French music.
    Alexander Guilmant and Andr&eacute; Pirro brought to daylight the works of our
    seventeenth and eighteenth century organists. Pierre Aubry studied mediaeval music.
    The admirable publications of the Benedictines of Solesmes awoke at the <i>Schola</i>
    and in the world outside it a taste for the study of religious music. Michel Brenet
    attacked all epochs of musical history, and produced, by his solid learning, some
    fine work. Julien Tiersot began the history of French folk-song, and rescued the
    music of the Revolution from oblivion. The publisher Durand set to work on his great
    editions of Rameau and Couperin. Towards 1893 the study of Music was introduced at
    the Sorbonne by some young professors, who made the subject the theses for their
    doctor's degree.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a><a
    name="page304" id="page304"/></p>
    <p>This movement with regard to musical study grew rapidly; and the first
    International Congress of Music, held in Paris at the time of the Universal
    Exhibition of 1900, gave historians of music an opportunity of realising their
    influence. In a few years, teaching about music was to be had everywhere. At first
    there were the free lectures of M. Lionel Dauriac and M. Georges Houdard at the
    Sorbonne, those of MM. Aubry, Gastou&eacute;, Pirro, and Vincent d'Indy at the
    <i>Schola</i> and the <i>Institut Catholique</i>; and then, at the beginning of 1902,
    there was the little Faculty of Music of the <i>&Eacute;cole des Hautes &Eacute;tudes
    sociales</i>, making a centre for the efforts of French scholars of music; and, in
    1900, two official courses of lectures on Musical History and Aesthetics were given
    at the College de France and the Sorbonne.</p>
    <p>The progress of musical criticism was just as rapid. Professors of faculties, old
    pupils of the &Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure, or the &Eacute;cole des
    Chartes, such as Henri Lichtenberger, Louis Laloy, and Pierre Aubrey, examined works
    of the past, and even of the present, by the exact methods of historical criticism.
    Choir-masters and organists of great erudition, such as Andre Pirro and
    Gastou&eacute;, and composers like Vincent d'Indy, Dukas, Debussy, and some others,
    analysed their art with the confidence that the intimate knowledge of its practice
    <a name="page305" id="page305"/>brings. A
    perfect efflorescence of works on music appeared. A galaxy of distinguished writers
    and a public were found to support two separate collections of Biographies of
    Musicians (which were issued at the same time by different publishers), as well as
    five or six good musical journals of a scientific character, some of which rivalled
    the best in Germany. And, finally, the French section of the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
    Internationale de Musique</i>, which was founded in 1899 in Berlin to establish
    communication between the scholars of all countries, found so favourable a ground
    with us that the number of its adherents in Paris alone is now over one hundred.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <h4>6. <i>Music and the People</i></h4>
    <p>Thus music had almost come back to its own, as far as the higher kind of teaching
    and the intellectual world were concerned. It remained for a place to be found for it
    in other kinds of teaching; for there, and especially in secondary education, its
    advance was less sure. It remained for us to make it enter into the life of the
    nation and into the people's education. This was a difficult task, for in France art
    has always had an aristocratic character; and it was a task in which neither the
    State nor musicians were very interested. The Republic still continued to regard
    music as something outside the people. There had even been opposition shown during
    the last thirty years towards any <a name="page306"
    id="page306"/>attempt at popular musical education. In the old days
    of the Pasdeloup concerts one could pay seventy-five centimes for the cheapest
    places, and have a seat for that; but at some of the symphony concerts to-day the
    cheapest seats are two and four francs. And so the people that sometimes came to the
    Pasdeloup concerts never come at all to the big concerts to-day.</p>
    <p>And that is why one should applaud the enterprise of Victor Charpentier, who, in
    March, 1905, founded a Symphonic Society of amateurs called <i>L'Orchestre</i>, to
    give free hearings for the benefit of the people. And in that Paris, where forty
    years ago one would have had a good deal of trouble to get together two or three
    amateur quartettes, Victor Charpentier has been able to count on one hundred and
    fifty good performers,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> who under his direction, or that
    of Saint-Sa&euml;ns or Gabriel Faur&eacute;, have already given seventeen free
    concerts, of which ten were given at the Trocad&eacute;ro.<a name="FNanchor_241_241"
    id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> It
    is to be hoped that the State will help forward such a generous work for the people
    in a rather more practical way than it has done up till now.<a
    name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242"
    class="fnanchor">[242]</a><a name="page307"
    id="page307"/></p>
    <p>Attempts have been made at different times to found a <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
    Lyrique Populaire</i>. But up to the present time none has succeeded. The first
    attempts were made in 1847. M. Carvalho's old Th&eacute;&acirc;tre-Lyrique was never
    a financial success, though quite distinguished performances of operas were given
    there, such as Gounod's <i>Faust</i> and Gluck's <i>Orfeo</i>, with Mme. Viardot as
    an interpreter and Berlioz as conductor; and the directors who followed
    Carvalho&mdash;Rety, Pasdeloup, etc.&mdash;did not succeed any better. In 1875
    Vizentini took over the Ga&icirc;t&eacute;, with a grant of two hundred thousand
    francs and excellent artists; but he had to give it up. Since then all sorts of other
    schemes have been tried by Viollet-le-Duc, Guimet, Lamoureux, Melchior de
    Vog&uuml;&eacute; and Julien Goujon, Gabriel Parisot, Colonne and Milliet, Deville,
    Lagoan&egrave;re, Corneille,<a name="page308"
    id="page308"/>Gailhard, and Carr&eacute;; but none of them achieved
    any success. At the moment, a new attempt is being made; and this time the thing
    seems to show every sign of being a success.</p>
    <p>But whatever may be the educational value of the theatre and concerts, they are
    not complete enough in themselves for the people. To make their influence deep and
    enduring it must be combined with teaching. Music, no less than every other
    expression of thought, has no use for the illiterate.</p>
    <p>So in this case there was everything to be done. There was no other popular
    teaching but that of the numerous Galin-Paris-Chev&eacute; schools. These schools
    have rendered great service, and are continuing to render it; but their simplified
    methods are not without drawbacks and gaps. Their purpose is to teach the people a
    musical language different from that of cultured people; and although it may not be
    as difficult as is supposed to go from a knowledge of the one to a knowledge of the
    other, it is always wrong to raise up a fresh barrier&mdash;however small it
    is&mdash;between the cultured people and the other people, who in our own country are
    already too widely separated.</p>
    <p>And besides, it is not enough to know one's letters; one must also have books to
    read. What books have the people had?&mdash;so far songs sung at the caf&eacute;
    concerts and the stupid repertoires of choral societies. The folk-song had
    practically disappeared, and was not yet ready for re-birth; for the populace, even
    more readily than the cul<a name="page309"
    id="page309"/>tured people, are inclined to blush at anything which
    suggests "popularity."<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>
    <p>It is nearly twenty-five years since M. Bourgault-Ducoudray, who was one of the
    people who fostered the growth of choral singing in France, pointed out, in an
    account of the teaching of singing, the usefulness of making children sing the old
    popular airs of the French provinces, and of getting the teachers to make collections
    of them. In 1895, as the result of a meeting organised by the <i>Correspondance
    g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Instruction primaire</i>, delightful collections of
    folk-songs were distributed in the schools. The melodies were taken from old airs
    collected by M. Julien Tiersot, and M. Maurice Buchor had put some fresh and
    sparkling verses to them. "M. Buchor," I wrote at the time, "will enjoy a pleasure
    not common to poets of our day: his songs will soar up into the open air, like the
    lark in his <i>Chanson de labour</i>. The populace may even recognise its own spirit
    in them, and one day take possession of them, as if they were of their own
    contriving."<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> This prediction has been almost
    com<a name="page310" id="page310"/>pletely
    realised, and M. Buchor's songs are now the property of all the people of France.</p>
    <p>But M. Buchor did not remain content to be a poet of popular song. During the last
    twelve years he has made, with untiring energy, a tour of all the &Eacute;coles
    Normales in France, returning several times to places where he found signs of good
    vocal ability. In each school he made the pupils sing his songs&mdash;in unison, or
    in two or three parts, sometimes massing the boys' and girls' schools of one town
    together. His ambition grew with his success; and to the folk-song melodies<a

    class="fnanchor">[245]</a> he began gradually to add pieces of classical music. And
    to impress the music better on the singers he changed the existing words, and tried
    to find others, which by their moral and poetic beauty more exactly translated the
    musical feeling.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page311" id="page311"/>And at last
    he composed and grouped together twenty-four poems in his <i>Po&egrave;me de la Vie
    humaine</i><a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>&mdash;fine odes and songs,
    written for classic airs and choruses, a vast repertory of the people's joys and
    sorrows, fitting the momentous hours of family or public life. With a people that has
    ancient musical traditions, as Germany has, music is the vehicle for the words and
    impresses them in the heart; but in France's case it is truer to say that the words
    have brought the music of H&auml;ndel and Beethoven into the hearts of French
    school-children. The great thing is that the music has really got hold of them, and
    that now one may hear the provincial &Eacute;coles Normales performing choruses from
    <i>Fidelio, The Messiah</i>, Schumann's<a name="page312"
    id="page312"/><i>Faust</i>, or Bach cantatas.<a
    name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248"
    class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The honour of this remarkable achievement, which no one
    could have believed possible twenty years ago, belongs almost entirely to M. Maurice
    Buchor.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>
    <p>M. Buchor's endeavours have been the most extensive and the most fruitful, but he
    is not alone in individual effort. There was, twenty years ago, in the suburbs of
    Paris and in the provinces, a large number of well-meaning people who devoted
    themselves to the work of musical education with sincerity and splendid enthusiasm.
    But their good works were too isolated, and were swamped by the <a name="page313" id="page313"/>apathy of the people
    about them; though sometimes they kindled little fires of love and understanding in
    art, which only needed coaxing in order to burn brightly; and even their less happy
    efforts generally succeeded in lighting a few sparks, which were left smouldering in
    people's hearts.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>
    <p>At length, as a result of these individual efforts, the State began to show an
    interest in this educational movement, although it had for so long stood apart from
    it.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251"
    class="fnanchor">[251]</a> It discovered, in its turn, the educational value of
    singing. A musical test was instituted at the examination for the <i>Brevet
    sup&eacute;rieur</i><a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> which made the study of solfeggio
    a more serious matter in the &Eacute;coles Normales. In 1903 an endeavour was made to
    organise the teaching of music in the schools and colleges in a more rational way.<a
    name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253"
    class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>
    <p><a name="page314" id="page314"/>In 1904,
    following the suggestions of M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns and M. Bourgault-Ducoudray,
    class-singing was incorporated with other subjects in the programme of teaching,<a
    name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254"
    class="fnanchor">[254]</a> and a free school of choral singing was started in Paris
    under the honorary chairmanship of M. Henry Marcel, director of the Beaux-Arts, and
    under the direction of M. Radiguer. Quite lately a choral society for young
    school-girls has been formed, with the Vice-Provost as president and a membership of
    from six to seven hundred young girls, who since 1906 have given an annual concert
    under the direction of M. Gabriel Piern&eacute;. And lastly, at the end of 1907, an
    association of professors was started to undertake the teaching of music in the
    institutions of public instruction; its chairman was the Inspector-General, M.
    Gilles, and its honorary presidents were M. Liard and M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns. Its object
    is to aid the progress of musical instruction by establishing a centre to promote
    friendly relations among professors of music; by centralising their interests and
    studies; by organising a circulating library of music and a periodical magazine in
    which questions relating to music may be discussed; by establishing communication
    between French professors and foreign professors; and by seeking to bring together
    professors of music and professors in other branches of public teaching.</p>
    <p>All this is not much, and we are yet terribly behindhand, especially as regards
    secondary teaching, which is considered less important than primary <a name="page315" id="page315"/>teaching.<a
    name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255"
    class="fnanchor">[255]</a> But we are scrambling out of an abyss of ignorance, and it
    is something to have the desire to get out of it. We must remember that Germany has
    not always been in its present plethoric state of musical prosperity. The great
    choral societies only date from the end of the eighteenth century. Germany in the
    time of Bach was poor&mdash;if not poorer&mdash;in means for performing choral works
    than France to-day. Bach's only executants were his pupils at the Thomasschule at
    Leipzig, of which barely a score knew how to sing.<a name="FNanchor_256_256"
    id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> And
    now these people gather together for the great <i>M&auml;nnergesangsfeste</i> (choral
    festivals) and the <i>Musikfeste</i> (music festivals) of Imperial Germany.</p>
    <p>Let us hope on and persevere. The main thing is that a start has been made; the
    thing that remains is to have patience and&mdash;persistence.</p>

    <h4>THE PRESENT CONDITION OF FRENCH MUSIC</h4>
    <p>We have seen how the musical education of France is going on in theatres, in
    concerts, in schools, by lectures and by books; and the Parisian's rather restless
    desire for knowledge seems to be satisfied for the moment. The mind of Paris has made
    a journey&mdash;a hasty journey, it is true <a name="page316"
    id="page316"/>through the music of other countries and other times,<a
    name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257"
    class="fnanchor">[257]</a> and is now becoming introspective. After a mad enthusiasm
    over discoveries in strange lands, music and musical criticism have regained their
    self-possession and their jealous love of independence. A very decided reaction
    against foreign music has been shown since the time of the Universal Exhibition of
    1900. This movement is not unconnected, consciously or unconsciously, with the
    nationalist train of thought, which was stirred up in France, and especially in
    Paris, somewhere about the same time. But it is also a natural development in the
    evolution of music. French music felt new vigour springing up within her, and was
    astonished at it; her days of preparation were over, and she aspired to fly alone;
    and, in accordance with the eternal rule of history, the first use she made of her
    newly-acquired strength was to defy her teachers. And this revolt against foreign
    influences was directed&mdash;one had expected it&mdash;against the strongest of the
    influences&mdash;the influence of German music as personified by Wagner. Two
    discussions in magazines, in 1903 and 1904, brought this state of mind curiously to
    light: one was an enquiry held by M. Jacques Morland in the <i>Mercure de France</i>
    (January, 1903) as to <i>The Influence of German Music in France</i>; and the other
    was that of M. Paul Landormy in the <i>Revue Bleue</i> (March and April,<a name="page317" id="page317"/>1904) as to <i>The
    Present Condition of French Music</i>. The first was like a shout of deliverance, and
    was not without exaggeration and a good deal of ingratitude; for it represented
    French musicians and critics throwing off Wagner's influence because it had had its
    day; the second set forth the theories of the new French school, and declared the
    independence of that school.</p>
    <p>For several years the leader of the young school, M. Claude Debussy, has, in his
    writings in the <i>Revue Blanche</i> and <i>Gil Blas</i>, attacked Wagnerian art. His
    personality is very French&mdash;capricious, poetic, and <i>spirituelle</i>, full of
    lively intelligence, heedless, independent, scattering new ideas, giving vent to
    paradoxical caprice, criticising the opinions of centuries with the teasing
    impertinence of a little street boy, attacking great heroes of music like Gluck,
    Wagner, and Beethoven, upholding only Bach, Mozart, and Weber, and loudly professing
    his preference for the old French masters of the eighteenth century. But in spite of
    this he is bringing back to French music its true nature and its forgotten
    ideals&mdash;its clearness, its elegant simplicity, its naturalness, and especially
    its grace and plastic beauty. He wishes music to free itself from all literary and
    philosophic pretensions, which have burdened German music in the nineteenth century
    (and perhaps have always done so); he wishes music to get away from the rhetoric
    which has been handed down to us through the centuries, from its heavy construction
    and precise orderliness, from its harmonic and rhythmic formulas, and the <a name="page318" id="page318"/>exercises of
    oratorical embroidery. He wishes that all about it shall be painting and poetry; that
    it shall explain its true feeling in a clear and direct way; and that melody,
    harmony, and rhythm shall develop broadly along the lines of inner laws, and not
    after the pretended laws of some intellectual arrangement. And he himself preaches by
    example in his <i>Pell&eacute;as et M&eacute;lisande</i>, and breaks with all the
    principles of the Bayreuth drama, and gives us the model of the new art of his
    dreams. And on all sides discerning and well-informed critics, such as M. Pierre Lalo
    of <i>Le Temps</i>, M. Louis Laloy of the <i>Revue Musicale</i> and the <i>Mercure
    Musicale</i>, and M. Marnold of <i>Le Mercure de France</i>, have championed his
    doctrines and his art. Even the <i>Schola Cantorum</i>, whose eclectic and archaic
    spirit is very different from that of Debussy, seemed at first to be drawn into the
    same current of thought; and this school which had so helped to propagate the foreign
    influences of the past, did not seem to be quite insensible to the nationalistic
    preoccupation of the last few years. So the <i>Schola</i> devoted itself more and
    more&mdash;as was moreover its right and duty&mdash;to the French music of the past,
    and filled its concert programmes with French works of the seventeenth and eighteenth
    centuries&mdash;with Marc Antoine Charpentier, Du Mont, Leclair, Cl&eacute;rambault,
    Couperin, and the French primitive composers for the organ, the harpsichord, and the
    violin; and with the works of dramatic composers, especially of the great Rameau,
    who, after a period of complete oblivion, suddenly benefited by this <a name="page319" id="page319"/>excessive reaction,
    to the detriment of Gluck, whom the young critics, following M. Debussy's example,
    severely abused.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> There was even a moment when the
    <i>Schola</i> took a decided share in the battle, and, through M. Charles Bordes,
    issued a manifesto&mdash;<i>Credo</i>, as they called it&mdash;about a new art
    founded on the ancient traditions of French music:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>"We wish to have free speech in music&mdash;a sustained recitative, infinite
      variety, and, in short, complete liberty in musical utterance. We wish for the
      triumph of natural music, so that it shall be as free and full of movement as
      speech, and as plastic and rhythmic as a classical dance."</p>
    </div>
    <p>It was open war against the metrical art of the last three centuries, in the name
    of national tradition (more or less freely interpreted), of folk-song, and of
    Gregorian chant. And "the constant and avowed purpose of all this campaign was the
    triumph of French music, and its cult."<a name="FNanchor_259_259"
    id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>
    <p>This manifesto reflects in its own way the spirit of Debussy and his untrammelled
    musical impressionism; and though it shows a good deal of na&iuml;vet&eacute; and
    some intolerance, there was in it a strength of youthful enthusiasm that accorded
    <a name="page320" id="page320"/>with the great
    hopes of the time, and foretold glorious days to come and a splendid harvest of
    music.</p>
    <p>Not many years have passed since then; yet the sky is already a little clouded,
    the light not quite so bright. Hope has not failed; but it has not been fulfilled.
    France is waiting, and is getting a little impatient. But the impatience is
    unnecessary; for to found an art we must bring time to our aid; art must ripen
    tranquilly. Yet tranquillity is what is most lacking in Parisian art. The artists,
    instead of working steadily at their own tasks and uniting in a common aim, are given
    up to sterile disputes. The young French school hardly exists any longer, as it has
    now split up into two or three parties. To a fight against foreign art has succeeded
    a fight among themselves: it is the deep-rooted evil of the country, this vain
    expenditure of force. And most curious of all is the fact that the quarrel is not
    between the conservatives and the progressives in music, but between the two most
    advanced sections: the <i>Schola</i> on the one hand, who, should it gain the
    victory, would through its dogmas and traditions inevitably develop the airs of a
    little academy; and, on the other hand, the independent party, whose most important
    representative is M. Debussy. It is not for us to enter into the quarrel; we would
    only suggest to the parties in question that if any profit is to result from their
    misunderstanding, it will be derived by a third party&mdash;the party in favour of
    routine, the party that has never lost favour with the great theatre-going
    public,&mdash;<a name="page321" id="page321"/>a
    party that will soon make good the place it has lost if those who aim at defending
    art set about fighting one another. Victory has been proclaimed too soon; for
    whatever the optimistic representatives of the young school may say, victory has not
    yet been gained; and it will not be gained for some time yet&mdash;not until public
    taste is changed, not while the nation lacks musical education, nor until the
    cultured few are united to the people, through whom their thoughts shall be
    preserved. For not only&mdash;with a few rare and generous exceptions&mdash;do the
    more aristocratic sections of society ignore the education of the people, but they
    ignore the very existence of the people's soul. Here and there, a composer&mdash;such
    as Bizet and M. Saint-Sa&euml;ns, or M. d'Indy and his disciples&mdash;will build up
    symphonies and rhapsodies and very difficult pieces for the piano on the popular airs
    of Auvergne, Provence, or the Cevennes; but that is only a whim of theirs, a little
    ingenious pastime for clever artists, such as the Flemish masters of the fifteenth
    century indulged in when they decorated popular airs with polyphonic elaborations. In
    spite of the advance of the democratic spirit, musical art&mdash;or at least all that
    counts in musical art&mdash;has never been more aristocratic than it is to-day.
    Probably the phenomenon is not peculiar to music, and shows itself more or less in
    other arts; but in no other art is it so dangerous, for no other has roots less
    firmly fixed in the soil of France. And it is no consolation to tell oneself that
    this is according to the great French traditions, which have nearly always been <a name="page322" id="page322"/>aristocratic.
    Traditions, great and small, are menaced to-day; the axe is ready for them. Whoever
    wishes to live must adapt himself to the new conditions of life. The future of art is
    at stake. To continue as we are doing is not only to weaken music by condemning it to
    live in unhealthy conditions, but also to risk its disappearing sooner or later under
    the rising flood of popular misconceptions of music. Let us take warning by the fact
    that we have already had to defend music<a name="FNanchor_260_260"
    id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> when
    it was attacked at some of the parliamentary assemblies; and let us remember the
    pitifulness of the defence. We must not let the day come when a famous speech will be
    repeated with a slight alteration&mdash;"The Republic has no need of musicians."</p>
    <p>It is the historian's duty to point out the dangers of the present hour, and to
    remind the French musicians who have been satisfied with their first victory that the
    future is anything but sure, and that we must never disarm while we have a common
    enemy before us, an enemy especially dangerous in a democracy&mdash;mediocrity.</p>
    <p>The road that stretches before us is long and difficult. But if we turn our heads
    and look back over the way we have come we may take heart. Which of us does not feel
    a little glow of pride at the thought of what has been done in the last thirty <a name="page323" id="page323"/>years? Here is a town
    where, before 1870, music had fallen to the most miserable depths, which to-day teems
    with concerts and schools of music&mdash;a town where one of the first symphonic
    schools in Europe has sprung from nothing, a town where an enthusiastic concert-going
    public has been formed, possessing among its members some great critics with broad
    interests and a fine, free spirit&mdash;all this is the pride of France. And we have,
    too, a little band of musicians; among them, in the first rank, that great painter of
    dreams, Claude Debussy; that master of constructive art, Dukas; that impassioned
    thinker, Alb&eacute;ric Magnard; that ironic poet, Ravel; and those delicate and
    finished writers, Albert Roussel and D&eacute;odat de S&eacute;verac; without mention
    of the younger musicians who are in the vanguard of their art. And all this poetic
    force, though not the most vigorous, is the most original in Europe to-day. Whatever
    gaps one may find in our musical organisation, still so new, whatever results this
    movement may lead to, it is impossible not to admire a people whom defeat has
    aroused, and a generation that has accomplished the magnificent work of reviving the
    nation's music with such untiring perseverance and such steadfast faith. The names of
    Camille Saint-Sa&euml;ns, C&eacute;sar Franck, Charles Bordes, and Vincent d'Indy,
    will remain associated before all others with this work of national regeneration,
    where so much talent and so much devotion, from the leaders of orchestras and
    celebrated composers down to that obscure body of artists and music-lovers, have
    joined <a name="page324" id="page324"/>forces
    in the fight against indifference and routine. They have the right to be proud of
    their work. But for ourselves, let us waste no time in thinking about it. Our hopes
    are great. Let us justify them.</p>

      sickness.... My throbbing breast seems to be sinking into space; and my heart,
      drawing in some irresistible force, feels as though it would expand until it
      evaporated and dissolved away. My skin becomes hot and tender, and flushes from
      head to foot. I want to cry out to my friends (even those I do not care for) to
      help and comfort me, to save me from destruction, and keep in the life that is
      ebbing from me. I have no sensation of impending death in these attacks, and
      suicide seems impossible; I do not want to die&mdash;far from it, I want very much
      to live, to intensify life a thousandfold. It is an excessive appetite for
      happiness, which becomes unbearable when it lacks food; and it is only satisfied by
      intense delights, which give this great overflow of feeling an outlet. It is not a
      state of spleen, though that may follow later ... spleen is rather the congealing
      of all these emotions&mdash;the block of ice. Even when I am calm I feel a little
      of this '<i>isolement</i>' on Sundays in summer, when our towns are lifeless, and
      everyone is in the country; for I know that people are enjoying themselves away
      from me, and I feel their absence. The <i>adagio</i> of Beethoven's symphonies,
      certain scenes from Gluck's <i>Alceste</i> and <i>Armide</i>, an air from his
      Italian opera <i>Telemacco</i>, the Elysian fields of his <i>Orfeo</i>, will bring
      on rather bad attacks of this suffering; but these masterpieces bring with them
      also an antidote&mdash;they make one's tears flow, and then the pain is eased. On
      the other hand, the <i>adagio</i> of some of Beethoven's sonatas and Gluck's
      <i>Iphig&eacute;nie en Tauride</i> are full of melancholy, and therefore provoke
      spleen ... it is then cold within, the sky is grey and overcast with clouds, the
      north wind moans dully...." <i>(M&eacute;moires</i>, I, 246).</p>

      thing needless, and yet necessary," he said to his friend Hiller, who, after having
      made him write the <i>Symphonie fantastique</i> to spite Henrietta Smithson, next
      made him write the wretched fantasia <i>Euphonia</i> to spite Camille Moke, now
      Mme. Pleyel. One would feel obliged to draw more attention to the way he often
      adorned or perverted the truth if one did not feel it arose from his irrepressible
      and glowing imagination far more than from any intention to mislead; for I believe
      his real nature to have been a-very straightforward one. I will quote the story of
      his friend Crispino, a young countryman from Tivoli, as a characteristic example.
      Berlioz says in his <i>M&eacute;moires</i> (I, 229): "One day when Crispino was
      lacking in respect I made-him a present of two shirts, a pair of trousers, and
      three good kicks behind." In a note he added, "This is a lie, and is the result of
      an artist's tendency to aim at effect. I never kicked Crispino." But Berlioz took
      care afterwards to omit this note. One attaches as little importance to his other
      small boasts as to this one. The errors in the <i>M&eacute;moires</i> have been
      greatly exaggerated; and besides, Berlioz is the first to warn his readers that he
      only wrote what pleased him, and in his preface says that he is not writing his
      Confessions. Can one blame him for that?</p>

      reproaches that might be made in the words that follow the story I have quoted.
      "'Coward!' some young enthusiast will say, 'you ought to have written it; you
      should have been bold.' Ah, young man, you who call me coward did not have to look
      upon what I did; had you done so you, too, would have had no choice. My wife was
      there, half dead, only able to moan; she had to have three nurses, and a doctor
      every day to visit her; and I was sure of the disastrous result of any musical
      adventure. No, I was not a coward; I know I was only human. I like to believe that
      I honoured art in proving that she had left me enough reason to distinguish between
      courage and cruelty" (<i>M&eacute;moires</i>, II, 350).</p>

      class="label">[25]</span></a> In a note in the <i>M&eacute;moires</i>, Berlioz
      publishes a letter of Mendelssohn's which protests his "good friendship," and he
      writes these bitter words: "I have just seen in a volume of Mendelssohn's Letters
      what his friendship for me consisted of. He says to his mother, in what is plainly
      a description of myself, '&mdash;&mdash; is a perfect caricature, without a spark
      of talent ... there are times when I should like to swallow him up'"
      (<i>M&eacute;moires</i>, II, 48). Berlioz did not add that Mendelssohn also said:
      "They pretend that Berlioz seeks lofty ideals in art. I don't think so at all. What
      he wants is to get himself married." The injustice of these insulting words will
      disgust all those who remember that when Berlioz married Henrietta Smithson she
      brought as dowry nothing but debts; and that he had only three hundred francs
      himself, which a friend had lent him.</p>

      I shall deal with more fully in another essay at the end of this book: it is the
      decline of musical taste in France&mdash;and, I rather think, in all
      Europe&mdash;since 1835 or 1840. Berlioz says in his <i>M&eacute;moires</i>: "Since
      the first performance of <i>Rom&eacute;o et Juliette</i> the indifference of the
      French public for all that concerns art and literature has grown incredibly"
      (<i>M&eacute;moires</i>, II, 263). Compare the shouts of excitement and the tears
      that were drawn from the dilettanti of 1830 (<i>M&eacute;moires</i>, I, 81), at the
      performances of Italian operas or Gluck's works, with the coldness of the public
      between 1840 and 1870. A mantle of ice covered art then. How much Berlioz must have
      suffered. In Germany the great romantic age was dead. Only Wagner remained to give
      life to music; and he drained all that was left in Europe of love and enthusiasm
      for music. Berlioz died truly of asphyxia.</p>

      terribly difficult to play. So I went, very anxious, to one of the trombonists of
      the Opera orchestra. He looked at the passage and reassured me. 'The key of D flat

      Auber, as the type of a true French musician&mdash;Auber and his mixed Italian and
      German opera. That shows how Wagner, like most Germans, was incapable of grasping
      the real originality of French music, and how he saw only its externals. The best
      way to find out the musical characteristics of a nation is to study its folk-songs.
      If only someone would devote himself to the study of French folk-song (and there is
      no lack of material), people would realise perhaps how much it differs from German
      folk-song, and how the temperament of the French race shows itself there as being
      sweeter and freer, more vigorous and more expressive.</p>

      emancipated and free and can do what she pleases. Many old rules have no longer any
      vogue; they were made by unreflecting minds, or by lovers of routine for other
      lovers of routine. New needs of the mind, of the heart, and of the sense of
      hearing, make necessary new endeavours and, in some cases, the breaking of ancient
      laws. Many forms have become too hackneyed to be still adopted. The same thing may
      be entirely good or entirely bad, according to the use one makes of it, or the
      reasons one has for making use of it. Sound and sonority are secondary to thought,
      and thought is secondary to feeling and passion." (These opinions were given with

      his father, 13 October, 1781). Despairing probably at being unable to obtain this
      obedience, Mozart thought seriously of breaking up the form of opera, and of
      putting in its place, in 1778, a sort of melodrama (of which Rousseau had given an
      example in 1773), which he called "duodrama," where music and poetry were loosely
      associated, yet not dependent on each other, but went side by side on two parallel
      roads (Letter of 12 November, 1778).</p>

      awkwardness of Berlioz's harmony&mdash;which is incontestable&mdash;since some
      critics and composers have been able to see (Am I saying something
      ridiculous?&mdash;Wagner would say it for me) nothing but "faults of orthography"
      in his genius. To these terrible grammarians&mdash;who, two hundred years ago,
      criticised Moli&egrave;re on account of his "jargon"&mdash;I shall reply by quoting
      Schumann.</p>
      <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"Berlioz's harmonies, in spite of the diversity of their effect, obtained from
        very scanty material, are distinguished by a sort of simplicity, and even by a
        solidity and conciseness, which one only meets with in Beethoven.... One may find
        here and there harmonies that are commonplace and trivial, and others that are
        incorrect&mdash;at least according to the old rules. In some places his harmonies
        have a fine effect, and in others their result is vague and indeterminate, or it
        sounds badly, or is too elaborate and far-fetched. Yet with Berlioz all this
        somehow takes on a certain distinction. If one attempted to correct it, or even
        slightly to modify it&mdash;for a skilled musician it would be child's
        play&mdash;the music would become dull" (Article on the <i>Symphonie
        fantastique</i>).</p>

      <p>But let us leave that "grammatical discussion" as well as what Wagner wrote on
      "the childish question as to whether it is permitted or not to introduce
      'neologisms' in matters of harmony and melody" (Wagner to Berlioz, 22 February,
      1860). As Schumann has said, "Look out for fifths, and then leave us in peace."</p>

        with fervour; his eyes filled with tears, and he was hardly able to get out the
        words, 'Ah, monsieur, monsieur! moi Hongrois ... pauvre diable ... pas parler
        Fran&ccedil;ais ... un poco Italiano. Pardonnez mon extase.... Ah! ai compris

        ceased to inveigh against the Revolution of 1848&mdash;which should have had his
        sympathies. Instead of finding material, like Wagner, in the excitement of that
        time for impassioned compositions, he worked at <i>L'Enfance du Christ</i>. He
        affected absolute indifference&mdash;he who was so little made for indifference.
        He approved the State's action, and despised its visionary hopes.</p>

        struck Wagner. "Berlioz's loneliness is not only one of external circumstances;
        its origin is in his temperament. Though he is a Frenchman, with quick sympathies
        and interests like those of his fellow-citizens, yet he is none the less alone.
        He sees no one before him who will hold out a helping hand, there is no one by
        his side on whom he may lean" (Article written 5 May, 1841). As one reads these
        words, one feels it was Wagner's lack of sympathy and not his intelligence that
        prevented him from understanding Berlioz. In his heart I do not doubt that he
        knew well who was his great rival. But he never said anything about
        it&mdash;unless perhaps one counts an odd document, certainly not intended for
        publication, where he (even he) compares him to Beethoven and to Bonaparte

        written <i>Samson et Dalila</i>. "Not only did Liszt have <i>Samson et Dalila</i>
        performed at Weimar, but without him that work would never have come into being.
        My suggestions on the subject had met with such hostility that I had given up the
        idea of writing it; and all that existed were some illegible notes.... Then at
        Weimar one day I spoke to Liszt about it, and he said to me, quite trustingly and
        without having heard a note, 'Finish your work; I will have it performed here.'
        The events of 1870 delayed its performance for several years." (<i>Revue

        the hero is a stranger who is persecuted, and treated as a sorcerer in the very
        town to which he has brought honour. But the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> is not the
        same; and the fundamental difference of temperament between the two artists is
        strongly marked. M. d'Indy finishes with the renouncement of a Christian, and
        Herr Richard Strauss by a proud and joyous affirmation of independence.</p>

        his heart is not always in agreement with his mind. His mind denounces the
        Renaissance, but his instinct obliges him to appreciate the great Florentine
        painters of the Renaissance and the musicians of the sixteenth century. He only
        gets out of the difficulty by the most extraordinary compromises, by saying that
        Ghirlandajo and Filippo Lippi were Gothic, or by stating that the Renaissance in
        music did not begin till the seventeenth century! (<i>Cours de Composition</i>,

        say that I am trying to write this study from a purely historical point of view,
        by eliminating all personal feeling&mdash;which would be of no value here. As a
        matter of fact, I am not a Debussyite; my sympathies are with quite another kind
        of art. But I feel impelled to give homage to a great artist, whose work I am
        able to judge with some impartiality.</p>

        that during the first half of the seventeenth century people of taste objected to
        the very theatrical declamation of French opera. "Our singers believe," wrote
        Mersenne, in 1636, "that the exclamations and emphasis used by the Italians in
        singing savour too much of tragedies and comedies, and so they do not wish to
        employ them."</p>

        has, I think, discerned so shrewdly Debussy's art and genius. Some of his

        do Hugo the justice of saying that he always spoke of Beethoven with admiration,
        although he did not know him. But he rather exalts him in order to take away from
        the importance of a poet&mdash;the only one in the nineteenth century&mdash;whose
        fame was shading his own; and when he wrote in his <i>William Shakespeare</i>
        that "the great man of Germany is Beethoven" it was understood by all to mean
        "the great man of Germany is not Goethe."</p>

        France saw the brilliant rise and extinction of a great artist&mdash;the most
        spontaneous of all her musicians&mdash;Georges Bizet, who died in 1875, aged
        thirty-seven. "Bizet was the last genius to discover a new beauty," said
        Nietzsche; "Bizet discovered new lands&mdash;the Southern lands of music,"
        <i>Carmen</i> (1875) and <i>L'Arl&eacute;sienne</i> (1872) are masterpieces of
        the lyrical Latin drama. Their style is luminous, concise, and well-defined; the
        figures are outlined with incisive precision. The music is full of light and
        movement, and is a great contrast to Wagner's philosophical symphonies, and its
        popular subject only serves to strengthen its aristocratic distinction. By its
        nature and its clear perception of the spirit of the race it was well in advance
        of its time. What a place Bizet might have taken in our art if he had only lived
        twenty years longer!</p>

        Conservatoire originated in <i>L'&Eacute;cole gratuite de musique de la garde
        nationale parisienne</i>, founded in 1792 by Sarrette, and directed by Gossec. It
        was then a civic and military school, but, according to Ch&eacute;nier, was
        changed into the <i>Institut national de musique</i> on 8 November, 1793, and
        into the <i>Conservatoire</i> on 3 August, 1795. This Republican Conservatoire
        made it its business to keep in contact with the spirit of the country, and was
        directly opposed to the Opera, which was of monarchical origin. See M. Constant
        Pierre's work <i>Le Conservatoire national de musique</i> (1900), and M. Julien
        Tiersot's very interesting book <i>Les F&ecirc;tes et les Chants de la
        R&eacute;volution fran&ccedil;aise</i> (1908).</p>

        that I am speaking here of <i>official</i> action only; for there have always
        been masters among the Conservatoire teaching staff who have united a fine
        musical culture with a broad-minded and liberal spirit. But the influence of
        these independent minds is, generally speaking, small; for they have not the
        disposing of academic successes; and when, by exception, they have a wide
        influence, like that of C&eacute;sar Franck, it is the result of personal work
        outside the Conservatoire&mdash;work that is, as often as not, opposed to
        Conservatoire principles.</p>

        href="#FNanchor_212_212"><span class="label">[212]</span></a> It is to be noted
        that since 1807 the Conservatoire pupils have made Beethoven's symphonies
        familiar to Parisians. The <i>Symphony in C minor</i> was performed by them in
        1808; the <i>Heroic</i> in 1811. It was in connection with one of these
        performances that the <i>Tablettes de Polymnie</i> gave a curious appreciation of
        Beethoven, which is quoted by M. Constant Pierre: "This composer is often
        grotesque and uncouth, and sometimes flies majestically like an eagle and
        sometimes crawls along stony paths. It is as though one had shut up doves and
        crocodiles together."</p>

        to M. Rivet's report on the <i>Beaux-Arts</i> in 1906. The Opera employs 1370
        people, and its expenses are about 3,988,000 francs. The annual grant of the

        Gregorian chant during 1850 and 1860 by Dom Gu&eacute;ranger, the first abbot of
        Solesmes, a work continued by Dom Jausions and Dom Pothier, the abbot of

        mainly composed of pupils; and, by a generous arrangement, the financial profits
        from rehearsals and performances are divided among the pupils who take part in
        them, and credited to their account. And so besides the exhibitioners the
        <i>Schola</i> has a great number of pupils who are not well off, but who manage
        by these concerts to defray almost the entire expenses of their education there.
        "The concerts serve more especially as aesthetic exercises for the pupils, and as
        a means of according them teaching at small expense to themselves." I owe this
        information and all that precedes it to the kindness of M. J. de la Laurencie,
        the general secretary of the <i>Schola</i>, whom I should like to thank.</p>

        the influence of the <i>Schola</i> an independent society, the
        <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; J.S. Bach</i>, started in Paris by an old <i>Schola</i>
        pupil, M. Gustave Bret, which, since 1905, has devoted itself to the performance
        of the great works of Bach. It is not one of the least merits of the
        <i>Schola</i> that it has helped to form good amateur choirs of the same type as
        the choral societies of Germany.</p>

        did not even then give up his labours altogether. Though obliged to retire to the
        south of France for his health's sake, he founded, in November, 1905, the
        <i>Schola</i> of Montpellier. This <i>Schola</i> has given about fifteen concerts
        a year, and has performed some of Bach's cantatas, scenes from Rameau's and
        Gluck's operas, Franck's oratorios, and Monteverde's <i>Orfeo</i>. In 1906 M.
        Bordes organised an open-air performance of Rameau's <i>Guirlande</i>. In
        January, 1908, he produced <i>Castor et Pollux</i> at the Montpellier theatre.
        The man's activity was incredible, and nothing seemed to tire him. He was
        planning to start a dramatic training-school at Montpellier for the production of
        seventeenth and eighteenth century operas, when he died, in November, 1909, at
        the age of forty-four, and so deprived French art of one of its best and most
        unselfish servants.</p>

        audience atoned, it is true, for its small numbers. Berlioz used to come to these
        concerts with his friends, Damcke and Stephen Heller; and it was after one of
        these performances, when he had been very stirred by an <i>adagio</i> in the E
        flat quartette, that he burst out with, "What a man! He could do everything, and
        the others nothing!"</p>

        Trompette</i>, was also the pretext for embellishing chamber-music, by
        introducing the trumpet among the other instruments. To this end M.
        Saint-Sa&euml;ns wrote his fine septette for piano, trumpet, two violins, viola,
        violoncello, and double bass; and M. Vincent d'Indy his romantic suite in D for

        has been a veritable outburst of concerts at popular prices&mdash;some of them in
        imitation of the German <i>Restaurationskonzerte</i>, such as the Concerts-Rouge,
        the Concerts-Touche, etc., where classical and modern symphony music may be
        heard. These concerts are increasing fast, and have great success among a public
        that is almost exclusively <i>bourgeois</i>, but they are yet a long way behind
        the popular performances of H&auml;ndel in London, where places may be had for
        sixpence and threepence.</p>
        <p>I do not attach very much importance to the courageous, though not always very
        intelligent movement of the Universit&eacute;s Populaires, where since 1886 a
        collection of amateurs, of fashionable people and artists, meet to make
        themselves heard, and pretend to initiate the people into what are sometimes the
        most complicated and aristocratic works of a classic or decadent art. While
        honouring this propaganda&mdash;whose ardour has now abated somewhat&mdash;one
        must say that it has shown more good-will than common-sense. The people do not
        need amusing, still less should they be bored; what they need is to learn
        something about music. This is not always easy; for it is not noisy deeds we
        want, but patience and self-sacrifice. Good intentions are not enough. One knows
        the final failure of the <i>Conservatoire populaire de Mimi Pinson</i>, started
        by Gustave Charpentier, for giving musical education to the work-girls of
        Paris.</p>

        relates an anecdote which typifies what I mean. "I begged the conductor of a good
        men's choral society," he says, "to have one of H&auml;ndel's choruses sung. But
        he seemed to hesitate. I had made the suggestion tentatively, and then tried to
        enlarge on the sincerity and breadth of its musical idea. 'Ah, very good,' he
        said, 'if you really want to hear it, it is easily done; but I was afraid that
        perhaps it was rather too popular.'" (<i>Po&egrave;me de la Vie Humaine</i>:
        Introduction to the Second Series, 1905.) One may add to this the words of a
        professor of singing in a primary school for Higher Education in Paris:
        "Folk-music&mdash;well, it is very good for the provinces." (Quoted by Buchor in
        the Introduction to the Second Series of the <i>Po&egrave;me</i>, 1902.)</p>

        href="#FNanchor_246_246"><span class="label">[246]</span></a> I reserve my
        opinion, from an artist's point of view, on this plagiarising of the words of
        songs. On principle I condemn it absolutely. But, in this case, it is Hobson's
        choice. <i>Primum vivere, deinde philosophari</i>. If our contemporary musicians
        really wished the people to sing, they would have written songs for them; but
        they seem to have no desire to achieve honour that way. So there is nothing else
        to be done but to have recourse to the musicians of other days; and even there
        the choice is very limited. For France formerly, like the France of to-day, had
        very few musicians who had any understanding of a great popular art. Berlioz came
        nearest to understanding the meaning of it; and he is not yet public property, so
        his airs cannot be used. It is curious, and rather sad, that out of eighty pieces
        chosen by M. Buchor only nine of them are French; and this is reckoning the
        Italians, Lully and Cherubini, as Frenchmen. M. Buchor has had to go to German
        classical musicians almost entirely, and, generally speaking, his choice has been
        a happy one. With a sure instinct he has given the preference to popular geniuses
        like H&auml;ndel and Beethoven. We may ask why he did not keep their words; but
        we must remember that at any rate they had to be translated; and though it may
        seem rash to change the subject of a musical masterpiece, it is certain that M.
        Buchor's clever adaptations have resulted in driving the fine thoughts of
        H&auml;ndel and Schubert and Mozart and Beethoven into the memories of the French
        people, and making them part of their lives. Had they heard the same music at a
        concert they would probably not have been very much moved. And that makes M.
        Buchor in the right. Let the French people enrich themselves with the musical
        treasures of Germany until the time comes when they are able to create a music of
        their own! This is a kind of peaceful conquest to which our art is accustomed.
        "Now then, Frenchmen," as Du Bellay used to say, "walk boldly up to that fine old
        Roman city, and decorate (as you have done more than once) your temples and
        altars with its spoils." Besides, let us remember that the German masters of the
        eighteenth century, whose words M. Buchor has plagiarised, did not hesitate to
        plagiarise themselves; and in turning the Berceuse of the <i>Oratorio de
        No&euml;l</i> into a <i>Sainte famille humaine</i>, M. Buchor has respected the
        musical ideas of Bach much more than Bach himself did when he turned it into a
        <i>Dialogue between Hercules and Pleasure</i>.</p>

        Angoul&ecirc;me and Valence; and the great choral scene and the last part of
        Schumann's <i>Faust</i> by the two &Eacute;coles Normales of Limoges. At Valence,
        performances are given every year in the theatre there before an audience of
        between eight hundred and a thousand teachers.</p>
        <p>Outside the schools, especially in the North, a certain number of teachers of
        both sexes have formed choral societies among work-girls and co-operative
        societies, such as <i>La Fraternelle</i> at Saint Quentin.</p>
        <p>In a general way one may say that M. Maurice Buchor's campaign has especially
        succeeded in departments like that of Aisne and Dr&ocirc;me, where the ground has
        been prepared by the Academy Inspector. Unhappily in many districts the movement
        receives a lively opposition from music-teachers, who do not approve of this
        mnemotechnical way of learning poetry with music, without any instruction in
        solfeggio or musical science. And it is quite evident that this method would have
        its defects if it were a question of training musicians. But it is really a
        matter of training people who have some music in them; and so the musicians must
        not be too fastidious. I hope that great musicians will one day spring from this
        good ground&mdash;musicians more human than those of our own time, musicians
        whose music will be rooted in their hearts and in their country.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
