    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My name is Hugh Paret. I was a corporation lawyer, but by no means a
      typical one, the choice of my profession being merely incidental, and due,
      as will be seen, to the accident of environment. The book I am about to
      write might aptly be called The Autobiography of a Romanticist. In that
      sense, if in no other, I have been a typical American, regarding my
      country as the happy hunting-ground of enlightened self-interest, as a
      function of my desires. Whether or not I have completely got rid of this
      romantic virus I must leave to those the aim of whose existence is to
      eradicate it from our literature and our life. A somewhat Augean task!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been impelled therefore to make an attempt at setting forth, with
      what frankness and sincerity I may, with those powers of selection of
      which I am capable, the life I have lived in this modern America; the
      passions I have known, the evils I have done. I endeavour to write a
      biography of the inner life; but in order to do this I shall have to
      relate those causal experiences of the outer existence that take place in
      the world of space and time, in the four walls of the home, in the school
      and university, in the noisy streets, in the realm of business and
      politics. I shall try to set down, impartially, the motives that have
      impelled my actions, to reveal in some degree the amazing mixture of good
      and evil which has made me what I am to-day: to avoid the tricks of memory
      and resist the inherent desire to present myself other and better than I
      am. Your American romanticist is a sentimental spoiled child who believes
      in miracles, whose needs are mostly baubles, whose desires are dreams.
      Expediency is his motto. Innocent of a knowledge of the principles of the
      universe, he lives in a state of ceaseless activity, admitting no
      limitations, impatient of all restrictions. What he wants, he wants very
      badly indeed. This wanting things was the corner-stone of my character,
      and I believe that the science of the future will bear me out when I say
      that it might have been differently built upon. Certain it is that the
      system of education in vogue in the 70's and 80's never contemplated the
      search for natural corner-stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      At all events, when I look back upon the boy I was, I see the beginnings
      of a real person who fades little by little as manhood arrives and
      advances, until suddenly I am aware that a stranger has taken his
      place....
    </p>
    <p>
      I lived in a city which is now some twelve hours distant from the Atlantic
      seaboard. A very different city, too, it was in youth, in my grandfather's
      day and my father's, even in my own boyhood, from what it has since become
      in this most material of ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a book of my photographs, preserved by my mother, which I have
      been looking over lately. First is presented a plump child of two, gazing
      in smiling trustfulness upon a world of sunshine; later on a lean boy in
      plaided kilts, whose wavy, chestnut-brown hair has been most carefully
      parted on the side by Norah, his nurse. The face is still childish. Then
      appears a youth of fourteen or thereabout in long trousers and the
      queerest of short jackets, standing beside a marble table against a
      classic background; he is smiling still in undiminished hope and trust,
      despite increasing vexations and crossings, meaningless lessons which had
      to be learned, disciplines to rack an aspiring soul, and long,
      uncomfortable hours in the stiff pew of the First Presbyterian Church.
      Associated with this torture is a peculiar Sunday smell and the faint
      rustling of silk dresses. I can see the stern black figure of Dr. Pound,
      who made interminable statements to the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord,&rdquo; I can hear him say, &ldquo;thou knowest...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These pictures, though yellowed and faded, suggest vividly the being I
      once was, the feelings that possessed and animated me, love for my
      playmates, vague impulses struggling for expression in a world forever
      thwarting them. I recall, too, innocent dreams of a future unidentified,
      dreams from which I emerged vibrating with an energy that was lost for
      lack of a definite objective: yet it was constantly being renewed. I often
      wonder what I might have become if it could have been harnessed, directed!
      Speculations are vain. Calvinism, though it had begun to make compromises,
      was still a force in those days, inimical to spontaneity and human
      instincts. And when I think of Calvinism I see, not Dr. Pound, who
      preached it, but my father, who practised and embodied it. I loved him,
      but he made of righteousness a stern and terrible thing implying not joy,
      but punishment, the suppression rather than the expansion of aspirations.
      His religion seemed woven all of austerity, contained no shining threads
      to catch my eye. Dreams, to him, were matters for suspicion and distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sometimes ask myself, as I gaze upon his portrait now, the duplicate of
      the one painted for the Bar Association, whether he ever could have felt
      the secret, hot thrills I knew and did not identify with religion. His
      religion was real to him, though he failed utterly to make it
      comprehensible to me. The apparent calmness, evenness of his life awed me.
      A successful lawyer, a respected and trusted citizen, was he lacking
      somewhat in virility, vitality? I cannot judge him, even to-day. I never
      knew him. There were times in my youth when the curtain of his unfamiliar
      spirit was withdrawn a little: and once, after I had passed the crisis of
      some childhood disease, I awoke to find him bending over my bed with a
      tender expression that surprised and puzzled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was well educated, and from his portrait a shrewd observer might divine
      in him a genteel taste for literature. The fine features bear witness to
      the influence of an American environment, yet suggest the intellectual
      Englishman of Matthew Arnold's time. The face is distinguished, ascetic,
      the chestnut hair lighter and thinner than my own; the side whiskers are
      not too obtrusive, the eyes blue-grey. There is a large black cravat
      crossed and held by a cameo pin, and the coat has odd, narrow lapels. His
      habits of mind were English, although he harmonized well enough with the
      manners and traditions of a city whose inheritance was Scotch-Irish; and
      he invariably drank tea for breakfast. One of my earliest recollections is
      of the silver breakfast service and egg-cups which my great-grandfather
      brought with him from Sheffield to Philadelphia shortly after the
      Revolution. His son, Dr. Hugh Moreton Paret, after whom I was named, was
      the best known physician of the city in the decorous, Second Bank days.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother was Sarah Breck. Hers was my Scotch-Irish side. Old Benjamin
      Breck, her grandfather, undaunted by sea or wilderness, had come straight
      from Belfast to the little log settlement by the great river that mirrored
      then the mantle of primeval forest on the hills. So much for chance. He
      kept a store with a side porch and square-paned windows, where hams and
      sides of bacon and sugar loaves in blue glazed paper hung beside ploughs
      and calico prints, barrels of flour, of molasses and rum, all of which had
      been somehow marvellously transported over the passes of those forbidding
      mountains,&mdash;passes we blithely thread to-day in dining cars and
      compartment sleepers. Behind the store were moored the barges that floated
      down on the swift current to the Ohio, carrying goods to even remoter
      settlements in the western wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin, in addition to his emigrant's leather box, brought with him some
      of that pigment that was to dye the locality for generations a deep blue.
      I refer, of course, to his Presbyterianism. And in order the better to
      ensure to his progeny the fastness of this dye, he married the
      granddaughter of a famous divine, celebrated in the annals of New England,&mdash;no
      doubt with some injustice,&mdash;as a staunch advocate on the doctrine of
      infant damnation. My cousin Robert Breck had old Benjamin's portrait,
      which has since gone to the Kinley's. Heaven knows who painted it, though
      no great art were needed to suggest on canvas the tough fabric of that
      sitter, who was more Irish than Scotch. The heavy stick he holds might,
      with a slight stretch of the imagination, be a blackthorn; his head looks
      capable of withstanding many blows; his hand of giving many. And, as I
      gazed the other day at this picture hanging in the shabby suburban
      parlour, I could only contrast him with his anaemic descendants who
      possessed the likeness. Between the children of poor Mary Kinley,&mdash;Cousin
      Robert's daughter, and the hardy stock of the old country there is a gap
      indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Benjamin Breck made the foundation of a fortune. It was his son who built
      on the Second Bank the wide, corniced mansion in which to house
      comfortably his eight children. There, two tiers above the river, lived my
      paternal grandfather, Dr. Paret, the Breck's physician and friend; the
      Durretts and the Hambletons, iron-masters; the Hollisters, Sherwins, the
      McAlerys and Ewanses,&mdash;Breck connections,&mdash;the Willetts and
      Ogilvys; in short, everyone of importance in the days between the
      'thirties and the Civil War. Theirs were generous houses surrounded by
      shade trees, with glorious back yards&mdash;I have been told&mdash;where
      apricots and pears and peaches and even nectarines grew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business of Breck and Company, wholesale grocers, descended to my
      mother's first cousin, Robert Breck, who lived at Claremore. The very
      sound of that word once sufficed to give me a shiver of delight; but the
      Claremore I knew has disappeared as completely as Atlantis, and the place
      is now a suburb (hateful word!) cut up into building lots and connected
      with Boyne Street and the business section of the city by trolley lines.
      Then it was &ldquo;the country,&rdquo; and fairly saturated with romance. Cousin
      Robert, when he came into town to spend his days at the store, brought
      with him some of this romance, I had almost said of this aroma. He was no
      suburbanite, but rural to the backbone, professing a most proper contempt
      for dwellers in towns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every summer day that dawned held Claremore as a possibility. And such was
      my capacity for joy that my appetite would depart completely when I heard
      my mother say, questioningly and with proper wifely respect&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're really going off on a business trip for a day or two, Mr.
      Paret&rdquo; (she generally addressed my father thus formally), &ldquo;I think I'll go
      to Robert's and take Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell Norah to pack, mother,&rdquo; I would exclaim, starting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll see what your father thinks, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain at the table until you are excused, Hugh,&rdquo; he would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Released at length, I would rush to Norah, who always rejoiced with me,
      and then to the wire fence which marked the boundary of the Peters domain
      next door, eager, with the refreshing lack of consideration characteristic
      of youth, to announce to the Peterses&mdash;who were to remain at home the
      news of my good fortune. There would be Tom and Alfred and Russell and
      Julia and little Myra with her grass-stained knees, faring forth to seek
      the adventures of a new day in the shady western yard. Myra was too young
      not to look wistful at my news, but the others pretended indifference,
      seeking to lessen my triumph. And it was Julia who invariably retorted &ldquo;We
      can go out to Uncle Jake's farm whenever we want to. Can't we, Tom?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      No journey ever taken since has equalled in ecstasy that leisurely trip of
      thirteen miles in the narrow-gauge railroad that wound through hot fields
      of nodding corn tassels and between delicious, acrid-smelling woods to
      Claremore. No silent palace &ldquo;sleeping in the sun,&rdquo; no edifice decreed by
      Kubla Khan could have worn more glamour than the house of Cousin Robert
      Breck.
    </p>
    <p>
      It stood half a mile from the drowsy village, deep in its own grounds
      amidst lawns splashed with shadows, with gravel paths edged&mdash;in
      barbarous fashion, if you please with shells. There were flower beds of
      equally barbarous design; and two iron deer, which, like the figures on
      Keats's Grecian urn, were ever ready poised to flee,&mdash;and yet never
      fled. For Cousin Robert was rich, as riches went in those days: not only
      rich, but comfortable. Stretching behind the house were sweet meadows of
      hay and red clover basking in the heat, orchards where the cows cropped
      beneath the trees, arbours where purple clusters of Concords hung beneath
      warm leaves: there were woods beyond, into which, under the guidance of
      Willie Breck, I made adventurous excursions, and in the autumn gathered
      hickories and walnuts. The house was a rambling, wooden mansion painted
      grey, with red scroll-work on its porches and horsehair furniture inside.
      Oh, the smell of its darkened interior on a midsummer day! Like the
      flavour of that choicest of tropical fruits, the mangosteen, it baffles
      analysis, and the nearest I can come to it is a mixture of matting and
      corn-bread, with another element too subtle to define.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hospitality of that house! One would have thought we had arrived, my
      mother and I, from the ends of the earth, such was the welcome we got from
      Cousin Jenny, Cousin Robert's wife, from Mary and Helen with the flaxen
      pig-tails, from Willie, whom I recall as permanently without shoes or
      stockings. Met and embraced by Cousin Jenny at the station and driven to
      the house in the squeaky surrey, the moment we arrived she and my mother
      would put on the dressing-sacks I associated with hot weather, and sit
      sewing all day long in rocking-chairs at the coolest end of the piazza.
      The women of that day scorned lying down, except at night, and as evening
      came on they donned starched dresses; I recall in particular one my mother
      wore, with little vertical stripes of black and white, and a full skirt.
      And how they talked, from the beginning of the visit until the end! I have
      often since wondered where the topics came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until nearly seven o'clock that the train arrived which brought
      home my Cousin Robert. He was a big man; his features and even his ample
      moustache gave a disconcerting impression of rugged integrity, and I
      remember him chiefly in an alpaca or seersucker coat. Though much less
      formal, more democratic&mdash;in a word&mdash;than my father, I stood in
      awe of him for a different reason, and this I know now was because he
      possessed the penetration to discern the flaws in my youthful character,&mdash;flaws
      that persisted in manhood. None so quick as Cousin Robert to detect
      deceptions which were hidden from my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hobby was carpentering, and he had a little shop beside the stable
      filled with shining tools which Willie and I, in spite of their
      attractions, were forbidden to touch. Willie, by dire experience, had
      learned to keep the law; but on one occasion I stole in alone, and
      promptly cut my finger with a chisel. My mother and Cousin Jenny accepted
      the fiction that the injury had been done with a flint arrowhead that
      Willie had given me, but when Cousin Robert came home and saw my bound
      hand and heard the story, he gave me a certain look which sticks in my
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful people, those Indians were!&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;They could make
      arrowheads as sharp as chisels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was most uncomfortable....
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a strong voice, and spoke with a rising inflection and a marked
      accent that still remains peculiar to our locality, although it was much
      modified in my mother and not at all noticeable in my father; with an odd
      nasal alteration of the burr our Scotch-Irish ancestors had brought with
      them across the seas. For instance, he always called my father Mr.
      Par-r-ret. He had an admiration and respect for him that seemed to forbid
      the informality of &ldquo;Matthew.&rdquo; It was shared by others of my father's
      friends and relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sarah,&rdquo; Cousin Robert would say to my mother, &ldquo;you're coddling that boy,
      you ought to lam him oftener. Hand him over to me for a couple of months&mdash;I'll
      put him through his paces.... So you're going to send him to college, are
      you? He's too good for old Benjamin's grocery business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was very fond of my mother, though he lectured her soundly for her
      weakness in indulging me. I can see him as he sat at the head of the
      supper table, carving liberal helpings which Mary and Helen and Willie
      devoured with country appetites, watching our plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Hugh? You haven't eaten all your lamb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't like fat, Robert,&rdquo; my mother explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd teach him to like it if he were my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Robert, he isn't your boy,&rdquo; Cousin Jenny would remind him.... His
      bark was worse than his bite. Like many kind people he made use of
      brusqueness to hide an inner tenderness, and on the train he was hail
      fellow well met with every Tom, Dick and Harry that commuted,&mdash;although
      the word was not invented in those days,&mdash;and the conductor and
      brakeman too. But he had his standards, and held to them....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mine was not a questioning childhood, and I was willing to accept the
      scheme of things as presented to me entire. In my tenderer years, when I
      had broken one of the commandments on my father's tablet (there were more
      than ten), and had, on his home-coming, been sent to bed, my mother would
      come softly upstairs after supper with a book in her hand; a book of
      selected Bible stories on which Dr. Pound had set the seal of his
      approval, with a glazed picture cover, representing Daniel in the lions'
      den and an angel standing beside him. On the somewhat specious plea that
      Holy Writ might have a chastening effect, she was permitted to minister to
      me in my shame. The amazing adventure of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
      particularly appealed to an imagination needing little stimulation. It
      never occurred to me to doubt that these gentlemen had triumphed over
      caloric laws. But out of my window, at the back of the second storey, I
      often saw a sudden, crimson glow in the sky to the southward, as though
      that part of the city had caught fire. There were the big steel-works, my
      mother told me, belonging to Mr. Durrett and Mr. Hambleton, the father of
      Ralph Hambleton and the grandfather of Hambleton Durrett, my schoolmates
      at Miss Caroline's. I invariably connected the glow, not with Hambleton
      and Ralph, but with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego! Later on, when my
      father took me to the steel-works, and I beheld with awe a huge pot filled
      with molten metal that ran out of it like water, I asked him&mdash;if I
      leaped into that stream, could God save me? He was shocked. Miracles, he
      told me, didn't happen any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did they stop?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About two thousand years ago, my son,&rdquo; he replied gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;no matter how much I believed in God, he wouldn't save me
      if I jumped into the big kettle for his sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For this I was properly rebuked and silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      My boyhood was filled with obsessing desires. If God, for example, had
      cast down, out of his abundant store, manna and quail in the desert, why
      couldn't he fling me a little pocket money? A paltry quarter of a dollar,
      let us say, which to me represented wealth. To avoid the reproach of the
      Pharisees, I went into the closet of my bed-chamber to pray, requesting
      that the quarter should be dropped on the north side of Lyme Street,
      between Stamford and Tryon; in short, as conveniently near home as
      possible. Then I issued forth, not feeling overconfident, but hoping. Tom
      Peters, leaning over the ornamental cast-iron fence which separated his
      front yard from the street, presently spied me scanning the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking for, Hugh?&rdquo; he demanded with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, something I dropped,&rdquo; I answered uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, I refused to tell. It was a broiling, midsummer day; Julia and
      Russell, who had been warned to stay in the shade, but who were engaged in
      the experiment of throwing the yellow cat from the top of the lattice
      fence to see if she would alight on her feet, were presently attracted,
      and joined in the search. The mystery which I threw around it added to its
      interest, and I was not inconsiderably annoyed. Suppose one of them were
      to find the quarter which God had intended for me? Would that be justice?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothing,&rdquo; I said, and pretended to abandon the quest&mdash;to be
      renewed later. But this ruse failed; they continued obstinately to search;
      and after a few minutes Tom, with a shout, picked out of a hot crevice
      between the bricks&mdash;a nickel!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's mine!&rdquo; I cried fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you lose it?&rdquo; demanded Julia, the canny one, as Tom was about to give
      it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      My lying was generally reserved for my elders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; I said hesitatingly, &ldquo;but it's mine all the same. It was&mdash;sent
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sent to you!&rdquo; they exclaimed, in a chorus of protest and derision. And
      how, indeed, was I to make good my claim? The Peterses, when assembled,
      were a clan, led by Julia and in matters of controversy, moved as one. How
      was I to tell them that in answer to my prayers for twenty-five cents, God
      had deemed five all that was good for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some&mdash;somebody dropped it there for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded the chorus. &ldquo;Say, that's a good one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears suddenly blinded me. Overcome by chagrin, I turned and flew into the
      house and upstairs into my room, locking the door behind me. An interval
      ensued, during which I nursed my sense of wrong, and it pleased me to
      think that the money would bring a curse on the Peters family. At length
      there came a knock on the door, and a voice calling my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh! Hugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hughie, won't you let me in? I want to give you the nickel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it!&rdquo; I shouted back. &ldquo;You found it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another interval, and then more knocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open up,&rdquo; he said coaxingly. &ldquo;I&mdash;I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I relented, and let him in. He pressed the coin into my hand. I refused;
      he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it's yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but you were looking for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes no difference,&rdquo; I declared magnanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity overcame him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Hughie, if you didn't drop it, who on earth did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody on earth,&rdquo; I replied cryptically....
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally, I declined to reveal the secret. Nor was this by any means the
      only secret I held over the Peters family, who never quite knew what to
      make of me. They were not troubled with imaginations. Julia was a little
      older than Tom and had a sharp tongue, but over him I exercised a distinct
      fascination, and I knew it. Literal himself, good-natured and
      warm-hearted, the gift I had of tingeing life with romance (to put the
      thing optimistically), of creating kingdoms out of back yards&mdash;at
      which Julia and Russell sniffed&mdash;held his allegiance firm.

      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I must have been about twelve years of age when I realized that I was
      possessed of the bard's inheritance. A momentous journey I made with my
      parents to Boston about this time not only stimulated this gift, but gave
      me the advantage of which other travellers before me have likewise availed
      themselves&mdash;of being able to take certain poetic liberties with a
      distant land that my friends at home had never seen. Often during the heat
      of summer noons when we were assembled under the big maple beside the
      lattice fence in the Peters' yard, the spirit would move me to relate the
      most amazing of adventures. Our train, for instance, had been held up in
      the night by a band of robbers in black masks, and rescued by a traveller
      who bore a striking resemblance to my Cousin Robert Breck. He had shot two
      of the robbers. These fabrications, once started, flowed from me with
      ridiculous ease. I experienced an unwonted exhilaration, exaltation; I
      began to believe that they had actually occurred. In vain the astute Julia
      asserted that there were no train robbers in the east. What had my father
      done? Well, he had been very brave, but he had had no pistol. Had I been
      frightened? No, not at all; I, too, had wished for a pistol. Why hadn't I
      spoken of this before? Well, so many things had happened to me I couldn't
      tell them all at once. It was plain that Julia, though often fascinated
      against her will, deemed this sort of thing distinctly immoral.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was a boy divided in two. One part of me dwelt in a fanciful realm of
      his own weaving, and the other part was a commonplace and protesting
      inhabitant of a world of lessons, disappointments and discipline. My
      instincts were not vicious. Ideas bubbled up within me continually from an
      apparently inexhaustible spring, and the very strength of the longings
      they set in motion puzzled and troubled my parents: what I seem to see
      most distinctly now is a young mind engaged in a ceaseless struggle for
      self-expression, for self-development, against the inertia of a tradition
      of which my father was the embodiment. He was an enigma to me then. He
      sincerely loved me, he cherished ambitions concerning me, yet thwarted
      every natural, budding growth, until I grew unconsciously to regard him as
      my enemy, although I had an affection for him and a pride in him that
      flared up at times. Instead of confiding to him my aspirations, vague
      though they were, I became more and more secretive as I grew older. I knew
      instinctively that he regarded these aspirations as evidences in my
      character of serious moral flaws. And I would sooner have suffered many
      afternoons of his favourite punishment&mdash;solitary confinement in my
      room&mdash;than reveal to him those occasional fits of creative fancy
      which caused me to neglect my lessons in order to put them on paper.
      Loving literature, in his way, he was characteristically incapable of
      recognizing the literary instinct, and the symptoms of its early stages he
      mistook for inherent frivolity, for lack of respect for the truth; in
      brief, for original sin. At the age of fourteen I had begun secretly
      (alas, how many things I did secretly!) to write stories of a sort,
      stories that never were finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded reading as duty, not pleasure. He laid out books for me, which
      I neglected. He was part and parcel of that American environment in which
      literary ambition was regarded as sheer madness. And no one who has not
      experienced that environment can have any conception of the pressure it
      exerted to stifle originality, to thrust the new generation into its
      religious and commercial moulds. Shall we ever, I wonder, develop the
      enlightened education that will know how to take advantage of such
      initiative as was mine? that will be on the watch for it, sympathize with
      it and guide it to fruition?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was conscious of still another creative need, that of dramatizing my
      ideas, of converting them into action. And this need was to lead me
      farther than ever afield from the path of righteousness. The concrete
      realization of ideas, as many geniuses will testify, is an expensive
      undertaking, requiring a little pocket money; and I have already touched
      upon that subject. My father did not believe in pocket money. A sea story
      that my Cousin Donald Ewan gave me at Christmas inspired me to compose one
      of a somewhat different nature; incidentally, I deemed it a vast
      improvement on Cousin Donald's book. Now, if I only had a boat, with the
      assistance of Ham Durrett and Tom Peters, Gene Hollister and Perry
      Blackwood and other friends, this story of mine might be staged. There
      were, however, as usual, certain seemingly insuperable difficulties: in
      the first place, it was winter time; in the second, no facilities existed
      in the city for operations of a nautical character; and, lastly, my
      Christmas money amounted only to five dollars. It was my father who
      pointed out these and other objections. For, after a careful perusal of
      the price lists I had sent for, I had been forced to appeal to him to
      supply additional funds with which to purchase a row-boat. Incidentally,
      he read me a lecture on extravagance, referred to my last month's report
      at the Academy, and finished by declaring that he would not permit me to
      have a boat even in the highly improbable case of somebody's presenting me
      with one. Let it not be imagined that my ardour or my determination were
      extinguished. Shortly after I had retired from his presence it occurred to
      me that he had said nothing to forbid my making a boat, and the first
      thing I did after school that day was to procure, for twenty-five cents, a
      second-hand book on boat construction. The woodshed was chosen as a
      shipbuilding establishment. It was convenient&mdash;and my father never
      went into the back yard in cold weather. Inquiries of lumber-yards
      developing the disconcerting fact that four dollars and seventy-five cents
      was inadequate to buy the material itself, to say nothing of the cost of
      steaming and bending the ribs, I reluctantly abandoned the ideal of the
      graceful craft I had sketched, and compromised on a flat bottom. Observe
      how the ways of deception lead to transgression: I recalled the cast-off
      lumber pile of Jarvis, the carpenter, a good-natured Englishman, coarse
      and fat: in our neighbourhood his reputation for obscenity was so well
      known to mothers that I had been forbidden to go near him or his shop.
      Grits Jarvis, his son, who had inherited the talent, was also contraband.
      I can see now the huge bulk of the elder Jarvis as he stood in the
      melting, soot-powdered snow in front of his shop, and hear his comments on
      my pertinacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ever wants another man's missus when you grows up, my lad, Gawd
      'elp 'im!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I want another man's wife when I don't want one of my own?&rdquo; I
      demanded, indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed with his customary lack of moderation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mind what old Jarvis says,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What you wants, you gets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did get his boards, by sheer insistence. No doubt they were not very
      valuable, and without question he more than made up for them in my
      mother's bill. I also got something else of equal value to me at the
      moment,&mdash;the assistance of Grits, the contraband; daily, after
      school, I smuggled him into the shed through the alley, acquiring likewise
      the services of Tom Peters, which was more of a triumph than it would
      seem. Tom always had to be &ldquo;worked up&rdquo; to participation in my ideas, but
      in the end he almost invariably succumbed. The notion of building a boat
      in the dead of winter, and so far from her native element, naturally
      struck him at first as ridiculous. Where in Jehoshaphat was I going to
      sail it if I ever got it made? He much preferred to throw snowballs at
      innocent wagon drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that Tom saw, at first, was a dirty, coal-spattered shed with dim
      recesses, for it was lighted on one side only, and its temperature was
      somewhere below freezing. Surely he could not be blamed for a tempered
      enthusiasm! But for me, all the dirt and cold and discomfort were blotted
      out, and I beheld a gallant craft manned by sturdy seamen forging her way
      across blue water in the South Seas. Treasure Island, alas, was as yet
      unwritten; but among my father's books were two old volumes in which I had
      hitherto taken no interest, with crude engravings of palms and coral
      reefs, of naked savages and tropical mountains covered with jungle, the
      adventures, in brief, of one Captain Cook. I also discovered a book by a
      later traveller. Spurred on by a mysterious motive power, and to the great
      neglect of the pons asinorum and the staple products of the Southern
      States, I gathered an amazing amount of information concerning a remote
      portion of the globe, of head-hunters and poisoned stakes, of typhoons, of
      queer war-craft that crept up on you while you were dismantling galleons,
      when desperate hand-to-hand encounters ensued. Little by little as I wove
      all this into personal adventures soon to be realized, Tom forgot the
      snowballs and the maddened grocery-men who chased him around the block;
      while Grits would occasionally stop sawing and cry out:&mdash;&ldquo;Ah, s'y!&rdquo;
       frequently adding that he would be G&mdash;d&mdash;d.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold woodshed became a chantry on the New England coast, the alley the
      wintry sea soon to embrace our ship, the saw-horses&mdash;which stood
      between a coal-bin on one side and unused stalls filled with rubbish and
      kindling on the other&mdash;the ways; the yard behind the lattice fence
      became a backwater, the flapping clothes the sails of ships that took
      refuge there&mdash;on Mondays and Tuesdays. Even my father was symbolized
      with unparalleled audacity as a watchful government which had, up to the
      present, no inkling of our semi-piratical intentions! The cook and the
      housemaid, though remonstrating against the presence of Grits, were
      friendly confederates; likewise old Cephas, the darkey who, from my
      earliest memory, carried coal and wood and blacked the shoes, washed the
      windows and scrubbed the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon Tom went to work....
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the building of the good ship Petrel is similar to that of
      all created things, a story of trial and error and waste. At last, one
      March day she stood ready for launching. She had even been caulked; for
      Grits, from an unknown and unquestionably dubious source, had procured a
      bucket of tar, which we heated over afire in the alley and smeared into
      every crack. It was natural that the news of such a feat as we were
      accomplishing should have leaked out, that the &ldquo;yard&rdquo; should have been
      visited from time to time by interested friends, some of whom came to
      admire, some to scoff, and all to speculate. Among the scoffers, of
      course, was Ralph Hambleton, who stood with his hands in his pockets and
      cheerfully predicted all sorts of dire calamities. Ralph was always a
      superior boy, tall and a trifle saturnine and cynical, with an amazing
      self-confidence not wholly due to the wealth of his father, the
      iron-master. He was older than I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won't float five minutes, if you ever get her to the water,&rdquo; was his
      comment, and in this he was supported on general principles by Julia and
      Russell Peters. Ralph would have none of the Petrel, or of the South Seas
      either; but he wanted,&mdash;so he said,&mdash;&ldquo;to be in at the death.&rdquo;
       The Hambletons were one of the few families who at that time went to the
      sea for the summer, and from a practical knowledge of craft in general
      Ralph was not slow to point out the defects of ours. Tom and I defended
      her passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph was not a romanticist. He was a born leader, excelling at organized
      games, exercising over boys the sort of fascination that comes from doing
      everything better and more easily than others. It was only during the
      progress of such enterprises as this affair of the Petrel that I succeeded
      in winning their allegiance; bit by bit, as Tom's had been won, fanning
      their enthusiasm by impersonating at once Achilles and Homer, recruiting
      while relating the Odyssey of the expedition in glowing colours. Ralph
      always scoffed, and when I had no scheme on foot they went back to him.
      Having surveyed the boat and predicted calamity, he departed, leaving a
      circle of quaint and youthful figures around the Petrel in the shed: Gene
      Hollister, romantically inclined, yet somewhat hampered by a strict
      parental supervision; Ralph's cousin Ham Durrett, who was even then a
      rather fat boy, good-natured but selfish; Don and Harry Ewan, my second
      cousins; Mac and Nancy Willett and Sam and Sophy McAlery. Nancy was a
      tomboy, not to be denied, and Sophy her shadow. We held a council, the
      all-important question of which was how to get the Petrel to the water,
      and what water to get her to. The river was not to be thought of, and
      Blackstone Lake some six miles from town. Finally, Logan's mill-pond was
      decided on,&mdash;a muddy sheet on the outskirts of the city. But how to
      get her to Logan's mill-pond? Cephas was at length consulted. It turned
      out that he had a coloured friend who went by the impressive name of
      Thomas Jefferson Taliaferro (pronounced Tolliver), who was in the express
      business; and who, after surveying the boat with some misgivings,&mdash;for
      she was ten feet long,&mdash;finally consented to transport her to
      &ldquo;tide-water&rdquo; for the sum of two dollars. But it proved that our combined
      resources only amounted to a dollar and seventy-five cents. Ham Durrett
      never contributed to anything. On this sum Thomas Jefferson compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday dawned clear, with a stiff March wind catching up the dust into
      eddies and whirling it down the street. No sooner was my father safely on
      his way to his office than Thomas Jefferson was reported to be in the
      alley, where we assembled, surveying with some misgivings Thomas
      Jefferson's steed, whose ability to haul the Petrel two miles seemed
      somewhat doubtful. Other difficulties developed; the door in the back of
      the shed proved to be too narrow for our ship's beam. But men embarked on
      a desperate enterprise are not to be stopped by such trifles, and the
      problem was solved by sawing out two adjoining boards. These were
      afterwards replaced with skill by the ship's carpenter, Able Seaman Grits
      Jarvis. Then the Petrel by heroic efforts was got into the wagon, the seat
      of which had been removed, old Thomas Jefferson perched himself
      precariously in the bow and protestingly gathered up his rope-patched
      reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks'll 'low I'se plum crazy, drivin' dis yere boat,&rdquo; he declared,
      observing with concern that some four feet of the stern projected over the
      tail-board. &ldquo;Ef she topples, I'll git to heaven quicker'n a bullet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When one is shanghaied, however,&mdash;in the hands of buccaneers,&mdash;it
      is too late to withdraw. Six shoulders upheld the rear end of the Petrel,
      others shoved, and Thomas Jefferson's rickety horse began to move forward
      in spite of himself. An expression of sheer terror might have been
      observed on the old negro's crinkled face, but his voice was drowned, and
      we swept out of the alley. Scarcely had we travelled a block before we
      began to be joined by all the boys along the line of march; marbles, tops,
      and even incipient baseball games were abandoned that Saturday morning;
      people ran out of their houses, teamsters halted their carts. The
      breathless excitement, the exaltation I had felt on leaving the alley were
      now tinged with other feelings, unanticipated, but not wholly lacking in
      delectable quality,&mdash;concern and awe at these unforeseen forces I had
      raised, at this ever growing and enthusiastic body of volunteers springing
      up like dragon's teeth in our path. After all, was not I the hero of this
      triumphal procession? The thought was consoling, exhilarating. And here
      was Nancy marching at my side, a little subdued, perhaps, but
      unquestionably admiring and realizing that it was I who had created all
      this. Nancy, who was the aptest of pupils, the most loyal of followers,
      though I did not yet value her devotion at its real worth, because she was
      a girl. Her imagination kindled at my touch. And on this eventful occasion
      she carried in her arms a parcel, the contents of which were unknown to
      all but ourselves. At length we reached the muddy shores of Logan's pond,
      where two score eager hands volunteered to assist the Petrel into her
      native element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! that the reality never attains to the vision. I had beheld, in my
      dreams, the Petrel about to take the water, and Nancy Willett standing
      very straight making a little speech and crashing a bottle of wine across
      the bows. This was the content of the mysterious parcel; she had stolen it
      from her father's cellar. But the number of uninvited spectators, which
      had not been foreseen, considerably modified the programme,&mdash;as the
      newspapers would have said. They pushed and crowded around the ship, and
      made frank and even brutal remarks as to her seaworthiness; even Nancy,
      inured though she was to the masculine sex, had fled to the heights, and
      it looked at this supreme moment as though we should have to fight for the
      Petrel. An attempt to muster her doughty buccaneers failed; the gunner too
      had fled,&mdash;Gene Hollister; Ham Durrett and the Ewanses were nowhere
      to be seen, and a muster revealed only Tom, the fidus Achates, and Grits
      Jarvis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, s'y!&rdquo; he exclaimed in the teeth of the menacing hordes. &ldquo;Stand back,
      carn't yer? I'll bash yer face in, Johnny. Whose boat is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shall it be whispered that I regretted his belligerency? Here, in truth,
      was the drama staged,&mdash;my drama, had I only been able to realize it.
      The good ship beached, the headhunters hemming us in on all sides, the
      scene prepared for one of those struggles against frightful odds which I
      had so graphically related as an essential part of our adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's roll the cuss in the fancy collar,&rdquo; proposed one of the
      head-hunters,&mdash;meaning me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stove yer slats if yer touch him,&rdquo; said Grits, and then resorted to
      appeal. &ldquo;I s'y, carn't yer stand back and let a chap 'ave a charnst?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head-hunters only jeered. And what shall be said of the Captain in
      this moment of peril? Shall it be told that his heart was beating wildly?&mdash;bumping
      were a better word. He was trying to remember that he was the Captain.
      Otherwise, he must admit with shame that he, too, should have fled. So
      much for romance when the test comes. Will he remain to fall fighting for
      his ship? Like Horatius, he glanced up at the hill, where, instead of the
      porch of the home where he would fain have been, he beheld a wisp of a
      girl standing alone, her hat on the back of her head, her hair flying in
      the wind, gazing intently down at him in his danger. The renegade crew was
      nowhere to be seen. There are those who demand the presence of a woman in
      order to be heroes....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us a chance, can't you?&rdquo; he cried, repeating Grits's appeal in not
      quite such a stentorian tone as he would have liked, while his hand
      trembled on the gunwale. Tom Peters, it must be acknowledged, was much
      more of a buccaneer when it was a question of deeds, for he planted
      himself in the way of the belligerent chief of the head-hunters (who spoke
      with a decided brogue).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of the way!&rdquo; said Tom, with a little squeak in his voice. Yet
      there he was, and he deserves a tribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unlooked-for diversion saved us from annihilation, in the shape of one
      who had a talent for creating them. We were bewilderingly aware of a
      girlish figure amongst us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cowards!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You cowards!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lithe, and fairly quivering with passion, it was Nancy who showed us how
      to face the head-hunters. They gave back. They would have been brave
      indeed if they had not retreated before such an intense little nucleus of
      energy and indignation!...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, give 'em a chanst,&rdquo; said their chief, after a moment.... He even
      helped to push the boat towards the water. But he did not volunteer to be
      one of those to man the Petrel on her maiden voyage. Nor did Logan's pond,
      that wild March day, greatly resemble the South Seas. Nevertheless, my eye
      on Nancy, I stepped proudly aboard and seized an &ldquo;oar.&rdquo; Grits and Tom
      followed,&mdash;when suddenly the Petrel sank considerably below the
      water-line as her builders had estimated it. Ere we fully realized this,
      the now friendly head-hunters had given us a shove, and we were off! The
      Captain, who should have been waving good-bye to his lady love from the
      poop, sat down abruptly,&mdash;the crew likewise; not, however, before she
      had heeled to the scuppers, and a half-bucket of iced water had run it.
      Head-hunters were mere daily episodes in Grits's existence, but water...
      He muttered something in cockney that sounded like a prayer.... The wind
      was rapidly driving us toward the middle of the pond, and something cold
      and ticklish was seeping through the seats of our trousers. We sat like
      statues....
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright scene etched itself in my memory&mdash;the bare brown slopes
      with which the pond was bordered, the Irish shanties, the clothes-lines
      with red flannel shirts snapping in the biting wind; Nancy motionless on
      the bank; the group behind her, silent now, impressed in spite of itself
      at the sight of our intrepidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Petrel was sailing stern first.... Would any of us, indeed, ever see
      home again? I thought of my father's wrath turned to sorrow because he had
      refused to gratify a son's natural wish and present him with a real
      rowboat.... Out of the corners of our eyes we watched the water creeping
      around the gunwale, and the very muddiness of it seemed to enhance its
      coldness, to make the horrors of its depths more mysterious and hideous.
      The voice of Grits startled us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Gawd,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;we're a-going to sink, and I carn't swim! The
      blarsted tar's give way back here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she leaking?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a-filling up like a bath tub,&rdquo; he lamented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly but perceptibly, in truth, the bow was rising, and above the
      whistling of the wind I could hear his chattering as she settled.... Then
      several things happened simultaneously: an agonized cry behind me, distant
      shouts from the shore, a sudden upward lunge of the bow, and the torture
      of being submerged, inch by inch, in the icy, yellow water. Despite the
      splashing behind me, I sat as though paralyzed until I was waist deep and
      the boards turned under me, and then, with a spasmodic contraction of my
      whole being I struck out&mdash;only to find my feet on the muddy bottom.
      Such was the inglorious end of the good ship Petrel! For she went down,
      with all hands, in little more than half a fathom of water.... It was not
      until then I realized that we had been blown clear across the pond!
    </p>
    <p>
      Figures were running along the shore. And as Tom and I emerged dragging
      Grits between us,&mdash;for he might have been drowned there abjectly in
      the shallows,&mdash;we were met by a stout and bare-armed Irishwoman whose
      scanty hair, I remember, was drawn into a tight knot behind her head; and
      who seized us, all three, as though we were a bunch of carrots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along wid ye!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shivering, we followed her up the hill, the spectators of the tragedy, who
      by this time had come around the pond, trailing after. Nancy was not among
      them. Inside the shanty into which we were thrust were two small children
      crawling about the floor, and the place was filled with steam from a
      wash-tub against the wall and a boiler on the stove. With a vigorous
      injunction to make themselves scarce, the Irishwoman slammed the door in
      the faces of the curious and ordered us to remove our clothes. Grits was
      put to bed in a corner, while Tom and I, provided with various garments,
      huddled over the stove. There fell to my lot the red flannel shirt which I
      had seen on the clothes-line. She gave us hot coffee, and was back at her
      wash-tub in no time at all, her entire comment on a proceeding that seemed
      to Tom and me to have certain elements of gravity being, &ldquo;By's will be
      by's!&rdquo; The final ironical touch was given the anti-climax when our rescuer
      turned out to be the mother of the chief of the head-hunters himself! He
      had lingered perforce with his brothers and sister outside the cabin until
      dinner time, and when he came in he was meek as Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the ready hospitality of the poor, which passed over the heads of Tom
      and me as we ate bread and onions and potatoes with a ravenous hunger. It
      must have been about two o'clock in the afternoon when we bade good-bye to
      our preserver and departed for home....
    </p>
    <p>
      At first we went at a dog-trot, but presently slowed down to discuss the
      future looming portentously ahead of us. Since entire concealment was now
      impossible, the question was,&mdash;how complete a confession would be
      necessary? Our cases, indeed, were dissimilar, and Tom's incentive to hold
      back the facts was not nearly so great as mine. It sometimes seemed to me
      in those days unjust that the Peterses were able on the whole to keep out
      of criminal difficulties, in which I was more or less continuously
      involved: for it did not strike me that their sins were not those of the
      imagination. The method of Tom's father was the slipper. He and Tom
      understood each other, while between my father and myself was a great gulf
      fixed. Not that Tom yearned for the slipper; but he regarded its
      occasional applications as being as inevitable as changes in the weather;
      lying did not come easily to him, and left to himself he much preferred to
      confess and have the matter over with. I have already suggested that I had
      cultivated lying, that weapon of the weaker party, in some degree, at
      least, in self-defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was loyal. Moreover, my conviction would probably deprive him for six
      whole afternoons of my company, on which he was more or less dependent.
      But the defence of this case presented unusual difficulties, and we
      stopped several times to thrash them out. We had been absent from dinner,
      and doubtless by this time Julia had informed Tom's mother of the
      expedition, and anyone could see that our clothing had been wet. So I
      lingered in no little anxiety behind the Peters stable while he made the
      investigation. Our spirits rose considerably when he returned to report
      that Julia had unexpectedly been a trump, having quieted his mother by the
      surmise that he was spending the day with his Aunt Fanny. So far, so good.
      The problem now was to decide upon what to admit. For we must both tell
      the same story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed that we had fallen into Logan's Pond from a raft: my
      suggestion. Well, said Tom, the Petrel hadn't proved much better than a
      raft, after all. I was in no mood to defend her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This designation of the Petrel as a &ldquo;raft&rdquo; was my first legal quibble. The
      question to be decided by the court was, What is a raft? just as the
      supreme tribunal of the land has been required, in later years, to decide,
      What is whiskey? The thing to be concealed if possible was the building of
      the &ldquo;raft,&rdquo; although this information was already in the possession of a
      number of persons, whose fathers might at any moment see fit to
      congratulate my own on being the parent of a genius. It was a risk,
      however, that had to be run. And, secondly, since Grits Jarvis was
      contraband, nothing was to be said about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have not said much about my mother, who might have been likened on such
      occasions to a grand jury compelled to indict, yet torn between loyalty to
      an oath and sympathy with the defendant. I went through the Peters yard,
      climbed the wire fence, my object being to discover first from Ella, the
      housemaid, or Hannah, the cook, how much was known in high quarters. It
      was Hannah who, as I opened the kitchen door, turned at the sound, and set
      down the saucepan she was scouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it home ye are? Mercy to goodness!&rdquo; (this on beholding my shrunken
      costume) &ldquo;Glory be to God you're not drownded! and your mother worritin'
      her heart out! So it's into the wather ye were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I admitted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hannah?&rdquo; I said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does mother know&mdash;about the boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't ye be wheedlin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I managed to discover, however, that my mother did not know, and surmised
      that the best reason why she had not been told had to do with Hannah's
      criminal acquiescence concerning the operations in the shed. I ran into
      the front hall and up the stairs, and my mother heard me coming and met me
      on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, where have you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I emerged from the semi-darkness of the stairway she caught sight of my
      dwindled garments, of the trousers well above my ankles. Suddenly she had
      me in her arms and was kissing me passionately. As she stood before me in
      her grey, belted skirt, the familiar red-and-white cameo at her throat,
      her heavy hair parted in the middle, in her eyes was an odd, appealing
      look which I know now was a sign of mother love struggling with a
      Presbyterian conscience. Though she inherited that conscience, I have
      often thought she might have succeeded in casting it off&mdash;or at least
      some of it&mdash;had it not been for the fact that in spite of herself she
      worshipped its incarnation in the shape of my father. Her voice trembled a
      little as she drew me to the sofa beside the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about what happened, my son,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a terrible moment for me. For my affections were still quiveringly
      alive in those days, and I loved her. I had for an instant an instinctive
      impulse to tell her the whole story,&mdash;South Sea Islands and all! And
      I could have done it had I not beheld looming behind her another figure
      which represented a stern and unsympathetic Authority, and somehow made
      her, suddenly, of small account. Not that she would have understood the
      romance, but she would have comprehended me. I knew that she was powerless
      to save me from the wrath to come. I wept. It was because I hated to lie
      to her,&mdash;yet I did so. Fear gripped me, and&mdash;like some
      respectable criminals I have since known&mdash;I understood that any
      confession I made would inexorably be used against me.... I wonder whether
      she knew I was lying? At any rate, the case appeared to be a grave one,
      and I was presently remanded to my room to be held over for trial....
    </p>
    <p>
      Vividly, as I write, I recall the misery of the hours I have spent, while
      awaiting sentence, in the little chamber with the honeysuckle wall-paper
      and steel engravings of happy but dumpy children romping in the fields and
      groves. On this particular March afternoon the weather had become morne,
      as the French say; and I looked down sadly into the grey back yard which
      the wind of the morning had strewn with chips from the Petrel. At last,
      when shadows were gathering in the corners of the room, I heard footsteps.
      Ella appeared, prim and virtuous, yet a little commiserating. My father
      wished to see me, downstairs. It was not the first time she had brought
      that summons, and always her manner was the same!
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene of my trials was always the sitting room, lined with grim books
      in their walnut cases. And my father sat, like a judge, behind the big
      desk where he did his work when at home. Oh, the distance between us at
      such an hour! I entered as delicately as Agag, and the expression in his
      eye seemed to convict me before I could open my mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your mother tells me that you have confessed to going,
      without permission, to Logan's Pond, where you embarked on a raft and fell
      into the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The slight emphasis he contrived to put on the word raft sent a colder
      shiver down my spine than the iced water had done. What did he know? or
      was this mere suspicion? Too late, now, at any rate, to plead guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a sort of a raft, sir,&rdquo; I stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sort of a raft,&rdquo; repeated my father. &ldquo;Where, may I ask, did you find
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn't exactly find it, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said my father. (It was the moment to glance meaningly at the jury.)
      The prisoner gulped. &ldquo;You didn't exactly find it, then. Will you kindly
      explain how you came by it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, we&mdash;I&mdash;put it together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any objection to stating, Hugh, in plain English, that you made
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I suppose you might say that I made it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or that it was intended for a row-boat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was the time to appeal, to force a decision as to what constituted a
      row-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it might be called a row-boat, sir,&rdquo; I said abjectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or that, in direct opposition to my wishes and commands in forbidding you
      to have a boat, to spend your money foolishly and wickedly on a whim, you
      constructed one secretly in the woodshed, took out a part of the back
      partition, thus destroying property that did, not belong to you, and had
      the boat carted this morning to Logan's Pond?&rdquo; I was silent, utterly
      undone. Evidently he had specific information.... There are certain
      expressions that are, at times, more than mere figures of speech, and now
      my father's wrath seemed literally towering. It added visibly to his
      stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that penetrated to the very corners of my
      soul, &ldquo;I utterly fail to understand you. I cannot imagine how a son of
      mine, a son of your mother who is the very soul of truthfulness and honour&mdash;can
      be a liar.&rdquo; (Oh, the terrible emphasis he put on that word!) &ldquo;Nor is it as
      if this were a new tendency&mdash;I have punished you for it before. Your
      mother and I have tried to do our duty by you, to instil into you
      Christian teaching. But it seems wholly useless. I confess that I am at a
      less how to proceed. You seem to have no conscience whatever, no
      conception of what you owe to your parents and your God. You not only
      persistently disregard my wishes and commands, but you have, for many
      months, been leading a double life, facing me every day, while you were
      secretly and continually disobeying me. I shudder to think where this
      determination of yours to have what you desire at any price will lead you
      in the future. It is just such a desire that distinguishes wicked men from
      good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I will not linger upon a scene the very remembrance of which is painful to
      this day.... I went from my father's presence in disgrace, in an agony of
      spirit that was overwhelming, to lock the door of my room and drop face
      downward on the bed, to sob until my muscles twitched. For he had, indeed,
      put into me an awful fear. The greatest horror of my boyish imagination
      was a wicked man. Was I, as he had declared, utterly depraved and doomed
      in spite of myself to be one?
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a knock at my door&mdash;Ella with my supper. I refused to
      open, and sent her away, to fall on my knees in the darkness and pray
      wildly to a God whose attributes and character were sufficiently confused
      in my mind. On the one hand was the stern, despotic Monarch of the
      Westminster Catechism, whom I addressed out of habit, the Father who
      condemned a portion of his children from the cradle. Was I one of those
      who he had decreed before I was born must suffer the tortures of the
      flames of hell? Putting two and two together, what I had learned in Sunday
      school and gathered from parts of Dr. Pound's sermons, and the intimation
      of my father that wickedness was within me, like an incurable disease,&mdash;was
      not mine the logical conclusion? What, then, was the use of praying?... My
      supplications ceased abruptly. And my ever ready imagination, stirred to
      its depths, beheld that awful scene of the last day: the darkness, such as
      sometimes creeps over the city in winter, when the jaundiced smoke falls
      down and we read at noonday by gas-light. I beheld the tortured faces of
      the wicked gathered on the one side, and my mother on the other amongst
      the blessed, gazing across the gulf at me with yearning and compassion.
      Strange that it did not strike me that the sight of the condemned whom
      they had loved in life would have marred if not destroyed the happiness of
      the chosen, about to receive their crowns and harps! What a theology&mdash;that
      made the Creator and Preserver of all mankind thus illogical!

      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although I was imaginative, I was not morbidly introspective, and by the
      end of the first day of my incarceration my interest in that solution had
      waned. At times, however, I actually yearned for someone in whom I could
      confide, who could suggest a solution. I repeat, I would not for worlds
      have asked my father or my mother or Dr. Pound, of whom I had a wholesome
      fear, or perhaps an unwholesome one. Except at morning Bible reading and
      at church my parents never mentioned the name of the Deity, save to
      instruct me formally. Intended or no, the effect of my religious training
      was to make me ashamed of discussing spiritual matters, and naturally I
      failed to perceive that this was because it laid its emphasis on personal
      salvation.... I did not, however, become an unbeliever, for I was not of a
      nature to contemplate with equanimity a godless universe....
    </p>
    <p>
      My sufferings during these series of afternoon confinements did not come
      from remorse, but were the result of a vague sense of injury; and their
      effect was to generate within me a strange motive power, a desire to do
      something that would astound my father and eventually wring from him the
      confession that he had misjudged me. To be sure, I should have to wait
      until early manhood, at least, for the accomplishment of such a coup.
      Might it not be that I was an embryonic literary genius? Many were the
      books I began in this ecstasy of self-vindication, only to abandon them
      when my confinement came to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about this time, I think, that I experienced one of those shocks
      which have a permanent effect upon character. It was then the custom for
      ladies to spend the day with one another, bringing their sewing; and
      sometimes, when I unexpectedly entered the sitting-room, the voices of my
      mother's visitors would drop to a whisper. One afternoon I returned from
      school to pause at the head of the stairs. Cousin Bertha Ewan and Mrs.
      McAlery were discussing with my mother an affair that I judged from the
      awed tone in which they spoke might prove interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Grace,&rdquo; Mrs. McAlery was saying, &ldquo;I imagine she's paid a heavy
      penalty. No man alive will be faithful under those circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stopped at the head of the stairs, with a delicious, guilty feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they ever heard of her?&rdquo; Cousin Bertha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is thought they went to Spain,&rdquo; replied Mrs. McAlery, solemnly, yet
      not without a certain zest. &ldquo;Mr. Jules Hollister will not have her name
      mentioned in his presence, you know. And Whitcomb chased them as far as
      New York with a horse-pistol in his pocket. The report is that he got to
      the dock just as the ship sailed. And then, you know, he went to live
      somewhere out West,&mdash;in Iowa, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he ever get a divorce?&rdquo; Cousin Bertha inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was too good a church member, my dear,&rdquo; my mother reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'd have got one quick enough, church member or no church member,&rdquo;
       declared Cousin Bertha, who had in her elements of daring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I mean for a moment to excuse her,&rdquo; Mrs. McAlery put in, &ldquo;but
      Edward Whitcomb did have a frightful temper, and he was awfully strict
      with her, and he was old enough, anyhow, to be her father. Grace Hollister
      was the last woman in the world I should have suspected of doing so
      hideous a thing. She was so sweet and simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jennings was very attractive,&rdquo; said my Cousin Bertha. &ldquo;I don't think I
      ever saw a handsomer man. Now, if he had looked at me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was never finished, for at this crucial moment I dropped a
      grammar....
    </p>
    <p>
      I had heard enough, however, to excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.
      And that evening, when I came in at five o'clock to study, I asked my
      mother what had become of Gene Hollister's aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went away, Hugh,&rdquo; replied my mother, looking greatly troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is something you are too young to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course I started an investigation, and the next day at school I asked
      the question of Gene Hollister himself, only to discover that he believed
      his aunt to be dead! And that night he asked his mother if his Aunt Grace
      were really alive, after all? Whereupon complications and explanations
      ensued between our parents, of which we saw only the surface signs.... My
      father accused me of eavesdropping (which I denied), and sentenced me to
      an afternoon of solitary confinement for repeating something which I had
      heard in private. I have reason to believe that my mother was also
      reprimanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed that I permitted the matter to rest. In addition
      to Grits Jarvis, there was another contraband among my acquaintances,
      namely, Alec Pound, the scrape-grace son of the Reverend Doctor Pound.
      Alec had an encyclopaedic mind, especially well stocked with the kind of
      knowledge I now desired; first and last he taught me much, which I would
      better have got in another way. To him I appealed and got the story, my
      worst suspicions being confirmed. Mrs. Whitcomb's house had been across
      the alley from that of Mr. Jennings, but no one knew that anything was
      &ldquo;going on,&rdquo; though there had been signals from the windows&mdash;the
      neighbours afterwards remembered....
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened shudderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;they were both married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does that make when you love a woman?&rdquo; Alec replied
      grandly. &ldquo;I could tell you much worse things than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This he proceeded to do. Fascinated, I listened with a sickening
      sensation. It was a mild afternoon in spring, and we stood in the deep
      limestone gutter in front of the parsonage, a little Gothic wooden house
      set in a gloomy yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that people couldn't love any more after they were
      married, except each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alec looked at me pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get over that notion,&rdquo; he assured me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus another ingredient entered my character. Denied its food at home,
      good food, my soul eagerly consumed and made part of itself the fermenting
      stuff that Alec Pound so willing distributed. And it was fermenting stuff.
      Let us see what it did to me. Working slowly but surely, it changed for me
      the dawning mystery of sex into an evil instead of a holy one. The
      knowledge of the tragedy of Grace Hollister started me to seeking
      restlessly, on bookshelves and elsewhere, for a secret that forever eluded
      me, and forever led me on. The word fermenting aptly describes the process
      begun, suggesting as it does something closed up, away from air and
      sunlight, continually working in secret, engendering forces that
      fascinated, yet inspired me with fear. Undoubtedly this secretiveness of
      our elders was due to the pernicious dualism of their orthodox
      Christianity, in which love was carnal and therefore evil, and the flesh
      not the gracious soil of the spirit, but something to be deplored and
      condemned, exorcised and transformed by the miracle of grace. Now love had
      become a terrible power (gripping me) whose enchantment drove men and
      women from home and friends and kindred to the uttermost parts of the
      earth....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before I got to sleep that night after my talk with Alec
      Pound. I alternated between the horror and the romance of the story I had
      heard, supplying for myself the details he had omitted: I beheld the
      signals from the windows, the clandestine meetings, the sudden and
      desperate flight. And to think that all this could have happened in our
      city not five blocks from where I lay!
    </p>
    <p>
      My consternation and horror were concentrated on the man,&mdash;and yet I
      recall a curious bifurcation. Instead of experiencing that automatic
      righteous indignation which my father and mother had felt, which had
      animated old Mr. Jules Hollister when he had sternly forbidden his
      daughter's name to be mentioned in his presence, which had made these
      people outcasts, there welled up within me an intense sympathy and pity.
      By an instinctive process somehow linked with other experiences, I seemed
      to be able to enter into the feelings of these two outcasts, to understand
      the fearful yet fascinating nature of the impulse that had led them to
      elude the vigilance and probity of a world with which I myself was at
      odds. I pictured them in a remote land, shunned by mankind. Was there
      something within me that might eventually draw me to do likewise? The
      desire in me to which my father had referred, which would brook no
      opposition, which twisted and squirmed until it found its way to its
      object? I recalled the words of Jarvis, the carpenter, that if I ever set
      my heart on another man's wife, God help him. God help me!
    </p>
    <p>
      A wicked man! I had never beheld the handsome and fascinating Mr.
      Jennings, but I visualised him now; dark, like all villains, with a black
      moustache and snapping black eyes. He carried a cane. I always associated
      canes with villains. Whereupon I arose, groped for the matches, lighted
      the gas, and gazing at myself in the mirror was a little reassured to find
      nothing sinister in my countenance....
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to my father's faith in a Moral Governor of the Universe was his
      belief in the Tariff and the Republican Party. And this belief, among
      others, he handed on to me. On the cinder playground of the Academy we
      Republicans used to wage, during campaigns, pitched battles for the
      Tariff. It did not take a great deal of courage to be a Republican in our
      city, and I was brought up to believe that Democrats were irrational,
      inferior, and&mdash;with certain exceptions like the Hollisters&mdash;dirty
      beings. There was only one degree lower, and that was to be a mugwump. It
      was no wonder that the Hollisters were Democrats, for they had a queer
      streak in them; owing, no doubt, to the fact that old Mr. Jules
      Hollister's mother had been a Frenchwoman. He looked like a Frenchman, by
      the way, and always wore a skullcap.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember one autumn afternoon having a violent quarrel with Gene
      Hollister that bade fair to end in blows, when he suddenly demanded:&mdash;&ldquo;I'll
      bet you anything you don't know why you're a Republican.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's because I'm for the Tariff,&rdquo; I replied triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his next question floored me. What, for example, was the Tariff? I
      tried to bluster it out, but with no success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo; I cried finally, with sudden inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned out that he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't we darned idiots,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;to get fighting over something we
      don't know anything about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was Gene's French blood, of course. But his question rankled. And how
      was I to know that he would have got as little satisfaction if he had
      hurled it into the marching ranks of those imposing torch-light
      processions which sometimes passed our house at night, with drums beating
      and fifes screaming and torches waving,&mdash;thousands of citizens who
      were for the Tariff for the same reason as I: to wit, because they were
      Republicans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet my father lived and died in the firm belief that the United States of
      America was a democracy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Resolved not to be caught a second time in such a humiliating position by
      a Democrat, I asked my father that night what the Tariff was. But I was
      too young to understand it, he said. I was to take his word for it that
      the country would go to the dogs if the Democrats got in and the Tariff
      were taken away. Here, in a nutshell, though neither he nor I realized it,
      was the political instruction of the marching hordes. Theirs not to reason
      why. I was too young, they too ignorant. Such is the method of Authority!
    </p>
    <p>
      The steel-mills of Mr. Durrett and Mr. Hambleton, he continued, would be
      forced to shut down, and thousands of workmen would starve. This was just
      a sample of what would happen. Prosperity would cease, he declared. That
      word, Prosperity, made a deep impression on me, and I recall the certain
      reverential emphasis he laid on it. And while my solicitude for the
      workmen was not so great as his and Mr. Durrett's, I was concerned as to
      what would happen to us if those twin gods, the Tariff and Prosperity,
      should take their departure from the land. Knowing my love for the good
      things of the table, my father intimated, with a rare humour I failed to
      appreciate, that we should have to live henceforth in spartan simplicity.
      After that, like the intelligent workman, I was firmer than ever for the
      Tariff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the idealistic plane on which&mdash;and from a good man&mdash;I
      received my first political instruction! And for a long time I connected
      the dominance of the Republican Party with the continuation of manna and
      quails, in other words, with nothing that had to do with the spiritual
      welfare of any citizen, but with clothing and food and material comforts.
      My education was progressing....
    </p>
    <p>
      Though my father revered Plato and Aristotle, he did not, apparently, take
      very seriously the contention that that government alone is good &ldquo;which
      seeks to attain the permanent interests of the governed by evolving the
      character of its citizens.&rdquo; To put the matter brutally, politics, despite
      the lofty sentiments on the transparencies in torchlight processions, had
      only to do with the belly, not the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Politics and government, one perceives, had nothing to do with religion,
      nor education with any of these. A secularized and disjointed world! Our
      leading citizens, learned in the classics though some of them might be,
      paid no heed to the dictum of the Greek idealist, who was more practical
      than they would have supposed. &ldquo;The man who does not carry his city within
      his heart is a spiritual starveling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One evening, a year or two after that tariff campaign, I was pretending to
      study my lessons under the student lamp in the sitting-room while my
      mother sewed and my father wrote at his desk, when there was a ring at the
      door-bell. I welcomed any interruption, even though the visitor proved to
      be only the druggist's boy; and there was always the possibility of a
      telegram announcing, for instance, the death of a relative. Such had once
      been the case when my Uncle Avery Paret had died in New York, and I was
      taken out of school for a blissful four days for the funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went tiptoeing into the hall and peeped over the banisters while Ella
      opened the door. I heard a voice which I recognized as that of Perry
      Blackwood's father asking for Mr. Paret; and then to my astonishment, I
      saw filing after him into the parlour some ten or twelve persons. With the
      exception of Mr. Ogilvy, who belonged to one of our old families, and Mr.
      Watling, a lawyer who had married the youngest of Gene Hollister's aunts,
      the visitors entered stealthily, after the manner of burglars; some of
      these were heavy-jowled, and all had an air of mystery that raised my
      curiosity and excitement to the highest pitch. I caught hold of Ella as
      she came up the stairs, but she tore herself free, and announced to my
      father that Mr. Josiah Blackwood and other gentlemen had asked to see him.
      My father seemed puzzled as he went downstairs.... A long interval
      elapsed, during which I did not make even a pretence of looking at my
      arithmetic. At times the low hum of voices rose to what was almost an
      uproar, and on occasions I distinguished a marked Irish brogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what they want?&rdquo; said my mother, nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we heard the front door shut behind them, and my father came
      upstairs, his usually serene face wearing a disturbed expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who in the world was it, Mr. Paret?&rdquo; asked my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father sat down in the arm-chair. He was clearly making an effort for
      self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blackwood and Ogilvy and Watling and some city politicians,&rdquo; he
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Politicians!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;What did they want? That is, if it's
      anything you can tell me,&rdquo; she added apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wished me to be the Republican candidate for the mayor of this
      city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This tremendous news took me off my feet. My father mayor!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you didn't consider it, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; my mother was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider it!&rdquo; he echoed reprovingly. &ldquo;I can't imagine what Ogilvy and
      Watling and Josiah Blackwood were thinking of! They are out of their
      heads. I as much as told them so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was more than I could bear, for I had already pictured myself telling
      the news to envious schoolmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father, why didn't you take it?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, when he turned to me, he had regained his usual expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you're talking about, Hugh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Accept a
      political office! That sort of thing is left to politicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which he spoke warned me that a continuation of the
      conversation would be unwise, and my mother also understood that the
      discussion was closed. He went back to his desk, and began writing again
      as though nothing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, I was left in a palpitating state of excitement which my
      father's self-control or sang-froid only served to irritate and enhance,
      and my head was fairly spinning as, covertly, I watched his pen steadily
      covering the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      How could he&mdash;how could any man of flesh and blood sit down calmly
      after having been offered the highest honour in the gift of his community!
      And he had spurned it as if Mr. Blackwood and the others had gratuitously
      insulted him! And how was it, if my father so revered the Republican Party
      that he would not suffer it to be mentioned slightingly in his presence,
      that he had refused contemptuously to be its mayor?...
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day at school, however, I managed to let it be known that the
      offer had been made and declined. After all, this seemed to make my father
      a bigger man than if he had accepted it. Naturally I was asked why he had
      declined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wouldn't take it,&rdquo; I replied scornfully. &ldquo;Office-holding should be
      left to politicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ralph Hambleton, with his precocious and cynical knowledge of the world,
      minimized my triumph by declaring that he would rather be his grandfather,
      Nathaniel Durrett, than the mayor of the biggest city in the country.
      Politicians, he said, were bloodsuckers and thieves, and the only reason
      for holding office was that it enabled one to steal the taxpayers'
      money....
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have intimated, my vision of a future literary career waxed and
      waned, but a belief that I was going to be Somebody rarely deserted me. If
      not a literary lion, what was that Somebody to be? Such an environment as
      mine was woefully lacking in heroic figures to satisfy the romantic soul.
      In view of the experience I have just related, it is not surprising that
      the notion of becoming a statesman did not appeal to me; nor is it to be
      wondered at, despite the somewhat exaggerated respect and awe in which
      Ralph's grandfather was held by my father and other influential persons,
      that I failed to be stirred by the elements of greatness in the grim
      personality of our first citizen, the iron-master. For he possessed such
      elements. He lived alone in Ingrain Street in an uncompromising mansion I
      always associated with the Sabbath, not only because I used to be taken
      there on decorous Sunday visits by my father, but because it was the very
      quintessence of Presbyterianism. The moment I entered its &ldquo;portals&rdquo;&mdash;as
      Mr. Hawthorne appropriately would have called them&mdash;my spirit was
      overwhelmed and suffocated by its formality and orderliness. Within its
      stern walls Nathaniel Durrett had made a model universe of his own, such
      as the Deity of the Westminster Confession had no doubt meant his greater
      one to be if man had not rebelled and foiled him.... It was a world from
      which I was determined to escape at any cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      My father and I were always ushered into the gloomy library, with its high
      ceiling, with its long windows that reached almost to the rococo cornice,
      with its cold marble mantelpiece that reminded me of a tombstone, with its
      interminable book shelves filled with yellow bindings. On the centre
      table, in addition to a ponderous Bible, was one of those old-fashioned
      carafes of red glass tipped with blue surmounted by a tumbler of blue
      tipped with red. Behind this table Mr. Durrett sat reading a volume of
      sermons, a really handsome old man in his black tie and pleated shirt;
      tall and spare, straight as a ramrod, with a finely moulded head and
      straight nose and sinewy hands the colour of mulberry stain. He called my
      father by his first name, an immense compliment, considering how few dared
      to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Matthew,&rdquo; the old man would remark, after they had discussed Dr.
      Pound's latest flight on the nature of the Trinity or the depravity of
      man, or horticulture, or the Republican Party, &ldquo;do you have any better
      news of Hugh at school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret to say, Mr. Durrett,&rdquo; my father would reply, &ldquo;that he does not
      yet seem to be aroused to a sense of his opportunities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Mr. Durrett would gimble me with a blue eye that lurked beneath
      grizzled brows, quite as painful a proceeding as if he used an iron tool.
      I almost pity myself when I think of what a forlorn stranger I was in
      their company. They two, indeed, were of one kind, and I of another sort
      who could never understand them,&mdash;nor they me. To what depths of
      despair they reduced me they never knew, and yet they were doing it all
      for my good! They only managed to convince me that my love of folly was
      ineradicable, and that I was on my way head first for perdition. I always
      looked, during these excruciating and personal moments, at the coloured
      glass bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It grieves me to hear it, Hugh,&rdquo; Mr. Durrett invariably declared. &ldquo;You'll
      never come to any good without study. Now when I was your age...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I knew his history by heart, a common one in this country, although he
      made an honourable name instead of a dishonourable one. And when I
      contrast him with those of his successors whom I was to know later...! But
      I shall not anticipate. American genius had not then evolved the false
      entry method of overcapitalization. A thrilling history, Mr. Durrett's,
      could I but have entered into it. I did not reflect then that this stern
      old man must have throbbed once; nay, fire and energy still remained in
      his bowels, else he could not have continued to dominate a city. Nor did
      it occur to me that the great steel-works that lighted the southern sky
      were the result of a passion, of dreams similar to those possessing me,
      but which I could not express. He had founded a family whose position was
      virtually hereditary, gained riches which for those days were great,
      compelled men to speak his name with a certain awe. But of what use were
      such riches as his when his religion and morality compelled him to banish
      from him all the joys in the power of riches to bring?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I didn't want to be an iron-master. But it may have been about this
      time that I began to be impressed with the power of wealth, the adulation
      and reverence it commanded, the importance in which it clothed all who
      shared in it....
    </p>
    <p>
      The private school I attended in the company of other boys with whom I was
      brought up was called Densmore Academy, a large, square building of a then
      hideous modernity, built of smooth, orange-red bricks with threads of
      black mortar between them. One reads of happy school days, yet I fail to
      recall any really happy hours spent there, even in the yard, which was
      covered with black cinders that cut you when you fell. I think of it as a
      penitentiary, and the memory of the barred lower windows gives substance
      to this impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose I learned something during the seven years of my incarceration.
      All of value, had its teachers known anything of youthful psychology, of
      natural bent, could have been put into me in three. At least four
      criminally wasted years, to say nothing of the benumbing and desiccating
      effect of that old system of education! Chalk and chalk-dust! The
      Mediterranean a tinted portion of the map, Italy a man's boot which I drew
      painfully, with many yawns; history no glorious epic revealing as it
      unrolls the Meaning of Things, no revelation of that wondrous distillation
      of the Spirit of man, but an endless marching and counter-marching up and
      down the map, weary columns of figures to be learned by rote instantly to
      be forgotten again. &ldquo;On June the 7th General So-and-so proceeded with his
      whole army&mdash;&rdquo; where? What does it matter? One little chapter of
      Carlyle, illuminated by a teacher of understanding, were worth a million
      such text-books. Alas, for the hatred of Virgil! &ldquo;Paret&rdquo; (a shiver),
      &ldquo;begin at the one hundred and thirtieth line and translate!&rdquo; I can hear
      myself droning out in detestable English a meaningless portion of that
      endless journey of the pious AEneas; can see Gene Hollister, with
      heart-rending glances of despair, stumbling through Cornelius Nepos in an
      unventilated room with chalk-rubbed blackboards and heavy odours of ink
      and stale lunch. And I graduated from Densmore Academy, the best school in
      our city, in the 80's, without having been taught even the rudiments of
      citizenship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowledge was presented to us as a corpse, which bit by bit we painfully
      dissected. We never glimpsed the living, growing thing, never experienced
      the Spirit, the same spirit that was able magically to waft me from a
      wintry Lyme Street to the South Seas, the energizing, electrifying Spirit
      of true achievement, of life, of God himself. Little by little its flames
      were smothered until in manhood there seemed no spark of it left alive.
      Many years were to pass ere it was to revive again, as by a miracle. I
      travelled. Awakening at dawn, I saw, framed in a port-hole, rose-red
      Seriphos set in a living blue that paled the sapphire; the seas Ulysses
      had sailed, and the company of the Argonauts. My soul was steeped in
      unimagined colour, and in the memory of one rapturous instant is gathered
      what I was soon to see of Greece, is focussed the meaning of history,
      poetry and art. I was to stand one evening in spring on the mound where
      heroes sleep and gaze upon the plain of Marathon between darkening
      mountains and the blue thread of the strait peaceful now, flushed with
      pink and white blossoms of fruit and almond trees; to sit on the
      cliff-throne whence a Persian King had looked down upon a Salamis fought
      and lost.... In that port-hole glimpse a Themistocles was revealed, a
      Socrates, a Homer and a Phidias, an AEschylus, and a Pericles; yes, and a
      John brooding Revelations on his sea-girt rock as twilight falls over the
      waters....
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw the Roman Empire, that Scarlet Woman whose sands were dyed crimson
      with blood to appease her harlotry, whose ships were laden with treasures
      from the immutable East, grain from the valley of the Nile, spices from
      Arabia, precious purple stuffs from Tyre, tribute and spoil, slaves and
      jewels from conquered nations she absorbed; and yet whose very emperors
      were the unconscious instruments of a Progress they wot not of, preserved
      to the West by Marathon and Salamis. With Caesar's legions its message
      went forth across Hispania to the cliffs of the wild western ocean,
      through Hercynian forests to tribes that dwelt where great rivers roll up
      their bars by misty, northern seas, and even to Celtic fastnesses beyond
      the Wall....

    <h2>
      IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In and out of my early memories like a dancing ray of sunlight flits the
      spirit of Nancy. I was always fond of her, but in extreme youth I accepted
      her incense with masculine complacency and took her allegiance for
      granted, never seeking to fathom the nature of the spell I exercised over
      her. Naturally other children teased me about her; but what was worse,
      with that charming lack of self-consciousness and consideration for what
      in after life are called the finer feelings, they teased her about me
      before me, my presence deterring them not at all. I can see them hopping
      around her in the Peters yard crying out:&mdash;&ldquo;Nancy's in love with
      Hugh! Nancy's in love with Hugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sufficiently thrilling pastime, this, for Nancy could take care of
      herself. I was a bungler beside her when it came to retaliation, and not
      the least of her attractions for me was her capacity for anger: fury would
      be a better term. She would fly at them&mdash;even as she flew at the
      head-hunters when the Petrel was menaced; and she could run like a deer.
      Woe to the unfortunate victim she overtook! Masculine strength, exercised
      apologetically, availed but little, and I have seen Russell Peters and
      Gene Hollister retire from such encounters humiliated and weeping. She
      never caught Ralph; his methods of torture were more intelligent and
      subtle than Gene's and Russell's, but she was his equal when it came to a
      question of tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what's the matter with you, Ralph Hambleton,&rdquo; she would say.
      &ldquo;You're jealous.&rdquo; An accusation that invariably put him on the defensive.
      &ldquo;You think all the girls are in love with you, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These scenes I found somewhat embarrassing. Not so Nancy. After
      discomfiting her tormenters, or wounding and scattering them, she would
      return to my side.... In spite of her frankly expressed preference for me
      she had an elusiveness that made a continual appeal to my imagination. She
      was never obvious or commonplace, and long before I began to experience
      the discomforts and sufferings of youthful love I was fascinated by a
      nature eloquent with contradictions and inconsistencies. She was a tomboy,
      yet her own sex was enhanced rather than overwhelmed by contact with the
      other: and no matter how many trees she climbed she never seemed to lose
      her daintiness. It was innate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could, at times, be surprisingly demure. These impressions of her
      daintiness and demureness are particularly vivid in a picture my memory
      has retained of our walking together, unattended, to Susan Blackwood's
      birthday party. She must have been about twelve years old. It was the
      first time I had escorted her or any other girl to a party; Mrs. Willett
      had smiled over the proceeding, but Nancy and I took it most seriously, as
      symbolic of things to come. I can see Powell Street, where Nancy lived, at
      four o'clock on a mild and cloudy December afternoon, the decorous,
      retiring houses, Nancy on one side of the pavement by the iron fences and
      I on the other by the tree boxes. I can't remember her dress, only the
      exquisite sense of her slimness and daintiness comes back to me, of her
      dark hair in a long braid tied with a red ribbon, of her slender legs clad
      in black stockings of shining silk. We felt the occasion to be somehow too
      significant, too eloquent for words....
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence we climbed the flight of stone steps that led up to the
      Blackwood mansion, when suddenly the door was opened, letting out sounds
      of music and revelry. Mr. Blackwood's coloured butler, Ned, beamed at us
      hospitably, inviting us to enter the brightness within. The shades were
      drawn, the carpets were covered with festal canvas, the folding doors
      between the square rooms were flung back, the prisms of the big
      chandeliers flung their light over animated groups of matrons and
      children. Mrs. Watling, the mother of the Watling twins&mdash;too young to
      be present was directing with vivacity the game of &ldquo;King William was King
      James's son,&rdquo; and Mrs. McAlery was playing the piano.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Now choose you East, now choose you West,
        Now choose the one you love the best!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Tom Peters, in a velvet suit and consequently very miserable, refused to
      embrace Ethel Hollister; while the scornful Julia lurked in a corner:
      nothing would induce her to enter such a foolish game. I experienced a
      novel discomfiture when Ralph kissed Nancy.... Afterwards came the feast,
      from which Ham Durrett, in a pink paper cap with streamers, was at length
      forcibly removed by his mother. Thus early did he betray his love for the
      flesh pots....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until I was sixteen that a player came and touched the keys of
      my soul, and it awoke, bewildered, at these first tender notes. The music
      quickened, tripping in ecstasy, to change by subtle phrases into themes of
      exquisite suffering hitherto unexperienced. I knew that I loved Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the advent of longer dresses that reached to her shoe tops a change
      had come over her. The tomboy, the willing camp-follower who loved me and
      was unashamed, were gone forever, and a mysterious, transfigured being,
      neither girl nor woman, had magically been evolved. Could it be possible
      that she loved me still? My complacency had vanished; suddenly I had
      become the aggressor, if only I had known how to &ldquo;aggress&rdquo;; but in her
      presence I was seized by an accursed shyness that paralyzed my tongue, and
      the things I had planned to say were left unuttered. It was something&mdash;though
      I did not realize it&mdash;to be able to feel like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time came when I could no longer keep this thing to myself. The need
      of an outlet, of a confidant, became imperative, and I sought out Tom
      Peters. It was in February; I remember because I had ventured&mdash;with
      incredible daring&mdash;to send Nancy an elaborate, rosy Valentine;
      written on the back of it in a handwriting all too thinly disguised was
      the following verse, the triumphant result of much hard thinking in school
      hours:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Should you of this the sender guess
          Without another sign,
          Would you repent, and rest content
          To be his Valentine
</pre>
    <p>
      I grew hot and cold by turns when I thought of its possible effects on my
      chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of those useless, slushy afternoons, I took Tom for a walk that led
      us, as dusk came on, past Nancy's house. Only by painful degrees did I
      succeed in overcoming my bashfulness; but Tom, when at last I had blurted
      out the secret, was most sympathetic, although the ailment from which I
      suffered was as yet outside of the realm of his experience. I have used
      the word &ldquo;ailment&rdquo; advisedly, since he evidently put my trouble in the
      same category with diphtheria or scarlet fever, remarking that it was
      &ldquo;darned hard luck.&rdquo; In vain I sought to explain that I did not regard it
      as such in the least; there was suffering, I admitted, but a degree of
      bliss none could comprehend who had not felt it. He refused to be envious,
      or at least to betray envy; yet he was curious, asking many questions, and
      I had reason to think before we parted that his admiration for me was
      increased. Was it possible that he, too, didn't love Nancy? No, it was
      funny, but he didn't. He failed to see much in girls: his tone remained
      commiserating, yet he began to take an interest in the progress of my
      suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time I had no progress to report. Out of consideration for those
      members of our weekly dancing class whose parents were Episcopalians the
      meetings were discontinued during Lent, and to call would have demanded a
      courage not in me; I should have become an object of ridicule among my
      friends and I would have died rather than face Nancy's mother and the
      members of her household. I set about making ingenious plans with a view
      to encounters that might appear casual. Nancy's school was dismissed at
      two, so was mine. By walking fast I could reach Salisbury Street, near St.
      Mary's Seminary for Young Ladies, in time to catch her, but even then for
      many days I was doomed to disappointment. She was either in company with
      other girls, or else she had taken another route; this I surmised led past
      Sophy McAlery's house, and I enlisted Tom as a confederate. He was to make
      straight for the McAlery's on Elm while I followed Powell, two short
      blocks away, and if Nancy went to Sophy's and left there alone he was to
      announce the fact by a preconcerted signal. Through long and persistent
      practice he had acquired a whistle shrill enough to wake the dead,
      accomplished by placing a finger of each hand between his teeth;&mdash;a
      gift that was the envy of his acquaintances, and the subject of much
      discussion as to whether his teeth were peculiar. Tom insisted that they
      were; it was an added distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion he came up behind Nancy as she was leaving Sophy's gate
      and immediately sounded the alarm. She leaped in the air, dropped her
      school-books and whirled on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom Peters! How dare you frighten me so!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom regarded her in sudden dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn't mean to,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn't think you were so near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must have seen me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't paying much attention,&rdquo; he equivocated,&mdash;a remark not
      calculated to appease her anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why were you doing it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just practising,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Practising!&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy, scornfully. &ldquo;I shouldn't think you needed
      to practise that any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've done it louder,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seized his hands, snatching them away from his lips. At this critical
      moment I appeared around the corner considerably out of breath, my heart
      beating like a watchman's rattle. I tried to feign nonchalance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Tom,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Hello, Nancy. What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Tom&mdash;he frightened me out of my senses.&rdquo; Dropping his wrists,
      she gave me a most disconcerting look; there was in it the suspicion of a
      smile. &ldquo;What are you doing here, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard Tom,&rdquo; I explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you might have. Where were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over in another street,&rdquo; I answered, with deliberate vagueness. Nancy had
      suddenly become demure. I did not dare look at her, but I had a most
      uncomfortable notion that she suspected the plot. Meanwhile we had begun
      to walk along, all three of us, Tom, obviously ill at ease and
      discomfited, lagging a little behind. Just before we reached the corner I
      managed to kick him. His departure was by no means graceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to go;&rdquo; he announced abruptly, and turned down the side street.
      We watched his sturdy figure as it receded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of all queer boys!&rdquo; said Nancy, and we walked on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's my best friend,&rdquo; I replied warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't seem to care much for your company,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they have dinner at half past two,&rdquo; I explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you afraid of missing yours, Hugh?&rdquo; she asked wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got time. I'd&mdash;I'd rather be with you.&rdquo; After making which
      audacious remark I was seized by a spasm of apprehension. But nothing
      happened. Nancy remained demure. She didn't remind me that I had reflected
      upon Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nice of you, Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not saying it because it's nice,&rdquo; I faltered. &ldquo;I'd rather be with
      you than&mdash;with anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was indeed the acme of daring. I couldn't believe I had actually said
      it. But again I received no rebuke; instead came a remark that set me
      palpitating, that I treasured for many weeks to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a very nice valentine,&rdquo; she informed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it like?&rdquo; I asked thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, beautiful! All pink lace and&mdash;and Cupids, and the picture of a
      young man and a young woman in a garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, there was a verse, in the oddest handwriting. I wonder who sent
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Ralph,&rdquo; I hazarded ecstatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph couldn't write poetry,&rdquo; she replied disdainfully. &ldquo;Besides, it was
      very good poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I suggested other possible authors and admirers. She rejected them all. We
      reached her gate, and I lingered. As she looked down at me from the stone
      steps her eyes shone with a soft light that filled me with radiance, and
      into her voice had come a questioning, shy note that thrilled the more
      because it revealed a new Nancy of whom I had not dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I'll meet you again&mdash;coming from school,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You'll be late to dinner, Hugh, if you don't
      go....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was late, and unable to eat much dinner, somewhat to my mother's alarm.
      Love had taken away my appetite.... After dinner, when I was wandering
      aimlessly about the yard, Tom appeared on the other side of the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ever ask me to do that again,&rdquo; he said gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did meet Nancy again coming from school, not every day, but nearly every
      day. At first we pretended that there was no arrangement in this, and we
      both feigned surprise when we encountered one another. It was Nancy who
      possessed the courage that I lacked. One afternoon she said:&mdash;&ldquo;I
      think I'd better walk with the girls to-morrow, Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I protested, but she was firm. And after that it was an understood thing
      that on certain days I should go directly home, feeling like an exile.
      Sophy McAlery had begun to complain: and I gathered that Sophy was Nancy's
      confidante. The other girls had begun to gossip. It was Nancy who
      conceived the brilliant idea&mdash;the more delightful because she said
      nothing about it to me&mdash;of making use of Sophy. She would leave
      school with Sophy, and I waited on the corner near the McAlery house. Poor
      Sophy! She was always of those who piped while others danced. In those
      days she had two straw-coloured pigtails, and her plain, faithful face is
      before me as I write. She never betrayed to me the excitement that filled
      her at being the accomplice of our romance.
    </p>

      Gossip raged, of course. Far from being disturbed, we used it, so to
      speak, as a handle for our love-making, which was carried on in an
      inferential rather than a direct fashion. Were they saying that we were
      lovers? Delightful! We laughed at one another in the sunshine.... At last
      we achieved the great adventure of a clandestine meeting and went for a
      walk in the afternoon, avoiding the houses of our friends. I've forgotten
      which of us had the boldness to propose it. The crocuses and tulips had
      broken the black mould, the flower beds in the front yards were beginning
      to blaze with scarlet and yellow, the lawns had turned a living green.
      What did we talk about? The substance has vanished, only the flavour
      remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      One awoke of a morning to the twittering of birds, to walk to school
      amidst delicate, lace-like shadows of great trees acloud with old gold:
      the buds lay curled like tiny feathers on the pavements. Suddenly the
      shade was dense, the sunlight white and glaring, the odour of lilacs heavy
      in the air, spring in all its fulness had come,&mdash;spring and Nancy.
      Just so subtly, yet with the same seeming suddenness had budded and come
      to leaf and flower a perfect understanding, which nevertheless remained
      undefined. This, I had no doubt, was my fault, and due to the
      incomprehensible shyness her presence continued to inspire. Although we
      did not altogether abandon our secret trysts, we began to meet in more
      natural ways; there were garden parties and picnics where we strayed
      together through the woods and fields, pausing to tear off, one by one,
      the petals of a daisy, &ldquo;She loves me, she loves me not.&rdquo; I never ventured
      to kiss her; I always thought afterwards I might have done so, she had
      seemed so willing, her eyes had shone so expectantly as I sat beside her
      on the grass; nor can I tell why I desired to kiss her save that this was
      the traditional thing to do to the lady one loved. To be sure, the very
      touch of her hand was galvanic. Paradoxically, I saw the human side of
      her, the yielding gentleness that always amazed me, yet I never overcame
      my awe of the divine; she was a being sacrosanct. Whether this idealism
      were innate or the result of such romances as I had read I cannot say....
      I got, indeed, an avowal of a sort. The weekly dancing classes having
      begun again, on one occasion when she had waltzed twice with Gene
      Hollister I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be silly, Hugh,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Of course I like you better than
      anyone else&mdash;you ought to know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We never got to the word &ldquo;love,&rdquo; but we knew the feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      One cloud alone flung its shadow across these idyllic days. Before I was
      fully aware of it I had drawn very near to the first great junction-point
      of my life, my graduation from Densmore Academy. We were to &ldquo;change cars,&rdquo;
       in the language of Principal Haime. Well enough for the fortunate ones who
      were to continue the academic journey, which implied a postponement of the
      serious business of life; but month after month of the last term had
      passed without a hint from my father that I was to change cars. Again and
      again I almost succeeded in screwing up my courage to the point of
      mentioning college to him,&mdash;never quite; his manner, though kind and
      calm, somehow strengthened my suspicion that I had been judged and found
      wanting, and doomed to &ldquo;business&rdquo;: galley slavery, I deemed it, humdrum,
      prosaic, degrading! When I thought of it at night I experienced almost a
      frenzy of self-pity. My father couldn't intend to do that, just because my
      monthly reports hadn't always been what he thought they ought to be! Gene
      Hollister's were no better, if as good, and he was going to Princeton. Was
      I, Hugh Paret, to be denied the distinction of being a college man, the
      delights of university existence, cruelly separated and set apart from my
      friends whom I loved! held up to the world and especially to Nancy Willett
      as good for nothing else! The thought was unbearable. Characteristically,
      I hoped against hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have mentioned garden parties. One of our annual institutions was Mrs.
      Willett's children's party in May; for the Willett house had a garden that
      covered almost a quarter of a block. Mrs. Willett loved children, the
      greatest regret of her life being that providence had denied her a large
      family. As far back as my memory goes she had been something of an
      invalid; she had a sweet, sad face, and delicate hands so thin as to seem
      almost transparent; and she always sat in a chair under the great tree on
      the lawn, smiling at us as we soared to dizzy heights in the swing, or
      played croquet, or scurried through the paths, and in and out of the
      latticed summer-house with shrieks of laughter and terror. It all ended
      with a feast at a long table made of sawhorses and boards covered with a
      white cloth, and when the cake was cut there was wild excitement as to who
      would get the ring and who the thimble.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were more decorous, or rather more awkward now, and the party began
      with a formal period when the boys gathered in a group and pretended
      indifference to the girls. The girls were cleverer at it, and actually
      achieved the impression that they were indifferent. We kept an eye on
      them, uneasily, while we talked. To be in Nancy's presence and not alone
      with Nancy was agonizing, and I wondered at a sang-froid beyond my power
      to achieve, accused her of coldness, my sufferings being the greater
      because she seemed more beautiful, daintier, more irreproachable than I
      had ever seen her. Even at that early age she gave evidence of the social
      gift, and it was due to her efforts that we forgot our best clothes and
      our newly born self-consciousness. When I begged her to slip away with me
      among the currant bushes she whispered:&mdash;&ldquo;I can't, Hugh. I'm the
      hostess, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had gone there in a flutter of anticipation, but nothing went right that
      day. There was dancing in the big rooms that looked out on the garden; the
      only girl with whom I cared to dance was Nancy, and she was busy finding
      partners for the backward members of both sexes; though she was my
      partner, to be sure, when it all wound up with a Virginia reel on the
      lawn. Then, at supper, to cap the climax of untoward incidents, an
      animated discussion was begun as to the relative merits of the various
      colleges, the girls, too, taking sides. Mac Willett, Nancy's cousin, was
      going to Yale, Gene Hollister to Princeton, the Ewan boys to our State
      University, while Perry Blackwood and Ralph Hambleton and Ham Durrett were
      destined for Harvard; Tom Peters, also, though he was not to graduate from
      the Academy for another year. I might have known that Ralph would have
      suspected my misery. He sat triumphantly next to Nancy herself, while I
      had been told off to entertain the faithful Sophy. Noticing my silence, he
      demanded wickedly:&mdash;&ldquo;Where are you going, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harvard, I think,&rdquo; I answered with as bold a front as I could muster. &ldquo;I
      haven't talked it over with my father yet.&rdquo; It was intolerable to admit
      that I of them all was to be left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy looked at me in surprise. She was always downright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh, doesn't your father mean to put you in business?&rdquo; she
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hot flush spread over my face. Even to her I had not betrayed my
      apprehensions on this painful subject. Perhaps it was because of this very
      reason, knowing me as she did, that she had divined my fate. Could my
      father have spoken of it to anyone?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; I said angrily. I wondered if she knew how deeply
      she had hurt me. The others laughed. The colour rose in Nancy's cheeks,
      and she gave me an appealing, almost tearful look, but my heart had
      hardened. As soon as supper was over I left the table to wander, nursing
      my wrongs, in a far corner of the garden, gay shouts and laughter still
      echoing in my ears. I was negligible, even my pathetic subterfuge had been
      detected and cruelly ridiculed by these friends whom I had always loved
      and sought out, and who now were so absorbed in their own prospects and
      happiness that they cared nothing for mine. And Nancy! I had been betrayed
      by Nancy!... Twilight was coming on. I remember glancing down miserably at
      the new blue suit I had put on so hopefully for the first time that
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separating the garden from the street was a high, smooth board fence with
      a little gate in it, and I had my hand on the latch when I heard the sound
      of hurrying steps on the gravel path and a familiar voice calling my name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh! Hugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned. Nancy stood before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, you're not going!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't know, there's no use telling you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just because I said your father intended to put you in business! Oh,
      Hugh, why are you so foolish and so proud? Do you suppose that anyone&mdash;that
      I&mdash;think any the worse of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she had read me, she alone had entered into the source of that
      prevarication, the complex feelings from which it sprang. But at that
      moment I could not forgive her for humiliating me. I hugged my grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was true, what I said,&rdquo; I declared hotly. &ldquo;My father has not spoken.
      It is true that I'm going to college, because I'll make it true. I may not
      go this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood staring in sheer surprise at sight of my sudden, quivering
      passion. I think the very intensity of it frightened her. And then,
      without more ado, I opened the gate and was gone....
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, though I did not realize it, my journey into a Far Country was
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The misery that followed this incident had one compensating factor.
      Although too late to electrify Densmore and Principal Haime with my
      scholarship, I was determined to go to college now, somehow, sometime. I
      would show my father, these companions of mine, and above all Nancy
      herself the stuff of which I was made, compel them sooner or later to
      admit that they had misjudged me. I had been possessed by similar
      resolutions before, though none so strong, and they had a way of sinking
      below the surface of my consciousness, only to rise again and again until
      by sheer pressure they achieved realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet I might have returned to Nancy if something had not occurred which I
      would have thought unbelievable: she began to show a marked preference for
      Ralph Hambleton. At first I regarded this affair as the most obvious of
      retaliations. She, likewise, had pride. Gradually, however, a feeling of
      uneasiness crept over me: as pretence, her performance was altogether too
      realistic; she threw her whole soul into it, danced with Ralph as often as
      she had ever danced with me, took walks with him, deferred to his opinions
      until, in spite of myself, I became convinced that the preference was
      genuine. I was a curious mixture of self-confidence and self-depreciation,
      and never had his superiority seemed more patent than now. His air of
      satisfaction was maddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      How well I remember his triumph on that hot, June morning of our
      graduation from Densmore, a triumph he had apparently achieved without
      labour, and which he seemed to despise. A fitful breeze blew through the
      chapel at the top of the building; we, the graduates, sat in two rows next
      to the platform, and behind us the wooden benches nicked by many knives&mdash;were
      filled with sisters and mothers and fathers, some anxious, some proud and
      some sad. So brief a span, like that summer's day, and youth was gone!
      Would the time come when we, too, should sit by the waters of Babylon and
      sigh for it? The world was upside down.
    </p>
    <p>
      We read the one hundred and third psalm. Then Principal Haime, in his long
      &ldquo;Prince Albert&rdquo; and a ridiculously inadequate collar that emphasized his
      scrawny neck, reminded us of the sacred associations we had formed, of the
      peculiar responsibilities that rested on us, who were the privileged of
      the city. &ldquo;We had crossed to-day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an invisible threshold. Some
      were to go on to higher institutions of learning. Others...&rdquo; I gulped.
      Quoting the Scriptures, he complimented those who had made the most of
      their opportunities. And it was then that he called out, impressively, the
      name of Ralph Forrester Hambleton. Summa cum laude! Suddenly I was seized
      with passionate, vehement regrets at the sound of the applause. I might
      have been the prize scholar, instead of Ralph, if I had only worked, if I
      had only realized what this focussing day of graduation meant! I might
      have been a marked individual, with people murmuring words of admiration,
      of speculation concerning the brilliancy of my future!... When at last my
      name was called and I rose to receive my diploma it seemed as though my
      incompetency had been proclaimed to the world...
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening I stood in the narrow gallery of the flag-decked gymnasium
      and watched Nancy dancing with Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      I let her go without protest or reproach. A mysterious lesion seemed to
      have taken place, I felt astonished and relieved, yet I was heavy with
      sadness. My emancipation had been bought at a price. Something hitherto
      spontaneous, warm and living was withering within me.

    <p>
      It was true to my father's character that he should have waited until the
      day after graduation to discuss my future, if discussion be the proper
      word. The next evening at supper he informed me that he wished to talk to
      me in the sitting-room, whither I followed him with a sinking heart. He
      seated himself at his desk, and sat for a moment gazing at me with a
      curious and benumbing expression, and then the blow fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, I have spoken to your Cousin Robert Breck about you, and he has
      kindly consented to give you a trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give me a trial, sir!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To employ you at a small but reasonable salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could find no words to express my dismay. My dreams had come to this,
      that I was to be made a clerk in a grocery store! The fact that it was a
      wholesale grocery store was little consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But father,&rdquo; I faltered, &ldquo;I don't want to go into business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The sharpness of the exclamation might have betrayed to me the pain
      in which he was, but he recovered himself instantly. And I could see
      nothing but an inexorable justice closing in on me mechanically; a blind
      justice, in its inability to read my soul. &ldquo;The time to have decided
      that,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;was some years ago, my son. I have given you the best
      schooling a boy can have, and you have not shown the least appreciation of
      your advantages. I do not enjoy saying this, Hugh, but in spite of all my
      efforts and of those of your mother, you have remained undeveloped and
      irresponsible. My hope, as you know, was to have made you a professional
      man, a lawyer, and to take you into my office. My father and grandfather
      were professional men before me. But you are wholly lacking in ambition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I had burned with it all my life!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have ambition,&rdquo; I cried, the tears forcing themselves to my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ambition&mdash;for what, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I hesitated. How could I tell him that my longings to do something, to be
      somebody in the world were never more keen than at that moment? Matthew
      Arnold had not then written his definition of God as the stream of
      tendency by which we fulfil the laws of our being; and my father, at any
      rate, would not have acquiesced in the definition. Dimly but passionately
      I felt then, as I had always felt, that I had a mission to perform, a
      service to do which ultimately would be revealed to me. But the
      hopelessness of explaining this took on, now, the proportions of a
      tragedy. And I could only gaze at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of ambition, Hugh?&rdquo; he repeated sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I have sometimes thought I could write, sir, if I had a chance. I
      like it better than anything else. I&mdash;I have tried it. And if I could
      only go to college&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Literature!&rdquo; There was in his voice a scandalized note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, father?&rdquo; I asked weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now it was he who, for the first time, seemed to be at a loss to
      express himself. He turned in his chair, and with a sweep of the hand
      indicated the long rows of musty-backed volumes. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you
      have had at your disposal as well-assorted a small library as the city
      contains, and you have not availed yourself of it. Yet you talk to me of
      literature as a profession. I am afraid, Hugh, that this is merely another
      indication of your desire to shun hard work, and I must tell you frankly
      that I fail to see in you the least qualification for such a career. You
      have not even inherited my taste for books. I venture to say, for
      instance, that you have never even read a paragraph of Plutarch, and yet
      when I was your age I was completely familiar with the Lives. You will not
      read Scott or Dickens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The impeachment was not to be denied, for the classics were hateful to me.
      Naturally I was afraid to make such a damning admission. My father had
      succeeded in presenting my ambition as the height of absurdity and
      presumption, and with something of the despair of a shipwrecked mariner my
      eyes rested on the green expanses of those book-backs, Bohn's Standard
      Library! Nor did it occur to him or to me that one might be great in
      literature without having read so much as a gritty page of them....
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished his argument by reminding me that worthless persons sought to
      enter the arts in the search for a fool's paradise, and in order to
      satisfy a reprehensible craving for notoriety. The implication was clear,
      that imaginative production could not be classed as hard work. And he
      assured me that literature was a profession in which no one could afford
      to be second class. A Longfellow, a Harriet Beecher Stowe, or nothing.
      This was a practical age and a practical country. We had indeed produced
      Irvings and Hawthornes, but the future of American letters was, to say the
      least, problematical. We were a utilitarian people who would never create
      a great literature, and he reminded me that the days of the romantic and
      the picturesque had passed. He gathered that I desired to be a novelist.
      Well, novelists, with certain exceptions, were fantastic fellows who blew
      iridescent soap-bubbles and who had no morals. In the face of such a
      philosophy as his I was mute. The world appeared a dreary place of musty
      offices and smoky steel-works, of coal dust, of labour without a spark of
      inspiration. And that other, the world of my dreams, simply did not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incidentally my father had condemned Cousin Robert's wholesale grocery
      business as a refuge of the lesser of intellect that could not achieve the
      professions,&mdash;an inference not calculated to stir my ambition and
      liking for it at the start.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began my business career on the following Monday morning. At breakfast,
      held earlier than usual on my account, my mother's sympathy was the more
      eloquent for being unspoken, while my father wore an air of unwonted
      cheerfulness; charging me, when I departed, to give his kindest
      remembrances to my Cousin Robert Breck. With a sense of martyrdom somehow
      deepened by this attitude of my parents I boarded a horse-car and went
      down town. Early though it was, the narrow streets of the wholesale
      district reverberated with the rattle of trucks and echoed with the shouts
      of drivers. The day promised to be scorching. At the door of the warehouse
      of Breck and Company I was greeted by the ineffable smell of groceries in
      which the suggestion of parched coffee prevailed. This is the sharpest
      remembrance of all, and even to-day that odour affects me somewhat in the
      manner that the interior of a ship affects a person prone to seasickness.
      My Cousin Robert, in his well-worn alpaca coat, was already seated at his
      desk behind the clouded glass partition next the alley at the back of the
      store, and as I entered he gazed at me over his steel-rimmed spectacles
      with that same disturbing look of clairvoyance I have already mentioned as
      one of his characteristics. The grey eyes were quizzical, and yet seemed
      to express a little commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Hugh, you've decided to honour us, have you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm much obliged for giving me the place, Cousin Robert,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had no use for that sort of politeness, and he saw through me, as
      always.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're not too tony for the grocery business, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was good enough for old Benjamin Breck,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I'll give you
      a fair trial, my boy, and no favouritism on account of relationship, any
      more than to Willie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His strong voice resounded through the store, and presently my cousin
      Willie appeared in answer to his summons, the same Willie who used to lead
      me, on mischief bent, through the barns and woods and fields of Claremore.
      He was barefoot no longer, though freckled still, grown lanky and tall; he
      wore a coarse blue apron that fell below his knees, and a pencil was stuck
      behind his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get an apron for Hugh,&rdquo; said his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willie's grin grew wider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll fit him out,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Start him in the shipping department,&rdquo; directed Cousin Robert, and turned
      to his letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was forthwith provided with an apron, and introduced to the slim and
      anaemic but cheerful Johnny Hedges, the shipping clerk, hard at work in
      the alley. Secretly I looked down on my fellow-clerks, as one destined for
      a higher mission, made out of better stuff,&mdash;finer stuff. Despite my
      attempt to hide this sense of superiority they were swift to discover it;
      and perhaps it is to my credit as well as theirs that they did not resent
      it. Curiously enough, they seemed to acknowledge it. Before the week was
      out I had earned the nickname of Beau Brummel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Beau,&rdquo; Johnny Hedges would ask, when I appeared of a morning, &ldquo;what
      happened in the great world last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had an affection for them, these fellow-clerks, and I often wondered at
      their contentment with the drab lives they led, at their
      self-congratulation for &ldquo;having a job&rdquo; at Breck and Company's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say you like this kind of work?&rdquo; I exclaimed one day to
      Johnny Hedges, as we sat on barrels of XXXX flour looking out at the hot
      sunlight in the alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't a question of liking it, Beau,&rdquo; he rebuked me. &ldquo;It's all very
      well for you to talk, since your father's a millionaire&rdquo; (a fiction so
      firmly embedded in their heads that no amount of denial affected it), &ldquo;but
      what do you think would happen to me if I was fired? I couldn't go home
      and take it easy&mdash;you bet not. I just want to shake hands with myself
      when I think that I've got a home, and a job like this. I know a feller&mdash;a
      hard worker he was, too who walked the pavements for three months when the
      Colvers failed, and couldn't get nothing, and took to drink, and the last
      I heard of him he was sleeping in police stations and walking the ties,
      and his wife's a waitress at a cheap hotel. Don't you think it's easy to
      get a job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was momentarily sobered by the earnestness with which he brought home to
      me the relentlessness of our civilization. It seemed incredible. I should
      have learned a lesson in that store. Barring a few discordant days when
      the orders came in too fast or when we were short handed because of
      sickness, it was a veritable hive of happiness; morning after morning
      clerks and porters arrived, pale, yet smiling, and laboured with
      cheerfulness from eight o'clock until six, and departed as cheerfully for
      modest homes in obscure neighbourhoods that seemed to me areas of exile.
      They were troubled with no visions of better things. When the travelling
      men came in from the &ldquo;road&rdquo; there was great hilarity. Important
      personages, these, looked up to by the city clerks; jolly, reckless,
      Elizabethan-like rovers, who had tasted of the wine of liberty&mdash;and
      of other wines with the ineradicable lust for the road in their blood. No
      more routine for Jimmy Bowles, who was king of them all. I shudder to
      think how much of my knowledge of life I owe to this Jimmy, whose stories
      would have filled a quarto volume, but could on no account have been
      published; for a self-respecting post-office would not have allowed them
      to pass through the mails. As it was, Jimmy gave them circulation enough.
      I can still see his round face, with the nose just indicated, his wicked,
      twinkling little eyes, and I can hear his husky voice fall to a whisper
      when &ldquo;the boss&rdquo; passed through the store. Jimmy, when visiting us, always
      had a group around him. His audacity with women amazed me, for he never
      passed one of the &ldquo;lady clerks&rdquo; without some form of caress, which they
      resented but invariably laughed at. One day he imparted to me his code of
      morality: he never made love to another man's wife, so he assured me, if
      he knew the man! The secret of life he had discovered in laughter, and by
      laughter he sold quantities of Cousin Robert's groceries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bowles boasted of a catholic acquaintance in all the cities of his
      district, but before venturing forth to conquer these he had learned his
      own city by heart. My Cousin Robert was not aware of the fact that Mr.
      Bowles &ldquo;showed&rdquo; the town to certain customers. He even desired to show it
      to me, but an epicurean strain in my nature held me back. Johnny Hedges
      went with him occasionally, and Henry Schneider, the bill clerk, and I
      listened eagerly to their experiences, afterwards confiding them to
      Tom....
    </p>
    <p>
      There were times when, driven by an overwhelming curiosity, I ventured
      into certain strange streets, alone, shivering with cold and excitement,
      gripped by a fascination I did not comprehend, my eyes now averted, now
      irresistibly raised toward the white streaks of light that outlined the
      windows of dark houses....
    </p>
    <p>
      One winter evening as I was going home, I encountered at the mail-box a
      young woman who shot at me a queer, twisted smile. I stood still, as
      though stunned, looking after her, and when halfway across the slushy
      street she turned and smiled again. Prodigiously excited, I followed her,
      fearful that I might be seen by someone who knew me, nor was it until she
      reached an unfamiliar street that I ventured to overtake her. She
      confounded me by facing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; she cried fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I halted in my tracks, overwhelmed with shame. But she continued to regard
      me by the light of the street lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't want to be seen with me on Second Street, did you? You're one
      of those sneaking swells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shock of this sudden onslaught was tremendous. I stood frozen to the
      spot, trembling, convicted, for I knew that her accusation was just; I had
      wounded her, and I had a desire to make amends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; I faltered. &ldquo;I didn't mean&mdash;to offend you. And you
      smiled&mdash;&rdquo; I got no farther. She began to laugh, and so loudly that I
      glanced anxiously about. I would have fled, but something still held me,
      something that belied the harshness of her laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're just a kid,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;Say, you get along home, and tell your
      mamma I sent you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon I departed in a state of humiliation and self-reproach I had
      never before known, wandering about aimlessly for a long time. When at
      length I arrived at home, late for supper, my mother's solicitude only
      served to deepen my pain. She went to the kitchen herself to see if my
      mince-pie were hot, and served me with her own hands. My father remained
      at his place at the head of the table while I tried to eat, smiling
      indulgently at her ministrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a little hard work won't hurt him, Sarah,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I was his
      age I often worked until eleven o'clock and never felt the worse for it.
      Business must be pretty good, eh, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had never seen him in a more relaxing mood, a more approving one. My
      mother sat down beside me.... Words seem useless to express the
      complicated nature of my suffering at that moment,&mdash;my remorse, my
      sense of deception, of hypocrisy,&mdash;yes, and my terror. I tried to
      talk naturally, to answer my father's questions about affairs at the
      store, while all the time my eyes rested upon the objects of the room,
      familiar since childhood. Here were warmth, love, and safety. Why could I
      not be content with them, thankful for them? What was it in me that drove
      me from these sheltering walls out into the dark places? I glanced at my
      father. Had he ever known these wild, destroying desires? Oh, if I only
      could have confided in him! The very idea of it was preposterous. Such
      placidity as theirs would never understand the nature of my temptations,
      and I pictured to myself their horror and despair at my revelation. In
      imagination I beheld their figures receding while I drifted out to sea,
      alone. Would the tide&mdash;which was somehow within me&mdash;carry me out
      and out, in spite of all I could do?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Give me that man
     That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
     In my heart's core....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      I did not shirk my tasks at the store, although I never got over the
      feeling that a fine instrument was being employed where a coarser one
      would have done equally well. There were moments when I was almost
      overcome by surges of self-commiseration and of impotent anger: for
      instance, I was once driven out of a shop by an incensed German grocer
      whom I had asked to settle a long-standing account. Yet the days passed,
      the daily grind absorbed my energies, and when I was not collecting, or
      tediously going over the stock in the dim recesses of the store, I was
      running errands in the wholesale district, treading the burning brick of
      the pavements, dodging heavy trucks and drays and perspiring clerks who
      flew about with memorandum pads in their hands, or awaiting the pleasure
      of bank tellers. Save Harvey, the venerable porter, I was the last to
      leave the store in the evening, and I always came away with the taste on
      my palate of Breck and Company's mail, it being my final duty to &ldquo;lick&rdquo;
       the whole of it and deposit it in the box at the corner. The gum on the
      envelopes tasted of winter-green.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Cousin Robert was somewhat astonished at my application.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll make a man of you yet, Hugh,&rdquo; he said to me once, when I had
      performed a commission with unexpected despatch....
    </p>
    <p>
      Business was his all-in-all, and he had an undisguised contempt for higher
      education. To send a boy to college was, in his opinion, to run no
      inconsiderable risk of ruining him. What did they amount to when they came
      home, strutting like peacocks, full of fads and fancies, and much too good
      to associate with decent, hard-working citizens? Nevertheless when autumn
      came and my friends departed with eclat for the East, I was desperate
      indeed! Even the contemplation of Robert Breck did not console me, and yet
      here, in truth, was a life which might have served me as a model. His
      store was his castle; and his reputation for integrity and square dealing
      as wide as the city. Often I used to watch him with a certain envy as he
      stood in the doorway, his hands in his pockets, and greeted
      fellow-merchant and banker with his genuine and dignified directness. This
      man was his own master. They all called him &ldquo;Robert,&rdquo; and they made it
      clear by their manner that they knew they were addressing one who
      fulfilled his obligations and asked no favours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crusty old Nathaniel Durrett once declared that when you bought a bill of
      goods from Robert Breck you did not have to check up the invoice or employ
      a chemist. Here was a character to mould upon. If my ambition could but
      have been bounded by Breck and Company, I, too, might have come to stand
      in that doorway content with a tribute that was greater than Caesar's.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been dreading the Christmas holidays, which were indeed to be no
      holidays for me. And when at length they arrived they brought with them
      from the East certain heroes fashionably clad, citizens now of a larger
      world than mine. These former companions had become superior beings, they
      could not help showing it, and their presence destroyed the Balance of
      Things. For alas, I had not wholly abjured the feminine sex after all! And
      from being a somewhat important factor in the lives of Ruth Hollister and
      other young women I suddenly became of no account. New interests, new
      rivalries and loyalties had arisen in which I had no share; I must
      perforce busy myself with invoices of flour and coffee and canned fruits
      while sleigh rides and coasting and skating expeditions to Blackstone Lake
      followed one another day after day,&mdash;for the irony of circumstances
      had decreed a winter uncommonly cold. There were evening parties, too,
      where I felt like an alien, though my friends were guilty of no conscious
      neglect; and had I been able to accept the situation simply, I should not
      have suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The principal event of those holidays was a play given in the old
      Hambleton house (which later became the Boyne Club), under the direction
      of the lively and talented Mrs. Watling. I was invited, indeed, to
      participate; but even if I had had the desire I could not have done so,
      since the rehearsals were carried on in the daytime. Nancy was the leading
      lady. I have neglected to mention that she too had been away almost
      continuously since our misunderstanding, for the summer in the mountains,&mdash;a
      sojourn recommended for her mother's health; and in the autumn she had
      somewhat abruptly decided to go East to boarding-school at Farmington.
      During the brief months of her absence she had marvellously acquired
      maturity and aplomb, a worldliness of manner and a certain frivolity that
      seemed to put those who surrounded her on a lower plane. She was only
      seventeen, yet she seemed the woman of thirty whose role she played. First
      there were murmurs, then sustained applause. I scarcely recognized her:
      she had taken wings and soared far above me, suggesting a sphere of power
      and luxury hitherto unimagined and beyond the scope of the world to which
      I belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her triumph was genuine. When the play was over she was immediately
      surrounded by enthusiastic admirers eager to congratulate her, to dance
      with her. I too would have gone forward, but a sense of inadequacy, of
      unimportance, of an inability to cope with her, held me back, and from a
      corner I watched her sweeping around the room, holding up her train, and
      leaning on the arm of Bob Lansing, a classmate whom Ralph had brought home
      from Harvard. Then it was Ralph's turn: that affair seemed still to be
      going on. My feelings were a strange medley of despondency and
      stimulation....
    </p>
    <p>
      Our eyes met. Her partner now was Ham Durrett. Capriciously releasing him,
      she stood before me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, you haven't asked me to dance, or even told me what you thought of
      the play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it was splendid,&rdquo; I said lamely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because she refrained from replying I was farther than ever from
      understanding her. How was I to divine what she felt? or whether any
      longer she felt at all? Here, in this costume of a woman of the world,
      with the string of pearls at her neck to give her the final touch of
      brilliancy, was a strange, new creature who baffled and silenced me.... We
      had not gone halfway across the room when she halted abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm tired,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I don't feel like dancing just now,&rdquo; and led
      the way to the big, rose punch-bowl, one of the Durretts' most cherished
      possessions. Glancing up at me over the glass of lemonade I had given her
      she went on: &ldquo;Why haven't you been to see me since I came home? I've
      wanted to talk to you, to hear how you are getting along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was she trying to make amends, or reminding me in this subtle way of the
      cause of our quarrel? What I was aware of as I looked at her was an
      attitude, a vantage point apparently gained by contact with that
      mysterious outer world which thus vicariously had laid its spell on me; I
      was tremendously struck by the thought that to achieve this attitude meant
      emancipation, invulnerability against the aches and pains which otherwise
      our fellow-beings had the power to give us; mastery over life,&mdash;the
      ability to choose calmly, as from a height, what were best for one's self,
      untroubled by loves and hates. Untroubled by loves and hates! At that very
      moment, paradoxically, I loved her madly, but with a love not of the old
      quality, a love that demanded a vantage point of its own. Even though she
      had made an advance&mdash;and some elusiveness in her manner led me to
      doubt it I could not go to her now. I must go as a conqueror,&mdash;a
      conqueror in the lists she herself had chosen, where the prize is power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm getting along pretty well,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;At any rate, they don't
      complain of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow,&rdquo; she ventured, &ldquo;somehow it's hard to think of you as a business
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took this for a reference to the boast I had made that I would go to
      college.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business isn't so bad as it might be,&rdquo; I assured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think a man ought to go away to college,&rdquo; she declared, in what seemed
      another tone. &ldquo;He makes friends, learns certain things,&mdash;it gives him
      finish. We are very provincial here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Provincial! I did not stop to reflect how recently she must have acquired
      the word; it summed up precisely the self-estimate at which I had arrived.
      The sting went deep. Before I could think of an effective reply Nancy was
      being carried off by the young man from the East, who was clearly
      infatuated. He was not provincial. She smiled back at me brightly over his
      shoulder.... In that instant were fused in one resolution all the
      discordant elements within me of aspiration and discontent. It was not so
      much that I would show Nancy what I intended to do&mdash;I would show
      myself; and I felt a sudden elation, and accession of power that enabled
      me momentarily to despise the puppets with whom she danced.... From this
      mood I was awakened with a start to feel a hand on my shoulder, and I
      turned to confront her father, McAlery Willett; a gregarious, easygoing,
      pleasure-loving gentleman who made only a pretence of business, having
      inherited an ample fortune from his father, unique among his generation in
      our city in that he paid some attention to fashion in his dress; good
      living was already beginning to affect his figure. His mellow voice had a
      way of breaking an octave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry, my boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You stick to business. These college
      fellows are cocks of the walk just now, but some day you'll be able to
      snap your fingers at all of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day was dark, overcast, smoky, damp-the soft, unwholesome
      dampness that follows a spell of hard frost. I spent the morning and
      afternoon on the gloomy third floor of Breck and Company, making a list of
      the stock. I remember the place as though I had just stepped out of it,
      the freight elevator at the back, the dusty, iron columns, the continuous
      piles of cases and bags and barrels with narrow aisles between them; the
      dirty windows, spotted and soot-streaked, that looked down on Second
      Street. I was determined now to escape from all this, and I had my plan in
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had I swallowed my supper that evening than I set out at a swift
      pace for a modest residence district ten blocks away, coming to a little
      frame house set back in a yard,&mdash;one of those houses in which the
      ringing of the front door-bell produces the greatest commotion; children's
      voices were excitedly raised and then hushed. After a brief silence the
      door was opened by a pleasant-faced, brown-bearded man, who stood staring
      at me in surprise. His hair was rumpled, he wore an old house coat with a
      hole in the elbow, and with one finger he kept his place in the book which
      he held in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh Paret!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ushered me into a little parlour lighted by two lamps, that bore every
      evidence of having been recently vacated. Its features somehow bespoke a
      struggle for existence; as though its occupants had worried much and loved
      much. It was a room best described by the word &ldquo;home&rdquo;&mdash;home made more
      precious by a certain precariousness. Toys and school-books strewed the
      floor, a sewing-bag and apron lay across the sofa, and in one corner was a
      roll-topped desk of varnished oak. The seats of the chairs were
      comfortably depressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this was where Mr. Wood lived! Mr. Wood, instructor in Latin and Greek
      at Densmore Academy. It was now borne in on me for the first time that he
      did live and have his ties like any other human being, instead of just
      appearing magically from nowhere on a platform in a chalky room at nine
      every morning, to vanish again in the afternoon. I had formerly stood in
      awe of his presence. But now I was suddenly possessed by an embarrassment,
      and (shall I say it?) by a commiseration bordering on contempt for a man
      who would consent to live thus for the sake of being a schoolteacher. How
      strange that civilization should set such a high value on education and
      treat its functionaries with such neglect!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wood's surprise at seeing me was genuine. For I had never shown a
      particular interest in him, nor in the knowledge which he strove to
      impart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you had forgotten me, Hugh,&rdquo; he said, and added whimsically:
      &ldquo;most boys do, when they graduate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt the reproach, which made it the more difficult for me to state my
      errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you sometimes took pupils in the evening, Mr. Wood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pupils,&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he replied, still eyeing me. Suddenly his eyes
      twinkled. He had indeed no reason to suspect me of thirsting for learning.
      &ldquo;But I was under the impression that you had gone into business, Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, sir,&rdquo; I explained somewhat painfully, &ldquo;that I am not
      satisfied with business. I feel&mdash;as if I ought to know more. And I
      came to see if you would give me lessons about three nights a week,
      because I want to take the Harvard examinations next summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus I made it appear, and so persuaded myself, that my ambition had been
      prompted by a craving for knowledge. As soon as he could recover himself
      he reminded me that he had on many occasions declared I had a brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father must be very happy over this decision of yours,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the point, I told him. It was to be a surprise for my father; I
      was to take the examinations first, and inform him afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my intense relief, Mr. Wood found the scheme wholly laudable, and
      entered into it with zest. He produced examinations of preceding years
      from a pigeonhole in his desk, and inside of half an hour the arrangement
      was made, the price of the lessons settled. They were well within my
      salary, which recently had been raised....
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went down town, or collecting bills for Breck and Company, I took a
      text-book along with me in the street-cars. Now at last I had behind my
      studies a driving force. Algebra, Latin, Greek and history became worth
      while, means to an end. I astonished Mr. Wood; and sometimes he would tilt
      back his chair, take off his spectacles and pull his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in the name of all the sages,&rdquo; he would demand, &ldquo;couldn't you have
      done this well at school? You might have led your class, instead of Ralph
      Hambleton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I grew very fond of Mr. Wood, and even of his thin little wife, who
      occasionally flitted into the room after we had finished. I fully intended
      to keep up with them in after life, but I never did. I forgot them
      completely....
    </p>
    <p>
      My parents were not wholly easy in their minds concerning me; they were
      bewildered by the new aspect I presented. For my lately acquired motive
      was strong enough to compel me to restrict myself socially, and the
      evenings I spent at home were given to study, usually in my own room. Once
      I was caught with a Latin grammar: I was just &ldquo;looking over it,&rdquo; I said.
      My mother sighed. I knew what was in her mind; she had always been
      secretly disappointed that I had not been sent to college. And presently,
      when my father went out to attend a trustee's meeting, the impulse to
      confide in her almost overcame me; I loved her with that affection which
      goes out to those whom we feel understand us, but I was learning to
      restrain my feelings. She looked at me wistfully.... I knew that she would
      insist on telling my father, and thus possibly frustrate my plans. That I
      was not discovered was due to a certain quixotic twist in my father's
      character. I was working now, and though not actually earning my own
      living, he no longer felt justified in prying into my affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When June arrived, however, my tutor began to show signs that his
      conscience was troubling him, and one night he delivered his ultimatum.
      The joke had gone far enough, he implied. My intentions, indeed, he found
      praiseworthy, but in his opinion it was high time that my father were
      informed of them; he was determined to call at my father's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning was blue with the presage of showers; blue, too, with the
      presage of fate. An interminable morning. My tasks had become utterly
      distasteful. And in the afternoon, so when I sat down to make out
      invoices, I wrote automatically the names of the familiar customers, my
      mind now exalted by hope, now depressed by anxiety. The result of an
      interview perhaps even now going on would determine whether or no I should
      be immediately released from a slavery I detested. Would Mr. Wood persuade
      my father? If not, I was prepared to take more desperate measures; remain
      in the grocery business I would not. In the evening, as I hurried homeward
      from the corner where the Boyne Street car had dropped me, I halted
      suddenly in front of the Peters house, absorbing the scene where my
      childhood had been spent: each of these spreading maples was an old
      friend, and in these yards I had played and dreamed. An unaccountable
      sadness passed over me as I walked on toward our gate; I entered it,
      gained the doorway of the house and went upstairs, glancing into the
      sitting room. My mother sat by the window, sewing. She looked up at me
      with an ineffable expression, in which I read a trace of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt very uncomfortable, and stood looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell us, my son?&rdquo; In her voice was in truth reproach; yet
      mingled with that was another note, which I think was pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has father said?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, he will tell you himself. I&mdash;I don't know&mdash;he will
      talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she seized my hands and drew me down to her, and then held me
      away, gazing into my face with a passionate questioning, her lips smiling,
      her eyes wet. What did she see? Was there a subtler relationship between
      our natures than I guessed? Did she understand by some instinctive power
      the riddle within me? divine through love the force that was driving me on
      she knew not whither, nor I? At the sound of my father's step in the hall
      she released me. He came in as though nothing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Hugh, are you home?&rdquo; he said....
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had I been more impressed, more bewildered by his self-command than
      at that time. Save for the fact that my mother talked less than usual,
      supper passed as though nothing had happened. Whether I had shaken him,
      disappointed him, or gained his reluctant approval I could not tell.
      Gradually his outward calmness turned my suspense to irritation....
    </p>
    <p>
      But when at length we were alone together, I gained a certain reassurance.
      His manner was not severe. He hesitated a little before beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess, Hugh; that I scarcely know what to say about this
      proceeding of yours. The thing that strikes me most forcibly is that you
      might have confided in your mother and myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hope flashed up within me, like an explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I wanted to surprise you, father. And then, you see, I thought it
      would be wiser to find out first how well I was likely to do at the
      examinations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My father looked at me. Unfortunately he possessed neither a sense of
      humour nor a sense of tragedy sufficient to meet such a situation. For the
      first time in my life I beheld him at a disadvantage; for I had, somehow,
      managed at length to force him out of position, and he was puzzled. I was
      quick to play my trump card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking it over carefully,&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;and I have made up
      my mind that I want to go into the law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law!&rdquo; he exclaimed sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, sir. I know that you were disappointed because I did not do
      sufficiently well at school to go to college and study for the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt indeed a momentary pang, but I remembered that I was fighting for
      my freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seemed satisfied where you were,&rdquo; he said in a puzzled voice, &ldquo;and
      your Cousin Robert gives a good account of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've tried to do the work as well as I could, sir,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But I
      don't like the grocery business, or any other business. I have a feeling
      that I'm not made for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think, now, that you are made for the law?&rdquo; he asked, with the
      faint hint of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I believe I could succeed at it. I'd like to try,&rdquo; I replied
      modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've given up the idiotic notion of wishing to be an author?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I implied that he himself had convinced me of the futility of such a wish.
      I listened to his next words as in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must confess to you, Hugh, that there are times when I fail to
      understand you. I hope it is as you say, that you have arrived at a
      settled conviction as to your future, and that this is not another of
      those caprices to which you have been subject, nor a desire to shirk
      honest work. Mr. Wood has made out a strong case for you, and I have
      therefore determined to give you a trial. If you pass the examinations
      with credit, you may go to college, but if at any time you fail to make
      good progress, you come home, and go into business again. Is that
      thoroughly understood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said it was, and thanked him effusively.... I had escaped,&mdash;the
      prison doors had flown open. But it is written that every happiness has
      its sting; and my joy, intense though it was, had in it a core of
      remorse....
    </p>
    <p>
      I went downstairs to my mother, who was sitting in the hall by the open
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father says I may go!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up and took me in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, I am so glad, although we shall miss you dreadfully.... Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh, I so want you to be a good man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her cry was a little incoherent, but fraught with a meaning that came home
      to me, in spite of myself....
    </p>
    <p>
      A while later I ran over to announce to the amazed Tom Peters that I was
      actually going to Harvard with him. He stood in the half-lighted hallway,
      his hands in his pockets, blinking at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, you're a wonder!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;How in Jehoshaphat did you work
      it?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay long awake that night thinking over the momentous change so soon to
      come into my life, wondering exultantly what Nancy Willett would say now.
      I was not one, at any rate, to be despised or neglected.

    <h2>
      VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following September Tom Peters and I went East together. In the early
      morning Boston broke on us like a Mecca as we rolled out of the old Albany
      station, joint lords of a &ldquo;herdic.&rdquo; How sharply the smell of the
      salt-laden east wind and its penetrating coolness come back to me! I seek
      in vain for words to express the exhilarating effect of that briny
      coolness on my imagination, and of the visions it summoned up of the
      newer, larger life into which I had marvellously been transported. We
      alighted at the Parker House, full-fledged men of the world, and tried to
      act as though the breakfast of which we partook were merely an incident,
      not an Event; as though we were Seniors, and not freshmen, assuming an
      indifference to the beings by whom we were surrounded and who were
      breakfasting, too,&mdash;although the nice-looking ones with fresh faces
      and trim clothes were all undoubtedly Olympians. The better to proclaim
      our nonchalance, we seated ourselves on a lounge of the marble-paved lobby
      and smoked cigarettes. This was liberty indeed! At length we departed for
      Cambridge, in another herdic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boston! Could it be possible? Everything was so different here as to give
      the place the aspect of a dream: the Bulfinch State House, the decorous
      shops, the still more decorous dwellings with the purple-paned windows
      facing the Common; Back Bay, still boarded up, ivy-spread, suggestive of a
      mysterious and delectable existence. We crossed the Charles River,
      blue-grey and still that morning; traversed a nondescript district, and at
      last found ourselves gazing out of the windows at the mellowed,
      plum-coloured bricks of the University buildings.... All at once our
      exhilaration evaporated as the herdic rumbled into a side street and
      backed up before the door of a not-too-inviting, three-storied house with
      a queer extension on top. Its steps and vestibule were, however,
      immaculate. The bell was answered by a plainly overworked servant girl, of
      whom we inquired for Mrs. Bolton, our landlady. There followed a period of
      waiting in a parlour from which the light had been almost wholly banished,
      with slippery horsehair furniture and a marble-topped table; and Mrs.
      Bolton, when she appeared, dressed in rusty black, harmonized perfectly
      with the funereal gloom. She was a tall, rawboned, severe lady with a
      peculiar red-mottled complexion that somehow reminded one of the
      outcropping rocks of her native New England soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to see your rooms, I suppose,&rdquo; she remarked impassively when we
      had introduced ourselves, and as we mounted the stairs behind her Tom, in
      a whisper, nicknamed her &ldquo;Granite Face.&rdquo; Presently she left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hospitable soul!&rdquo; said Tom, who, with his hands in his pockets, was
      gazing at the bare walls of our sitting-room. &ldquo;We'll have to go into the
      house-furnishing business, Hughie. I vote we don't linger here to-day&mdash;we'll
      get melancholia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Outside, however, the sun was shining brightly, and we departed
      immediately to explore Cambridge and announce our important presences to
      the proper authorities.... We went into Boston to dine.... It was not
      until nine o'clock in the evening that we returned and the bottom suddenly
      dropped out of things. He who has tasted that first, acute homesickness of
      college will know what I mean. It usually comes at the opening of one's
      trunk. The sight of the top tray gave me a pang I shall never forget. I
      would not have believed that I loved my mother so much! These articles had
      been packed by her hands; and in one corner, among the underclothes on
      which she had neatly sewed my initials, lay the new Bible she had bought.
      &ldquo;Hugh Moreton Paret, from his Mother. September, 1881.&rdquo; I took it up (Tom
      was not looking) and tried to read a passage, but my eyes were blurred.
      What was it within me that pressed and pressed until I thought I could
      bear the pain of it no longer? I pictured the sitting-room at home, and my
      father and mother there, thinking of me. Yes, I must acknowledge it; in
      the bitterness of that moment I longed to be back once more in the
      railed-off space on the floor of Breck and Company, writing invoices....
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, as we went on silently with our unpacking, we became aware of
      someone in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, you fellows!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We're classmates, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We turned to behold an ungainly young man in an ill-fitting blue suit. His
      face was pimply, his eyes a Teutonic blue, his yellow hair rumpled, his
      naturally large mouth was made larger by a friendly grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Hermann Krebs,&rdquo; he announced simply. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We replied, I regret to say, with a distinct coolness that did not seem to
      bother him in the least. He advanced into the room, holding out a large,
      red, and serviceable hand, evidently it had never dawned on him that there
      was such a thing in the world as snobbery. But Tom and I had been
      &ldquo;coached&rdquo; by Ralph Hambleton and Perry Blackwood, warned to be careful of
      our friendships. There was a Reason! In any case Mr. Krebs would not have
      appealed to us. In answer to a second question he was informed what city
      we hailed from, and he proclaimed himself likewise a native of our state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'm from Elkington!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as though the fact sealed our
      future relationships. He seated himself on Tom's trunk and added: &ldquo;Welcome
      to old Harvard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We felt that he was scarcely qualified to speak for &ldquo;old Harvard,&rdquo; but we
      did not say so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as if you'd been pall-bearers for somebody,&rdquo; was his next
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this there seemed no possible reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellows are pretty well fixed here,&rdquo; he went on, undismayed, gazing
      about a room which had seemed to us the abomination of desolation. &ldquo;Your
      folks must be rich. I'm up under the skylight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even this failed to touch us. His father&mdash;he told us with
      undiminished candour&mdash;had been a German emigrant who had come over in
      '49, after the cause of liberty had been lost in the old country, and made
      eye-glasses and opera glasses. There hadn't been a fortune in it. He,
      Hermann, had worked at various occupations in the summer time, from
      peddling to farming, until he had saved enough to start him at Harvard.
      Tom, who had been bending over his bureau drawer, straightened up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you want to come here for?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, what did you?&rdquo; Mr. Krebs retorted genially. &ldquo;To get an education, of
      course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An education!&rdquo; echoed Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't Harvard the oldest and best seat of learning in America?&rdquo; There was
      an exaltation in Krebs's voice that arrested my attention, and made me
      look at him again. A troubled chord had been struck within me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you come for?&rdquo; Mr. Krebs persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To sow my wild oats,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I expect to have something of a crop,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some reason I could not fathom, it suddenly seemed to dawn on Mr.
      Krebs, as a result of this statement, that he wasn't wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; he said, with a new dignity that curiously belied the
      informality of his farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interval of silence followed his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he's got a crust!&rdquo; said Tom, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own feeling about Mr. Krebs had become more complicated; but I took my
      cue from Tom, who dealt with situations simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll come in for a few knockouts,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Here's to old Harvard,
      the greatest institution of learning in America! Oh, gee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our visitor, at least, made us temporarily forget our homesickness, but it
      returned with redoubled intensity when we had put out the lights and gone
      to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we had left home it had been mildly hinted to us by Ralph and Perry
      Blackwood that scholarly eminence was not absolutely necessary to one's
      welfare and happiness at Cambridge. The hint had been somewhat
      superfluous; but the question remained, what was necessary? With a view of
      getting some light on this delicate subject we paid a visit the next
      evening to our former friends and schoolmates, whose advice was conveyed
      with a masterly circumlocution that impressed us both. There are some
      things that may not be discussed directly, and the conduct of life at a
      modern university&mdash;which is a reflection of life in the greater world&mdash;is
      one of these. Perry Blackwood and Ham did most of the talking, while
      Ralph, characteristically, lay at full length on the window-seat,
      interrupting with an occasional terse and cynical remark very much to the
      point. As a sophomore, he in particular seemed lifted immeasurably above
      us, for he was&mdash;as might have been expected already a marked man in
      his class. The rooms which he shared with his cousin made a tremendous
      impression on Tom and me, and seemed palatial in comparison to our
      quarters at Mrs. Bolton's, eloquent of the freedom and luxury of
      undergraduate existence; their note, perhaps, was struck by the profusion
      of gay sofa pillows, then something of an innovation. The heavy, expensive
      furniture was of a pattern new to me; and on the mantel were three or four
      photographs of ladies in the alluring costume of the musical stage, in
      which Tom evinced a particular interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did grandfather send 'em?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're Ham's,&rdquo; said Ralph, and he contrived somehow to get into those
      two words an epitome of his cousin's character. Ham was stouter, and his
      clothes were more striking, more obviously expensive than ever.... On our
      way homeward, after we had walked a block or two in silence, Tom
      exclaimed:&mdash;&ldquo;Don't make friends with the friendless!&mdash;eh,
      Hughie? We knew enough to begin all right, didn't we?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Have I made us out a pair of deliberate, calculating snobs? Well, after
      all it must be remembered that our bringing up had not been of sufficient
      liberality to include the Krebses of this world. We did not, indeed, spend
      much time in choosing and weighing those whom we should know and those
      whom we should avoid; and before the first term of that Freshman year was
      over Tom had become a favourite. He had the gift of making men feel that
      he delighted in their society, that he wished for nothing better than to
      sit for hours in their company, content to listen to the arguments that
      raged about him. Once in a while he would make a droll observation that
      was greeted with fits of laughter. He was always referred to as &ldquo;old Tom,&rdquo;
       or &ldquo;good old Tom&rdquo;; presently, when he began to pick out chords on the
      banjo, it was discovered that he had a good tenor voice, though he could
      not always be induced to sing.... Somewhat to the jeopardy of the academic
      standard that my father expected me to sustain, our rooms became a
      rendezvous for many clubable souls whose maudlin, midnight attempts at
      harmony often set the cocks crowing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       &ldquo;Free from care and despair,
        What care we?
       'Tis wine, 'tis wine
        That makes the jollity.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      As a matter of truth, on these occasions it was more often beer; beer
      transported thither in Tom's new valise,&mdash;given him by his mother,&mdash;and
      stuffed with snow to keep the bottles cold. Sometimes Granite Face,
      adorned in a sky-blue wrapper, would suddenly appear in the doorway to
      declare that we were a disgrace to her respectable house: the university
      authorities should be informed, etc., etc. Poor woman, we were
      outrageously inconsiderate of her.... One evening as we came through the
      hall we caught a glimpse in the dimly lighted parlour of a young man
      holding a shy and pale little girl on his lap, Annie, Mrs. Bolton's
      daughter: on the face of our landlady was an expression I had never seen
      there, like a light. I should scarcely have known her. Tom and I paused at
      the foot of the stairs. He clutched my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darned if it wasn't our friend Krebs!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I was by no means so popular as Tom, I got along fairly well. I had
      escaped from provincialism, from the obscure purgatory of the wholesale
      grocery business; new vistas, exciting and stimulating, had been opened
      up; nor did I offend the sensibilities and prejudices of the new friends I
      made, but gave a hearty consent to a code I found congenial. I recognized
      in the social system of undergraduate life at Harvard a reflection of that
      of a greater world where I hoped some day to shine; yet my ambition did
      not prey upon me. Mere conformity, however, would not have taken me very
      far in a sphere from which I, in common with many others, desired not to
      be excluded.... One day, in an idle but inspired moment, I paraphrased a
      song from &ldquo;Pinafore,&rdquo; applying it to a college embroglio, and the brief
      and lively vogue it enjoyed was sufficient to indicate a future
      usefulness. I had &ldquo;found myself.&rdquo; This was in the last part of the
      freshman year, and later on I became a sort of amateur, class
      poet-laureate. Many were the skits I composed, and Tom sang them....
    </p>
    <p>
      During that freshman year we often encountered Hermann Krebs, whistling
      merrily, on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got your themes done?&rdquo; he would inquire cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Tom would always mutter, when he was out of earshot: &ldquo;He has got a
      crust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I thought about Krebs at all,&mdash;and this was seldom indeed,&mdash;his
      manifest happiness puzzled me. Our cool politeness did not seem to bother
      him in the least; on the contrary, I got the impression that it amused
      him. He seemed to have made no friends. And after that first evening,
      memorable for its homesickness, he never ventured to repeat his visit to
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      One windy November day I spied his somewhat ludicrous figure striding
      ahead of me, his trousers above his ankles. I was bundled up in a new
      ulster,&mdash;of which I was secretly quite proud,&mdash;but he wore no
      overcoat at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how are you getting along?&rdquo; I asked, as I overtook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made clear, as he turned, his surprise that I should have addressed him
      at all, but immediately recovered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, fine,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;I've had better luck than I expected. I'm
      correspondent for two or three newspapers. I began by washing windows, and
      doing odd jobs for the professors' wives.&rdquo; He laughed. &ldquo;I guess that
      doesn't strike you as good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He showed no resentment at my patronage, but a self-sufficiency that made
      my sympathy seem superfluous, giving the impression of an inner harmony
      and content that surprised me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I needn't ask how you're getting along,&rdquo; he said....
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the freshman year we abandoned Mrs. Bolton's for more
      desirable quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not go deeply into my college career, recalling only such
      incidents as, seen in the retrospect, appear to have had significance. I
      have mentioned my knack for song-writing; but it was not, I think, until
      my junior year there was startlingly renewed in me my youthful desire to
      write, to create something worth while, that had so long been dormant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspiration came from Alonzo Cheyne, instructor in English; a
      remarkable teacher, in spite of the finicky mannerisms which Tom imitated.
      And when, in reading aloud certain magnificent passages, he forgot his
      affectations, he managed to arouse cravings I thought to have deserted me
      forever. Was it possible, after all, that I had been right and my father
      wrong? that I might yet be great in literature?
    </p>
    <p>
      A mere hint from Alonzo Cheyne was more highly prized by the grinds than
      fulsome praise from another teacher. And to his credit it should be
      recorded that the grinds were the only ones he treated with any
      seriousness; he took pains to answer their questions; but towards the rest
      of us, the Chosen, he showed a thinly veiled contempt. None so quick as he
      to detect a simulated interest, or a wily effort to make him ridiculous;
      and few tried this a second time, for he had a rapier-like gift of
      repartee that transfixed the offender like a moth on a pin. He had a way
      of eyeing me at times, his glasses in his hand, a queer smile on his lips,
      as much as to imply that there was one at least among the lost who was
      made for better things. Not that my work was poor, but I knew that it
      might have been better. Out of his classes, however, beyond the immediate,
      disturbing influence of his personality I would relapse into
      indifference....
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning one evening to our quarters, which were now in the &ldquo;Yard,&rdquo; I
      found Tom seated with a blank sheet before him, thrusting his hand through
      his hair and biting the end of his penholder to a pulp. In his muttering,
      which was mixed with the curious, stingless profanity of which he was
      master, I caught the name of Cheyne, and I knew that he was facing the
      crisis of a fortnightly theme. The subject assigned was a narrative of
      some personal experience, and it was to be handed in on the morrow. My own
      theme was already, written.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been holding down this chair for an hour, and I can't seem to think
      of a thing.&rdquo; He rose to fling himself down on the lounge. &ldquo;I wish I was in
      Canada.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Canada?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trout fishing with Uncle Jake at that club of his where he took me last
      summer.&rdquo; Tom gazed dreamily at the ceiling. &ldquo;Whenever I have some darned
      foolish theme like this to write I want to go fishing, and I want to go
      like the devil. I'll get Uncle Jake to take you, too, next summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, that's living all right, Hughie, up there among the tamaracks and
      balsams!&rdquo; And he began, for something like the thirtieth time, to relate
      the adventures of the trip.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he talked, the idea presented itself to me with sudden fascination to
      use this incident as the subject of Tom's theme; to write it for him, from
      his point of view, imitating the droll style he would have had if he had
      been able to write; for, when he was interested in any matter, his oral
      narrative did not lack vividness. I began to ask him questions: what were
      the trees like, for instance? How did the French-Canadian guides talk? He
      had the gift of mimicry: aided by a partial knowledge of French I wrote
      down a few sentences as they sounded. The canoe had upset and he had come
      near drowning. I made him describe his sensations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll write your theme for you,&rdquo; I exclaimed, when he had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee, not about that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It's a personal experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His gratitude was pathetic.... By this time I was so full of the subject
      that it fairly clamoured for expression, and as I wrote the hours flew.
      Once in a while I paused to ask him a question as he sat with his chair
      tilted back and his feet on the table, reading a detective story. I
      sketched in the scene with bold strokes; the desolate bois brule on the
      mountain side, the polished crystal surface of the pool broken here and
      there with the circles left by rising fish; I pictured Armand, the guide,
      his pipe between his teeth, holding the canoe against the current; and I
      seemed to smell the sharp tang of the balsams, to hear the roar of the
      rapids below. Then came the sudden hooking of the big trout, habitant
      oaths from Armand, bouleversement, wetness, darkness, confusion; a
      half-strangled feeling, a brief glimpse of green things and sunlight, and
      then strangulation, or what seemed like it; strangulation, the sense of
      being picked up and hurled by a terrific force whither? a blinding
      whiteness, in which it was impossible to breathe, one sharp, almost
      unbearable pain, then another, then oblivion.... Finally, awakening, to be
      confronted by a much worried Uncle Jake.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the detective story had fallen to the floor, and Tom was
      huddled up in his chair, asleep. He arose obediently and wrapped a wet
      towel around his head, and began to write. Once he paused long enough to
      mutter:&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, that's about it,&mdash;that's the way I felt!&rdquo; and set
      to work again, mechanically,&mdash;all the praise I got for what I deemed
      a literary achievement of the highest order! At three o'clock, a.m., he
      finished, pulled off his clothes automatically and tumbled into bed. I had
      no desire for sleep. My brain was racing madly, like an engine without a
      governor. I could write! I could write! I repeated the words over and over
      to myself. All the complexities of my present life were blotted out, and I
      beheld only the long, sweet vista of the career for which I was now
      convinced that nature had intended me. My immediate fortunes became
      unimportant, immaterial. No juice of the grape I had ever tasted made me
      half so drunk.... With the morning, of course, came the reaction, and I
      suffered the after sensations of an orgie, awaking to a world of
      necessity, cold and grey and slushy, and necessity alone made me rise from
      my bed. My experience of the night before might have taught me that
      happiness lies in the trick of transforming necessity, but it did not. The
      vision had faded,&mdash;temporarily, at least; and such was the
      distraction of the succeeding days that the subject of the theme passed
      from my mind....
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Tom was later than usual in getting home. I was writing a
      letter when he came in, and did not notice him, yet I was vaguely aware of
      his standing over me. When at last I looked up I gathered from his
      expression that something serious had happened, so mournful was his face,
      and yet so utterly ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Hugh, I'm in the deuce of a mess,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank down on the table with a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Alonzo,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I remembered the theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;what's he done?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says I must become a writer. Think of it, me a writer! He says I'm a
      young Shakespeare, that I've been lazy and hid my light under a bushel! He
      says he knows now what I can do, and if I don't keep up the quality, he'll
      know the reason why, and write a personal letter to my father. Oh, hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of his evident anguish, I was seized with a convulsive laughter.
      Tom stood staring at me moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it's funny,&mdash;don't you? I guess it is, but what's going to
      become of me? That's what I want to know. I've been in trouble before, but
      never in any like this. And who got me into it? You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was gratitude!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to go on writing 'em, now.&rdquo; His voice became desperately
      pleading. &ldquo;Say, Hugh, old man, you can temper 'em down&mdash;temper 'em
      down gradually. And by the end of the year, let's say, they'll be about
      normal again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seemed actually shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end of the year!&rdquo; I cried, the predicament striking me for the first
      time in its fulness. &ldquo;Say, you've got a crust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll do it, if I have to hold a gun over you,&rdquo; he announced grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mingled with my anxiety, which was real, was an exultation that would not
      down. Nevertheless, the idea of developing Tom into a Shakespeare,&mdash;Tom,
      who had not the slightest desire to be one I was appalling, besides having
      in it an element of useless self-sacrifice from which I recoiled. On the
      other hand, if Alonzo should discover that I had written his theme, there
      were penalties I did not care to dwell upon.... With such a cloud hanging
      over me I passed a restless night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As luck would have it the very next evening in the level light under the
      elms of the Square I beheld sauntering towards me a dapper figure which I
      recognized as that of Mr. Cheyne himself. As I saluted him he gave me an
      amused and most disconcerting glance; and when I was congratulating myself
      that he had passed me he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine weather for March, Paret,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I agreed in a strange voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he remarked, contemplating the bare branches above our
      heads, &ldquo;that was an excellent theme your roommate handed in. I had no idea
      that he possessed such&mdash;such genius. Did you, by any chance, happen
      to read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&mdash;I read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren't you surprised?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Cheyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, sir&mdash;that is&mdash;I mean to say he talks just like that,
      sometimes&mdash;that is, when it's anything he cares about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Cheyne. &ldquo;That's interesting, most interesting. In all
      my experience, I do not remember a case in which a gift has been developed
      so rapidly. I don't want to give the impression&mdash;ah that there is no
      room for improvement, but the thing was very well done, for an
      undergraduate. I must confess I never should have suspected it in Peters,
      and it's most interesting what you say about his cleverness in
      conversation.&rdquo; He twirled the head of his stick, apparently lost in
      reflection. &ldquo;I may be wrong,&rdquo; he went on presently, &ldquo;I have an idea it is
      you&mdash;&rdquo; I must literally have jumped away from him. He paused a
      moment, without apparently noticing my panic, &ldquo;that it is you who have
      influenced Peters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am wrong, then. Or is this merely commendable modesty on your part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then my hypothesis falls to the ground. I had greatly hoped,&rdquo; he added
      meaningly, &ldquo;that you might be able to throw some light on this mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paret,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;have you time to come over to my rooms for a few
      minutes this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave me his number in Brattle Street....
    </p>
    <p>
      Like one running in a nightmare and making no progress I made my way home,
      only to learn from Hallam,&mdash;who lived on the same floor,&mdash;that
      Tom had inconsiderately gone to Boston for the evening, with four other
      weary spirits in search of relaxation! Avoiding our club table, I took
      what little nourishment I could at a modest restaurant, and restlessly
      paced the moonlit streets until eight o'clock, when I found myself in
      front of one of those low-gabled colonial houses which, on less
      soul-shaking occasions, had exercised a great charm on my imagination. My
      hand hung for an instant over the bell.... I must have rung it violently,
      for there appeared almost immediately an old lady in a lace cap, who
      greeted me with gentle courtesy, and knocked at a little door with
      glistening panels. The latch was lifted by Mr. Cheyne himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Paret,&rdquo; he said, in a tone that was unexpectedly hospitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have rarely seen a more inviting room. A wood fire burned brightly on
      the brass andirons, flinging its glare on the big, white beam that crossed
      the ceiling, and reddening the square panes of the windows in their
      panelled recesses. Between these were rows of books,&mdash;attractive
      books in chased bindings, red and blue; books that appealed to be taken
      down and read. There was a table covered with reviews and magazines in
      neat piles, and a lamp so shaded as to throw its light only on the white
      blotter of the pad. Two easy chairs, covered with flowered chintz, were
      ranged before the fire, in one of which I sank, much bewildered, upon
      being urged to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I utterly failed to recognize &ldquo;Alonzo&rdquo; in this new atmosphere. And he had,
      moreover, dropped the subtly sarcastic manner I was wont to associate with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jolly old house, isn't it?&rdquo; he observed, as though I had casually dropped
      in on him for a chat; and he stood, with his hands behind him stretched to
      the blaze, looking down at me. &ldquo;It was built by a certain Colonel Draper,
      who fought at Louisburg, and afterwards fled to England at the time of the
      Revolution. He couldn't stand the patriots, I'm not so sure that I blame
      him, either. Are you interested in colonial things, Mr. Paret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said I was. If the question had concerned Aztec relics my answer would
      undoubtedly have been the same. And I watched him, dazedly, while he took
      down a silver porringer from the shallow mantel shelf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not a Revere,&rdquo; he said, in a slightly apologetic tone as though to
      forestall a comment, &ldquo;but it's rather good, I think. I picked it up at a
      sale in Dorchester. But I have never been able to identify the coat of
      arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He showed me a ladle, with the names of &ldquo;Patience and William Simpson&rdquo;
       engraved quaintly thereon, and took down other articles in which I managed
      to feign an interest. Finally he seated himself in the chair opposite,
      crossed his feet, putting the tips of his fingers together and gazing into
      the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you thought you could fool me,&rdquo; he said, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became aware of the ticking of a great clock in the corner. My mouth was
      dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to forgive you,&rdquo; he went on, more gravely, &ldquo;for several
      reasons. I don't flatter, as you know. It's because you carried out the
      thing so perfectly that I am led to think you have a gift that may be
      cultivated, Paret. You wrote that theme in the way Peters would have
      written it if he had not been&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;scripturally
      inarticulate. And I trust it may do you some good if I say it was
      something of a literary achievement, if not a moral one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; I faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever,&rdquo; he inquired, lapsing a little into his lecture-room
      manner, &ldquo;seriously thought of literature as a career? Have you ever
      thought of any career seriously?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I once wished to be a writer, sir,&rdquo; I replied tremulously, but refrained
      from telling him of my father's opinion of the profession. Ambition&mdash;a
      purer ambition than I had known for years&mdash;leaped within me at his
      words. He, Alonzo Cheyne, had detected in me the Promethean fire!
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat there until ten o'clock talking to the real Mr. Cheyne, a human Mr.
      Cheyne unknown in the lecture-room. Nor had I suspected one in whom
      cynicism and distrust of undergraduates (of my sort) seemed so ingrained,
      of such idealism. He did not pour it out in preaching; delicately,
      unobtrusively and on the whole rather humorously he managed to present to
      me in a most disillusionizing light that conception of the university held
      by me and my intimate associates. After I had left him I walked the quiet
      streets to behold as through dissolving mists another Harvard, and there
      trembled in my soul like the birth-struggle of a flame something of the
      vision later to be immortalized by St. Gaudens, the spirit of Harvard
      responding to the spirit of the Republic&mdash;to the call of Lincoln, who
      voiced it. The place of that bronze at the corner of Boston Common was as
      yet empty, but I have since stood before it to gaze in wonder at the light
      shining in darkness on mute, uplifted faces, black faces! at Harvard's son
      leading them on that the light might live and prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, too, longed for a Cause into which I might fling myself, in which I
      might lose myself... I halted on the sidewalk to find myself staring from
      the opposite side of the street at a familiar house, my old landlady's,
      Mrs. Bolton's, and summoned up before me was the tired, smiling face of
      Hermann Krebs. Was it because when he had once spoken so crudely of the
      University I had seen the reflection of her spirit in his eyes? A light
      still burned in the extension roof&mdash;Krebs's light; another shone
      dimly through the ground glass of the front door. Obeying a sudden
      impulse, I crossed the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bolton, in the sky-blue wrapper, and looking more forbidding than
      ever, answered the bell. Life had taught her to be indifferent to
      surprises, and it was I who became abruptly embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; she said, as though I had been a frequent
      caller. I had never once darkened her threshold since I had left her
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, and hesitated.... &ldquo;Is Mr. Krebs in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she replied in a lifeless tone, which nevertheless had in it a
      touch of bitterness, &ldquo;I guess there's no reason why you and your friends
      should have known he was sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick!&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Is he very sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I calculate he'll pull through,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sunday the doctor gave him
      up. And no wonder! He hasn't had any proper food since he's be'n here!&rdquo;
       She paused, eyeing me. &ldquo;If you'll excuse me, Mr. Paret, I was just going
      up to him when you rang.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I replied awkwardly. &ldquo;Would you be so kind as to tell him&mdash;when
      he's well enough&mdash;that I came to see him, and that I'm sorry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another pause, and she stood with a hand defensively clutching
      the knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'll tell him,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sense of having been baffled, I turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking back toward the Yard my attention was attracted by a slowly
      approaching cab whose occupants were disturbing the quiet of the night
      with song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shollity&mdash;'tis wine, 'tis wine, that makesh&mdash;shollity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The vehicle drew up in front of a new and commodious building,&mdash;I
      believe the first of those designed to house undergraduates who were
      willing to pay for private bathrooms and other modern luxuries; out of one
      window of the cab protruded a pair of shoeless feet, out of the other a
      hatless head I recognized as belonging to Tom Peters; hence I surmised
      that the feet were his also. The driver got down from the box, and a
      lively argument was begun inside&mdash;for there were other occupants&mdash;as
      to how Mr. Peters was to be disembarked; and I gathered from his frequent
      references to the &ldquo;Shgyptian obelisk&rdquo; that the engineering problem
      presented struck him as similar to the unloading of Cleopatra's Needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful, careful!&rdquo; he cautioned, as certain expelling movements began
      from within, &ldquo;Easy, Ham, you jam-fool, keep the door shut, y'll break me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Jerry, all heave sh'gether!&rdquo; exclaimed a voice from the blackness of
      the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will ye wait a minute, Mr. Durrett, sir?&rdquo; implored the cabdriver. &ldquo;You'll
      be after ruining me cab entirely.&rdquo; (Loud roars and vigorous resistance
      from the obelisk, the cab rocking violently.) &ldquo;This gintleman&rdquo; (meaning
      me) &ldquo;will have him by the head, and I'll get hold of his feet, sir.&rdquo; Which
      he did, after a severe kick in the stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Head'sh all right, Martin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure it is, Mr. Peters. Now will ye rest aisy awhile, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm axphyxiated,&rdquo; cried another voice from the darkness, the mined voice
      of Jerome Kyme, our classmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get the tackles under him!&rdquo; came forth in commanding tones from Conybear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime many windows had been raised and much gratuitous advice
      was being given. The three occupants of the cab's seat who had previously
      clamoured for Mr. Peters' removal, now inconsistently resisted it;
      suddenly he came out with a jerk, and we had him fairly upright on the
      pavement minus a collar and tie and the buttons of his evening waistcoat.
      Those who remained in the cab engaged in a riotous game of hunt the
      slipper, while Tom peered into the dark interior, observing gravely the
      progress of the sport. First flew out an overcoat and a much-battered hat,
      finally the pumps, all of which in due time were adjusted to his person,
      and I started home with him, with much parting counsel from the other
      three.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereinell were you, Hughie?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Hunted all over for you. Had
      a sousin' good time. Went to Babcock's&mdash;had champagne&mdash;then to
      see Babesh in&mdash;th'&mdash;Woods. Ham knows one of the Babesh had
      supper with four of 'em. Nice Babesh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven's sake don't step on me again!&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh'poloshize, old man. But y'know I'm William Shakespheare. C'n do what I
      damplease.&rdquo; He halted in the middle of the street and recited
      dramatically:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;'Not marble, nor th' gilded monuments
     Of prinches sh'll outlive m' powerful rhyme.'&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's that, Alonzho, b'gosh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you learn it?&rdquo; I demanded, momentarily forgetting his
      condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fr'm Ralph,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;says I wrote it. Can't remember....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After I had got him to bed,&mdash;a service I had learned to perform with
      more or less proficiency,&mdash;I sat down to consider the events of the
      evening, to attempt to get a proportional view. The intensity of my
      disgust was not hypocritical as I gazed through the open door into the
      bedroom and recalled the times when I, too, had been in that condition.
      Tom Peters drunk, and sleeping it off, was deplorable, without doubt; but
      Hugh Paret drunk was detestable, and had no excuse whatever. Nor did I
      mean by this to set myself on a higher ethical plane, for I felt nothing
      but despair and humility. In my state of clairvoyance I perceived that he
      was a better man, than I, and that his lapses proceeded from a love of
      liquor and the transcendent sense of good-fellowship that liquor brings.

    <h2>
      VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The crisis through which I passed at Cambridge, inaugurated by the events
      I have just related, I find very difficult to portray. It was a religious
      crisis, of course, and my most pathetic memory concerning it is of the
      vain attempts to connect my yearnings and discontents with the theology I
      had been taught; I began in secret to read my Bible, yet nothing I hit
      upon seemed to point a way out of my present predicament, to give any
      definite clew to the solution of my life. I was not mature enough to
      reflect that orthodoxy was a Sunday religion unrelated to a world whose
      wheels were turned by the motives of self-interest; that it consisted of
      ideals not deemed practical, since no attempt was made to put them into
      practice in the only logical manner,&mdash;by reorganizing civilization to
      conform with them. The implication was that the Christ who had preached
      these ideals was not practical.... There were undoubtedly men in the
      faculty of the University who might have helped me had I known of them;
      who might have given me, even at that time, a clew to the modern, logical
      explanation of the Bible as an immortal record of the thoughts and acts of
      men who had sought to do just what I was seeking to do,&mdash;connect the
      religious impulse to life and make it fruitful in life: an explanation, by
      the way, a thousand-fold more spiritual than the old. But I was hopelessly
      entangled in the meshes of the mystic, the miraculous and supernatural. If
      I had analyzed my yearnings, I might have realized that I wanted to
      renounce the life I had been leading, not because it was sinful, but
      because it was aimless. I had not learned that the Greek word for sin is
      &ldquo;a missing of the mark.&rdquo; Just aimlessness! I had been stirred with the
      desire to perform some service for which the world would be grateful: to
      write great literature, perchance. But it had never been suggested to me
      that such swellings of the soul are religious, that religion is that kind
      of feeling, of motive power that drives the writer and the scientist, the
      statesman and the sculptor as well as the priest and the Prophet to serve
      mankind for the joy of serving: that religion is creative, or it is
      nothing: not mechanical, not a force imposed from without, but a driving
      power within. The &ldquo;religion&rdquo; I had learned was salvation from sin by
      miracle: sin a deliberate rebellion, not a pathetic missing of the mark of
      life; useful service of man, not the wandering of untutored souls who had
      not been shown the way. I felt religious. I wanted to go to church, I
      wanted to maintain, when it was on me, that exaltation I dimly felt as
      communion with a higher power, with God, and which also was identical with
      my desire to write, to create....
    </p>
    <p>
      I bought books, sets of Wordsworth and Keats, of Milton and Shelley and
      Shakespeare, and hid them away in my bureau drawers lest Tom and my
      friends should see them. These too I read secretly, making excuses for not
      joining in the usual amusements. Once I walked to Mrs. Bolton's and
      inquired rather shamefacedly for Hermann Krebs, only to be informed that
      he had gone out.... There were lapses, of course, when I went off on the
      old excursions,&mdash;for the most part the usual undergraduate follies,
      though some were of a more serious nature; on these I do not care to
      dwell. Sex was still a mystery.... Always I awoke afterwards to bitter
      self-hatred and despair.... But my work in English improved, and I earned
      the commendation and friendship of Mr. Cheyne. With a wisdom for which I
      was grateful he was careful not to give much sign of it in classes, but
      the fact that he was &ldquo;getting soft on me&rdquo; was evident enough to be
      regarded with suspicion. Indeed the state into which I had fallen became a
      matter of increasing concern to my companions, who tried every means from
      ridicule to sympathy, to discover its cause and shake me out of it. The
      theory most accepted was that I was in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on now, Hughie&mdash;tell me who she is. I won't give you away,&rdquo; Tom
      would beg. Once or twice, indeed, I had imagined I was in love with the
      sisters of Boston classmates whose dances I attended; to these parties
      Tom, not having overcome his diffidence in respect to what he called
      &ldquo;social life,&rdquo; never could be induced to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Ralph who detected the true cause of my discontent. Typical as no
      other man I can recall of the code to which we had dedicated ourselves,
      the code that moulded the important part of the undergraduate world and
      defied authority, he regarded any defection from it in the light of
      treason. An instructor, in a fit of impatience, had once referred to him
      as the Mephistopheles of his class; he had fatal attractions, and a
      remarkable influence. His favourite pastime was the capricious exercise of
      his will on weaker characters, such as his cousin, Ham Durrett; if they
      &ldquo;swore off,&rdquo; Ralph made it his business to get them drunk again, and
      having accomplished this would proceed himself to administer a new oath
      and see that it was kept. Alcohol seemed to have no effect whatever on
      him. Though he was in the class above me, I met him frequently at a club
      to which I had the honour to belong, then a suite of rooms over a shop
      furnished with a pool and a billiard table, easy-chairs and a bar. It has
      since achieved the dignity of a house of its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were having, one evening, a &ldquo;religious&rdquo; argument, Cinibar, Laurens and
      myself and some others. I can't recall how it began; I think Cinibar had
      attacked the institution of compulsory chapel, which nobody defended;
      there was something inherently wrong, he maintained, with a religion to
      which men had to be driven against their wills. Somewhat to my surprise I
      found myself defending a Christianity out of which I had been able to
      extract but little comfort and solace. Neither Laurens nor Conybear,
      however, were for annihilating it: although they took the other side of
      the discussion of a subject of which none of us knew anything, their
      attacks were but half-hearted; like me, they were still under the spell
      exerted by a youthful training.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all of us aware of Ralph, who sat at some distance looking over
      the pages of an English sporting weekly. Presently he flung it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you found out yet that man created God, Hughie?&rdquo; he inquired.
      &ldquo;And even if there were a personal God, what reason have you to think that
      man would be his especial concern, or any concern of his whatever? The
      discovery of evolution has knocked your Christianity into a cocked hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I don't remember how I answered him. In spite of the superficiality of his
      own arguments, which I was not learned enough to detect, I was
      ingloriously routed. Darwin had kicked over the bucket, and that was all
      there was to it.... After we had left the club both Conybear and Laurens
      admitted they were somewhat disturbed, declaring that Ralph had gone too
      far. I spent a miserable night, recalling the naturalistic assertions he
      had made so glibly, asking myself again and again how it was that the
      religion to which I so vainly clung had no greater effect on my actions
      and on my will, had not prevented me from lapses into degradation. And I
      hated myself for having argued upon a subject that was still sacred. I
      believed in Christ, which is to say that I believed that in some
      inscrutable manner he existed, continued to dominate the world and had
      suffered on my account.
    </p>
    <p>
      To whom should I go now for a confirmation of my wavering beliefs? One of
      the results&mdash;it will be remembered of religion as I was taught it was
      a pernicious shyness, and even though I had found a mentor and confessor,
      I might have hesitated to unburden myself. This would be different from
      arguing with Ralph Hambleton. In my predicament, as I was wandering
      through the yard, I came across a notice of an evening talk to students in
      Holder Chapel, by a clergyman named Phillips Brooks. This was before the
      time, let me say in passing, when his sermons at Harvard were attended by
      crowds of undergraduates. Well, I stood staring at the notice, debating
      whether I should go, trying to screw up my courage; for I recognized
      clearly that such a step, if it were to be of any value, must mean a
      distinct departure from my present mode of life; and I recall thinking
      with a certain revulsion that I should have to &ldquo;turn good.&rdquo; My presence at
      the meeting would be known the next day to all my friends, for the idea of
      attending a religious gathering when one was not forced to do so by the
      authorities was unheard of in our set. I should be classed with the
      despised &ldquo;pious ones&rdquo; who did such things regularly. I shrank from the
      ridicule. I had, however, heard of Mr. Brooks from Ned Symonds, who was by
      no means of the pious type, and whose parents attended Mr. Brooks's church
      in Boston.... I left my decision in abeyance. But when evening came I
      stole away from the club table, on the plea of an engagement, and made my
      way rapidly toward Holder Chapel. I had almost reached it&mdash;when I
      caught a glimpse of Symonds and of some others approaching,&mdash;and I
      went on, to turn again. By this time the meeting, which was in a room on
      the second floor, had already begun. Palpitating, I climbed the steps; the
      door of the room was slightly ajar; I looked in; I recall a distinct
      sensation of surprise,&mdash;the atmosphere of that meeting was so
      different from what I had expected. Not a &ldquo;pious&rdquo; atmosphere at all! I saw
      a very tall and heavy gentleman, dressed in black, who sat, wholly at
      ease, on the table! One hand was in his pocket, one foot swung clear of
      the ground; and he was not preaching, but talking in an easy,
      conversational tone to some forty young men who sat intent on his words. I
      was too excited to listen to what he was saying, I was making a vain
      attempt to classify him. But I remember the thought, for it struck me with
      force,&mdash;that if Christianity were so thoroughly discredited by
      evolution, as Ralph Hambleton and other agnostics would have one believe,
      why should this remarkably sane and able-looking person be standing up for
      it as though it were still an established and incontrovertible fact?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not, certainly, the air of a dupe or a sentimentalist, but inspired
      confidence by his very personality. Youthlike, I watched him narrowly for
      flaws, for oratorical tricks, for all kinds of histrionic symptoms. Again
      I was near the secret; again it escaped me. The argument for Christianity
      lay not in assertions about it, but in being it. This man was
      Christianity.... I must have felt something of this, even though I failed
      to formulate it. And unconsciously I contrasted his strength, which
      reinforced the atmosphere of the room, with that of Ralph Hambleton, who
      was, a greater influence over me than I have recorded, and had come to
      sway me more and more, as he had swayed others. The strength of each was
      impressive, yet this Mr. Brooks seemed to me the bodily presentment of a
      set of values which I would have kept constantly before my eyes.... I felt
      him drawing me, overcoming my hesitation, belittling my fear of ridicule.
      I began gently to open the door&mdash;when something happened,&mdash;one
      of those little things that may change the course of a life. The door made
      little noise, yet one of the men sitting in the back of the room chanced
      to look around, and I recognized Hermann Krebs. His face was still sunken
      from his recent illness. Into his eyes seemed to leap a sudden appeal, an
      appeal to which my soul responded yet I hurried down the stairs and into
      the street. Instantly I regretted my retreat, I would have gone back, but
      lacked the courage; and I strayed unhappily for hours, now haunted by that
      look of Krebs, now wondering what the remarkably sane-looking and informal
      clergyman whose presence dominated the little room had been talking about.
      I never learned, but I did live to read his biography, to discover what he
      might have talked about,&mdash;for he if any man believed that life and
      religion are one, and preached consecration to life's task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of little use to speculate whether the message, had I learned it then,
      would have fortified and transformed me!
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the fact that I was unable to relate to a satisfying
      conception of religion my new-born determination, I made up my mind, at
      least, to renounce my tortuous ways. I had promised my father to be a
      lawyer; I would keep my promise, I would give the law a fair trial; later
      on, perhaps, I might demonstrate an ability to write. All very
      praiseworthy! The season was Lent, a fitting time for renunciations and
      resolves. Although I had more than once fallen from grace, I believed
      myself at last to have settled down on my true course&mdash;when something
      happened. The devil interfered subtly, as usual&mdash;now in the person of
      Jerry Kyme. It should be said in justice to Jerry that he did not look the
      part. He had sunny-red, curly hair, mischievous blue eyes with long
      lashes, and he harboured no respect whatever for any individual or
      institution, sacred or profane; he possessed, however, a shrewd sense of
      his own value, as many innocent and unsuspecting souls discovered as early
      as our freshman year, and his method of putting down the presumptuous was
      both effective and unique. If he liked you, there could be no mistake
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening when I was engaged in composing a theme for Mr. Cheyne on no
      less a subject than the interpretation of the work of William Wordsworth,
      I found myself unexpectedly sprawling on the floor, in my descent kicking
      the table so vigorously as to send the ink-well a foot or two toward the
      ceiling. This, be it known, was a typical proof of Jerry's esteem. For he
      had entered noiselessly, jerking the back of my chair, which chanced to be
      tilted, and stood with his hands in his pockets, surveying the ruin he had
      wrought, watching the ink as it trickled on the carpet. Then he picked up
      the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poetry, you darned old grind!&rdquo; he exclaimed disgustedly. &ldquo;Say, Parry, I
      don't know what's got into you, but I want you to come home with me for
      the Easter holidays. It'll do you good. We'll be on the Hudson, you know,
      and we'll manage to make life bearable somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I forgot my irritation, in sheer surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's mighty good of you, Jerry&mdash;&rdquo; I began, struggling to my
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rot!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I shouldn't ask you if I didn't want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no denying the truth of this, and after he had gone I sat for a
      long time with my pen in my mouth, reflecting as to whether or not I
      should go. For I had the instinct that here was another cross-roads, that
      more depended on my decision than I cared to admit. But even then I knew
      what I should do. Ridiculous not to&mdash;I told myself. How could a week
      or ten days with Jerry possibly affect my newborn, resolve?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the prospect, now, of a visit to the Kymes' was by no means so glowing
      as it once would have been. For I had seen visions, I had dreamed dreams,
      beheld a delectable country of my very own. A year ago&mdash;nay, even a
      month ago&mdash;how such an invitation would have glittered!... I returned
      at length to my theme, over which, before Jerry's arrival, I had been
      working feverishly. But now the glamour had gone from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Tom came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyone been here?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jerry,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wanted me to go home with him at Easter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I haven't decided.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd be a fool not to,&rdquo; was Tom's comment. It voiced, succinctly, a
      prevailing opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the conclusion I arrived at in my own mind. But just why I had been
      chosen for the honour, especially at such a time, was a riddle. Jerry's
      invitations were charily given, and valued accordingly; and more than
      once, at our table, I had felt a twinge of envy when Conybear or someone
      else had remarked, with the proper nonchalance, in answer to a question,
      that they were going to Weathersfield. Such was the name of the Kyme
      place....
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall never forget the impression made on me by the decorous luxury of
      that big house, standing amidst its old trees, halfway up the gentle slope
      that rose steadily from the historic highway where poor Andre was
      captured. I can see now the heavy stone pillars of its portico vignetted
      in a flush of tenderest green, the tulips just beginning to flame forth
      their Easter colours in the well-kept beds, the stately, well-groomed
      evergreens, the vivid lawns, the clipped hedges. And like an overwhelming
      wave of emotion that swept all before it, the impressiveness of wealth
      took possession of me. For here was a kind of wealth I had never known,
      that did not exist in the West, nor even in the still Puritan environs of
      Boston where I had visited. It took itself for granted, proclaimed itself
      complacently to have solved all problems. By ignoring them, perhaps. But I
      was too young to guess this. It was order personified, gaining effect at
      every turn by a multitude of details too trivial to mention were it not
      for the fact that they entered deeply into my consciousness, until they
      came to represent, collectively, the very flower of achievement. It was a
      wealth that accepted tribute calmly, as of inherent right. Law and
      tradition defended its sanctity more effectively than troops. Literature
      descended from her high altar to lend it dignity; and the long, silent
      library displayed row upon row of the masters, appropriately clad in
      morocco or calf,&mdash;Smollett, Macaulay, Gibbon, Richardson, Fielding,
      Scott, Dickens, Irving and Thackeray, as though each had striven for a
      tablet here. Art had denied herself that her canvases might be hung on
      these walls; and even the Church, on that first Sunday of my visit, forgot
      the blood of her martyrs that she might adorn an appropriate niche in the
      setting. The clergyman, at one of the dinner parties, gravely asked a
      blessing as upon an Institution that included and absorbed all other
      institutions in its being....
    </p>
    <p>
      The note of that house was a tempered gaiety. Guests arrived from New
      York, spent the night and departed again without disturbing the even tenor
      of its ways. Unobtrusive servants ministered to their wants,&mdash;and to
      mine....
    </p>
    <p>
      Conybear was there, and two classmates from Boston, and we were treated
      with the amiable tolerance accorded to college youths and intimates of the
      son of the house. One night there was a dance in our honour. Nor have I
      forgotten Jerry's sister, Nathalie, whom I had met at Class Days, a slim
      and willowy, exotic young lady of the Botticelli type, with a crown of
      burnished hair, yet more suggestive of a hothouse than of spring. She
      spoke English with a French accent. Capricious, impulsive, she captured my
      interest because she put a high value on her favour; she drove me over the
      hills, informing me at length that I was sympathique&mdash;different from
      the rest; in short, she emphasized and intensified what I may call the
      Weathersfield environment, stirred up in me new and vague aspirations that
      troubled yet excited me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was Mrs. Kyme, a pretty, light-hearted lady, still young, who seemed
      to have no intention of growing older, who romped and played songs for us
      on the piano. The daughter of an old but now impecunious Westchester
      family, she had been born to adorn the position she held, she was adapted
      by nature to wring from it the utmost of the joys it offered. From her,
      rather than from her husband, both of the children seemed to have
      inherited. I used to watch Mr. Grosvenor Kyme as he sat at the end of the
      dinner-table, dark, preoccupied, taciturn, symbolical of a wealth new to
      my experience, and which had about it a certain fabulous quality. It
      toiled not, neither did it spin, but grew as if by magic, day and night,
      until the very conception of it was overpowering. What must it be to have
      had ancestors who had been clever enough to sit still until a congested
      and discontented Europe had begun to pour its thousands and hundreds of
      thousands into the gateway of the western world, until that gateway had
      become a metropolis? ancestors, of course, possessing what now suddenly
      appeared to me as the most desirable of gifts&mdash;since it reaped so
      dazzling a harvest-business foresight. From time to time these ancestors
      had continued to buy desirable corners, which no amount of persuasion had
      availed to make them relinquish. Lease them, yes; sell them, never! By
      virtue of such a system wealth was as inevitable as human necessity; and
      the thought of human necessity did not greatly bother me. Mr. Kyme's
      problem of life was not one of making money, but of investing it. One
      became automatically a personage....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was due to one of those singular coincidences&mdash;so interesting a
      subject for speculation&mdash;that the man who revealed to me this golden
      romance of the Kyme family was none other than a resident of my own city,
      Mr. Theodore Watling, now become one of our most important and influential
      citizens; a corporation lawyer, new and stimulating qualification,
      suggesting as it did, a deus ex machina of great affairs. That he, of all
      men, should come to Weathersfield astonished me, since I was as yet to
      make the connection between that finished, decorous, secluded existence
      and the source of its being. The evening before my departure he arrived in
      company with two other gentlemen, a Mr. Talbot and a Mr. Saxes, whose
      names were spoken with respect in a sphere of which I had hitherto taken
      but little cognizance-Wall Street. Conybear informed me that they were
      &ldquo;magnates,&rdquo;... We were sitting in the drawing-room at tea, when they
      entered with Mr. Watling, and no sooner had he spoken to Mrs. Kyme than
      his quick eye singled me out of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hugh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, taking my hand. &ldquo;I had no idea I should meet
      you here&mdash;I saw your father only last week, the day I left home.&rdquo; And
      he added, turning to Mrs. Kyme, &ldquo;Hugh is the son of Mr. Matthew Paret, who
      has been the leader of our bar for many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recognition and the tribute to my father were so graciously given that
      I warmed with gratitude and pride, while Mr. Kyme smiled a little,
      remarking that I was a friend of Jerry's. Theodore Watling, for being
      here, had suddenly assumed in my eyes a considerable consequence, though
      the note he struck in that house was a strange one. It was, however, his
      own note, and had a certain distinction, a ring of independence, of the
      knowledge of self-worth. Dinner at Weathersfield we youngsters had usually
      found rather an oppressive ceremony, with its shaded lights and precise
      ritual over which Mr. Kyme presided like a high priest; conversation had
      been restrained. That night, as Johnnie Laurens afterwards expressed it,
      &ldquo;things loosened up,&rdquo; and Mr. Watling was responsible for the loosening.
      Taking command of the Kyme dinner table appeared to me to be no mean
      achievement, but this is just what he did, without being vulgar or noisy
      or assertive. Suavitar in modo, forbiter in re. If, as I watched him there
      with a newborn pride and loyalty, I had paused to reconstruct the idea
      that the mention of his name would formerly have evoked, I suppose I
      should have found him falling short of my notion of a gentleman; it had
      been my father's opinion; but Mr. Watling's marriage to Gene Hollister's
      aunt had given him a standing with us at home. He possessed virility,
      vitality in a remarkable degree, yet some elusive quality that was neither
      tact nor delicacy&mdash;though related to these differentiated him from
      the commonplace, self-made man of ability. He was just off the type. To
      liken him to a clothing store model of a well-built, broad-shouldered man
      with a firm neck, a handsome, rather square face not lacking in colour and
      a conventional, drooping moustache would be slanderous; yet he did suggest
      it. Suggesting it, he redeemed it: and the middle western burr in his
      voice was rather attractive than otherwise. He had not so much the air of
      belonging there, as of belonging anywhere&mdash;one of those anomalistic
      American citizens of the world who go abroad and make intimates of
      princes. Before the meal was over he had inspired me with loyalty and
      pride, enlisted the admiration of Jerry and Conybear and Johnnie Laurens;
      we followed him into the smoking-room, sitting down in a row on a leather
      lounge behind our elders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, now that the gentlemen were alone, there was an inspiring largeness
      in their talk that fired the imagination. The subject was investments, at
      first those of coal and iron in my own state, for Mr. Watling, it
      appeared, was counsel for the Boyne Iron Works.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will pay you to keep an eye on that company, Mr. Kyme,&rdquo; he said,
      knocking the ashes from his cigar. &ldquo;Now that old Mr. Durrett's gone&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say Nathaniel Durrett's dead!&rdquo; said Mr. Kyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old regime passed with him. Adolf Scherer succeeds him, and you may
      take my word for it, he's a coming man. Mr. Durrett, who was a judge of
      men, recognized that. Scherer was an emigrant, he had ideas, and rose to
      be a foreman. For the last few years Mr. Durrett threw everything on his
      shoulders....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little by little the scope of the discussion was enlarged until it ranged
      over a continent, touching lightly upon lines of railroad, built or
      projected, across the great west our pioneers had so lately succeeded in
      wresting from the savages, upon mines of copper and gold hidden away among
      the mountains, and millions of acres of forest and grazing lands which a
      complacent government would relinquish provided certain technicalities
      were met: touching lightly, too, very lightly,&mdash;upon senators and
      congressmen at Washington. And for the first time I learned that not the
      least of the functions of these representatives of the people was to act
      as the medium between capital and investment, to facilitate the handing
      over of the Republic's resources to those in a position to develop them.
      The emphasis was laid on development, or rather on the resulting
      prosperity for the country: that was the justification, and it was taken
      for granted as supreme. Nor was it new to me; this cult of prosperity. I
      recalled the torch-light processions of the tariff enthusiasts of my
      childhood days, my father's championship of the Republican Party. He had
      not idealized politicians, either. For the American, politics and ethics
      were strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I listened with increasing fascination to these gentlemen in evening
      clothes calmly treating the United States as a melon patch that existed
      largely for the purpose of being divided up amongst a limited and favored
      number of persons. I had a feeling of being among the initiated. Where, it
      may be asked, were my ideals? Let it not be supposed that I believed
      myself to have lost them. If so, the impression I have given of myself has
      been wholly inadequate. No, they had been transmuted, that is all,
      transmuted by the alchemy of Weathersfield, by the personality of Theodore
      Watling into brighter visions. My eyes rarely left his face; I hung on his
      talk, which was interspersed with native humour, though he did not always
      join in the laughter, sometimes gazing at the fire, as though his keen
      mind were grappling with a problem suggested. I noted the respect in which
      his opinions were held, and my imagination was fired by an impression of
      the power to be achieved by successful men of his profession, by the
      evidence of their indispensability to capital itself.... At last when the
      gentlemen rose and were leaving the room, Mr. Watling lingered, with his
      hand on my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you're going through the Law School, Hugh,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; he exclaimed emphatically. &ldquo;The law, to-day, is more of a career
      than ever, especially for a young man with your antecedents and
      advantages, and I know of no city in the United States where I would
      rather start practice, if I were a young man, than ours. In the next
      twenty years we shall see a tremendous growth. Of course you'll be going
      into your father's office. You couldn't do better. But I'll keep an eye on
      you, and perhaps I'll be able to help you a little, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      A famous artist, who started out in youth to embrace a military career and
      who failed to pass an examination at West Point, is said to have remarked
      that if silicon had been a gas he would have been a soldier. I am afraid I
      may have given the impression that if I had not gone to Weathersfield and
      encountered Mr. Watling I might not have been a lawyer. This impression
      would be misleading. And while it is certain that I have not exaggerated
      the intensity of the spiritual experience I went through at Cambridge, a
      somewhat belated consideration for the truth compels me to register my
      belief that the mood would in any case have been ephemeral. The poison
      generated by the struggle of my nature with its environment had sunk too
      deep, and the very education that was supposed to make a practical man of
      me had turned me into a sentimentalist. I became, as will be seen,
      anything but a practical man in the true sense, though the world in which
      I had been brought up and continued to live deemed me such. My father was
      greatly pleased when I wrote him that I was now more than ever convinced
      of the wisdom of choosing the law as my profession, and was satisfied that
      I had come to my senses at last. He had still been prepared to see me &ldquo;go
      off at a tangent,&rdquo; as he expressed it. On the other hand, the powerful
      effect of the appeal made by Weathersfield and Mr. Watling must not be
      underestimated. Here in one object lesson was emphasized a host of
      suggestions each of which had made its impression. And when I returned to
      Cambridge Alonzo Cheyne knew that he had lost me....
    </p>
    <p>
      I pass over the rest of my college course, and the years I spent at the
      Harvard Law School, where were instilled into me without difficulty the
      dictums that the law was the most important of all professions, that those
      who entered it were a priestly class set aside to guard from profanation
      that Ark of the Covenant, the Constitution of the United States. In short,
      I was taught law precisely as I had been taught religion,&mdash;scriptural
      infallibility over again,&mdash;a static law and a static theology,&mdash;a
      set of concepts that were supposed to be equal to any problems
      civilization would have to meet until the millennium. What we are wont to
      call wisdom is often naively innocent of impending change. It has no
      barometric properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall content myself with relating one incident only of this period. In
      the January of my last year I went with a party of young men and girls to
      stay over Sunday at Beverly Farms, where Mrs. Fremantle&mdash;a young
      Boston matron had opened her cottage for the occasion. This &ldquo;cottage,&rdquo; a
      roomy, gabled structure, stood on a cliff, at the foot of which roared the
      wintry Atlantic, while we danced and popped corn before the open fires.
      During the daylight hours we drove about the country in sleighs, or made
      ridiculous attempts to walk on snow-shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday afternoon, left temporarily to my own devices, I wandered along
      the cliff, crossing into the adjoining property. The wind had fallen; the
      waves, much subdued, broke rhythmically against the rocks; during the
      night a new mantle of snow had been spread, and the clouds were still low
      and menacing. As I strolled I became aware of a motionless figure ahead of
      me,&mdash;one that seemed oddly familiar; the set of the shabby overcoat
      on the stooping shoulders, the unconscious pose contributed to a certain
      sharpness of individuality; in the act of challenging my memory, I halted.
      The man was gazing at the seascape, and his very absorption gave me a
      sudden and unfamiliar thrill. The word absorption precisely expresses my
      meaning, for he seemed indeed to have become a part of his surroundings,&mdash;an
      harmonious part. Presently he swung about and looked at me as though he
      had expected to find me there&mdash;and greeted me by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Krebs!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, and flung out his arm, indicating the scene. His eyes at that
      moment seemed to reflect the sea,&mdash;they made the gaunt face suddenly
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This reminds me of a Japanese print,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words, or the tone in which he spoke, curiously transformed the
      picture. It was as if I now beheld it, anew, through his vision: the grey
      water stretching eastward to melt into the grey sky, the massed, black
      trees on the hillside, powdered with white, the snow in rounded, fantastic
      patches on the huge boulders at the foot of the cliff. Krebs did not seem
      like a stranger, but like one whom I had known always,&mdash;one who stood
      in a peculiar relationship between me and something greater I could not
      define. The impression was fleeting, but real.... I remember wondering how
      he could have known anything about Japanese prints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't think you were still in this part of the country,&rdquo; I remarked
      awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a reporter on a Boston newspaper, and I've been sent up here to
      interview old Mr. Dome, who lives in that house,&rdquo; and he pointed to a roof
      above the trees. &ldquo;There is a rumour, which I hope to verify, that he has
      just given a hundred thousand dollars to the University.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;won't he see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At present he's taking a nap,&rdquo; said Krebs. &ldquo;He comes here occasionally
      for a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like interviewing?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I see a good many different kinds of people, and that's
      interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;being a reporter?&rdquo; I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This continued patronage was not a conscious expression of superiority on
      my part, but he did not seem to resent it. He had aroused my curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going into the law,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet confidence with which he spoke aroused, suddenly, a twinge of
      antagonism. He had every right to go into the law, of course, and yet!...
      my query would have made it evident to me, had I been introspective in
      those days, that the germ of the ideal of the profession, implanted by Mr.
      Watling, was expanding. Were not influential friends necessary for the
      proper kind of career? and where were Krebs's? In spite of the history of
      Daniel Webster and a long line of American tradition, I felt an
      incongruity in my classmate's aspiration. And as he stood there, gaunt and
      undoubtedly hungry, his eyes kindling, I must vaguely have classed him
      with the revolutionaries of all the ages; must have felt in him,
      instinctively, a menace to the stability of that Order with which I had
      thrown my fortunes. And yet there were comparatively poor men in the Law
      School itself who had not made me feel this way! He had impressed me
      against my will, taken me by surprise, commiseration had been mingled with
      other feelings that sprang out of the memory of the night I had called on
      him, when he had been sick. Now I resented something in him which Tom
      Peters had called &ldquo;crust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law!&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;even when I was a boy, working at odd jobs, I used to
      think if I could ever be a lawyer I should have reached the top notch of
      human dignity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more his smile disarmed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&rdquo; I asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it was an ideal with me, I suppose. My father was responsible
      for that. He had the German temperament of '48, and when he fled to this
      country, he expected to find Utopia.&rdquo; The smile emerged again, like the
      sun shining through clouds, while fascination and antagonism again
      struggled within me. &ldquo;And then came frightful troubles. For years he could
      get only enough work to keep him and my mother alive, but he never lost
      his faith in America. 'It is man,' he would say, 'man has to grow up to it&mdash;to
      liberty.' Without the struggle, liberty would be worth nothing. And he
      used to tell me that we must all do our part, we who had come here, and
      not expect everything to be done for us. He had made that mistake. If
      things were bad, why, put a shoulder to the wheel and help to make them
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That helped me,&rdquo; he continued, after a moment's pause. &ldquo;For I've seen a
      good many things, especially since I've been working for a newspaper. I've
      seen, again and again, the power of the law turned against those whom it
      was intended to protect, I've seen lawyers who care a great deal more
      about winning cases than they do about justice, who prostitute their
      profession to profit making,&mdash;profit making for themselves and
      others. And they are often the respectable lawyers, too, men of high
      standing, whom you would not think would do such things. They are on the
      side of the powerful, and the best of them are all retained by rich men
      and corporations. And what is the result? One of the worst evils, I think,
      that can befall a country. The poor man goes less and less to the courts.
      He is getting bitter, which is bad, which is dangerous. But men won't see
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was on my tongue to refute this, to say that everybody had a chance. I
      could indeed recall many arguments that had been drilled into me;
      quotations, even, from court decisions. But something prevented me from
      doing this,&mdash;something in his manner, which was neither argumentative
      nor combative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why I am going into the law,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And I intend to stay in
      it if I can keep alive. It's a great chance for me&mdash;for all of us.
      Aren't you at the Law School?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. Once more, as his earnest glance fell upon me, came that
      suggestion of a subtle, inexplicable link between us; but before I could
      reply, steps were heard behind us, and an elderly servant, bareheaded, was
      seen coming down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the reporter?&rdquo; he demanded somewhat impatiently of Krebs. &ldquo;If you
      want to see Mr. Dome, you'd better come right away. He's going out for a
      drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a while, after he had shaken my hand and departed, I stood in the
      snow, looking after him....

      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the Wednesday of that same week the news of my father's sudden and
      serious illness came to me in a telegram, and by the time I arrived at
      home it was too late to see him again alive. It was my first experience
      with death, and what perplexed me continually during the following days
      was an inability to feel the loss more deeply. When a child, I had been
      easily shaken by the spectacle of sorrow. Had I, during recent years, as a
      result of a discovery that emotions arising from human relationships lead
      to discomfort and suffering, deliberately been forming a shell, until now
      I was incapable of natural feelings? Of late I had seemed closer to my
      father, and his letters, though formal, had given evidence of his
      affection; in his repressed fashion he had made it clear that he looked
      forward to the time when I was to practise with him. Why was it then, as I
      gazed upon his fine features in death, that I experienced no intensity of
      sorrow? What was it in me that would not break down? He seemed worn and
      tired, yet I had never thought of him as weary, never attributed to him
      any yearning. And now he was released.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wondered what had been his private thoughts about himself, his private
      opinions about life; and when I reflect now upon my lack of real knowledge
      at five and twenty, I am amazed at the futility of an expensive education
      which had failed to impress upon me the simple, basic fact that life was
      struggle; that either development or retrogression is the fate of all men,
      that characters are never completely made, but always in the making. I had
      merely a disconcerting glimpse of this truth, with no powers of
      formulation, as I sat beside my mother in the bedroom, where every article
      evoked some childhood scene. Here was the dent in the walnut foot-board of
      the bed made, one wintry day, by the impact of my box of blocks; the big
      arm-chair, covered with I know not what stiff embroidery, which had served
      on countless occasions as a chariot driven to victory. I even remembered
      how every Wednesday morning I had been banished from the room, which had
      been so large a part of my childhood universe, when Ella, the housemaid,
      had flung open all its windows and crowded its furniture into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of my wanderings since then became poignant, almost
      terrifying. The room, with all its memories, was unchanged. How safe I had
      been within its walls! Why could I not have been, content with what it
      represented? of tradition, of custom,&mdash;of religion? And what was it
      within me that had lured me away from these?
    </p>
    <p>
      I was miserable, indeed, but my misery was not of the kind I thought it
      ought to be. At moments, when my mother relapsed into weeping, I glanced
      at her almost in wonder. Such sorrow as hers was incomprehensible. Once
      she surprised and discomfited me by lifting her head and gazing fixedly at
      me through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recall certain impressions of the funeral. There, among the
      pall-bearers, was my Cousin Robert Breck, tears in the furrows of his
      cheeks. Had he loved my father more than I? The sight of his grief moved
      me suddenly and strongly.... It seemed an age since I had worked in his
      store, and yet here he was still, coming to town every morning and
      returning every evening to Claremore, loving his friends, and mourning
      them one by one. Was this, the spectacle presented by my Cousin Robert,
      the reward of earthly existence? Were there no other prizes save those
      known as greatness of character and depth of human affections? Cousin
      Robert looked worn and old. The other pall-bearers, men of weight, of long
      standing in the community, were aged, too; Mr. Blackwood, and Mr. Jules
      Hollister; and out of place, somehow, in this new church building. It came
      to me abruptly that the old order was gone,&mdash;had slipped away during
      my absence. The church I had known in boyhood had been torn down to make
      room for a business building on Boyne Street; the edifice in which I sat
      was expensive, gave forth no distinctive note; seemingly transitory with
      its hybrid interior, its shiny oak and blue and red organ-pipes,
      betokening a compromised and weakened faith. Nondescript, likewise, seemed
      the new minister, Mr. Randlett, as he prayed unctuously in front of the
      flowers massed on the platform. I vaguely resented his laudatory
      references to my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old church, with its severity, had actually stood for something. It
      was the Westminster Catechism in wood and stone, and Dr. Pound had been
      the human incarnation of that catechism, the fit representative of a
      wrathful God, a militant shepherd who had guarded with vigilance his
      respectable flock, who had protested vehemently against the sins of the
      world by which they were surrounded, against the &ldquo;dogs, and sorcerers, and
      whoremongers, and murderers and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh
      a lie.&rdquo; How Dr. Pound would have put the emphasis of the Everlasting into
      those words!
    </p>
    <p>
      Against what was Mr. Randlett protesting?
    </p>
    <p>
      My glance wandered to the pews which held the committees from various
      organizations, such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Bar Association,
      which had come to do honour to my father. And there, differentiated from
      the others, I saw the spruce, alert figure of Theodore Watling. He, too,
      represented a new type and a new note,&mdash;this time a forceful note, a
      secular note that had not belonged to the old church, and seemed likewise
      anomalistic in the new....
    </p>
    <p>
      During the long, slow journey in the carriage to the cemetery my mother
      did not raise her veil. It was not until she reached out and seized my
      hand, convulsively, that I realized she was still a part of my existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days that followed I became aware that my father's death had
      removed a restrictive element, that I was free now to take without
      criticism or opposition whatever course in life I might desire. It may be
      that I had apprehended even then that his professional ideals would not
      have coincided with my own. Mingled with this sense of emancipation was a
      curious feeling of regret, of mourning for something I had never valued,
      something fixed and dependable for which he had stood, a rock and a refuge
      of which I had never availed myself!... When his will was opened it was
      found that the property had been left to my mother during her lifetime. It
      was larger than I had thought, four hundred thousand dollars, shrewdly
      invested, for the most part, in city real estate. My father had been very
      secretive as to money matters, and my mother had no interest in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four days later I received in the mail a typewritten letter
      signed by Theodore Watling, expressing sympathy for my bereavement, and
      asking me to drop in on him, down town, before I should leave the city. In
      contrast to the somewhat dingy offices where my father had practised in
      the Blackwood Block, the quarters of Watling, Fowndes and Ripon on the
      eighth floor of the new Durrett Building were modern to a degree, finished
      in oak and floored with marble, with a railed-off space where young women
      with nimble fingers played ceaselessly on typewriters. One of them
      informed me that Mr. Watling was busy, but on reading my card added that
      she would take it in. Meanwhile, in company with two others who may have
      been clients, I waited. This, then, was what it meant to be a lawyer of
      importance, to have, like a Chesterfield, an ante-room where clients
      cooled their heels and awaited one's pleasure...
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman returned, and led me through a corridor to a door on which
      was painted Mr. Wailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recall him tilted back in his chair in a debonnair manner beside his
      polished desk, the hint of a smile on his lips; and leaning close to him
      was a yellow, owl-like person whose eyes, as they turned to me, gave the
      impression of having stared for years into hard, artificial lights. Mr.
      Watling rose briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Hugh?&rdquo; he said, the warmth of his greeting tempered by just
      the note of condolence suitable to my black clothes. &ldquo;I'm glad you came. I
      wanted to see you before you went back to Cambridge. I must introduce you
      to Judge Bering, of our State Supreme Court. Judge, this is Mr. Paret's
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge looked me over with a certain slow impressiveness, and gave me a
      soft and fleshy hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to know you, Mr. Paret. Your father was a great loss to our bar,&rdquo; he
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      I detected in his tone and manner a slight reservation that could not be
      called precisely judicial dignity; it was as though, in these few words,
      he had gone to the limit of self-commitment with a stranger&mdash;a
      striking contrast to the confidential attitude towards Mr. Watling in
      which I had surprised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge,&rdquo; said Mr. Watling, sitting down again, &ldquo;do you recall that time we
      all went up to Mr. Paret's house and tried to induce him to run for mayor?
      That was before you went on the lower bench.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge nodded gloomily, caressing his watch chain, and suddenly rose to
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be all right, then?&rdquo; Mr. Watling inquired cryptically, with a
      smile. The other made a barely perceptible inclination of the head and
      departed. Mr. Watling looked at me. &ldquo;He's one of the best men we have on
      the bench to-day,&rdquo; he added. There was a trace of apology in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He talked a while of my father, to whom, so he said, he had looked up ever
      since he had been admitted to the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a pleasure to me, Hugh, as well as a matter of pride,&rdquo; he
      said cordially, but with dignity, &ldquo;to have Matthew Paret's son in my
      office. I suppose you will be wishing to take your mother somewhere this
      summer, but if you care to come here in the autumn, you will be welcome.
      You will begin, of course, as other young men begin,&mdash;as I began. But
      I am a believer in blood, and I'll be glad to have you. Mr. Fowndes and
      Mr. Ripon feel the same way.&rdquo; He escorted me to the door himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere I went during that brief visit home I was struck by change, by
      the crumbling and decay of institutions that once had held me in thrall,
      by the superimposition of a new order that as yet had assumed no definite
      character. Some of the old landmarks had disappeared; there were new and
      aggressive office buildings, new and aggressive residences, new and
      aggressive citizens who lived in them, and of whom my mother spoke with
      gentle deprecation. Even Claremore, that paradise of my childhood, had
      grown shrivelled and shabby, even tawdry, I thought, when we went out
      there one Sunday afternoon; all that once represented the magic word
      &ldquo;country&rdquo; had vanished. The old flat piano, made in Philadelphia ages ago,
      the horsehair chairs and sofa had been replaced by a nondescript furniture
      of the sort displayed behind plate-glass windows of the city's stores:
      rocking-chairs on stands, upholstered in clashing colours, their coiled
      springs only half hidden by tassels, and &ldquo;ornamental&rdquo; electric fixtures,
      instead of the polished coal-oil lamps. Cousin Jenny had grown white,
      Willie was a staid bachelor, Helen an old maid, while Mary had married a
      tall, anaemic young man with glasses, Walter Kinley, whom Cousin Robert
      had taken into the store. As I contemplated the Brecks odd questions
      suggested themselves: did honesty and warm-heartedness necessarily
      accompany a lack of artistic taste? and was virtue its own reward, after
      all? They drew my mother into the house, took off her wraps, set her down
      in the most comfortable rocker, and insisted on making her a cup of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was touched. I loved them still, and yet I was conscious of reservations
      concerning them. They, too, seemed a little on the defensive with me, and
      once in a while Mary was caustic in her remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess nothing but New York will be good enough for Hugh now. He'll be
      taking Cousin Sarah away from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, my dear,&rdquo; said my mother, gently, &ldquo;he's going into Mr.
      Watling's office next autumn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theodore Watling?&rdquo; demanded Cousin Robert, pausing in his carving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Robert. Mr. Watling has been good enough to say that he would like
      to have Hugh. Is there anything&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm out of date, Sarah,&rdquo; Cousin Robert replied, vigorously severing
      the leg of the turkey. &ldquo;These modern lawyers are too smart for me.
      Watling's no worse than the others, I suppose,&mdash;only he's got more
      ability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never heard anything against him,&rdquo; said my mother in a pained voice.
      &ldquo;Only the other day McAlery Willett congratulated me that Hugh was going
      to be with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't mind Robert, Sarah,&rdquo; put in Cousin Jenny,&mdash;a remark
      reminiscent of other days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dad has a notion that his generation is the only honest one,&rdquo; said Helen,
      laughingly, as she passed a plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had gained a sense of superiority, and I was quite indifferent to Cousin
      Robert's opinion of Mr. Watling, of modern lawyers in general. More than
      once a wave of self-congratulation surged through me that I had possessed
      the foresight and initiative to get out of the wholesale grocery business
      while there was yet time. I looked at Willie, still freckled, still
      literal, still a plodder, at Walter Kinley, and I thought of the drabness
      of their lives; at Cousin Robert himself as he sat smoking his cigar in
      the bay-window on that dark February day, and suddenly I pitied him. The
      suspicion struck me that he had not prospered of late, and this deepened
      to a conviction as he talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Republican Party is going to the dogs,&rdquo; he asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It used to be an honourable party, but now it is no better than the
      other. Politics are only conducted, now, for the purpose of making
      unscrupulous men rich, sir. For years I furnished this city with good
      groceries, if I do say it myself. I took a pride in the fact that the
      inmates of the hospitals, yes, and the dependent poor in the city's
      institutions, should have honest food. You can get anything out of the
      city if you are willing to pay the politicians for it. I lost my city
      contracts. Why? Because I refused to deal with scoundrels. Weill and
      Company and other unscrupulous upstarts are willing to do so, and poison
      the poor and the sick with adulterated groceries! The first thing I knew
      was that the city auditor was holding back my bills for supplies, and
      paying Weill's. That's what politics and business, yes, sir, and the law,
      have come to in these days. If a man wants to succeed, he must turn into a
      rascal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was not shocked, but I was silent, uncomfortable, wishing that it were
      time to take the train back to the city. Cousin Robert's face was more
      worn than I had thought, and I contrasted him inevitably with the forceful
      person who used to stand, in his worn alpaca coat, on the pavement in
      front of his store, greeting with clear-eyed content his fellow merchants
      of the city. Willie Breck, too, was silent, and Walter Kinley took off his
      glasses and wiped them. In the meanwhile Helen had left the group in which
      my mother sat, and, approaching us, laid her hands on her father's
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, dad,&rdquo; she said, in affectionate remonstrance, &ldquo;you're excited about
      politics again, and you know it isn't good for you. And besides, they're
      not worth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Helen,&rdquo; he replied. Under the pressure of her hands he made
      a strong effort to control himself, and turned to address my mother across
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm getting to be a crotchety old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's a good thing I
      have a daughter to remind me of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a good thing, Robert,&rdquo; said my mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the rest of our visit he seemed to have recovered something of his
      former spirits and poise, taking refuge in the past. They talked of their
      own youth, of families whose houses had been landmarks on the Second Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm worried about your Cousin Robert, Hugh,&rdquo; my mother confided to me,
      when we were at length seated in the train. &ldquo;I've heard rumours that
      things are not so well at the store as they might be.&rdquo; We looked out at
      the winter landscape, so different from that one which had thrilled every
      fibre of my being in the days when the railroad on which we travelled had
      been a winding narrow gauge. The orchards&mdash;those that remained&mdash;were
      bare; stubble pricked the frozen ground where tassels had once waved in
      the hot, summer wind. We flew by row after row of ginger-bread, suburban
      houses built on &ldquo;villa plots,&rdquo; and I read in large letters on a hideous
      sign-board, &ldquo;Woodbine Park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, have you ever heard anything against&mdash;Mr. Watling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;So far as I knew, he is very much looked up to by
      lawyers and business men. He is counsel, I believe, for Mr. Blackwood's
      street car line on Boyne Street. And I told you, I believe, that I met him
      once at Mr. Kyme's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Robert!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I suppose business trouble does make one
      bitter,&mdash;I've seen it so often. But I never imagined that it would
      overtake Robert, and at his time of life! It is an old and respected firm,
      and we have always had a pride in it.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, when I was going to bed, it was evident that the subject was
      still in her mind. She clung to my hand a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, am afraid of the new, Hugh,&rdquo; she said, a little tremulously. &ldquo;We
      all grow so, as age comes on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are not old, mother,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a feeling, since your father has gone, that I have lived my life,
      my dear, though I'd like to stay long enough to see you happily married&mdash;to
      have grandchildren. I was not young when you were born.&rdquo; And she added,
      after a little while, &ldquo;I know nothing about business affairs, and now&mdash;now
      that your father is no longer here, sometimes I'm afraid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of what, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She tried to smile at me through her tears. We were in the old
      sitting-room, surrounded by the books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it's foolish, and it isn't that I don't trust you. I know that the
      son of your father couldn't do anything that was not honourable. And yet I
      am afraid of what the world is becoming. The city is growing so fast, and
      so many new people are coming in. Things are not the same. Robert is
      right, there. And I have heard your father say the same thing. Hugh,
      promise me that you will try to remember always what he was, and what he
      would wish you to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, mother,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But I think you would find that Cousin
      Robert exaggerates a little, makes things seem worse than they really are.
      Customs change, you know. And politics were never well&mdash;Sunday
      schools.&rdquo; I, too, smiled a little. &ldquo;Father knew that. And he would never
      take an active part in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was too fine!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;Cousin Robert has happened to come in contact
      with them through business. That is what has made the difference in him.
      Before, he always knew they were corrupt, but he rarely thought about
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; she said suddenly, after a pause, &ldquo;you must remember one thing,&mdash;that
      you can afford to be independent. I thank God that your father has
      provided for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was duly admitted, the next autumn, to the bar of my own state, and was
      assigned to a desk in the offices of Watling, Fowndes and Ripon. Larry
      Weed was my immediate senior among the apprentices, and Larry was a
      hero-worshipper. I can see him now. He suggested a bullfrog as he sat in
      the little room we shared in common, his arms akimbo over a law book, his
      little legs doubled under him, his round, eyes fixed expectantly on the
      doorway. And even if I had not been aware of my good fortune in being
      connected with such a firm as Theodore Watling's, Larry would shortly have
      brought it home to me. During those weeks when I was making my first
      desperate attempts at briefing up the law I was sometimes interrupted by
      his exclamations when certain figures went by in the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Hugh, do you know who that was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miller Gorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say you never heard of Miller Gorse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been away a long time,&rdquo; I would answer apologetically. A person of
      some importance among my contemporaries at Harvard, I had looked forward
      to a residence in my native city with the complacency of one who has seen
      something of the world,&mdash;only to find that I was the least in the new
      kingdom. And it was a kingdom. Larry opened up to me something of the
      significance and extent of it, something of the identity of the men who
      controlled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miller Gorse,&rdquo; he said impressively, &ldquo;is the counsel for the railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What railroad? You mean the&mdash;&rdquo; I was adding, when he interrupted me
      pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you've been here a while you'll find out there's only one railroad
      in this state, so far as politics are concerned. The Ashuela and Northern,
      the Lake Shore and the others don't count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I refrained from asking any more questions at that time, but afterwards I
      always thought of the Railroad as spelled with a capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miller Gorse isn't forty yet,&rdquo; Larry told me on another occasion. &ldquo;That's
      doing pretty well for a man who comes near running this state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of acquiring knowledge, I endured Mr. Weed's patronage. I
      inquired how Mr. Gorse ran the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you'll find out soon enough,&rdquo; he assured me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Barbour's president of the Railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. Once in a while they take something up to him, but as a rule he
      leaves things to Gorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon I resolved to have a good look at Mr. Gorse at the first
      opportunity. One day Mr. Watling sent out for some papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's in there now;&rdquo; said Larry. &ldquo;You take 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In there&rdquo; meant Mr. Watling's sanctum. And in there he was. I had only a
      glance at the great man, for, with a kindly but preoccupied &ldquo;Thank you,
      Hugh,&rdquo; Mr. Watling took the papers and dismissed me. Heaviness, blackness
      and impassivity,&mdash;these were the impressions of Mr. Gorse which I
      carried away from that first meeting. The very solidity of his flesh
      seemed to suggest the solidity of his position. Such, say the
      psychologists, is the effect of prestige.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember well an old-fashioned picture puzzle in one of my boyhood
      books. The scene depicted was to all appearances a sylvan, peaceful one,
      with two happy lovers seated on a log beside a brook; but presently, as
      one gazed at the picture, the head of an animal stood forth among the
      branches, and then the body; more animals began to appear, bit by bit; a
      tiger, a bear, a lion, a jackal, a fox, until at last, whenever I looked
      at the page, I did not see the sylvan scene at all, but only the predatory
      beasts of the forest. So, one by one, the figures of the real rulers of
      the city superimposed themselves for me upon the simple and democratic
      design of Mayor, Council, Board of Aldermen, Police Force, etc., that
      filled the eye of a naive and trusting electorate which fondly imagined
      that it had something to say in government. Miller Gorse was one of these
      rulers behind the screen, and Adolf Scherer, of the Boyne Iron Works,
      another; there was Leonard Dickinson of the Corn National Bank; Frederick
      Grierson, becoming wealthy in city real estate; Judah B. Tallant, who,
      though outlawed socially, was deferred to as the owner of the Morning Era;
      and even Ralph Hambleton, rapidly superseding the elderly and conservative
      Mr. Lord, who had hitherto managed the great Hambleton estate. Ralph
      seemed to have become, in a somewhat gnostic manner, a full-fledged
      financier. Not having studied law, he had been home for four years when I
      became a legal fledgling, and during the early days of my apprenticeship I
      was beholden to him for many &ldquo;eye openers&rdquo; concerning the conduct of great
      affairs. I remember him sauntering into my room one morning when Larry
      Weed had gone out on an errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Hughie,&rdquo; he said, with his air of having nothing to do. &ldquo;Grinding
      it out? Where's Watling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he in his office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can we do for you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I'll tell you when you're a little older. You're too young.&rdquo; And
      he sank down into Larry Weed's chair, his long legs protruding on the
      other side of the table. &ldquo;It's a matter of taxes. Some time ago I found
      out that Dickinson and Tallant and others I could mention were paying a
      good deal less on their city property than we are. We don't propose to do
      it any more&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can Mr. Watling help you?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't mind giving you a few tips about your profession, Hughie.
      I'm going to get Watling to fix it up with the City Hall gang. Old Lord
      doesn't like it, I'll admit, and when I told him we had been contributing
      to the city long enough, that I proposed swinging into line with other
      property holders, he began to blubber about disgrace and what my
      grandfather would say if he were alive. Well, he isn't alive. A good deal
      of water has flowed under the bridges since his day. It's a mere matter of
      business, of getting your respectable firm to retain a City Hall attorney
      to fix it up with the assessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the penitentiary?&rdquo; I ventured, not too seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't go to the penitentiary, neither will Watling. What I do is to
      pay a lawyer's fee. There isn't anything criminal in that, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time after Ralph had departed I sat reflecting upon this new
      knowledge, and there came into my mind the bitterness of Cousin Robert
      Breck against this City Hall gang, and his remarks about lawyers. I
      recalled the tone in which he had referred to Mr. Watling. But Ralph's
      philosophy easily triumphed. Why not be practical, and become master of a
      situation which one had not made, and could not alter, instead of being
      overwhelmed by it? Needless to say, I did not mention the conversation to
      Mr. Watling, nor did he dwindle in my estimation. These necessary
      transactions did not interfere in any way with his personal relationships,
      and his days were filled with kindnesses. And was not Mr. Ripon, the
      junior partner, one of the evangelical lights of the community, conducting
      advanced Bible classes every week in the Church of the Redemption?... The
      unfolding of mysteries kept me alert. And I understood that, if I was to
      succeed, certain esoteric knowledge must be acquired, as it were,
      unofficially. I kept my eyes and ears open, and applied myself, with all
      industry, to the routine tasks with which every young man in a large legal
      firm is familiar. I recall distinctly my pride when, the Board of Aldermen
      having passed an ordinance lowering the water rates, I was intrusted with
      the responsibility of going before the court in behalf of Mr. Ogilvy's
      water company, obtaining a temporary restricting order preventing the
      ordinance from going at once into effect. Here was an affair in point.
      Were it not for lawyers of the calibre of Watling, Fowndes and Ripon,
      hard-earned private property would soon be confiscated by the rapacious
      horde. Once in a while I was made aware that Mr. Watling had his eye on
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Hugh,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;how are you getting along? That's right,
      stick to it, and after a while we'll hand the drudgery over to somebody
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He possessed the supreme quality of a leader of men in that he took pains
      to inform himself concerning the work of the least of his subordinates;
      and he had the gift of putting fire into a young man by a word or a touch
      of the hand on the shoulder. It was not difficult for me, therefore, to
      comprehend Larry Weed's hero-worship, the loyalty of other members of the
      firm or of those occupants of the office whom I have not mentioned. My
      first impression of him, which I had got at Jerry Kyme's, deepened as time
      went on, and I readily shared the belief of those around me that his legal
      talents easily surpassed those of any of his contemporaries. I can recall,
      at this time, several noted cases in the city when I sat in court
      listening to his arguments with thrills of pride. He made us all feel&mdash;no
      matter how humble may have been our contributions to the preparation&mdash;that
      we had a share in his triumphs. We remembered his manner with judges and
      juries, and strove to emulate it. He spoke as if there could be no
      question as to his being right as to the law and the facts, and yet, in
      some subtle way that bated analysis, managed not to antagonize the court.
      Victory was in the air in that office. I do not mean to say there were not
      defeats; but frequently these defeats, by resourcefulness, by a
      never-say-die spirit, by a consummate knowledge, not only of the law, but
      of other things at which I have hinted, were turned into ultimate
      victories. We fought cases from one court to another, until our opponents
      were worn out or the decision was reversed. We won, and that spirit of
      winning got into the blood. What was most impressed on me in those early
      years, I think, was the discovery that there was always a path&mdash;if
      one were clever enough to find it&mdash;from one terrace to the next
      higher. Staying power was the most prized of all the virtues. One could
      always, by adroitness, compel a legal opponent to fight the matter out all
      over again on new ground, or at least on ground partially new. If the
      Court of Appeals should fail one, there was the Supreme Court; there was
      the opportunity, also, to shift from the state to the federal courts; and
      likewise the much-prized device known as a change of venue, when a judge
      was supposed to be &ldquo;prejudiced.&rdquo;

      IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As my apprenticeship advanced I grew more and more to the inhabitants of
      our city into two kinds, the who were served, and the inefficient, who
      were separate efficient, neglected; but the mental process of which the
      classification was the result was not so deliberate as may be supposed.
      Sometimes, when an important client would get into trouble, the affair
      took me into the police court, where I saw the riff-raff of the city
      penned up, waiting to have justice doled out to them: weary women who had
      spent the night in cells, indifferent now as to the front they presented
      to the world, the finery rued that they had tended so carefully to catch
      the eyes of men on the darkened streets; brazen young girls, who blazed
      forth defiance to all order; derelict men, sodden and hopeless, with
      scrubby beards; shifty looking burglars and pickpockets. All these I
      beheld, at first with twinges of pity, later to mass them with the ugly
      and inevitable with whom society had to deal somehow. Lawyers, after all,
      must be practical men. I came to know the justices of these police courts,
      as well as other judges. And underlying my acquaintance with all of them
      was the knowledge&mdash;though not on the threshold of my consciousness&mdash;that
      they depended for their living, every man of them, those who were
      appointed and those who were elected, upon a political organization which
      derived its sustenance from the element whence came our clients. Thus by
      degrees the sense of belonging to a special priesthood had grown on me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recall an experience with that same Mr. Nathan. Weill, the wholesale
      grocer of whose commerce with the City Hall my Cousin Robert Breck had so
      bitterly complained. Late one afternoon Mr. Weill's carriage ran over a
      child on its way up-town through one of the poorer districts. The parents,
      naturally, were frantic, and the coachman was arrested. This was late in
      the afternoon, and I was alone in the office when the telephone rang.
      Hurrying to the police station, I found Mr. Weill in a state of excitement
      and abject fear, for an ugly crowd had gathered outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could not Mr. Watling or Mr. Fowndes come?&rdquo; demanded the grocer.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an inner contempt for the layman's state of mind on such occasions I
      assured him of my competency to handle the case. He was impressed, I
      think, by the sergeant's deference, who knew what it meant to have such an
      office as ours interfere with the affair. I called up the prosecuting
      attorney, who sent to Monahan's saloon, close by, and procured a release
      for the coachman on his own recognizance, one of many signed in blank and
      left there by the justice for privileged cases. The coachman was hustled
      out by a back door, and the crowd dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, while a score or more of delinquents sat in the anxious
      seats, Justice Garry recognized me and gave me precedence. And Mr. Weill,
      with a sigh of relief, paid his fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Paret, is it?&rdquo; he asked, as we stood together for a moment on the
      sidewalk outside the court. &ldquo;You have managed this well. I will remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sued, of course. When he came to the office he insisted on
      discussing the case with Mr. Watling, who sent for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a bright young man,&rdquo; Mr. Weill declared, shaking my hand. &ldquo;He
      will get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; said Mr. Watling, &ldquo;he may save you a lot of money, Weill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When my friend Mr. Watling is United States Senator,&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watling laughed. &ldquo;Before that, I hope. I advise you to compromise this
      suit, Weill,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;How would a thousand dollars strike you? I've had
      Paret look up the case, and he tells me the little girl has had to have an
      operation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand dollars!&rdquo; cried the grocer. &ldquo;What right have these people to
      let their children play on the streets? It's an outrage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where else have the children to play?&rdquo; Mr. Watling touched his arm.
      &ldquo;Weill,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;suppose it had been your little girl?&rdquo; The
      grocer pulled out his handkerchief and mopped his bald forehead. But he
      rallied a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fight these damage cases for the street railroads all through the
      courts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Watling agreed, &ldquo;but there a principle is involved. If the
      railroads once got into the way of paying damages for every careless
      employee, they would soon be bankrupt through blackmail. But here you have
      a child whose father is a poor janitor and can't afford sickness. And your
      coachman, I imagine, will be more particular in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the end Mr. Weill made out a cheque and departed in a good humour,
      convinced that he was well out of the matter. Here was one of many
      instances I could cite of Mr. Watling's tenderness of heart. I felt,
      moreover, as if he had done me a personal favour, since it was I who had
      recommended the compromise. For I had been to the hospital and had seen
      the child on the cot,&mdash;a dark little thing, lying still in her pain,
      with the bewildered look of a wounded animal....
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after this incident of Mr. Weill's damage suit I obtained a more
      or less definite promotion by the departure of Larry Weed. He had suddenly
      developed a weakness of the lungs. Mr. Watling got him a place in Denver,
      and paid his expenses west.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first six or seven years I spent in the office of Wading, Fowndes and
      Ripon were of importance to my future career, but there is little to
      relate of them. I was absorbed not only in learning law, but in acquiring
      that esoteric knowledge at which I have hinted&mdash;not to be had from my
      seniors and which I was convinced was indispensable to a successful and
      lucrative practice. My former comparison of the organization of our city
      to a picture puzzle wherein the dominating figures become visible only
      after long study is rather inadequate. A better analogy would be the human
      anatomy: we lawyers, of course, were the brains; the financial and
      industrial interests the body, helpless without us; the City Hall
      politicians, the stomach that must continually be fed. All three, law,
      politics and business, were interdependent, united by a nervous system too
      complex to be developed here. In these years, though I worked hard and
      often late, I still found time for convivialities, for social gaieties,
      yet little by little without realizing the fact, I was losing zest for the
      companionship of my former intimates. My mind was becoming polarized by
      the contemplation of one object, success, and to it human ties were
      unconsciously being sacrificed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom Peters began to feel this, even at a time when I believed myself still
      to be genuinely fond of him. Considering our respective temperaments in
      youth, it is curious that he should have been the first to fall in love
      and marry. One day he astonished me by announcing his engagement to Susan
      Blackwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ends the liquor, Hughie,&rdquo; he told me, beamingly. &ldquo;I promised her I'd
      eliminate it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did eliminate it, save for mild relapses on festive occasions. A more
      seemingly incongruous marriage could scarcely be imagined, and yet it was
      a success from the start. From a slim, silent, self-willed girl Susan had
      grown up into a tall, rather rawboned and energetic young woman. She was
      what we called in those days &ldquo;intellectual,&rdquo; and had gone in for
      kindergartens, and after her marriage she turned out to be excessively
      domestic; practising her theories, with entire success, upon a family that
      showed a tendency to increase at an alarming rate. Tom, needless to say,
      did not become intellectual. He settled down&mdash;prematurely, I thought&mdash;into
      what is known as a family man, curiously content with the income he
      derived from the commission business and with life in general; and he
      developed a somewhat critical view of the tendencies of the civilization
      by which he was surrounded. Susan held it also, but she said less about
      it. In the comfortable but unpretentious house they rented on Cedar Street
      we had many discussions, after the babies had been put to bed and the door
      of the living-room closed, in order that our voices might not reach the
      nursery. Perry Blackwood, now Tom's brother-in-law, was often there. He,
      too, had lapsed into what I thought was an odd conservatism. Old Josiah,
      his father, being dead, he occupied himself mainly with looking after
      certain family interests, among which was the Boyne Street car line. Among
      &ldquo;business men&rdquo; he was already getting the reputation of being a little
      difficult to deal with. I was often the subject of their banter, and
      presently I began to suspect that they regarded my career and beliefs with
      some concern. This gave me no uneasiness, though at limes I lost my
      temper. I realized their affection for me; but privately I regarded them
      as lacking in ambition, in force, in the fighting qualities necessary for
      achievement in this modern age. Perhaps, unconsciously, I pitied them a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Judah B. to-day, Hughie?&rdquo; Tom would inquire. &ldquo;I hear you've put
      him up for the Boyne Club, now that Mr. Watling has got him out of that
      libel suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carter Ives is dead,&rdquo; Perry would add, sarcastically, &ldquo;let bygones be
      bygones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was well known that Mr. Tallant, in the early days of his newspaper,
      had blackmailed Mr. Ives out of some hundred thousand dollars. And that
      this, more than any other act, stood in the way, with certain recalcitrant
      gentlemen, of his highest ambition, membership in the Boyne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble with you fellows is that you refuse to deal with conditions
      as you find them,&rdquo; I retorted. &ldquo;We didn't make them, and we can't change
      them. Tallant's a factor in the business life of this city, and he has to
      be counted with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom would shake his head exasperatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you get after Ralph?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;He doesn't antagonize
      Tallant, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph's hopeless,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;He was born a pirate, you weren't, Hughie.
      We think there's a chance for his salvation, don't we, Perry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I refused to accept the remark as flattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another object of their assaults was Frederick Grierson, who by this time
      had emerged from obscurity as a small dealer in real estate into a
      manipulator of blocks and corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you think it's a lawyer's business to demand an ethical bill of
      health of every client,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I won't stand up for all of Tallant's
      career, of course, but Mr. Wading has a clear right to take his cases. As
      for Grierson, it seems to me that's a matter of giving a dog a bad name.
      Just because his people weren't known here, and because he has worked up
      from small beginnings. To get down to hard-pan, you fellows don't believe
      in democracy,&mdash;in giving every man a chance to show what's in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Democracy is good!&rdquo; exclaimed Perry. &ldquo;If the kind of thing we're coming
      to is democracy, God save the state!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand I found myself drawing closer to Ralph Hambleton,
      sometimes present at these debates, as the only one of my boyhood friends
      who seemed to be able to &ldquo;deal with conditions as he found them.&rdquo; Indeed,
      he gave one the impression that, if he had had the making of them, he
      would not have changed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce do you expect?&rdquo; I once heard him inquire with good-natured
      contempt. &ldquo;Business isn't charity, it's war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are certain things,&rdquo; maintained Perry, stoutly, &ldquo;that gentlemen
      won't do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; exclaimed Ralph, stretching his slim six feet two: We were
      sitting in the Boyne Club. &ldquo;It's ungentlemanly to kill, or burn a town or
      sink a ship, but we keep armies and navies for the purpose. For a man with
      a good mind, Perry, you show a surprising inability to think things, out
      to a logical conclusion. What the deuce is competition, when you come down
      to it? Christianity? Not by a long shot! If our nations are slaughtering
      men and starving populations in other countries,&mdash;are carried on, in
      fact, for the sake of business, if our churches are filled with business
      men and our sky pilots pray for the government, you can't expect heathen
      individuals like me to do business on a Christian basis,&mdash;if there is
      such a thing. You can make rules for croquet, but not for a game that is
      based on the natural law of the survival of the fittest. The darned fools
      in the legislatures try it occasionally, but we all know it's a sop to the
      'common people.' Ask Hughie here if there ever was a law put on the
      statute books that his friend Watling couldn't get 'round'? Why, you've
      got competition even among the churches. Yours, where I believe you teach
      in the Sunday school, would go bankrupt if it proclaimed real
      Christianity. And you'll go bankrupt if you practise it, Perry, my boy.
      Some early, wide-awake, competitive, red-blooded bird will relieve you of
      the Boyne Street car line.&rdquo;
     </p>

      It was one of this same new and &ldquo;fittest&rdquo; species who had already relieved
      poor Mr. McAlery Willett of his fortune. Mr. Willett was a trusting soul
      who had never known how to take care of himself or his money, people said,
      and now that he had lost it they blamed him. Some had been saved enough
      for him and Nancy to live on in the old house, with careful economy. It
      was Nancy who managed the economy, who accomplished remarkable things with
      a sum they would have deemed poverty in former days. Her mother had died
      while I was at Cambridge. Reverses did not subdue Mr. Willett's spirits,
      and the fascination modern &ldquo;business&rdquo; had for him seemed to grow in
      proportion to the misfortunes it had caused him. He moved into a tiny
      office in the Durrett Building, where he appeared every morning about
      half-past ten to occupy himself with heaven knows what short cuts to
      wealth, with prospectuses of companies in Mexico or Central America or
      some other distant place: once, I remember, it was a tea, company in which
      he tried to interest his friends, to raise in the South a product he
      maintained would surpass Orange Pekoe. In the afternoon between three and
      four he would turn up at the Boyne Club, as well groomed, as spruce as
      ever, generally with a flower in his buttonhole. He never forgot that he
      was a gentleman, and he had a gentleman's notions of the fitness of
      things, and it was against his principles to use, a gentleman's club for
      the furtherance of his various enterprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop into my office some day, Dickinson,&rdquo; he would say. &ldquo;I think I've got
      something there that might interest you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He reminded me, when I met him, that he had always predicted I would get
      along in life....
    </p>
    <p>
      The portrait of Nancy at this period is not so easily drawn. The decline
      of the family fortunes seemed to have had as little effect upon her as
      upon her father, although their characters differed sharply. Something of
      that spontaneity, of that love of life and joy in it she had possessed in
      youth she must have inherited from McAlery Willett, but these qualities
      had disappeared in her long before the coming of financial reverses. She
      was nearing thirty, and in spite of her beauty and the rarer distinction
      that can best be described as breeding, she had never married. Men admired
      her, but from a distance; she kept them at arm's length, they said:
      strangers who visited the city invariably picked her out of an assembly
      and asked who she was; one man from New York who came to visit Ralph and
      who had been madly in love with her, she had amazed many people by
      refusing, spurning all he might have given her. This incident seemed a
      refutation of the charge that she was calculating. As might have been
      foretold, she had the social gift in a remarkable degree, and in spite of
      the limitations of her purse the knack of dressing better than other
      women, though at that time the organization of our social life still
      remained comparatively simple, the custom of luxurious and expensive
      entertainment not having yet set in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more I reflect upon those days, the more surprising does it seem that
      I was not in love with her. It may be that I was, unconsciously, for she
      troubled my thoughts occasionally, and she represented all the qualities I
      admired in her sex. The situation that had existed at the time of our
      first and only quarrel had been reversed, I was on the highroad to the
      worldly success I had then resolved upon, Nancy was poor, and for that
      reason, perhaps, prouder than ever. If she was inaccessible to others, she
      had the air of being peculiarly inaccessible to me&mdash;the more so
      because some of the superficial relics of our intimacy remained, or rather
      had been restored. Her very manner of camaraderie seemed paradoxically to
      increase the distance between us. It piqued me. Had she given me the least
      encouragement, I am sure I should have responded; and I remember that I
      used occasionally to speculate as to whether she still cared for me, and
      took this method of hiding her real feelings. Yet, on the whole, I felt a
      certain complacency about it all; I knew that suffering was disagreeable,
      I had learned how to avoid it, and I may have had, deep within me, a
      feeling that I might marry her after all. Meanwhile my life was full, and
      gave promise of becoming even fuller, more absorbing and exciting in the
      immediate future.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most fascinating figures, to me, of that Order being woven,
      like a cloth of gold, out of our hitherto drab civilization,&mdash;an
      Order into which I was ready and eager to be initiated,&mdash;was that of
      Adolf Scherer, the giant German immigrant at the head of the Boyne Iron
      Works. His life would easily lend itself to riotous romance. In the old
      country, in a valley below the castle perched on the rack above, he had
      begun life by tending his father's geese. What a contrast to &ldquo;Steeltown&rdquo;
       with its smells and sickening summer heat, to the shanty where Mrs.
      Scherer took boarders and bent over the wash-tub! She, too, was an
      immigrant, but lived to hear her native Wagner from her own box at Covent
      Garden; and he to explain, on the deck of an imperial yacht, to the man
      who might have been his sovereign certain processes in the manufacture of
      steel hitherto untried on that side of the Atlantic. In comparison with
      Adolf Scherer, citizen of a once despised democracy, the minor prince in
      whose dominions he had once tended geese was of small account indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Adolf Scherer of that day&mdash;though it is not so long ago as time
      flies&mdash;was even more solid and impressive than the man he afterwards
      became, when he reached the dizzier heights from which he delivered to an
      eager press opinions on politics and war, eugenics and woman's suffrage
      and other subjects that are the despair of specialists. Had he stuck to
      steel, he would have remained invulnerable. But even then he was beginning
      to abandon the field of production for that of exploitation: figuratively
      speaking, he had taken to soap, which with the aid of water may be blown
      into beautiful, iridescent bubbles to charm the eye. Much good soap,
      apparently, has gone that way, never to be recovered. Everybody who was
      anybody began to blow bubbles about that time, and the bigger the bubble
      the greater its attraction for investors of hard-earned savings. Outside
      of this love for financial iridescence, let it be called, Mr. Scherer
      seemed to care little then for glitter of any sort. Shortly after his
      elevation to the presidency of the Boyne Iron Works he had been elected a
      member of the Boyne Club,&mdash;an honour of which, some thought, he
      should have been more sensible; but generally, when in town, he preferred
      to lunch at a little German restaurant annexed to a saloon, where I used
      often to find him literally towering above the cloth,&mdash;for he was a
      giant with short legs,&mdash;his napkin tucked into his shirt front,
      engaged in lively conversation with the ministering Heinrich. The chef at
      the club, Mr. Scherer insisted, could produce nothing equal to Heinrich's
      sauer-kraut and sausage. My earliest relationship with Mr. Scherer was
      that of an errand boy, of bringing to him for his approval papers which
      might not be intrusted to a common messenger. His gruffness and brevity
      disturbed me more than I cared to confess. I was pretty sure that he eyed
      me with the disposition of the self-made to believe that college
      educations and good tailors were the heaviest handicaps with which a young
      man could be burdened: and I suspected him of an inimical attitude toward
      the older families of the city. Certain men possessed his confidence; and
      he had built, as it were, a stockade about them, sternly keeping the rest
      of the world outside. In Theodore Watling he had a childlike faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus I studied him, with a deliberation which it is the purpose of these
      chapters to confess, though he little knew that he was being made the
      subject of analysis. Nor did I ever venture to talk with him, but held
      strictly to my role of errand boy,&mdash;even after the conviction came
      over me that he was no longer indifferent to my presence. The day arrived,
      after some years, when he suddenly thrust toward me a big, hairy hand that
      held the document he was examining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who drew this, Mr. Paret!&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ripon, I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Boyne Works were buying up coal-mines, and this was a contract looking
      to the purchase of one in Putman County, provided, after a certain period
      of working, the yield and quality should come up to specifications. Mr.
      Scherer requested me to read one of the sections, which puzzled him. And
      in explaining it an idea flashed over me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind my making a suggestion, Mr. Scherer?&rdquo; I ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      I showed him how, by the alteration of a few words, the difficulty to
      which he had referred could not only be eliminated, but that certain
      possible penalties might be evaded, while the apparent meaning of the
      section remained unchanged. In other words, it gave the Boyne Iron Works
      an advantage that was not contemplated. He seized the paper, stared at
      what I had written in pencil on the margin, and then stared at me.
      Abruptly, he began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Mr. Wading what he thinks of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intended to, provided it had your approval, sir,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have my approval, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; he declared, rather cryptically, and
      with the slight German hardening of the v's into which he relapsed at
      times. &ldquo;Bring it to the Works this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wading agreed to the alteration. He looked at me amusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think that's an improvement, Hugh,&rdquo; he said. I had a feeling that
      I had gained ground, and from this time on I thought I detected a change
      in his attitude toward me; there could be no doubt about the new attitude
      of Mr. Scherer, who would often greet me now with a smile and a joke, and
      sometimes went so far as to ask my opinions.... Then, about six months
      later, came the famous Ribblevale case that aroused the moral indignation
      of so many persons, among whom was Perry Blackwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know as well as I do, Hugh, how this thing is being manipulated,&rdquo; he
      declared at Tom's one Sunday evening; &ldquo;there was nothing the matter with
      the Ribblevale Steel Company&mdash;it was as right as rain before Leonard
      Dickinson and Grierson and Scherer and that crowd you train with began to
      talk it down at the Club. Oh, they're very compassionate. I've heard 'em.
      Dickinson, privately, doesn't think much of Ribblevale paper, and Pugh&rdquo;
       (the president of the Ribblevale) &ldquo;seems worried and looks badly. It's all
      very clever, but I'd hate to tell you in plain words what I'd call it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; I challenged him audaciously. &ldquo;You haven't any proof that the
      Ribblevale wasn't in trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard Mr. Pugh tell my father the other day it was a d&mdash;d outrage.
      He couldn't catch up with these rumours, and some of his stockholders were
      liquidating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, don't suppose Pugh would want to admit his situation, do you?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pugh's a straight man,&rdquo; retorted Perry. &ldquo;That's more than I can say for
      any of the other gang, saving your presence. The unpleasant truth is that
      Scherer and the Boyne people want the Ribblevale, and you ought to know it
      if you don't.&rdquo; He looked at me very hard through the glasses he had lately
      taken to wearing. Tom, who was lounging by the fire, shifted his position
      uneasily. I smiled, and took another cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe Ralph is right, Perry, when he calls you a sentimentalist. For
      you there's a tragedy behind every ordinary business transaction. The
      Ribblevale people are having a hard time to keep their heads above water,
      and immediately you smell conspiracy. Dickinson and Scherer have been
      talking it down. How about it, Tom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Tom, in these debates, was inclined to be noncommittal, although it
      was clear they troubled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't ask me, Hughie,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I ought to cultivate the scientific point of view, and look
      with impartial interest at this industrial cannibalism,&rdquo; returned Perry,
      sarcastically. &ldquo;Eat or be eaten that's what enlightened self-interest has
      come to. After all, Ralph would say, it is nature, the insect world over
      again, the victim duped and crippled before he is devoured, and the lawyer&mdash;how
      shall I put it?&mdash;facilitating the processes of swallowing and
      digesting....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no use arguing with Perry when he was in this vein....
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I am not writing a technical treatise, I need not go into the
      details of the Ribblevale suit. Since it to say that the affair, after a
      while, came apparently to a deadlock, owing to the impossibility of
      getting certain definite information from the Ribblevale books, which had
      been taken out of the state. The treasurer, for reasons of his own,
      remained out of the state also; the ordinary course of summoning him
      before a magistrate in another state had naturally been resorted to, but
      the desired evidence was not forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; Mr. Wading explained to Mr. Scherer, &ldquo;that there is no
      law in the various states with a sufficient penalty attached that will
      compel the witness to divulge facts he wishes to conceal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the middle of a February afternoon, and they were seated in deep,
      leather chairs in one corner of the reading room of the Boyne Club. They
      had the place to themselves. Fowndes was there also, one leg twisted
      around the other in familiar fashion, a bored look on his long and sallow
      face. Mr. Wading had telephoned to the office for me to bring them some
      papers bearing on the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Hugh,&rdquo; he said kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we have present a genuine legal mind,&rdquo; said Mr. Scherer, in the
      playful manner he had adopted of late, while I grinned appreciatively and
      took a chair. Mr. Watling presently suggested kidnapping the Ribblevale
      treasurer until he should promise to produce the books as the only way out
      of what seemed an impasse. But Mr. Scherer brought down a huge fist on his
      knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you it is no joke, Watling, we've got to win that suit,&rdquo; he
      asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all very well,&rdquo; replied Mr. Watling. &ldquo;But we're a respectable
      firm, you know. We haven't had to resort to safe-blowing, as yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scherer shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say it were a matter of
      indifference to him what methods were resorted to. Mr. Watling's eyes met
      mine; his glance was amused, yet I thought I read in it a query as to the
      advisability, in my presence, of going too deeply into the question of
      ways and means. I may have been wrong. At any rate, its sudden effect was
      to embolden me to give voice to an idea that had begun to simmer in my
      mind, that excited me, and yet I had feared to utter it. This look of my
      chief's, and the lighter tone the conversation had taken decided me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why wouldn't it be possible to draw up a bill to fit the situation?&rdquo; I
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Wading started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three looked at me. I felt the blood come into my face, but it was too
      late to draw back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;the legislature is in session. And since, as Mr. Watling says,
      there is no sufficient penalty in other states to compel the witness to
      produce the information desired, why not draw up a bill and&mdash;and have
      it passed&mdash;&rdquo; I paused for breath&mdash;&ldquo;imposing a sufficient penalty
      on home corporations in the event of such evasions. The Ribblevale Steel
      Company is a home corporation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had shot my bolt.... There followed what was for me an anxious silence,
      while the three of them continued to stare at me. Mr. Watling put the tips
      of his fingers together, and I became aware that he was not offended, that
      he was thinking rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, why not, Fowndes?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Fowndes, &ldquo;there's an element of risk in such a proceeding I
      need not dwell upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Risk!&rdquo; cried the senior partner vigorously. &ldquo;There's risk in everything.
      They'll howl, of course. But they howl anyway, and nobody ever listens to
      them. They'll say it's special legislation, and the Pilot will print
      sensational editorials for a few days. But what of it? All of that has
      happened before. I tell you, if we can't see those books, we'll lose the
      suit. That's in black and white. And, as a matter of justice, we're
      entitled to know what we want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There might be two opinions as to that,&rdquo; observed Fowndes, with his
      sardonic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watling paid no attention to this remark. He was already deep in
      thought. It was characteristic of his mind to leap forward, seize a
      suggestion that often appeared chimerical to a man like Fowndes and turn
      it into an accomplished Fact. &ldquo;I believe you've hit it, Hugh,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;We needn't bother about the powers of the courts in other states. We'll
      put into this bill an appeal to our court for an order on the clerk to
      compel the witness to come before the court and testify, and we'll provide
      for a special commissioner to take depositions in the state where the
      witness is. If the officers of a home corporation who are outside of the
      state refuse to testify, the penalty will be that the ration goes into the
      hands of a receiver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fowndes whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's going some!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we've got to go some. How about it, Scherer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Mr. Scherer's brown eyes were snapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have got to win that suit, Watling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were all excited, even Fowndes, I think, though he remained
      expressionless. Ours was the tense excitement of primitive man in chase:
      the quarry which had threatened to elude us was again in view, and not
      unlikely to fall into our hands. Add to this feeling, on my part, the
      thrill that it was I who had put them on the scent. I had all the
      sensations of an aspiring young brave who for the first time is admitted
      to the councils of the tribe!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be a popular bill, too,&rdquo; Mr. Schemer was saying, with a smile
      of ironic appreciation at the thought of demagogues advocating it. &ldquo;We
      should have one of Lawler's friends introduce it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we shall have it properly introduced,&rdquo; replied Mr. Wading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may come back at us,&rdquo; suggested Fowndes pessimistically. &ldquo;The Boyne
      Iron Works is a home corporation too, if I am not mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Boyne Iron Works has the firm of Wading, Fowndes and Ripon behind
      it,&rdquo; asserted Mr. Scherer, with what struck me as a magnificent faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't forget Paret,&rdquo; Mr. Watling reminded him, with a wink at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had risen. Mr. Scherer laid a hand on my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I do not forget him. He will not permit me to forget him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A remark, I thought, that betrayed some insight into my character... Mr.
      Watling called for pen and paper and made then and there a draft of the
      proposed bill, for no time was to be lost. It was dark when we left the
      Club, and I recall the elation I felt and strove to conceal as I
      accompanied my chief back to the office. The stenographers and clerks were
      gone; alone in the library we got down the statutes and set to work to
      perfect the bill from the rough draft, on which Mr. Fowndes had written
      his suggestions. I felt that a complete yet subtle change had come over my
      relationship with Mr. Watling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of our labours he asked me to call up the attorney for the
      Railroad. Mr. Gorse was still at his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Is that you, Miller?&rdquo; Mr. Watling said. &ldquo;This is Wading. When can
      I see you for a few minutes this evening? Yes, I am leaving for Washington
      at nine thirty. Eight o'clock. All right, I'll be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was almost eight before he got the draft finished to his satisfaction,
      and I had picked it out on the typewriter. As I handed it to him, my chief
      held it a moment, gazing at me with an odd smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have acquired a good deal of useful knowledge, here and
      there, Hugh,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've tried to keep my eyes open, Mr. Watling,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are a great many things a young man practising law
      in these days has to learn for himself. And if I hadn't given you credit
      for some cleverness, I shouldn't have wanted you here. There's only one
      way to look at&mdash;at these matters we have been discussing, my boy,
      that's the common-sense way, and if a man doesn't get that point of view
      by himself, nobody can teach it to him. I needn't enlarge upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled again, but immediately became serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Mr. Gorse should approve of this bill, I'm going to send you down to
      the capital&mdash;to-night. Can you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to look out for the bill in the legislature. Of course there
      won't be much to do, except to stand by, but you will get a better idea of
      what goes on down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him, and told him I would do my best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure of that,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Now it's time to go to see Gorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The legal department of the Railroad occupied an entire floor of the Corn
      Bank building. I had often been there on various errands, having on
      occasions delivered sealed envelopes to Mr. Gorse himself, approaching him
      in the ordinary way through a series of offices. But now, following Mr.
      Watling through the dimly lighted corridor, we came to a door on which no
      name was painted, and which was presently opened by a stenographer. There
      was in the proceeding a touch of mystery that revived keenly my boyish
      love for romance; brought back the days when I had been, in turn, Captain
      Kidd and Ali Baba.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have never realized more strongly than in that moment the psychological
      force of prestige. Little by little, for five years, an estimate of the
      extent of Miller Gorse's power had been coming home to me, and his
      features stood in my mind for his particular kind of power. He was a
      tremendous worker, and often remained in his office until ten and eleven
      at night. He dismissed the stenographer by the wave of a hand which seemed
      to thrust her bodily out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Miller,&rdquo; said Mr. Watling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Theodore,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Paret, of my office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Mr. Gorse, and nodded toward me. I was impressed by the
      felicity with which a cartoonist of the Pilot had once caricatured him by
      the use of curved lines. The circle of the heavy eyebrows ended at the
      wide nostrils; the mouth was a crescent, but bowed downwards; the heavy
      shoulders were rounded. Indeed, the only straight line to be discerned
      about him was that of his hair, black as bitumen, banged across his
      forehead; even his polished porphyry eyes were constructed on some
      curvilinear principle, and never seemed to focus. It might be said of Mr.
      Gorse that he had an overwhelming impersonality. One could never be quite
      sure that one's words reached the mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the intimacy which I knew existed between them, in my presence
      at least Mr. Gorse's manner was little different with Mr. Watling than it
      was with other men. Mr. Wading did not seem to mind. He pulled up a chair
      close to the desk and began, without any preliminaries, to explain his
      errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about the Ribblevale affair,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know we have a suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gorse nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to get at the books, Miller,&mdash;that's all there is to it. I
      told you so the other day. Well, we've found out a way, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his hand in his pocket, while the railroad attorney remained
      impassive, and drew out the draft of the bill. Mr. Gorse read it, then
      read it over again, and laid it down in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to put that through both houses and have the governor's signature
      to it by the end of the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems a little raw, at first sight, Theodore,&rdquo; said Mr. Gorse, with
      the suspicion of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      My chief laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not half so raw as some things I might mention, that went through
      like greased lightning,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;What can they do? I believe it will
      hold water. Tallant's, and most of the other newspapers in the state,
      won't print a line about it, and only Socialists and Populists read the
      Pilot. They're disgruntled anyway. The point is, there's no other way out
      for us. Just think a moment, bearing in mind what I've told you about the
      case, and you'll see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gorse took up the paper again, and read the draft over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know as well as I do, Miller, how dangerous it is to leave this
      Ribblevale business at loose ends. The Carlisle steel people and the Lake
      Shore road are after the Ribblevale Company, and we can't afford to run
      any risk of their getting it. It's logically a part of the Boyne
      interests, as Scherer says, and Dickinson is ready with the money for the
      reorganization. If the Carlisle people and the Lake Shore get it, the
      product will be shipped out by the L and G, and the Railroad will lose.
      What would Barbour say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barbour, as I have perhaps mentioned, was the president of the
      Railroad, and had his residence in the other great city of the state. He
      was then, I knew, in the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to act now,&rdquo; insisted Mr. Watling. &ldquo;That's open and shut. If
      you have any other plan, I wish you'd trot it out. If not, I want a letter
      to Paul Varney and the governor. I'm going to send Paret down with them on
      the night train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was clear to me then, in the discussion following, that Mr. Watling's
      gift of persuasion, though great, was not the determining factor in Mr.
      Gorse's decision. He, too, possessed boldness, though he preferred
      caution. Nor did the friendship between the two enter into the
      transaction. I was impressed more strongly than ever with the fact that a
      lawsuit was seldom a mere private affair between two persons or
      corporations, but involved a chain of relationships and nine times out of
      ten that chain led up to the Railroad, which nearly always was vitally
      interested in these legal contests. Half an hour of masterly presentation
      of the situation was necessary before Mr. Gorse became convinced that the
      introduction of the bill was the only way out for all concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess you're right, Theodore,&rdquo; he said at length. Whereupon he
      seized his pen and wrote off two notes with great rapidity. These he
      showed to Mr. Watling, who nodded and returned them. They were folded and
      sealed, and handed to me. One was addressed to Colonel Paul Varney, and
      the other to the Hon. W. W. Trulease, governor of the state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can trust this young man?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Gorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; replied Mr. Watling, smiling at me. &ldquo;The bill was his own
      idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The railroad attorney wheeled about in his chair and looked at me; looked
      around me, would better express it, with his indefinite, encompassing yet
      inclusive glance. I had riveted his attention. And from henceforth, I
      knew, I should enter into his calculations. He had made for me a
      compartment in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His own idea!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely suggested it,&rdquo; I was putting in, when he cut me short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you the son of Matthew Paret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave me a queer glance, the significance of which I left untranslated.
      My excitement was too great to analyze what he meant by this mention of my
      father....
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the sidewalk my chief gave me a few parting instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need scarcely say, Hugh,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that your presence in the capital
      should not be advertised as connected with this&mdash;legislation. They
      will probably attribute it to us in the end, but if you're reasonably
      careful, they'll never be able to prove it. And there's no use in putting
      our cards on the table at the beginning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed, sir!&rdquo; I agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took my hand and pressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good luck,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know you'll get along all right.&rdquo;
     </p>

      X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This was not my first visit to the state capital. Indeed, some of that
      recondite knowledge, in which I took a pride, had been gained on the
      occasions of my previous visits. Rising and dressing early, I beheld out
      of the car window the broad, shallow river glinting in the morning
      sunlight, the dome of the state house against the blue of the sky. Even at
      that early hour groups of the gentlemen who made our laws were scattered
      about the lobby of the Potts House, standing or seated within easy reach
      of the gaily coloured cuspidors that protected the marble floor:
      heavy-jawed workers from the cities mingled with moon-faced but astute
      countrymen who manipulated votes amongst farms and villages; fat or
      cadaverous, Irish, German or American, all bore in common a certain
      indefinable stamp. Having eaten my breakfast in a large dining-room that
      resounded with the clatter of dishes, I directed my steps to the apartment
      occupied from year to year by Colonel Paul Barney, generalissimo of the
      Railroad on the legislative battlefield,&mdash;a position that demanded a
      certain uniqueness of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, sir,&rdquo; he said, in a guarded but courteous tone as he
      opened the door. I entered to confront a group of three or four figures,
      silent and rather hostile, seated in a haze of tobacco smoke around a
      marble-topped table. On it reposed a Bible, attached to a chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You probably don't remember me, Colonel,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;My name is Pared, and
      I'm associated with the firm of Watling, Fowndes, and Ripon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His air of marginality,&mdash;heightened by a grey moustache and goatee a
      la Napoleon Third,&mdash;vanished instantly; he became hospitable,
      ingratiating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why certainly, you were down heah with Mr. Fowndes two years
      ago.&rdquo; The Colonel spoke with a slight Southern accent. &ldquo;To be sure, sir.
      I've had the honour of meeting your father. Mr. Norris, of North Haven,
      meet Mr. Paret&mdash;one of our rising lawyers...&rdquo; I shook hands with them
      all and sat down. Opening his long coat, Colonel Varney revealed two rows
      of cigars, suggesting cartridges in a belt. These he proceeded to hand out
      as he talked. &ldquo;I'm glad to see you here, Mr. Paret. You must stay awhile,
      and become acquainted with the men who&mdash;ahem&mdash;are shaping the
      destinies of a great state. It would give me pleasure to escort you
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him. I had learned enough to realize how important are the
      amenities in politics and business. The Colonel did most of the
      conversing; he could not have filled with efficiency and ease the
      important post that was his had it not been for the endless fund of
      humorous anecdotes at his disposal. One by one the visitors left, each
      assuring me of his personal regard: the Colonel closed the door, softly,
      turning the key in the lock; there was a sly look in his black eyes as he
      took a chair in proximity to mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; he asked softly, &ldquo;what's up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further ado I handed him Mr. Gorse's letter, and another Mr.
      Watling had given me for him, which contained a copy of the bill. He read
      these, laid them on the table, glancing at me again, stroking his goatee
      the while. He chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I take off my hat to Theodore Watling, always
      did.&rdquo; He became contemplative. &ldquo;It can be done, Mr. Paret, but it's going
      to take some careful driving, sir, some reaching out and flicking 'em when
      they r'ar and buck. Paul Varney's never been stumped yet. Just as soon as
      this is introduced we'll have Gates and Armstrong down here&mdash;they're
      the Ribblevale attorneys, aren't they? I thought so,&mdash;and the best
      legal talent they can hire. And they'll round up all the disgruntled
      fellows, you know,&mdash;that ain't friendly to the Railroad. We've got to
      do it quick, Mr. Paret. Gorse gave you a letter to the Governor, didn't
      he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come along. I'll pass the word around among the boys, just to let
      'em know what to expect.&rdquo; His eyes glittered again. &ldquo;I've been following
      this Ribblevale business,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and I understand Leonard Dickinson's
      all ready to reorganize that company, when the time comes. He ought to let
      me in for a little, on the ground floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not venture to make any promises for Mr. Dickinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it's just as well if you were to meet me at the Governor's
      office,&rdquo; the Colonel added reflectively, and the hint was not lost on me.
      &ldquo;It's better not to let 'em find out any sooner than they have to where
      this thing comes from,&mdash;you understand.&rdquo; He looked at his watch. &ldquo;How
      would nine o'clock do? I'll be there, with Trulease, when you come,&mdash;by
      accident, you understand. Of course he'll be reasonable, but when they get
      to be governors they have little notions, you know, and you've got to
      indulge 'em, flatter 'em a little. It doesn't hurt, for when they get
      their backs up it only makes more trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put on a soft, black felt hat, and departed noiselessly...
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o'clock I arrived at the State House and was ushered into a great
      square room overlooking the park. The Governor was seated at a desk under
      an elaborate chandelier, and sure enough, Colonel Varney was there beside
      him; making barely perceptible signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Trulease. &ldquo;Your name is a familiar one in your city, sir. And I gather
      from your card that you are associated with my good friend, Theodore
      Watling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I acknowledged it. I was not a little impressed by the perfect blend of
      cordiality, democratic simplicity and impressiveness Mr. Trulease had
      achieved. For he had managed, in the course of a long political career, to
      combine in exact proportions these elements which, in the public mind,
      should up the personality of a chief executive. Momentarily he overcame
      the feeling of superiority with which I had entered his presence;
      neutralized the sense I had of being associated now with the higher powers
      which had put him where he was. For I knew all about his &ldquo;record.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're acquainted with Colonel Varney?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Governor, I've met the Colonel,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose your firm is getting its share of business these days,&rdquo;
       Mr. Trulease observed. I acknowledged it was, and after discussing for a
      few moments the remarkable growth of my native city the Governor tapped on
      his desk and inquired what he could do for me. I produced the letter from
      the attorney for the Railroad. The Governor read it gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from Mr. Gorse.&rdquo; A copy of the proposed bill was enclosed,
      and the Governor read that also, hemmed and hawed a little, turned and
      handed it to Colonel Varney, who was sitting with a detached air, smoking
      contemplatively, a vacant expression on his face. &ldquo;What do you think of
      this, Colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the Colonel tore himself away from his reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that, Governor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Gorse has called my attention to what seems to him a flaw in our
      statutes, an inability to obtain testimony from corporations whose books
      are elsewhere, and who may thus evade, he says, to a certain extent, the
      sovereign will of our state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel took the paper with an admirable air of surprise, adjusted his
      glasses, and became absorbed in reading, clearing his throat once or twice
      and emitting an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you ask me, Governor,&rdquo; he said, at length, &ldquo;all I can say is
      that I am astonished somebody didn't think of this simple remedy before
      now. Many times, sir, have I seen justice defeated because we had no such
      legislation as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed it back. The Governor studied it once more, and coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the penalty,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;seem to you a little severe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the Colonel, emphatically. &ldquo;Perhaps it is because I am
      anxious, as a citizen, to see an evil abated. I have had an intimate
      knowledge of legislation, sir, for more than twenty years in this state,
      and in all that time I do not remember to have seen a bill more concisely
      drawn, or better calculated to accomplish the ends of justice. Indeed, I
      often wondered why this very penalty was not imposed. Foreign magistrates
      are notoriously indifferent as to affairs in another state than their own.
      Rather than go into the hands of a receiver I venture to say that
      hereafter, if this bill is made a law, the necessary testimony will be
      forthcoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Governor read the bill through again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is introduced, Colonel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the legislature and the people
      of the state ought to have it made clear to them that its aim is to remedy
      an injustice. A misunderstanding on this point would be unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most unfortunate, Governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course,&rdquo; added the Governor, now addressing me, &ldquo;it would be
      improper for me to indicate what course I shall pursue in regard to it if
      it should come to me for my signature. Yet I may go so far as to say that
      the defect it seeks to remedy seems to me a real one. Come in and see me,
      Mr. Paret, when you are in town, and give my cordial regards to Mr.
      Watling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So gravely had the farce been carried on that I almost laughed, despite
      the fact that the matter in question was a serious one for me. The
      Governor held out his hand, and I accepted my dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not gone fifty steps in the corridor before I heard the Colonel's
      voice in my ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had to give him a little rope to go through with his act,&rdquo; he
      whispered confidentially. &ldquo;But he'll sign it all right. And now, if you'll
      excuse me, Mr. Paret, I'll lay a few mines. See you at the hotel, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus he indicated, delicately, that it would be better for me to keep out
      of sight. On my way to the Potts House the bizarre elements in the
      situation struck me again with considerable force. It seemed so
      ridiculous, so puerile to have to go through with this political farce in
      order that a natural economic evolution might be achieved. Without doubt
      the development of certain industries had reached a stage where the units
      in competition had become too small, when a greater concentration of
      capital was necessary. Curiously enough, in this mental argument of
      justification, I left out all consideration of the size of the probable
      profits to Mr. Scherer and his friends. Profits and brains went together.
      And, since the Almighty did not limit the latter, why should man attempt
      to limit the former? We were playing for high but justifiable stakes; and
      I resented the comedy which an hypocritical insistence on the forms of
      democracy compelled us to go through. It seemed unworthy of men who
      controlled the destinies of state and nation. The point of view, however,
      was consoling. As the day wore on I sat in the Colonel's room, admiring
      the skill with which he conducted the campaign: a green country lawyer had
      been got to introduce the bill, it had been expedited to the Committee on
      the Judiciary, which would have an executive session immediately after
      dinner. I had ventured to inquire about the hearings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There won't be any hearings, sir,&rdquo; the Colonel assured me. &ldquo;We own that
      committee from top to bottom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, by four o'clock in the afternoon the message came that the
      committee had agreed to recommend the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after that the first flurry occurred. There came a knock at the
      door, followed by the entrance of a stocky Irish American of about forty
      years of age, whose black hair was plastered over his forehead. His
      sea-blue eyes had a stormy look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Jim,&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;I was just wondering where you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, you must have been!&rdquo; replied the gentleman sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Colonel's geniality was unruffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Maker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you ought to know Mr. Paret. Mr. Maker is the
      representative from Ward Five of your city, and we can always count on him
      to do the right thing, even if he is a Democrat. How about it, Jim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Maker relighted the stump of his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a fresh one, Jim,&rdquo; said the Colonel, opening a bureau drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Maker took two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Colonel,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;what's this bill that went into the
      judiciary this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What bill?&rdquo; asked the Colonel, blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think I ain't on?&rdquo; Mr. Maker inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been, Jim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been up to the city, seem' my wife&mdash;that's where I've been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel smiled, as at a harmless fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you weren't here, I don't see what right you've got to complain.
      I never leave my good Democratic friends on the outside, do I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; replied Mr. Maker, doggedly, &ldquo;I'm on, I'm here now,
      and that bill in the Judiciary doesn't pass without me. I guess I can stop
      it, too. How about a thousand apiece for five of us boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're pretty good at a joke, Jim,&rdquo; remarked the Colonel, stroking his
      goatee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you're looking for a little publicity in this here game,&rdquo; retorted
      Mr. Maker, darkly. &ldquo;Say, Colonel, ain't we always treated the Railroad on
      the level?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; asked the Colonel, gently, &ldquo;didn't I always take care of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had laid his hand on the shoulder of Mr. Maker, who appeared slightly
      mollified, and glanced at a massive silver watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll be dropping in about eight o'clock,&rdquo; was his significant
      reply, as he took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we'll have to grease the wheels a little,&rdquo; the Colonel remarked
      to me, and gazed at the ceiling....
    </p>
    <p>
      The telegram apropos of the Ward Five leader was by no means the only
      cipher message I sent back during my stay. I had not needed to be told
      that the matter in hand would cost money, but Mr. Watling's parting
      instruction to me had been to take the Colonel's advice as to specific
      sums, and obtain confirmation from Fowndes. Nor was it any surprise to me
      to find Democrats on intimate terms with such a stout Republican as the
      Colonel. Some statesman is said to have declared that he knew neither
      Easterners nor Westerners, Northerners nor Southerners, but only
      Americans; so Colonel Varney recognized neither Democrats nor Republicans;
      in our legislature party divisions were sunk in a greater loyalty to the
      Railroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Colonel's suggestion I had laid in a liberal supply of cigars and
      whiskey. The scene in his room that evening suggested a session of a
      sublimated grand lodge of some secret order, such were the mysterious
      comings and goings, knocks and suspenses. One after another the
      &ldquo;important&rdquo; men duly appeared and were introduced, the Colonel supplying
      the light touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, cuss me if it isn't Billy! Mr. Paret, I want you to shake hands with
      Mr. Donovan, the floor leader of the 'opposition,' sir. Mr. Donovan has
      had the habit of coming up here for a friendly chat ever since he first
      came down to the legislature. How long is it, Billy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it's nigh on to fifteen years, Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen years!&rdquo; echoed the Colonel, &ldquo;and he's so good a Democrat it
      hasn't changed his politics a particle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Donovan grinned in appreciation of this thrust, helped himself
      liberally from the bottle on the mantel, and took a seat on the bed. We
      had a &ldquo;friendly chat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus I made the acquaintance also of the Hon. Joseph Mecklin, Speaker of
      the House, who unbent in the most flattering way on learning my identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Paret's here on that little matter, representing Watling, Fowndes and
      Ripon,&rdquo; the Colonel explained. And it appeared that Mr. Mecklin knew all
      about the &ldquo;little matter,&rdquo; and that the mention of the firm of Watling,
      Fowndes and Ripon had a magical effect in these parts. The President of
      the Senate, the Hon. Lafe Giddings, went so far as to say that he hoped
      before long to see Mr. Watling in Washington. By no means the least among
      our callers was the Hon. Fitch Truesdale, editor of the St. Helen's
      Messenger, whose editorials were of the trite effectiveness that is taken
      widely for wisdom, and were assiduously copied every week by other state
      papers and labeled &ldquo;Mr. Truesdale's Common Sense.&rdquo; At countless firesides
      in our state he was known as the spokesman of the plain man, who was
      blissfully ignorant of the fact that Mr. Truesdale was owned body and
      carcass by Mr. Cyrus Ridden, the principal manufacturer of St. Helen's and
      a director in several subsidiary lines of the Railroad. In the
      legislature, the Hon. Fitch's function was that of the moderate counsellor
      and bellwether for new members, hence nothing could have been more fitting
      than the choice of that gentleman for the honour of moving, on the morrow,
      that Bill No. 709 ought to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Truesdale reluctantly consented to accept a small &ldquo;loan&rdquo; that would
      help to pay the mortgage on his new press....
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last of the gathering had departed, about one o'clock in the
      morning, I had added considerably to my experience, gained a pretty
      accurate idea of who was who in the legislature and politics of the state,
      and established relationships&mdash;as the Colonel reminded me&mdash;likely
      to prove valuable in the future. It seemed only gracious to congratulate
      him on his management of the affair,&mdash;so far. He appeared pleased,
      and squeezed my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, it did require a little delicacy of touch. And if I do say it
      myself, it hasn't been botched,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;There ain't an outsider, as
      far as I can learn, who has caught on to the nigger in the wood-pile.
      That's the great thing, to keep 'em ignorant as long as possible. You
      understand. They yell bloody murder when they do find out, but generally
      it's too late, if a bill's been handled right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I found myself speculating as to who the &ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; might be. No
      Ribblevale attorneys were on the spot as yet,&mdash;of that I was
      satisfied. In the absence of these, who were the opposition? It seemed to
      me as though I had interviewed that day every man in the legislature.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was very tired. But when I got into bed, it was impossible to sleep. My
      eyes smarted from the tobacco smoke; and the events of the day, in
      disorderly manner, kept running through my head. The tide of my
      exhilaration had ebbed, and I found myself struggling against a revulsion
      caused, apparently, by the contemplation of Colonel Varney and his
      associates; the instruments, in brief, by which our triumph over our
      opponents was to be effected. And that same idea which, when launched
      amidst the surroundings of the Boyne Club, had seemed so brilliant, now
      took on an aspect of tawdriness. Another thought intruded itself,&mdash;that
      of Mr. Pugh, the president of the Ribblevale Company. My father had known
      him, and some years before I had traveled halfway across the state in his
      company; his kindliness had impressed me. He had spent a large part of his
      business life, I knew, in building up the Ribblevale, and now it was to be
      wrested from him; he was to be set aside, perhaps forced to start all over
      again when old age was coming on! In vain I accused myself of
      sentimentality, and summoned all my arguments to prove that in commerce
      efficiency must be the only test. The image of Mr. Pugh would not down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up and turned on the light, and took refuge in a novel I had in my
      bag. Presently I grew calmer. I had chosen. I had succeeded. And now that
      I had my finger at last on the nerve of power, it was no time to weaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half-past six when I awoke and went to the window, relieved to find
      that the sun had scattered my morbid fancies with the darkness; and I
      speculated, as I dressed, whether the thing called conscience were not,
      after all, a matter of nerves. I went downstairs through the tobacco-stale
      atmosphere of the lobby into the fresh air and sparkly sunlight of the
      mild February morning, and leaving the business district I reached the
      residence portion of the little town. The front steps of some of the
      comfortable houses were being swept by industrious servant girls, and out
      of the chimneys twisted, fantastically, rich blue smoke; the bare branches
      of the trees were silver-grey against the sky; gaining at last an
      old-fashioned, wooden bridge, I stood for awhile gazing at the river, over
      the shallows of which the spendthrift hand of nature had flung a shower of
      diamonds. And I reflected that the world was for the strong, for him who
      dared reach out his hand and take what it offered. It was not money we
      coveted, we Americans, but power, the self-expression conferred by power.
      A single experience such as I had had the night before would since to
      convince any sane man that democracy was a failure, that the world-old
      principle of aristocracy would assert itself, that the attempt of our
      ancestors to curtail political power had merely resulted in the growth of
      another and greater economic power that bade fair to be limitless. As I
      walked slowly back into town I felt a reluctance to return to the noisy
      hotel, and finding myself in front of a little restaurant on a side
      street, I entered it. There was but one other customer in the place, and
      he was seated on the far side of the counter, with a newspaper in front of
      him; and while I was ordering my breakfast I was vaguely aware that the
      newspaper had dropped, and that he was looking at me. In the slight
      interval that elapsed before my brain could register his identity I
      experienced a distinct shock of resentment; a sense of the reintrusion of
      an antagonistic value at a moment when it was most unwelcome....
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had risen and was coming around the counter. He was Hermann Krebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paret!&rdquo; I heard him say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not seem to notice the lack of cordiality in my tone. He appeared
      so genuinely glad to see me again that I instantly became rather ashamed
      of my ill nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm here&mdash;in the legislature,&rdquo; he informed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Solon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm only a spectator. Down here for a day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was still lanky, his clothes gave no evidence of an increased
      prosperity, but his complexion was good, his skin had cleared. I was more
      than ever baked by a resolute good humour, a simplicity that was not
      innocence, a whimsical touch seemingly indicative of a state of mind that
      refused to take too seriously certain things on which I set store. What
      right had he to be contented with life?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I too am only a spectator here,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I'm neither fish,
      flesh nor fowl, nor good red herring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were going into the law, weren't you?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I remember you said
      something about it that day we met at Beverly Farms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I managed it, after all. Then I went back home to Elkington to try
      to make a living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But somehow I have never thought of you as being likely to develop
      political aspirations, Krebs,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say not! he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet here you are, launched upon a political career! How did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not worrying about the career,&rdquo; he assured me. &ldquo;I got here by
      accident, and I'm afraid it won't happen again in a hurry. You see, the
      hands in those big mills we have in Elkington sprang a surprise on the
      machine, and the first thing I knew I was nominated for the legislature. A
      committee came to my boarding-house and told me, and there was the deuce
      to pay, right off. The Railroad politicians turned in and worked for the
      Democratic candidate, of course, and the Hutchinses, who own the mills,
      tried through emissaries to intimidate their operatives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;I'm here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't you be accomplishing more,&rdquo; I inquired, &ldquo;if you hadn't
      antagonized the Hutchinses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends upon what you mean by accomplishment,&rdquo; he answered, so mildly
      that I felt more rued than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, from what you say, I suppose you're going in for reform, that these
      workmen up at Elkington are not satisfied with their conditions and
      imagine you can help to better them. Now, provided the conditions are not
      as good as they might be, how are you going to improve them if you find
      yourself isolated here, as you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, I should cooperate with Colonel Varney and other
      disinterested philanthropists,&rdquo; he supplied, and I realized that I was
      losing my temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can you do?&rdquo; I inquired defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can find out what's going on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have already learned
      something, by the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; I asked, wondering whether the implication were personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can help&mdash;disseminate the knowledge. I may be wrong, but I
      have an idea that when the people of this country learn how their
      legislatures are conducted they will want to change things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right!&rdquo; echoed the waiter, who had come up with my griddle-cakes.
      &ldquo;And you're the man to tell 'em, Mr. Krebs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will need several thousand of us to do that, I'm afraid,&rdquo; said Krebs,
      returning his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      My distaste for the situation became more acute, but I felt that I was
      thrown on the defensive. I could not retreat, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are wrong,&rdquo; I declared, when the waiter had departed to
      attend to another customer. &ldquo;The people the great majority of them, at
      least are indifferent, they don't want to be bothered with politics. There
      will always be labour agitation, of course,&mdash;the more wages those
      fellows get, the more they want. We pay the highest wages in the world
      to-day, and the standard of living is higher in this country than anywhere
      else. They'd ruin our prosperity, if we'd let 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the thousands of families who don't earn enough to live
      decently even in times of prosperity?&rdquo; inquired Krebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's hard, I'll admit, but the inefficient and the shiftless are bound to
      suffer, no matter what form of government you adopt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk about standards of living,&mdash;I could show you some examples
      of standards to make your heart sick,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What you don't realize,
      perhaps, is that low standards help to increase the inefficient of whom
      you complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled rather sadly. &ldquo;The prosperity you are advocating,&rdquo; he added,
      after a moment, &ldquo;is a mere fiction, it is gorging the few at the expense
      of the many. And what is being done in this country is to store up an
      explosive gas that some day will blow your superstructure to atoms if you
      don't wake up in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't that a rather one-sided view, too?&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've no doubt it may appear so, but take the proceedings in this
      legislature. I've no doubt you know something about them, and that you
      would maintain they are justified on account of the indifference of the
      public, and of other reasons, but I can cite an instance that is simply
      legalized thieving.&rdquo; For the first time a note of indignation crept into
      Krebs's voice. &ldquo;Last night I discovered by a mere accident, in talking to
      a man who came in on a late train, that a bill introduced yesterday, which
      is being rushed through the Judiciary Committee of the House&mdash;an
      apparently innocent little bill&mdash;will enable, if it becomes a law,
      the Boyne Iron Works, of your city, to take possession of the Ribblevale
      Steel Company, lock, stock, and barrel. And I am told it was conceived by
      a lawyer who claims to be a respectable member of his profession, and who
      has extraordinary ability, Theodore Watling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Krebs put his hand in his pocket and drew out a paper. &ldquo;Here's a copy of
      it,&mdash;House Bill 709.&rdquo; His expression suddenly changed. &ldquo;Perhaps Mr.
      Watling is a friend of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm with his firm,&rdquo; I replied....
    </p>
    <p>
      Krebs's fingers closed over the paper, crumpling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, then, you know about this,&rdquo; he said. He was putting the paper back
      into his pocket when I took it from him. But my adroitness, so carefully
      schooled, seemed momentarily to have deserted me. What should I say? It
      was necessary to decide quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you take rather a&mdash;prejudiced view of this, Krebs?&rdquo; I said.
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I can't see why you should accept a rumour running around
      the lobbies that Mr. Watling drafted this bill for a particular purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent. But his eyes did not leave my face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should any sensible man, a member of the legislature, take stock in
      that kind of gossip?&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;Why not judge this bill by its face,
      without heeding a cock and bull story as to how it may have originated? It
      is a good bill, or a bad bill? Let's see what it says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I can see, it is legislation which we ought to have had long
      ago, and tends to compel a publicity in corporation affairs that is much
      needed, to put a stop to practices which every decent citizen deplores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew the paper out of my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't go on, Paret,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;It's no use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm sorry we don't agree,&rdquo; I said, and got up. I left him twisting
      the paper in his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside the clerk's desk in the Potts House, relating one of his anecdotes,
      I spied Colonel Varney, and managed presently to draw him upstairs to his
      room. &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know a man named Krebs in the House?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Elkington? Why, that's the man the Hutchinses let slip through,&mdash;the
      Hutchinses, who own the mills over there. The agitators put up a job on
      them.&rdquo; The Colonel was no longer the genial and social purveyor of
      anecdotes. He had become tense, alert, suspicious. &ldquo;What's he up to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's found out about this bill,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. But someone told him that it originated in our office, and
      that we were going to use it in our suit against the Ribblevale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I related the circumstances of my running across Krebs, speaking of having
      known him at Harvard. Colonel Varney uttered an oath, and strode across to
      the window, where he stood looking down into the street from between the
      lace curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to attend to him, right off,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised to find myself resenting the imputation, and deeply. &ldquo;I'm
      afraid he's one of those who can't be 'attended to,'&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that he's in the employ of the Ribblevale people?&rdquo; the Colonel
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean anything of the kind,&rdquo; I retorted, with more heat, perhaps,
      than I realized. The Colonel looked at me queerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Mr. Paret. Of course I don't want to question your
      judgment, sir. And you say he's a friend of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I knew him at college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will pardon me,&rdquo; the Colonel went on, &ldquo;when I tell you that I've
      had some experience with that breed, and I have yet to see one of 'em you
      couldn't come to terms with in some way&mdash;in some way,&rdquo; he added,
      significantly. I did not pause to reflect that the Colonel's attitude,
      from his point of view (yes, and from mine,&mdash;had I not adopted it?)
      was the logical one. In that philosophy every man had his price, or his
      weakness. Yet, such is the inconsistency of human nature, I was now unable
      to contemplate this attitude with calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Krebs is a lawyer. Has he accepted a pass from the Railroad?&rdquo; I
      demanded, knowing the custom of that corporation of conferring this
      delicate favour on the promising young talent in my profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he's never had the chance,&rdquo; said Mr. Varney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, has he taken a pass as a member of the legislature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&mdash;I remember looking that up when he first came down. Sent that
      back, if I recall the matter correctly.&rdquo; Colonel Varney went to a desk in
      the corner of the room, unlocked it, drew forth a black book, and running
      his fingers through the pages stopped at the letter K. &ldquo;Yes, sent back his
      legislative pass, but I've known 'em to do that when they were holding out
      for something more. There must be somebody who can get close to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel ruminated awhile. Then he strode to the door and called out to
      the group of men who were always lounging in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell Alf Young I want to see him, Fred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited, by no means free from uneasiness and anxiety, from a certain
      lack of self-respect that was unfamiliar. Mr. Young, the Colonel
      explained, was a legal light in Galesburg, near Elkington,&mdash;the
      Railroad lawyer there. And when at last Mr. Young appeared he proved to be
      an oily gentleman of about forty, inclining to stoutness, with one of
      those &ldquo;blue,&rdquo; shaven faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want me, Colonel?&rdquo; he inquired blithely, when the door had closed behind
      him; and added obsequiously, when introduced to me, &ldquo;Glad to meet you, Mr.
      Paret. My regards to Mr. Watling, when you go back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alf,&rdquo; demanded the Colonel, &ldquo;what do you know of this fellow Krebs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Young laughed. Krebs was &ldquo;nutty,&rdquo; he declared&mdash;that was all there
      was to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't he&mdash;listen to reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been tried, Colonel. Say, he wouldn't know a hundred-dollar bill if
      you showed him one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, something,&mdash;that's sure, they all want something.&rdquo; Mr. Young
      shrugged his shoulder expressively, and by a skillful manipulation of his
      lips shifted his cigar from one side of his mouth to the other without
      raising his hands. &ldquo;But it ain't money. I guess he's got a notion that
      later on the labour unions'll send him to the United States Senate some
      day. He's no slouch, either, when it comes to law. I can tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no flaw in his&mdash;record?&rdquo; Colonel Varney's agate eyes sought
      those of Mr. Young, meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's been tried, too,&rdquo; declared the Galesburg attorney. &ldquo;Say, you can
      believe it or not, but we've never dug anything up so far. He's been too
      slick for us, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed the Colonel, at length, &ldquo;let him squeal and be d&mdash;d!
      He can't do any more than make a noise. Only I hoped we'd be able to
      grease this thing along and slide it through the Senate this afternoon,
      before they got wind of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll squeal, all right, until you smother him,&rdquo; Mr. Young observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll smother him some day!&rdquo; replied the Colonel, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Young laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as I made my way toward the State House I was conscious of a feeling
      of relief. I had no sooner gained a front seat in the gallery of the House
      of Representatives when the members rose, the Senate marched gravely in,
      the Speaker stopped jesting with the Chaplain, and over the Chaplain's
      face came suddenly an agonized expression. Folding his hands across his
      stomach he began to call on God with terrific fervour, in an intense and
      resounding voice. I was struck suddenly by the irony of it all. Why have a
      legislature when Colonel Paul Varney was so efficient! The legislature was
      a mere sop to democratic prejudice, to pray over it heightened the
      travesty. Suppose there were a God after all? not necessarily the
      magnified monarch to whom these pseudo-democrats prayed, but an
      Intelligent Force that makes for righteousness. How did He, or It, like to
      be trifled with in this way? And, if He existed, would not His disgust be
      immeasurable as He contemplated that unctuous figure in the &ldquo;Prince
      Albert&rdquo; coat, who pretended to represent Him?
    </p>
    <p>
      As the routine business began I searched for Krebs, to find him presently
      at a desk beside a window in the rear of the hall making notes on a paper;
      there was, confessedly, little satisfaction in the thought that the man
      whose gaunt features I contemplated was merely one of those impractical
      idealists who beat themselves to pieces against the forces that sway the
      world and must forever sway it. I should be compelled to admit that he
      represented something unique in that assembly if he had the courage to get
      up and oppose House Bill 709. I watched him narrowly; the suggestion
      intruded itself&mdash;perhaps he had been &ldquo;seen,&rdquo; as the Colonel expressed
      it. I repudiated it. I grew impatient, feverish; the monotonous reading of
      the clerk was interrupted now and then by the sharp tones of the Speaker
      assigning his various measures to this or that committee, &ldquo;unless
      objection is offered,&rdquo; while the members moved about and murmured among
      themselves; Krebs had stopped making notes; he was looking out of the
      window. At last, without any change of emphasis in his droning voice, the
      clerk announced the recommendation of the Committee on Judiciary that
      House Bill 709 ought to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in front a man had risen from his seat&mdash;the felicitous Mr.
      Truesdale. Glancing around at his fellow-members he then began to explain
      in the impressive but conversational tone of one whose counsels are in the
      habit of being listened to, that this was merely a little measure to
      remedy a flaw in the statutes. Mr. Truesdale believed in corporations when
      corporations were good, and this bill was calculated to make them good, to
      put an end to jugglery and concealment. Our great state, he said, should
      be in the forefront of such wise legislation, which made for justice and a
      proper publicity; but the bill in question was of greater interest to
      lawyers than to laymen, a committee composed largely of lawyers had
      recommended it unanimously, and he was sure that no opposition would
      develop in the House. In order not to take up their time he asked:
      therefore, that it be immediately put on its second and third reading and
      allowed to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, and I looked at Krebs. Could he, could any man, any lawyer,
      have the presumption to question such an obviously desirable measure, to
      arraign the united judgment of the committee's legal talent? Such was the
      note Mr. Truesdale so admirably struck. As though fascinated, I continued
      to gaze at Krebs. I hated him, I desired to see him humiliated, and yet
      amazingly I found myself wishing with almost equal vehemence that he would
      be true to himself. He was rising,&mdash;slowly, timidly, I thought, his
      hand clutching his desk lid, his voice sounding wholly inadequate as he
      addressed the Speaker. The Speaker hesitated, his tone palpably
      supercilious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman from&mdash;from Elkington, Mr. Krebs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a craning of necks, a staring, a tittering. I burned with
      vicarious shame as Krebs stood there awkwardly, his hand still holding the
      desk. There were cries of &ldquo;louder&rdquo; when he began; some picked up their
      newspapers, while others started conversations. The Speaker rapped with
      his gavel, and I failed to hear the opening words. Krebs paused, and began
      again. His speech did not, at first, flow easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Speaker, I rise to protest against this bill, which in my opinion is
      not so innocent as the gentleman from St. Helen's would have the House
      believe. It is on a par, indeed, with other legislation that in past years
      has been engineered through this legislature under the guise of beneficent
      law. No, not on a par. It is the most arrogant, the most monstrous example
      of special legislation of them all. And while I do not expect to be able
      to delay its passage much longer than the time I shall be on my feet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not sit down?&rdquo; came a voice, just audible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned swiftly toward the offender his profile had an eagle-like
      effect that startled me, seemingly realizing a new quality in the man. It
      was as though he had needed just the stimulus of that interruption to
      electrify and transform him. His awkwardness disappeared; and if he was a
      little bombastic, a little &ldquo;young,&rdquo; he spoke with the fire of conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;because I should lose my self-respect for life if I
      sat here and permitted the political organization of a railroad, the
      members of which are here under the guise of servants of the people, to
      cow me into silence. And if it be treason to mention the name of that
      Railroad in connection with its political tyranny, then make the most of
      it.&rdquo; He let go of the desk, and tapped the copy of the bill. &ldquo;What are the
      facts? The Boyne Iron Works, under the presidency of Adolf Scherer, has
      been engaged in litigation with the Ribblevale Steel Company for some
      years: and this bill is intended to put into the hands of the attorneys
      for Mr. Scherer certain information that will enable him to get possession
      of the property. Gentlemen, that is what 'legal practice' has descended to
      in the hands of respectable lawyers. This device originated with the
      resourceful Mr. Theodore Watling, and if it had not had the approval of
      Mr. Miller Gorse, it would never have got any farther than the judiciary
      committee. It was confided to the skillful care of Colonel Paul Varney to
      be steered through this legislature, as hundreds of other measures have
      been steered through,&mdash;without unnecessary noise. It may be asked why
      the Railroad should bother itself by lending its political organization to
      private corporations? I will tell you. Because corporations like the Boyne
      corporation are a part of a network of interests, these corporations aid
      the Railroad to maintain its monopoly, and in return receive rebates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Krebs had raised his voice as the murmurs became louder. At this point a
      sharp-faced lawyer from Belfast got to his feet and objected that the
      gentleman from Elkington was wasting the time of the House, indulging in
      hearsay. His remarks were not germane, etc. The Speaker rapped again, with
      a fine show of impartiality, and cautioned the member from Elkington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Krebs. &ldquo;I have said what I wanted to say on that
      score, and I know it to be the truth. And if this House does not find it
      germane, the day is coming when its constituents will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon he entered into a discussion of the bill, dissecting it with
      more calmness, with an ability that must have commanded, even from some
      hostile minds, an unwilling respect. The penalty, he said, was outrageous,
      hitherto unheard of in law,&mdash;putting a corporation in the hands of a
      receiver, at the mercy of those who coveted it, because one of its
      officers refused, or was unable, to testify. He might be in China, in
      Timbuctoo when the summons was delivered at his last or usual place of
      abode. Here was an enormity, an exercise of tyrannical power exceeding all
      bounds, a travesty on popular government.... He ended by pointing out the
      significance of the fact that the committee had given no hearings; by
      declaring that if the bill became a law, it would inevitably react upon
      the heads of those who were responsible for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down, and there was a flutter of applause from the scattered
      audience in the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, that's the only man in the whole place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was aware, for the first time, of a neighbour at my side,&mdash;a solid,
      red-faced man, evidently a farmer. His trousers were tucked into his
      boots, and his gnarled and powerful hands, ingrained with dirt, clutched
      the arms of the seat as he leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't he just naturally lambaste 'em?&rdquo; he cried excitedly. &ldquo;They'll down
      him, I guess,&mdash;but say, he's right. A man would lose his self-respect
      if he didn't let out his mind at them hoss thieves, wouldn't he? What's
      that fellow's name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Krebs,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;I want to remember that. Durned if I don't shake
      hands with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His excitement astonished me. Would the public feel like that, if they
      only knew?... The Speaker's gavel had come down like a pistol shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      One &ldquo;war-hoss&rdquo;&mdash;as my neighbour called them&mdash;after another
      proceeded to crush the member from Elkington. It was, indeed, very
      skillfully done, and yet it was a process from which I did not derive,
      somehow, much pleasure. Colonel Varney's army had been magnificently
      trained to meet just this kind of situation: some employed ridicule,
      others declared, in impassioned tones, that the good name of their state
      had been wantonly assailed, and pointed fervently to portraits on the
      walls of patriots of the past,&mdash;sentiments that drew applause from
      the fickle gallery. One gentleman observed that the obsession of a
      &ldquo;railroad machine&rdquo; was a sure symptom of a certain kind of insanity, of
      which the first speaker had given many other evidences. The farmer at my
      side remained staunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can't fool me,&rdquo; he said angrily, &ldquo;I know 'em. Do you see that fellow
      gettin' up to talk now? Well, I could tell you a few things about him, all
      right. He comes from Glasgow, and his name's Letchworth. He's done more
      harm in his life than all the criminals he's kept out of prison,&mdash;belongs
      to one of the old families down there, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had, indeed, remarked Letchworth's face, which seemed to me peculiarly
      evil, its lividity enhanced by a shock of grey hair. His method was
      withering sarcasm, and he was clearly unable to control his animus....
    </p>
    <p>
      No champion appeared to support Krebs, who sat pale and tense while this
      denunciation of him was going on. Finally he got the floor. His voice
      trembled a little, whether with passion, excitement, or nervousness it was
      impossible to say. But he contented himself with a brief defiance. If the
      bill passed, he declared, the men who voted for it, the men who were
      behind it, would ultimately be driven from political life by an indignant
      public. He had a higher opinion of the voters of the state than those who
      accused him of slandering it, than those who sat silent and had not lifted
      their voices against this crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bill was put to a vote he demanded a roll call. Ten members
      besides himself were recorded against House Bill No. 709!
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this overwhelming triumph my feelings were not wholly those of
      satisfaction when I returned to the hotel and listened to the exultations
      and denunciations of such politicians as Letchworth, Young, and Colonel
      Varney. Perhaps an image suggesting Hermann Krebs as some splendid animal
      at bay, dragged down by the hounds, is too strong: he had been
      ingloriously crushed, and defeat, even for the sake of conviction, was not
      an inspiring spectacle.... As the chase swept on over his prostrate figure
      I rapidly regained poise and a sense of proportion; a &ldquo;master of life&rdquo;
       could not permit himself to be tossed about by sentimentality; and
      gradually I grew ashamed of my bad quarter of an hour in the gallery of
      the House, and of the effect of it&mdash;which lingered awhile&mdash;as of
      a weakness suddenly revealed, which must at all costs be overcome. I began
      to see something dramatic and sensational in Krebs's performance....
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ribblevale Steel Company was the real quarry, after all. And such had
      been the expedition, the skill and secrecy, with which our affair was
      conducted, that before the Ribblevale lawyers could arrive, alarmed and
      breathless, the bill had passed the House, and their only real chance of
      halting it had been lost. For the Railroad controlled the House, not by
      owning the individuals composing it, but through the leaders who dominated
      it,&mdash;men like Letchworth and Truesdale. These, and Colonel Varney,
      had seen to it that men who had any parliamentary ability had been
      attended to; all save Krebs, who had proved a surprise. There were indeed
      certain members who, although they had railroad passes in their pockets
      (which were regarded as just perquisites,&mdash;the Railroad being so
      rich!), would have opposed the bill if they had felt sufficiently sure of
      themselves to cope with such veterans as Letchworth. Many of these had
      allowed themselves to be won over or cowed by the oratory which had
      crushed Krebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the Ribblevale people&mdash;be it recorded&mdash;scruple to fight
      fire with fire. Their existence, of course, was at stake, and there was no
      public to appeal to. A part of the legal army that rushed to the aid of
      our adversaries spent the afternoon and most of the night organizing all
      those who could be induced by one means or another to reverse their
      sentiments, and in searching for the few who had grievances against the
      existing power. The following morning a motion was introduced to
      reconsider; and in the debate that followed, Krebs, still defiant, took an
      active part. But the resolution required a two-thirds vote, and was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the battle was shifted to the Senate it was as good as lost. The
      Judiciary Committee of the august body did indeed condescend to give
      hearings, at which the Ribblevale lawyers exhausted their energy and
      ingenuity without result with only two dissenting votes the bill was
      calmly passed. In vain was the Governor besieged, entreated, threatened,&mdash;it
      was said; Mr. Trulease had informed protesters&mdash;so Colonel Varney
      gleefully reported&mdash;that he had &ldquo;become fully convinced of the
      inherent justice of the measure.&rdquo; On Saturday morning he signed it, and it
      became a law....
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Varney, as he accompanied me to the train, did not conceal his
      jubilation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I ought not to say it, Mr. Paret, but it couldn't have been done
      neater. That's the art in these little affairs, to get 'em runnin' fast,
      to get momentum on 'em before the other party wakes up, and then he can't
      stop 'em.&rdquo; As he shook hands in farewell he added, with more gravity:
      &ldquo;We'll see each other often, sir, I guess. My very best regards to Mr.
      Watling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Needless to say, I had not confided to him the part I had played in
      originating House Bill No. 709, now a law of the state. But as the train
      rolled on through the sunny winter landscape a sense of well-being, of
      importance and power began to steal through me. I was victoriously bearing
      home my first scalp,&mdash;one which was by no means to be despised.... It
      was not until we reached Rossiter, about five o'clock, that I was able to
      get the evening newspapers. Such was the perfection of the organization of
      which I might now call myself an integral part that the &ldquo;best&rdquo;
       publications contained only the barest mention,&mdash;and that in the
      legislative news,&mdash;of the signing of the bill. I read with
      complacency and even with amusement the flaring headlines I had
      anticipated in Mr. Lawler's 'Pilot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Governor Signs It!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Special legislation, forced through by the Railroad Lobby, which will
      drive honest corporations from this state.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ribblevale Steel Company the Victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was common talk in the capital, the article went on to say, that
      Theodore Watling himself had drawn up the measure.... Perusing the
      editorial page my eye fell on the name, Krebs. One member of the
      legislature above all deserved the gratitude of the people of the state,&mdash;the
      member from Elkington. &ldquo;An unknown man, elected in spite of the opposition
      of the machine, he had dared to raise his voice against this iniquity,&rdquo;
       etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had won. That was the essential thing. And my legal experience had
      taught me that victory counts; defeat is soon forgotten. Even the
      discontented, half-baked and heterogeneous element from which the Pilot
      got its circulation had short memories.

      XI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, which was Sunday, I went to Mr. Watling's house in,
      Fillmore Street&mdash;a new residence at that time, being admired as the
      dernier cri in architecture. It had a mediaeval look, queer dormers in a
      steep roof of red tiles, leaded windows buried deep in walls of rough
      stone. Emerging from the recessed vestibule on a level with the street
      were the Watling twins, aglow with health, dressed in identical costumes
      of blue. They had made their bow to society that winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, here's Hugh!&rdquo; said Frances. &ldquo;Doesn't he look pleased with himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's come to take us to church,&rdquo; said Janet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's much too important,&rdquo; said Frances. &ldquo;He's made a killing of some
      sort,&mdash;haven't you, Hugh?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      I rang the bell and stood watching them as they departed, reflecting that
      I was thirty-two years of age and unmarried. Mr. Watling, surrounded with
      newspapers and seated before his library fire, glanced up at me with a
      welcoming smile: how had I borne the legislative baptism of fire? Such, I
      knew, was its implication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything went through according to schedule, eh? Well, I congratulate
      you, Hugh,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I didn't have much to do with it,&rdquo; I answered, smiling back at him.
      &ldquo;I kept out of sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's an art in itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had an opportunity, at close range, to study the methods of our
      lawmakers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're not particularly edifying,&rdquo; Mr. Watling replied. &ldquo;But they seem,
      unfortunately, to be necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such had been my own thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this man Krebs?&rdquo; he inquired suddenly. &ldquo;And why didn't Varney get
      hold of him and make him listen to reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid it wouldn't have been any use,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;He was in my class
      at Harvard. I knew him&mdash;slightly. He worked his way through, and had
      a pretty hard time of it. I imagine it affected his ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he, a Socialist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of the sort.&rdquo; In Theodore Watling's vigorous, sanity-exhaling
      presence Krebs's act appeared fantastic, ridiculous. &ldquo;He has queer notions
      about a new kind of democracy which he says is coming. I think he is the
      kind of man who would be willing to die for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in these days!&rdquo; Mr. Watling looked at me incredulously. &ldquo;If that's
      so, we must keep an eye on him, a sincere fanatic is a good deal more
      dangerous than a reformer who wants something. There are such men,&rdquo; he
      added, &ldquo;but they are rare. How was the Governor, Trulease?&rdquo; he asked
      suddenly. &ldquo;Tractable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behaved like a lamb, although he insisted upon going through with his
      little humbug,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watling laughed. &ldquo;They always do,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;and waste a lot of
      valuable time. You'll find some light cigars in the corner, Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat down beside him and we spent the morning going over the details of
      the Ribblevale suit, Mr. Watling delegating to me certain matters
      connected with it of a kind with which I had not hitherto been entrusted;
      and he spoke again, before I left, of his intention of taking me into the
      firm as soon as the affair could be arranged. Walking homeward, with my
      mind intent upon things to come, I met my mother at the corner of Lyme
      Street coming from church. Her face lighted up at sight of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been working to-day, Hugh?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I explained that I had spent the morning with Mr. Watling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you a secret, mother. I'm going to be taken into the firm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, I'm so glad!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I often think, if only your
      father were alive, how happy he would be, and how proud of you. I wish he
      could know. Perhaps he does know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Theodore Watling had once said to me that the man who can best keep his
      own counsel is the best counsel for other men to keep. I did not go about
      boasting of the part I had played in originating the now famous Bill No.
      709, the passage of which had brought about the capitulation of the
      Ribblevale Steel Company to our clients. But Ralph Hambleton knew of it,
      of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a pretty good thing you pulled off, Hughie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn't
      think you had it in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was rank patronage, of course, yet I was secretly pleased. As the years
      went on I was thrown more and more with him, though in boyhood there had
      been between us no bond of sympathy. About this time he was beginning to
      increase very considerably the Hambleton fortune, and a little later I
      became counsel for the Crescent Gas and Electric Company, in which he had
      shrewdly gained a controlling interest. Even toward the colossal game of
      modern finance his attitude was characteristically that of the dilettante,
      of the amateur; he played it, as it were, contemptuously, even as he had
      played poker at Harvard, with a cynical audacity that had a peculiarly
      disturbing effect upon his companions. He bluffed, he raised the limit in
      spite of protests, and when he lost one always had the feeling that he
      would ultimately get his money back twice over. At the conferences in the
      Boyne Club, which he often attended, his manner toward Mr. Dickinson and
      Mr. Scherer and even toward Miller Gorse was frequently one of thinly
      veiled amusement at their seriousness. I often wondered that they did not
      resent it. But he was a privileged person.
    </p>
    <p>
      His cousin, Ham Durrett, whose inheritance was even greater than Ralph's
      had been, had also become a privileged person whose comings and goings and
      more reputable doings were often recorded in the newspapers. Ham had
      attained to what Gene Hollister aptly but inadvertently called
      &ldquo;notoriety&rdquo;: as Ralph wittily remarked, Ham gave to polo and women that
      which might have gone into high finance. He spent much of his time in the
      East; his conduct there and at home would once have created a black
      scandal in our community, but we were gradually leaving our Calvinism
      behind us and growing more tolerant: we were ready to Forgive much to
      wealth especially if it was inherited. Hostesses lamented the fact that
      Ham was &ldquo;wild,&rdquo; but they asked him to dinners and dances to meet their
      daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      If some moralist better educated and more far-seeing than Perry Blackwood
      (for Perry had become a moralist) had told these hostesses that Hambleton
      Durrett was a victim of our new civilization, they would have raised their
      eyebrows. They deplored while they coveted. If Ham had been told he was a
      victim of any sort, he would have laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He enjoyed life; he was genial and jovial, both lavish and parsimonious,&mdash;this
      latter characteristic being the curious survival of the trait of the
      ancestors to which he owed his millions. He was growing even heavier, and
      decidedly red in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perry used to take Ralph to task for not saving Ham from his iniquities,
      and Ralph would reply that Ham was going to the devil anyway, and not even
      the devil himself could stop him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can stop him, and you know it,&rdquo; Perry retorted indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to do with him?&rdquo; asked Ralph. &ldquo;Convert him to the
      saintly life I lead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a poser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact,&rdquo; sand Perry, &ldquo;you're no better than he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you mean by 'better,'&rdquo; retorted Ralph, grinning. &ldquo;I'm
      wiser, that's all.&rdquo; (We had been talking about the ethics of business when
      Perry had switched off to Ham.) &ldquo;I believe, at least, in restraint of
      trade. Ham doesn't believe in restraint of any kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When, therefore, the news suddenly began to be circulated in the Boyne
      Club that Ham was showing a tendency to straighten up, surprise and
      incredulity were genuine. He was drinking less,&mdash;much less; and it
      was said that he had severed certain ties that need not again be
      definitely mentioned. The theory of religious regeneration not being
      tenable, it was naturally supposed that he had fallen in love; the
      identity of the unknown lady becoming a fruitful subject of speculation
      among the feminine portion of society. The announcement of the marriage of
      Hambleton Durrett would be news of the first magnitude, to be absorbed
      eagerly by the many who had not the honour of his acquaintance,&mdash;comparable
      only to that of a devastating flood or a murder mystery or a change in the
      tariff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being absorbed in affairs that seemed more important, the subject did not
      interest me greatly. But one cold Sunday afternoon, as I made my way, in
      answer to her invitation, to see Nancy Willett, I found myself wondering
      idly whether she might not be by way of making a shrewd guess as to the
      object of Hambleton's affections. It was well known that he had
      entertained a hopeless infatuation for her; and some were inclined to
      attribute his later lapses to her lack of response. He still called on
      her, and her lectures, which she delivered like a great aunt with a
      recondite knowledge of the world, he took meekly. But even she had seemed
      powerless to alter his habits....
    </p>
    <p>
      Powell Street, that happy hunting-ground of my youth, had changed its
      character, become contracted and unfamiliar, sooty. The McAlerys and other
      older families who had not decayed with the neighbourhood were rapidly
      deserting it, moving out to the new residence district known as &ldquo;the
      Heights.&rdquo; I came to the Willett House. That, too, had an air of
      shabbiness,&mdash;of well-tended shabbiness, to be sure; the stone steps
      had been scrupulously scrubbed, but one of them was cracked clear across,
      and the silver on the polished name-plate was wearing off; even the act of
      pulling the knob of a door-bell was becoming obsolete, so used had we
      grown to pushing porcelain buttons in bright, new vestibules. As I waited
      for my summons to be answered it struck me as remarkable that neither
      Nancy nor her father had been contaminated by the shabbiness that
      surrounded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had managed rather marvellously to redeem one room from the
      old-fashioned severity of the rest of the house, the library behind the
      big &ldquo;parlour.&rdquo; It was Nancy's room, eloquent of her daintiness and taste,
      of her essential modernity and luxuriousness; and that evening, as I was
      ushered into it, this quality of luxuriousness, of being able to shut out
      the disagreeable aspects of life that surrounded and threatened her,
      particularly impressed me. She had not lacked opportunities to escape. I
      wondered uneasily as I waited why she had not embraced them. I strayed
      about the room. A coal fire burned in the grate, the red-shaded lamps gave
      a subdued but cheerful light; some impulse led me to cross over to the
      windows and draw aside the heavy hangings. Dusk was gathering over that
      garden, bleak and frozen now, where we had romped together as children.
      How queer the place seemed! How shrivelled! Once it had had the wide range
      of a park. There, still weathering the elements, was the old-fashioned
      latticed summer-house, but the fruit-trees that I recalled as clouds of
      pink and white were gone.... A touch of poignancy was in these memories. I
      dropped the curtain, and turned to confront Nancy, who had entered
      noiselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Hugh, were you dreaming?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; I replied, embarrassed. &ldquo;I was looking at the garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soot has ruined it. My life seems to be one continual struggle
      against the soot,&mdash;the blacks, as the English call them. It's a more
      expressive term. They are like an army, you know, overwhelming in their
      relentless invasion. Well, do sit down. It is nice of you to come. You'll
      have some tea, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid had brought in the tray. Afternoon tea was still rather a new
      custom with us, more of a ceremony than a meal; and as Nancy handed me my
      cup and the thinnest of slices of bread and butter I found the intimacy of
      the situation a little disquieting. Her manner was indeed intimate, and
      yet it had the odd and disturbing effect of making her seem more remote.
      As she chatted I answered her perfunctorily, while all the time I was
      asking myself why I had ceased to desire her, whether the old longing for
      her might not return&mdash;was not even now returning? I might indeed go
      far afield to find a wife so suited to me as Nancy. She had beauty,
      distinction, and position. She was a woman of whom any man might be
      proud....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't congratulated you yet, Hugh,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;now that you
      are a partner of Mr. Watling's. I hear on all sides that you are on the
      high road to a great success.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'm glad to be in the firm,&rdquo; I admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new tack for Nancy, rather a disquieting one, this discussion of
      my affairs, which she had so long avoided or ignored. &ldquo;You are getting
      what you have always wanted, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered in some trepidation whether by that word &ldquo;always&rdquo; she was
      making a deliberate reference to the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always?&rdquo; I repeated, rather fatuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly always, ever since you have been a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was incapable of taking advantage of the opening, if it were one. She
      was baffling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man likes to succeed in his profession, of course,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you made up your mind to succeed more deliberately than most men. I
      needn't ask you if you are satisfied, Hugh. Success seems to agree with
      you,&mdash;although I imagine you will never be satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't known you all your life for nothing. I think I know you much
      better than you know yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't acted as if you did,&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been interested in what I thought about you?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't quite fair, Nancy,&rdquo; I protested. &ldquo;You haven't given me much
      evidence that you did think about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I received much encouragement to do so?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't seemed to invite&mdash;you've kept me at arm's length.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't fence!&rdquo; she cried, rather sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had become agitated, but her next words gave me a shock that was
      momentarily paralyzing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you to come here to-day, Hugh, because I wished you to know that
      I have made up my mind to marry Hambleton Durrett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hambleton Durrett!&rdquo; I echoed stupidly. &ldquo;Hambleton Durrett!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you&mdash;have you accepted him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I mean to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you love him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see what right you have to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you just said that you invited me here to talk frankly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why, in heaven's name, are you going to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lay back in her chair, regarding me, her lips slightly parted. All at
      once the full flavour of her, the superfine quality was revealed after
      years of blindness.&mdash;Nor can I describe the sudden rebellion, the
      revulsion that I experienced. Hambleton Durrett! It was an outrage, a
      sacrilege! I got up, and put my hand on the mantel. Nancy remained
      motionless, inert, her head lying back against the chair. Could it be that
      she were enjoying my discomfiture? There is no need to confess that I knew
      next to nothing of women; had I been less excited, I might have made the
      discovery that I still regarded them sentimentally. Certain romantic
      axioms concerning them, garnered from Victorian literature, passed current
      in my mind for wisdom; and one of these declared that they were prone to
      remain true to an early love. Did Nancy still care for me? The query,
      coming as it did on top of my emotion, brought with it a strange and
      overwhelming perplexity. Did I really care for her? The many years during
      which I had practised the habit of caution began to exert an inhibiting
      pressure. Here was a situation, an opportunity suddenly thrust upon me
      which might never return, and which I was utterly unprepared to meet.
      Would I be happy with Nancy, after all? Her expression was still
      enigmatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't I marry him?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he's not good enough for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and laughed. &ldquo;He loves me. He wants me without
      reservation or calculation.&rdquo; There was a sting in this. &ldquo;And is he any
      worse,&rdquo; she asked slowly, &ldquo;than many others who might be mentioned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I agreed. I did not intend to be led into the thankless and
      disagreeable position of condemning Hambleton Durrett. &ldquo;But why have you
      waited all these years if you did not mean to marry a man of ability, a
      man who has made something of himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man like you, Hugh?&rdquo; she said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't quite fair, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you working for?&rdquo; she suddenly inquired, straightening up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What any man works for, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you have hit it,&mdash;what any man works for in our world.
      Power,&mdash;personal power. You want to be somebody,&mdash;isn't that it?
      Not the noblest ambition, you'll have to admit,&mdash;not the kind of
      thing we used to dream about, when we did dream. Well, when we find we
      can't realize our dreams, we take the next best thing. And I fail to see
      why you should blame me for taking it when you yourself have taken it.
      Hambleton Durrett can give it to me. He'll accept me on my own terms, he
      won't interfere with me, I shan't be disillusionized,&mdash;and I shall
      have a position which I could not hope to have if I remained unmarried, a
      very marked position as Hambleton Durrett's wife. I am thirty, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her frankness appalled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble with you, Hugh, is that you still deceive yourself. You throw
      a glamour over things. You want to keep your cake and eat it too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why you say that. And marriage especially&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took me up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage! What other career is open to a woman? Unless she is married,
      and married well, according to the money standard you men have set up, she
      is nobody. We can't all be Florence Nightingales, and I am unable to
      imagine myself a Julia Ward Howe or a Harriet Beecher Stowe. What is left?
      Nothing but marriage. I'm hard and cynical, you will say, but I have
      thought, and I'm not afraid, as I have told you, to look things in the
      face. There are very few women, I think, who would not take the real thing
      if they had the chance before it were too late, who wouldn't be willing to
      do their own cooking in order to get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell silent suddenly. I began to pace the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, don't do this, Nancy!&rdquo; I begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she continued to stare into the fire, as though she had not heard me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had made up your mind to do it, why did you tell me?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sentiment, I suppose. I am paying a tribute to what I once was, to what
      you once were,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A&mdash;a sort of good-bye to sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo; I said hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Hugh. Surely you can't misjudge me so!&rdquo; she answered reproachfully.
      &ldquo;Do you think I should have sent for you if I had meant&mdash;that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, I didn't think so. But why not? You&mdash;you cared once, and you
      tell me plainly you don't love him. It was all a terrible mistake. We were
      meant for each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did love you then,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You never knew how much. And there is
      nothing I wouldn't give to bring it all back again. But I can't. It's
      gone. You're gone, and I'm gone. I mean what we were. Oh, why did you
      change?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was you who changed,&rdquo; I declared, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't you see&mdash;can't you see now what you did? But perhaps you
      couldn't help it. Perhaps it was just you, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why couldn't you have held fast to your faith? If you had, you would have
      known what it was I adored in you. Oh, I don't mind telling you now, it
      was just that faith, Hugh, that faith you had in life, that faith you had
      in me. You weren't cynical and calculating, like Ralph Hambleton, you had
      imagination. I&mdash;I dreamed, too. And do you remember the time when you
      made the boat, and we went to Logan's Pond, and you sank in her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you stayed,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;when all the others ran away? You ran down
      the hill like a whirlwind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then you came here one day, to a party, and said you were going to
      Harvard, and quarrelled with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you doubt met&rdquo; I asked agitatedly. &ldquo;Why didn't you let me see
      that you still cared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because that wasn't you, Hugh, that wasn't your real self. Do you suppose
      it mattered to me whether you went to Harvard with the others? Oh, I was
      foolish too, I know. I shouldn't have said what I did. But what is the use
      of regrets?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;We've both run after the practical gods, and
      the others have hidden their faces from us. It may be that we are not to
      blame, either of us, that the practical gods are too strong. We've learned
      to love and worship them, and now we can't do without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can try, Nancy,&rdquo; I pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered in a low voice, &ldquo;that's the difference between you and
      me. I know myself better than you know yourself, and I know you better.&rdquo;
       She smiled again. &ldquo;Unless we could have it all back again, I shouldn't
      want any of it. You do not love me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started once more to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, don't say it!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may think you do, just this moment, but it's only because&mdash;you've
      been moved. And what you believe you want isn't me, it's what I was. But
      I'm not that any more,&mdash;I'm simply recalling that, don't you see? And
      even then you wouldn't wish me, now, as I was. That sounds involved, but
      you must understand. You want a woman who will be wrapped up in your
      career, Hugh, and yet who will not share it,&mdash;who will devote herself
      body and soul to what you have become. A woman whom you can shape. And you
      won't really love her, but only just so much of her as may become the
      incarnation of you. Well, I'm not that kind of woman. I might have been,
      had you been different. I'm not at all sure. Certainly I'm not that kind
      now, even though I know in my heart that the sort of career you have made
      for yourself, and that I intend to make for myself is all dross. But now I
      can't do without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you are going to marry Hambleton Durrett!&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood me, although I regretted my words at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am going to marry him.&rdquo; There was a shade of bitterness, of
      defiance in her voice. &ldquo;Surely you are not offering me the&mdash;the other
      thing, now. Oh, Hugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am willing to abandon it all, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you're not, and I'm not. What you can't see and won't see
      is that it has become part of you. Oh, you are successful, you will be
      more and more successful. And you think I should be somebody, as your
      wife, Hugh, more perhaps, eventually, than I shall be as Hambleton's. But
      I should be nobody, too. I couldn't stand it now, my dear. You must
      realize that as soon as you have time to think it over. We shall be
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sudden gentleness in her voice pierced me through and through. She
      held out her hand. Something in her grasp spoke of a resolution which
      could not be shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; she added sadly, &ldquo;I don't love you any more, Hugh. I'm
      mourning for something that's gone. I wanted to have just this one talk
      with you. But we shan't mention it again,&mdash;we'll close the book.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      At that I fled out of the house, and at first the thought of her as
      another man's wife, as Hambleton Durrett's wife, was seemingly not to be
      borne. It was incredible! &ldquo;We'll close the book.&rdquo; I found myself repeating
      the phrase; and it seemed then as though something within me I had
      believed dead&mdash;something that formerly had been all of me&mdash;had
      revived again to throb with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not surprising that the acuteness of my suffering was of short
      duration, though I remember certain sharp twinges when the announcement of
      the engagement burst on the city. There was much controversy over the
      question as to whether or not Ham Durrett's reform would be permanent; but
      most people were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt; it was time
      he settled down and took the position in the community that was to be
      expected of one of his name; and as for Nancy, it was generally agreed
      that she had done well for herself. She was not made for poverty&mdash;and
      who so well as she was fitted for the social leadership of our community?
    </p>
    <p>
      They were married in Trinity Church in the month of May, and I was one of
      Ham's attendants. Ralph was &ldquo;best man.&rdquo; For the last time the old Willett
      mansion in Powell Street wore the gala air of former days; carpets were
      spread over the sidewalk, and red and white awnings; rooms were filled
      with flowers and flung open to hundreds of guests. I found the wedding
      something of an ordeal. I do not like to dwell upon it&mdash;especially
      upon that moment when I came to congratulate Nancy as she stood beside Ham
      at the end of the long parlour. She seemed to have no regrets. I don't
      know what I expected of her&mdash;certainly not tears and tragedy. She
      seemed taller than ever, and very beautiful in her veil and white satin
      gown and the diamonds Ham had given her; very much mistress of herself,
      quite a contrast to Ham, who made no secret of his elation. She smiled
      when I wished her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be home in the autumn, Hugh, and expect to see a great deal of
      you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I paused in a corner of the room my eye fell upon Nancy's father.
      McAlery Willett's elation seemed even greater than Ham's. With a gardenia
      in his frock-coat and a glass of champagne in his hand he went from group
      to group; and his familiar laughter, which once had seemed so full of
      merriment and fun, gave me to-day a somewhat scandalized feeling. I heard
      Ralph's voice, and turned to discover him standing beside me, his long
      legs thrust slightly apart, his hands in his pockets, overlooking the
      scene with typical, semi-contemptuous amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This lets old McAlery out, anyway,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One or two little notes of his will be cancelled, sooner or later&mdash;that's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment I was unable to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think that she&mdash;that Nancy found out&mdash;?&rdquo; I
      stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'd be willing to take that end of the bet,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Why the
      deuce should she marry Ham? You ought to know her well enough to
      understand how she'd feel if she discovered some of McAlery's financial
      coups? Of course it's not a thing I talk about, you understand. Are you
      going to the Club?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm going home,&rdquo; I said. I was aware of his somewhat compassionate
      smile as I left him....

    <h2>
      XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One November day nearly two years after my admission as junior member of
      the firm of Watling, Fowndes and Ripon seven gentlemen met at luncheon in
      the Boyne Club; Mr. Barbour, President of the Railroad, Mr. Scherer, of
      the Boyne Iron Works and other corporations, Mr. Leonard Dickinson, of the
      Corn National Bank, Mr. Halsey, a prominent banker from the other great
      city of the state, Mr. Grunewald, Chairman of the Republican State
      Committee, and Mr. Frederick Grierson, who had become a very important man
      in our community. At four o'clock they emerged from the club: citizens in
      Boyne Street who saw them chatting amicably on the steps little suspected
      that in the last three hours these gentlemen had chosen and practically
      elected the man who was to succeed Mr. Wade as United States Senator in
      Washington. Those were the days in which great affairs were simply and
      efficiently handled. No democratic nonsense about leaving the choice to an
      electorate that did not know what it wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man chosen to fill this high position was Theodore Watling. He said he
      would think about the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the nation at large, through the defection of certain Northern states
      neither so conservative nor fortunate as ours, the Democratic party was in
      power, which naturally implies financial depression. There was no question
      about our ability to send a Republican Senator; the choice in the Boyne
      Club was final; but before the legislature should ratify it, a year or so
      hence, it were just as well that the people of the state should be
      convinced that they desired Mr. Watling more than any other man; and
      surely enough, in a little while such a conviction sprang up
      spontaneously. In offices and restaurants and hotels, men began to suggest
      to each other what a fine thing it would be if Theodore Watling might be
      persuaded to accept the toga; at the banks, when customers called to renew
      their notes and tight money was discussed and Democrats excoriated, it was
      generally agreed that the obvious thing to do was to get a safe man in the
      Senate. From the very first, Watling sentiment stirred like spring sap
      after a hard winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country newspapers, watered by providential rains, began to put forth
      tender little editorial shoots, which Mr. Judah B. Tallant presently
      collected and presented in a charming bouquet in the Morning Era. &ldquo;The
      Voice of the State Press;&rdquo; thus was the column headed; and the remarks of
      the Hon. Fitch Truesdale, of the St. Helen's Messenger, were given a
      special prominence. Mr. Truesdale was the first, in his section, to be
      inspired by the happy thought that the one man preeminently fitted to
      represent the state in the present crisis, when her great industries had
      been crippled by Democratic folly, was Mr. Theodore Watling. The Rossiter
      Banner, the Elkington Star, the Belfast Recorder, and I know not how many
      others simultaneously began to sing Mr. Watling's praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since the troublous times of the Civil War,&rdquo; declared the Morning
      Era, &ldquo;had the demand for any man been so unanimous.&rdquo; As a proof of it,
      there were the country newspapers, &ldquo;which reflected the sober opinion of
      the firesides of the common people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are certain industrious gentlemen to whom little credit is given,
      and who, unlike the average citizen who reserves his enthusiasm for
      election time, are patriotic enough to labour for their country's good all
      the year round. When in town, it was their habit to pay a friendly call on
      the Counsel for the Railroad, Mr. Miller Gorse, in the Corn Bank Building.
      He was never too busy to converse with them; or, it might better be said,
      to listen to them converse. Let some legally and politically ambitious
      young man observe Mr. Gorse's method. Did he inquire what the party worker
      thought of Mr. Watling for the Senate? Not at all! But before the party
      worker left he was telling Mr. Gorse that public sentiment demanded Mr.
      Watling. After leaving Mr. Gorse they wended their way to the Durrett
      Building and handed their cards over the rail of the offices of Watling,
      Fowndes and Ripon. Mr. Watling shook hands with scores of them, and they
      departed, well satisfied with the flavour of his cigars and intoxicated by
      his personality. He had a marvellous way of cutting short an interview
      without giving offence. Some of them he turned over to Mr. Paret, whom he
      particularly desired they should know. Thus Mr. Paret acquired many
      valuable additions to his acquaintance, cultivated a memory for names and
      faces that was to stand him in good stead; and kept, besides, an indexed
      note-book into which he put various bits of interesting information
      concerning each. Though not immediately lucrative, it was all, no doubt,
      part of a lawyer's education.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the summer and the following winter Colonel Paul Varney came often
      to town and spent much of his time in Mr. Paret's office smoking Mr.
      Watling's cigars and discussing the coming campaign, in which he took a
      whole-souled interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Hugh, this is goin' slick!&rdquo; he would exclaim, his eyes glittering
      like round buttons of jet. &ldquo;I never saw a campaign where they fell in the
      way they're doing now. If it was anybody else but Theodore Watling, it
      would scare me. You ought to have been in Jim Broadhurst's campaign,&rdquo; he
      added, referring to the junior senator, &ldquo;they wouldn't wood up at all,
      they was just listless. But Gorse and Barbour and the rest wanted him, and
      we had to put him over. I reckon he is useful down there in Washington,
      but say, do you know what he always reminded me of? One of those
      mud-turtles I used to play with as a boy up in Columbia County,&mdash;shuts
      up tight soon as he sees you coming. Now Theodore Watling ain't like that,
      any way of speaking. We can get up some enthusiasm for a man of his sort.
      He's liberal and big. He's made his pile, and he don't begrudge some of it
      to the fellows who do the work. Mark my words, when you see a man who
      wants a big office cheap, look out for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, and much more wisdom I imbibed while assenting to my chief's
      greatness. For Mr. Varney was right,&mdash;one could feel enthusiasm for
      Theodore Watling; and my growing intimacy with him, the sense that I was
      having a part in his career, a share in his success, became for the moment
      the passion of my life. As the campaign progressed I gave more and more
      time to it, and made frequent trips of a confidential nature to the
      different counties of the state. The whole of my being was energized. The
      national fever had thoroughly pervaded my blood&mdash;the national fever
      to win. Prosperity&mdash;writ large&mdash;demanded it, and Theodore
      Watling personified, incarnated the cause. I had neither the time nor the
      desire to philosophize on this national fever, which animated all my
      associates: animated, I might say, the nation, which was beginning to get
      into a fever about games. If I remember rightly, it was about this time
      that golf was introduced, tennis had become a commonplace, professional
      baseball was in full swing; Ham Durrett had even organized a local polo
      team.... The man who failed to win something tangible in sport or law or
      business or politics was counted out. Such was the spirit of America, in
      the closing years of the nineteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, when one has said this, one has failed to express the national
      Geist in all its subtlety. In brief, the great American sport was not so
      much to win the game as to beat it; the evasion of rules challenged our
      ingenuity; and having won, we set about devising methods whereby it would
      be less and less possible for us winners to lose in the future. No better
      illustration of this tendency could be given than the development which
      had recently taken place in the field of our city politics, hitherto the
      battle-ground of Irish politicians who had fought one another for
      supremacy. Individualism had been rampant, competition the custom; you
      bought an alderman, or a boss who owned four or five aldermen, and then
      you never could be sure you were to get what you wanted, or that the
      aldermen and the bosses would &ldquo;stay bought.&rdquo; But now a genius had
      appeared, an American genius who had arisen swiftly and almost silently,
      who appealed to the imagination, and whose name was often mentioned in a
      whisper,&mdash;the Hon. Judd Jason, sometimes known as the Spider, who
      organized the City Hall and capitalized it; an ultimate and logical effect&mdash;if
      one had considered it&mdash;of the Manchester school of economics.
      Enlightened self-interest, stripped of sentiment, ends on Judd Jasons. He
      ran the city even as Mr. Sherrill ran his department store; you paid your
      price. It was very convenient. Being a genius, Mr. Jason did not wholly
      break with tradition, but retained those elements of the old muddled
      system that had their value, chartering steamboats for outings on the
      river, giving colossal picnics in Lowry Park. The poor and the wanderer
      and the criminal (of the male sex at least) were cared for. But he was not
      loved, as the rough-and-tumble Irishmen had been loved; he did not make
      himself common; he was surrounded by an aura of mystery which I confess
      had not failed of effect on me. Once, and only once during my legal
      apprenticeship, he had been pointed out to me on the street, where he
      rarely ventured. His appearance was not impressive....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jason could not, of course, prevent Mr. Watling's election, even did
      he so desire, but he did command the allegiance of several city candidates&mdash;both
      democratic and republican&mdash;for the state legislature, who had as yet
      failed to announce their preferences for United States Senator. It was
      important that Mr. Watling's vote should be large, as indicative of a
      public reaction and repudiation of Democratic national folly. This matter
      among others was the subject of discussion one July morning when the
      Republican State Chairman was in the city; Mr. Grunewald expressed anxiety
      over Mr. Jason's continued silence. It was expedient that somebody should
      &ldquo;see&rdquo; the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not Paret?&rdquo; suggested Leonard Dickinson. Mr. Watling was not present
      at this conference. &ldquo;Paret seems to be running Watling's campaign,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was settled that I should be the emissary. With lively sensations of
      curiosity and excitement, tempered by a certain anxiety as to my ability
      to match wits with the Spider, I made my way to his &ldquo;lair&rdquo; over Monahan's
      saloon, situated in a district that was anything but respectable. The
      saloon, on the ground floor, had two apartments; the bar-room proper where
      Mike Monahan, chamberlain of the establishment, was wont to stand, red
      faced and smiling, to greet the courtiers, big and little, the party
      workers, the district leaders, the hangers-on ready to be hired, the city
      officials, the police judges,&mdash;yes, and the dignified members of
      state courts whose elections depended on Mr. Jason's favour: even Judge
      Bering, whose acquaintance I had made the day I had come, as a law
      student, to Mr. Watling's office, unbent from time to time sufficiently to
      call there for a small glass of rye and water, and to relate, with his
      owl-like gravity, an anecdote to the &ldquo;boys.&rdquo; The saloon represented
      Democracy, so dear to the American public. Here all were welcome, even the
      light-fingered gentlemen who enjoyed the privilege of police protection;
      and who sometimes, through fortuitous circumstances, were hauled before
      the very magistrates with whom they had rubbed elbows on the polished
      rail. Behind the bar-room, and separated from it by swinging doors only
      the elite ventured to thrust apart, was an audience chamber whither Mr.
      Jason occasionally descended. Anecdote and political reminiscence gave
      place here to matters of high policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had several times come to the saloon in the days of my apprenticeship in
      search of some judge or official, and once I had run down here the city
      auditor himself. Mike Monahan, whose affair it was to know everyone,
      recognized me. It was part of his business, also, to understand that I was
      now a member of the firm of Watling, Fowndes and Ripon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning to you, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; he said suavely. We held a colloquy in
      undertones over the bar, eyed by the two or three customers who were
      present. Mr. Monahan disappeared, but presently returned to whisper:
      &ldquo;Sure, he'll see you,&rdquo; to lead the way through the swinging doors and up a
      dark stairway. I came suddenly on a room in the greatest disorder, its
      tables and chairs piled high with newspapers and letters, its windows
      streaked with soot. From an open door on its farther side issued a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Mr. Paret? Come in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was little less than a command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard of you, Mr. Paret. Glad to know you. Sit down, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The inner room was almost dark. I made out a bed in the corner, and
      propped up in the bed a man; but for the moment I was most aware of a pair
      of eyes that flared up when the man spoke, and died down again when he
      became silent. They reminded me of those insects which in my childhood
      days we called &ldquo;lightning bugs.&rdquo; Mr. Jason gave me a hand like a woman's.
      I expressed my pleasure at meeting him, and took a chair beside the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you're a partner of Theodore Watling's now aren't you? Smart
      man, Watling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll make a good senator,&rdquo; I replied, accepting the opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he'll get elected&mdash;do you?&rdquo; Mr. Jason inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there isn't much doubt about that, I imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know&mdash;don't know. Seen some dead-sure things go wrong in my
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's going to defeat him?&rdquo; I asked pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't say anything,&rdquo; Mr. Jason replied. &ldquo;But I've known funny things to
      happen&mdash;never does to be dead sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, we're as sure as it's humanly possible to be,&rdquo; I declared. The
      eyes continued to fascinate me, they had a peculiar, disquieting effect.
      Now they died down, and it was as if the man's very presence had gone out,
      as though I had been left alone; and I found it exceedingly difficult,
      under the circumstances, to continue to address him. Suddenly he flared up
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Watling send you over here?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. As a matter of fact, he's out of town. Some of Mr. Watling's friends,
      Mr. Grunewald and Mr. Dickinson, Mr. Gorse and others, suggested that I
      see you, Mr. Jason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came a grunt from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Watling has always valued your friendship and support,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes him think he ain't going to get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hasn't a doubt of it,&rdquo; I went on diplomatically. &ldquo;But we felt&mdash;and
      I felt personally, that we ought to be in touch with you, to work along
      with you, to keep informed how things are going in the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;there are one or two representatives, friends of yours, who
      haven't come out for Mr. Watling. We aren't worrying, we know you'll do
      the right thing, but we feel that it would have a good deal of influence
      in some other parts of the state if they declared themselves. And then you
      know as well as I do that this isn't a year when any of us can afford to
      recognize too closely party lines; the Democratic administration has
      brought on a panic, the business men in that party are down on it, and it
      ought to be rebuked. And we feel, too, that some of the city's Democrats
      ought to be loyal to Mr. Watling,&mdash;not that we expect them to vote
      for him in caucus, but when it comes to the joint ballot&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Jason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senator Dowse and Jim Maher, for instance,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim voted for Bill 709 all right&mdash;didn't he?&rdquo; said Mr. Jason
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just it,&rdquo; I put in boldly. &ldquo;We'd like to induce him to come in
      with us this time. But we feel that&mdash;the inducement would better come
      through you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought Mr. Jason smiled. By this time I had grown accustomed to the
      darkness, the face and figure of the man in the bed had become
      discernible. Power, I remember thinking, chooses odd houses for itself.
      Here was no overbearing, full-blooded ward ruffian brimming with vitality,
      but a thin, sallow little man in a cotton night-shirt, with iron-grey hair
      and a wiry moustache; he might have been an overworked clerk behind a
      dry-goods counter; and yet somehow, now that I had talked to him, I
      realized that he never could have been. Those extraordinary eyes of his,
      when they were functioning, marked his individuality as unique. It were
      almost too dramatic to say that he required darkness to make his effect,
      but so it seemed. I should never forget him. He had in truth been well
      named the Spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we haven't tried to get in touch with them. We are leaving them
      to you,&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paret,&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;I don't care a damn about Grunewald&mdash;never
      did. I'd turn him down for ten cents. But you can tell Theodore Watling
      for me, and Dickinson, that I guess the 'inducement' can be fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt a certain relief that the interview had come to an end, that the
      moment had arrived for amenities. To my surprise, Mr. Jason anticipated
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been interested in you, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Know who you are,
      of course, knew you were in Watling's office. Then some of the boys spoke
      about you when you were down at the legislature on that Ribblevale matter.
      Guess you had more to do with that bill than came out in the newspapers&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was taken off my guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's talk,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, it's talk, then? But I guess you and I will have some more
      talk after a while,&mdash;after Theodore Watling gets to be United States
      Senator. Give him my regards, and&mdash;and come in when I can do anything
      for you, Mr. Paret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thanking him, I groped my way downstairs and let myself out by a side door
      Monahan had shown me into an alleyway, thus avoiding the saloon. As I
      walked slowly back to the office, seeking the shade of the awnings, the
      figure in the darkened room took on a sinister aspect that troubled me....
    </p>
    <p>
      The autumn arrived, the campaign was on with a whoop, and I had my first
      taste of &ldquo;stump&rdquo; politics. The acrid smell of red fire brings it back to
      me. It was a medley of railroad travel, of committees provided with badges&mdash;and
      cigars, of open carriages slowly drawn between lines of bewildered
      citizens, of Lincoln clubs and other clubs marching in serried ranks,
      uniformed and helmeted, stalwarts carrying torches and banners. And then
      there were the draughty opera-houses with the sylvan scenery pushed back
      and plush chairs and sofas pushed forward; with an ominous table, a
      pitcher of water on it and a glass, near the footlights. The houses were
      packed with more bewildered citizens. What a wonderful study of
      mob-psychology it would have offered! Men who had not thought of the grand
      old Republican party for two years, and who had not cared much about it
      when they had entered the dooms, after an hour or so went mad with
      fervour. The Hon. Joseph Mecklin, ex-Speaker of the House, with whom I
      traveled on occasions, had a speech referring to the martyred President,
      ending with an appeal to the revolutionary fathers who followed Washington
      with bleeding feet. The Hon. Joseph possessed that most valuable of
      political gifts, presence; and when with quivering voice he finished his
      peroration, citizens wept with him. What it all had to do with the tariff
      was not quite clear. Yet nobody seemed to miss the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all of us most concerned, of course, about the working-man and his
      dinner pail,&mdash;whom the Democrats had wantonly thrown out of
      employment for the sake of a doctrinaire theory. They had put him in
      competition with the serf of Europe. Such was the subject-matter of my own
      modest addresses in this, my maiden campaign. I had the sense to see
      myself in perspective; to recognize that not for me, a dignified and
      substantial lawyer of affairs, were the rhetorical flights of the Hon.
      Joseph Mecklin. I spoke with a certain restraint. Not too dryly, I hope.
      But I sought to curb my sentiments, my indignation, at the manner in which
      the working-man had been treated; to appeal to the common sense rather
      than to the passions of my audiences. Here were the statistics! (drawn, by
      the way, from the Republican Campaign book). Unscrupulous demagogues&mdash;Democratic,
      of course&mdash;had sought to twist and evade them. Let this terrible
      record of lack of employment and misery be compared with the prosperity
      under Republican rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the most effective speakers in this campaign for the restoration
      of Prosperity,&rdquo; said the Rossiter Banner, &ldquo;is Mr. Hugh Paret, of the firm
      of Watling, Fowndes and Ripon. Mr. Paret's speech at the Opera-House last
      evening made a most favourable impression. Mr. Paret deals with facts. And
      his thoughtful analysis of the situation into which the Democratic party
      has brought this country should convince any sane-minded voter that the
      time has come for a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I began to keep a scrap-book, though I locked it up in the drawer of my
      desk. In it are to be found many clippings of a similarly gratifying
      tenor....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mecklin and I were well contrasted. In this way, incidentally, I made many
      valuable acquaintances among the &ldquo;solid&rdquo; men of the state, the local
      capitalists and manufacturers, with whom my manner of dealing with public
      questions was in particular favour. These were practical men; they rather
      patronized the Hon. Joseph, thus estimating, to a nicety, a mans value; or
      solidity, or specific gravity, it might better be said, since our universe
      was one of checks and balances. The Hon. Joseph and his like, skyrocketing
      through the air, were somehow necessary in the scheme of things, but not
      to be taken too seriously. Me they did take seriously, these provincial
      lords, inviting me to their houses and opening their hearts. Thus, when we
      came to Elkington, Mr. Mecklin reposed in the Commercial House, on the
      noisy main street. Fortunately for him, the clanging of trolley cars never
      interfered with his slumbers. I slept in a wide chamber in the mansion of
      Mr. Ezra Hutchins. There were many Hutchinses in Elkington,&mdash;brothers
      and cousins and uncles and great-uncles,&mdash;and all were connected with
      the woollen mills. But there is always one supreme Hutchins, and Ezra was
      he: tall, self-contained, elderly, but well preserved through frugal
      living, essentially American and typical of his class, when he entered the
      lobby of the Commercial House that afternoon the babel of political
      discussion was suddenly hushed; politicians, traveling salesmen and the
      members of the local committee made a lane for him; to him, the Hon.
      Joseph and I were introduced. Mr. Hutchins knew what he wanted. He was
      cordial to Mr. Mecklin, but he took me. We entered a most respectable
      surrey with tassels, driven by a raw-boned coachman in a black overcoat,
      drawn by two sleek horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is this thing going, Paret?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave him Mr. Grunewald's estimated majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; he demanded, a shrewd, humorous look in his blue
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think we'll carry the state. I haven't had Grunewald's experience
      in estimating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezra Hutchins smiled appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Watling think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn't seem to be worrying much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever been in Elkington before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said I hadn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a drive will do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was about four o'clock on a mild October afternoon. The little town, of
      fifteen thousand inhabitants or so, had a wonderful setting in the
      widening valley of the Scopanong, whose swiftly running waters furnished
      the power for the mills. We drove to these through a gateway over which
      the words &ldquo;No Admittance&rdquo; were conspicuously painted, past long brick
      buildings that bordered the canals; and in the windows I caught sight of
      drab figures of men and women bending over the machines. Half of the
      buildings, as Mr. Hutchins pointed out, were closed,&mdash;mute witnesses
      of tariff-tinkering madness. Even more eloquent of democratic folly was
      that part of the town through which we presently passed, streets lined
      with rows of dreary houses where the workers lived. Children were playing
      on the sidewalks, but theirs seemed a listless play; listless, too, were
      the men and women who sat on the steps,&mdash;listless, and somewhat
      sullen, as they watched us passing. Ezra Hutchins seemed to read my
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since the unions got in here I've had nothing but trouble,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I've tried to do my duty by my people, God knows. But they won't see
      which side their bread's buttered on. They oppose me at every step, they
      vote against their own interests. Some years ago they put up a job on us,
      and sent a scatter-brained radical to the legislature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Krebs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slightly. He was in my class at Harvard.... Is he still here?&rdquo; I asked,
      after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. But he hasn't gone to the legislature this time, we've seen to
      that. His father was a respectable old German who had a little shop and
      made eye-glasses. The son is an example of too much education. He's a
      notoriety seeker. Oh, he's clever, in a way. He's given us a good deal of
      trouble, too, in the courts with damage cases.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      We came to a brighter, more spacious, well-to-do portion of the town,
      where the residences faced the river. In a little while the waters widened
      into a lake, which was surrounded by a park, a gift to the city of the
      Hutchins family. Facing it, on one side, was the Hutchins Library; on the
      other, across a wide street, where the maples were turning, were the
      Hutchinses' residences of various dates of construction, from that of the
      younger George, who had lately married a wife, and built in bright yellow
      brick, to the old-fashioned mansion of Ezra himself. This, he told me, had
      been good enough for his father, and was good enough for him. The picture
      of it comes back to me, now, with singular attractiveness. It was of
      brick, and I suppose a modification of the Georgian; the kind of house one
      still sees in out-of-the way corners of London, with a sort of Dickensy
      flavour; high and square and uncompromising, with small-paned windows,
      with a flat roof surrounded by a low balustrade, and many substantial
      chimneys. The third storey was lower than the others, separated from them
      by a distinct line. On one side was a wide porch. Yellow and red leaves,
      the day's fall, scattered the well-kept lawn. Standing in the doorway of
      the house was a girl in white, and as we descended from the surrey she
      came down the walk to meet us. She was young, about twenty. Her hair was
      the colour of the russet maple leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Paret, Maude.&rdquo; Mr. Hutchins looked at his watch as does a man
      accustomed to live by it. &ldquo;If you'll excuse me, Mr. Paret, I have
      something important to attend to. Perhaps Mr. Paret would like to look
      about the grounds?&rdquo; He addressed his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said I should be delighted, though I had no idea what grounds were
      meant. As I followed Maude around the house she explained that all the
      Hutchins connection had a common back yard, as she expressed it. In
      reality, there were about two blocks of the property, extending behind all
      the houses. There were great trees with swings, groves, orchards where the
      late apples glistened between the leaves, an old-fashioned flower garden
      loath to relinquish its blooming. In the distance the shadowed western
      ridge hung like a curtain of deep blue velvet against the sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a wonderful spot!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is nice,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;we were all brought up here&mdash;I mean
      my cousins and myself. There are dozens of us. And dozens left,&rdquo; she
      added, as the shouts and laughter of children broke the stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A boy came running around the corner of the path. He struck out at Maude.
      With a remarkably swift movement she retaliated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got him that time,&rdquo; I laughed, and, being detected, she suddenly
      blushed. It was this act that drew my attention to her, that defined her
      as an individual. Before that I had regarded her merely as a shy and
      provincial girl. Now she was brimming with an unsuspected vitality. A
      certain interest was aroused, although her shyness towards me was not
      altered. I found it rather a flattering shyness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Hugh,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;he's always trying to be funny. Speak to Mr.
      Paret, Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's my name, too,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knocked my hat off a little while ago,&rdquo; said Hugh. &ldquo;I was only
      getting square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you didn't get square, did you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to speak in the tows hall to-night?&rdquo; the boy demanded. I
      admitted it. He went off, pausing once to stare back at me.... Maude and I
      walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be exciting to speak before a large audience,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I
      were a man, I think I should like to be in politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot imagine you in politics,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, if I were a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to the meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Father promised to take me. He has a box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought it would be pleasant to have her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you'll find what I have to say rather dry,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman can't expect to understand everything,&rdquo; she answered quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark struck me favourably. I glanced at her sideways. She was not a
      beauty, but she was distinctly well-formed and strong. Her face was oval,
      her features not quite regular,&mdash;giving them a certain charm; her
      colour was fresh, her eyes blue, the lighter blue one sees on Chinese
      ware: not a poetic comparison, but so I thought of them. She was
      apparently not sophisticated, as were most of the young women at home whom
      I knew intimately (as were the Watling twins, for example, with one of
      whom, Frances, I had had, by the way, rather a lively flirtation the
      spring before); she seemed refreshingly original, impressionable and
      plastic....
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked slowly back to the house, and in the hallway I met Mrs.
      Hutchins, a bustling, housewifely lady, inclined to stoutness, whose
      creased and kindly face bore witness to long acquiescence in the
      discipline of matrimony, to the contentment that results from an
      essentially circumscribed and comfortable life. She was, I learned later,
      the second Mrs. Hutchins, and Maude their only child. The children of the
      first marriage, all girls, had married and scattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was a decorous but heterogeneous meal of the old-fashioned sort
      that gives one the choice between tea and cocoa. It was something of an
      occasion, I suspected. The minister was there, the Reverend Mr. Doddridge,
      who would have made, in appearance at least, a perfect Puritan divine in a
      steeple hat and a tippet. Only&mdash;he was no longer the leader of the
      community; and even in his grace he had the air of deferring to the man
      who provided the bounties of which we were about to partake rather than to
      the Almighty. Young George was there, Mr. Hutchins's nephew, who was daily
      becoming more and more of a factor in the management of the mills, and had
      built the house of yellow brick that stood out so incongruously among the
      older Hutchinses' mansions, and marked a transition. I thought him rather
      a yellow-brick gentleman himself for his assumption of cosmopolitan
      manners. His wife was a pretty, discontented little woman who plainly
      deplored her environment, longed for larger fields of conquest: George,
      she said, must remain where he was, for the present at least,&mdash;Uncle
      Ezra depended on him; but Elkington was a prosy place, and Mrs. George
      gave the impression that she did not belong here. They went to the city on
      occasions; both cities. And when she told me we had a common acquaintance
      in Mrs. Hambleton Durrett&mdash;whom she thought so lovely!&mdash;I knew
      that she had taken Nancy as an ideal: Nancy, the social leader of what was
      to Mrs. George a metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the talk became general among the men, the subject being the
      campaign, and I the authority, bombarded with questions I strove to answer
      judicially. What was the situation in this county and in that? the
      national situation? George indulged in rather a vigorous arraignment of
      the demagogues, national and state, who were hurting business in order to
      obtain political power. The Reverend Mr. Doddridge assented, deploring the
      poverty that the local people had brought on themselves by heeding the
      advice of agitators; and Mrs. Hutchins, who spent much of her time in
      charity work, agreed with the minister when he declared that the trouble
      was largely due to a decline in Christian belief. Ezra Hutchins, too,
      nodded at this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take that man Krebs, for example,&rdquo; the minister went on, stimulated by
      this encouragement, &ldquo;he's an atheist, pure and simple.&rdquo; A sympathetic
      shudder went around the table at the word. George alone smiled. &ldquo;Old Krebs
      was a free-thinker; I used to get my glasses of him. He was at least a
      conscientious man, a good workman, which is more than can be said for the
      son. Young Krebs has talent, and if only he had devoted himself to the
      honest practice of law, instead of stirring up dissatisfaction among these
      people, he would be a successful man to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hutchins explained that I was at college with Krebs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These people must like him,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;or they wouldn't have sent him to
      the legislature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a good many of them do like him,&rdquo; the minister admitted. &ldquo;You see,
      he actually lives among them. They believe his socialistic doctrines
      because he's a friend of theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He won't represent this town again, that's sure,&rdquo; exclaimed George. &ldquo;You
      didn't see in the papers that he was nominated,&mdash;did you, Paret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if the mill people wanted him, George, how could it be prevented?&rdquo;
       his wife demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      George winked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are more ways of skinning a cat than one,&rdquo; he said cryptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's time to go to the meeting, I guess,&rdquo; remarked Ezra, rising.
      Once more he looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were packed into several family carriages and started off. In front of
      the hall the inevitable red fire was burning, its quivering light
      reflected on the faces of the crowd that blocked the street. They stood
      silent, strangely apathetic as we pushed through them to the curb, and the
      red fire went out suddenly as we descended. My temporary sense of
      depression, however, deserted me as we entered the hall, which was well
      lighted and filled with people, who clapped when the Hon. Joseph and I,
      accompanied by Mr. Doddridge and the Hon. Henry Clay Mellish from
      Pottstown, with the local chairman, walked out on the stage. A glance over
      the audience sufficed to ascertain that that portion of the population
      whose dinner pails we longed to fill was evidently not present in large
      numbers. But the farmers had driven in from the hills, while the merchants
      and storekeepers of Elkington had turned out loyally.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chairman, in introducing me, proclaimed me as a coming man, and
      declared that I had already achieved, in the campaign, considerable
      notoriety. As I spoke, I was pleasantly aware of Maude Hutchins leaning
      forward a little across the rail of the right-hand stage box&mdash;for the
      town hall was half opera-house; her attitude was one of semi-absorbed
      admiration; and the thought that I had made an impression on her
      stimulated me. I spoke with more aplomb. Somewhat to my surprise, I found
      myself making occasional, unexpected witticisms that drew laughter and
      applause. Suddenly, from the back of the hall, a voice called out:&mdash;&ldquo;How
      about House Bill 709?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, then a stirring and craning of necks. It was my first
      experience of heckling, and for the moment I was taken aback. I thought of
      Krebs. He had, indeed, been in my mind since I had risen to my feet, and I
      had scanned the faces before me in search of his. But it was not his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what about Bill 709?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know something about it, I guess,&rdquo; the voice responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him out!&rdquo; came from various portions of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly, I was shaken. Not&mdash;in orthodox language from any
      &ldquo;conviction of sin.&rdquo; Yet it was my first intimation that my part in the
      legislation referred to was known to any save a select few. I blamed
      Krebs, and a hot anger arose within me against him. After all, what could
      they prove?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't put him out,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Let him come up here to the platform.
      I'll yield to him. And I'm entirely willing to discuss with him and defend
      any measures passed in the legislature of this state by a Republican
      majority. Perhaps,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;the gentleman has a copy of the law in his
      pocket, that I may know what he is talking about, and answer him
      intelligently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this there was wild applause. I had the audience with me. The offender
      remained silent and presently I finished my speech. After that Mr. Mecklin
      made them cheer and weep, and Mr. Mellish made them laugh. The meeting had
      been highly successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You polished him off, all right,&rdquo; said George Hutchins, as he took my
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one of the local sore-heads. Krebs put him up to it, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was Krebs here?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sitting in the corner of the balcony. That meeting must have made him
      feel sick.&rdquo; George bent forward and whispered in my ear: &ldquo;I thought Bill
      709 was Watling's idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I happened to be in the Potts House about that time,&rdquo; I explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      George, of whom it may be gathered that he was not wholly unsophisticated,
      grinned at me appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Paret,&rdquo; he replied, putting his hand through my arm, &ldquo;there's a
      little legal business in prospect down here that will require some
      handling, and I wish you'd come down after the campaign and talk it over,
      with us. I've just about made up my mind that you're he man to tackle it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I'll come,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And stay with me,&rdquo; said George....
    </p>
    <p>
      We went to his yellow-brick house for refreshments, salad and ice-cream
      and (in the face of the Hutchins traditions) champagne. Others had been
      invited in, some twenty persons.... Once in a while, when I looked up, I
      met Maude's eyes across the room. I walked home with her, slowly, the
      length of the Hutchinses' block. Floating over the lake was a waning
      October moon that cast through the thinning maples a lace-work of shadows
      at our feet; I had the feeling of well-being that comes to heroes, and the
      presence of Maude Hutchins was an incense, a vestal incense far from
      unpleasing. Yet she had reservations which appealed to me. Hers was not a
      gushing provincialism, like that of Mrs. George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked your speech so much, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;It seemed so
      sensible and&mdash;controlled, compared to the others. I have never
      thought a great deal about these things, of course, and I never understood
      before why taking away the tariff caused so much misery. You made that
      quite plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so, I'm glad,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The working people here have had a hard time during the last year,&rdquo; she
      went on. &ldquo;Some of the mills had to be shut down, you know. It has troubled
      me. Indeed, it has troubled all of us. And what has made it more
      difficult, more painful is that many of them seem actually to dislike us.
      They think it's father's fault, and that he could run all the mills if he
      wanted to. I've been around a little with mother and sometimes the women
      wouldn't accept any help from us; they said they'd rather starve than take
      charity, that they had the right to work. But father couldn't run the
      mills at a loss&mdash;could he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then there's Mr. Krebs, of whom we were speaking at supper, and who
      puts all kinds of queer notions into their heads. Father says he's an
      anarchist. I heard father say at supper that he was at Harvard with you.
      Did you like him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered hesitatingly, &ldquo;I didn't know him very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she put in. &ldquo;I suppose you couldn't have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got these notions,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;that are mischievous and crazy&mdash;but
      I don't dislike him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to hear you say that!&rdquo; she answered quietly. &ldquo;I like him, too&mdash;he
      seems so kind, so understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;I feel as though I do. I've only met
      him once, and that was by accident. It was the day the big strike began,
      last spring, and I had been shopping, and started for the mills to get
      father to walk home with me, as I used to do. I saw the crowds blocking
      the streets around the canal. At first I paid no attention to them, but
      after a while I began to be a little uneasy, there were places where I had
      to squeeze through, and I couldn't help seeing that something was wrong,
      and that the people were angry. Men and women were talking in loud voices.
      One woman stared at me, and called my name, and said something that
      frightened me terribly. I went into a doorway&mdash;and then I saw Mr.
      Krebs. I didn't know who he was. He just said, 'You'd better come with me,
      Miss Hutchins,' and I went with him. I thought afterwards that it was a
      very courageous thing for him to do, because he was so popular with the
      mill people, and they had such a feeling against us. Yet they didn't seem
      to resent it, and made way for us, and Mr. Krebs spoke to many of them as
      we passed. After we got to State Street, I asked him his name, and when he
      told me I was speechless. He took off his hat and went away. He had such a
      nice face&mdash;not at all ugly when you look at it twice&mdash;and kind
      eyes, that I just couldn't believe him to be as bad as father and George
      think he is. Of course he is mistaken,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;but I am sure
      he is sincere, and honestly thinks he can help those people by telling
      them what he does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question shot at me during the meeting rankled still; I wanted to
      believe that Krebs had inspired it, and her championship of him gave me a
      twinge of jealousy,&mdash;the slightest twinge, to be sure, yet a
      perceptible one. At the same time, the unaccountable liking I had for the
      man stirred to life. The act she described had been so characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's one of the born rebels against society,&rdquo; I said glibly. &ldquo;Yet I do
      think he's sincere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maude was grave. &ldquo;I should be sorry to think he wasn't,&rdquo; she replied.
      After I had bidden her good night at the foot of the stairs, and gone to
      my room, I reflected how absurd it was to be jealous of Krebs. What was
      Maude Hutchins to me? And even if she had been something to me, she never
      could be anything to Krebs. All the forces of our civilization stood
      between the two; nor was she of a nature to take plunges of that sort. The
      next day, as I lay back in my seat in the parlour-car and gazed at the
      autumn landscape, I indulged in a luxurious contemplation of the picture
      she had made as she stood on the lawn under the trees in the early morning
      light, when my carriage had driven away; and I had turned, to perceive
      that her eyes had followed me. I was not in love with her, of course. I
      did not wish to return at once to Elkington, but I dwelt with a pleasant
      anticipation upon my visit, when the campaign should be over, with George.

    <h2>
      XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The good old days of the Watling campaign,&rdquo; as Colonel Paul Varney is
      wont to call them, are gone forever. And the Colonel himself, who stuck to
      his gods, has been through the burning, fiery furnace of Investigation,
      and has come out unscathed and unrepentant. The flames of investigation,
      as a matter of fact, passed over his head in their vain attempt to reach
      the &ldquo;man higher up,&rdquo; whose feet they licked; but him they did not devour,
      either. A veteran in retirement, the Colonel is living under his vine and
      fig tree on the lake at Rossiter; the vine bears Catawba grapes, of which
      he is passionately fond; the fig tree, the Bartlett pears he gives to his
      friends. He has saved something from the spoils of war, but other veterans
      I could mention are not so fortunate. The old warriors have retired, and
      many are dead; the good old methods are becoming obsolete. We never
      bothered about those mischievous things called primaries. Our county
      committees, our state committees chose the candidates for the conventions,
      which turned around and chose the committees. Both the committees and the
      conventions&mdash;under advice&mdash;chose the candidates. Why, pray,
      should the people complain, when they had everything done for them? The
      benevolent parties, both Democratic and Republican, even undertook the
      expense of printing the ballots! And generous ballots they were (twenty
      inches long and five wide!), distributed before election, in order that
      the voters might have the opportunity of studying and preparing them: in
      order that Democrats of delicate feelings might take the pains to scratch
      out all the Democratic candidates, and write in the names of the
      Republican candidates. Patriotism could go no farther than this....
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the week before election in the city, where I had the opportunity
      of observing what may be called the charitable side of politics. For a
      whole month, or more, the burden of existence had been lifted from the
      shoulders of the homeless. No church or organization, looked out for these
      frowsy, blear-eyed and ragged wanderers who had failed to find a place in
      the scale of efficiency. For a whole month, I say, Mr. Judd Jason and his
      lieutenants made them their especial care; supported them in
      lodging-houses, induced the night clerks to give them attention; took the
      greatest pains to ensure them the birth-right which, as American citizens,
      was theirs,&mdash;that of voting. They were not only given homes for a
      period, but they were registered; and in the abundance of good feeling
      that reigned during this time of cheer, even the foreigners were
      registered! On election day they were driven, like visiting notables, in
      carryalls and carriages to the polls! Some of them, as though in
      compensation for ills endured between elections, voted not once, but many
      times; exercising judicial functions for which they should be given
      credit. For instance, they were convinced that the Hon. W. W. Trulease had
      made a good governor; and they were Watling enthusiasts,&mdash;intent on
      sending men to the legislature who would vote for him for senator; yet
      there were cases in which, for the minor offices, the democrat was the
      better man!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a memorable day. In spite of Mr. Lawler's Pilot, which was as a
      voice crying in the wilderness, citizens who had wives and homes and
      responsibilities, business men and clerks went to the voting booths and
      recorded their choice for Trulease, Watling and Prosperity: and
      working-men followed suit. Victory was in the air. Even the policemen wore
      happy smiles, and in some instances the election officers themselves in
      absent-minded exuberance thrust bunches of ballots into the boxes!
    </p>
    <p>
      In response to an insistent demand from his fellow-citizens Mr. Watling,
      the Saturday evening before, had made a speech in the Auditorium, decked
      with bunting and filled with people. For once the Morning Era did not
      exaggerate when it declared that the ovation had lasted fully ten minutes.
      &ldquo;A remarkable proof&rdquo; it went on to say, &ldquo;of the esteem and confidence in
      which our fellow-citizen is held by those who know him best, his
      neighbours in the city where he has given so many instances of his public
      spirit, where he has achieved such distinction in the practice of the law.
      He holds the sound American conviction that the office should seek the
      man. His address is printed in another column, and we believe it will
      appeal to the intelligence and sober judgment of the state. It is replete
      with modesty and wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watling was introduced by Mr. Bering of the State Supreme Court (a
      candidate for re-election), who spoke with deliberation, with owl-like
      impressiveness. He didn't believe in judges meddling in politics, but this
      was an unusual occasion. (Loud applause.) Most unusual. He had come here
      as a man, as an American, to pay his tribute to another man, a long-time
      friend, whom he thought to stand somewhat aside and above mere party
      strife, to represent values not merely political.... So accommodating and
      flexible is the human mind, so &ldquo;practical&rdquo; may it become through dealing
      with men and affairs, that in listening to Judge Bering I was able to
      ignore the little anomalies such a situation might have suggested to the
      theorist, to the mere student of the institutions of democracy. The
      friendly glasses of rye and water Mr. Bering had taken in Monahan's
      saloon, the cases he had &ldquo;arranged&rdquo; for the firm of Watling, Fowndes and
      Ripon were forgotten. Forgotten, too, when Theodore Watling stood up and
      men began, to throw their hats in the air,&mdash;were the cavilling
      charges of Mr. Lawler's Pilot that, far from the office seeking the man,
      our candidate had spent over a hundred thousand dollars of his own money,
      to say nothing of the contributions of Mr. Scherer, Mr. Dickinson and the
      Railroad! If I had been troubled with any weak, ethical doubts, Mr.
      Watling would have dispelled them; he had red blood in his veins, a creed
      in which he believed, a rare power of expressing himself in plain,
      everyday language that was often colloquial, but never&mdash;as the saying
      goes&mdash;&ldquo;cheap.&rdquo; The dinner-pail predicament was real to him. He would
      present a policy of our opponents charmingly, even persuasively, and then
      add, after a moment's pause: &ldquo;There is only one objection to this, my
      friends&mdash;that it doesn't work.&rdquo; It was all in the way he said it, of
      course. The audience would go wild with approval, and shouts of &ldquo;that's
      right&rdquo; could be heard here and there. Then he proceeded to show why it
      didn't work. He had the faculty of bringing his lessons home, the
      imagination to put himself into the daily life of those who listened to
      him,&mdash;the life of the storekeeper, the clerk, of the labourer and of
      the house-wife. The effect of this can scarcely be overestimated. For the
      American hugs the delusion that there are no class distinctions, even
      though his whole existence may be an effort to rise out of once class into
      another. &ldquo;Your wife,&rdquo; he told them once, &ldquo;needs a dress. Let us admit that
      the material for the dress is a little cheaper than it was four years ago,
      but when she comes to look into the family stocking&mdash;&rdquo; (Laughter.) &ldquo;I
      needn't go on. If we could have things cheaper, and more money to buy them
      with, we should all be happy, and the Republican party could retire from
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not once refer to the United States Senatorship.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was appropriate, perhaps, that many of us dined on the evening of
      election day at the Boyne Club. There was early evidence of a Republican
      land-slide. And when, at ten o'clock, it was announced that Mr. Trulease
      was re-elected by a majority which exceeded Mr. Grunewald's most hopeful
      estimate, that the legislature was &ldquo;safe,&rdquo; that Theodore Watling would be
      the next United States Senator, a scene of jubilation ensued within those
      hallowed walls which was unprecedented. Chairs were pushed back, rugs
      taken up, Gene Hollister played the piano and a Virginia reel started; in
      a burst of enthusiasm Leonard Dickinson ordered champagne for every member
      present. The country was returning to its senses. Theodore Watling had
      preferred, on this eventful night, to remain quietly at home. But
      presently carriages were ordered, and a &ldquo;delegation&rdquo; of enthusiastic
      friends departed to congratulate him; Dickinson, of course, Grierson,
      Fowndes, Ogilvy, and Grunewald. We found Judah B. Tallant there,&mdash;in
      spite of the fact that it was a busy night for the Era; and Adolf Scherer
      himself, in expansive mood, was filling the largest of the library chairs.
      Mr. Watling was the least excited of them all; remarkably calm, I thought,
      for a man on the verge of realizing his life's high ambition. He had some
      old brandy, and a box of cigars he had been saving for an occasion. He
      managed to convey to everyone his appreciation of the value of their
      cooperation....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight before Mr. Scherer arose to take his departure. He seized
      Mr. Watling's hand, warmly, in both of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never,&rdquo; he said, with a relapse into the German f's, &ldquo;I have never
      had a happier moment in my life, my friend, than when I congratulate you
      on your success.&rdquo; His voice shook with emotion. &ldquo;Alas, we shall not see so
      much of you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll be on guard, Scherer,&rdquo; said Leonard Dickinson, putting his arm
      around my chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Senator,&rdquo; said Tallant, and all echoed the word, which struck
      me as peculiarly appropriate. Much as I had admired Mr. Watling before, it
      seemed indeed as if he had undergone some subtle change in the last few
      hours, gained in dignity and greatness by the action of the people that
      day. When it came my turn to bid him good night, he retained my hand in
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go yet, Hugh,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must be tired,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This sort of thing doesn't make a man tired,&rdquo; he laughed, leading me back
      to the library, where he began to poke the fire into a blaze. &ldquo;Sit down
      awhile. You must be tired, I think,&mdash;you've worked hard in this
      campaign, a good deal harder than I have. I haven't said much about it,
      but I appreciate it, my boy.&rdquo; Mr. Watling had the gift of expressing his
      feelings naturally, without sentimentality. I would have given much for
      that gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I liked it,&rdquo; I replied awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read a gentle amusement in his eyes, and also the expression of
      something else, difficult to define. He had seated himself, and was
      absently thrusting at the logs with the poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've never regretted going into law?&rdquo; he asked suddenly, to my
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, sir,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to hear that. I feel, to a considerable extent, responsible for
      your choice of a profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father intended me to be a lawyer,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;But it's true that
      you gave me my&mdash;my first enthusiasm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at me at the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admired your father. He seemed to me to be everything that a lawyer
      should be. And years ago, when I came to this city a raw country boy from
      upstate, he represented and embodied for me all the fine traditions of the
      profession. But the practice of law isn't what it was in his day, Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;that could scarcely be expected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe you realize that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've watched you, I've taken
      a personal pride in you, and I have an idea that eventually you will
      succeed me here&mdash;neither Fowndes nor Ripon have the peculiar ability
      you have shown. You and I are alike in a great many respects, and I am
      inclined to think we are rather rare, as men go. We are able to keep one
      object vividly in view, so vividly as to be able to work for it day and
      night. I could mention dozens who had and have more natural talent for the
      law than I, more talent for politics than I. The same thing may be said
      about you. I don't regard either of us as natural lawyers, such as your
      father was. He couldn't help being a lawyer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was new evidence of his perspicacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely,&rdquo; I ventured, &ldquo;you don't feel any regrets concerning your
      career, Mr. Watling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that's just the point. But no two of us are made wholly
      alike. I hadn't practised law very long before I began to realize that
      conditions were changing, that the new forces at work in our industrial
      life made the older legal ideals impracticable. It was a case of choosing
      between efficiency and inefficiency, and I chose efficiency. Well, that
      was my own affair, but when it comes to influencing others&mdash;&rdquo; He
      paused. &ldquo;I want you to see this as I do, not for the sake of justifying
      myself, but because I honestly believe there is more to it than
      expediency,&mdash;a good deal more. There's a weak way of looking at it,
      and a strong way. And if I feel sure you understand it, I shall be
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because things are going to change in this country, Hugh. They are
      changing, but they are going to change more. A man has got to make up his
      mind what he believes in, and be ready to fight for it. We'll have to
      fight for it, sooner perhaps than we realize. We are a nation divided
      against ourselves; democracy&mdash;Jacksonian democracy, at all events, is
      a flat failure, and we may as well acknowledge it. We have a political
      system we have outgrown, and which, therefore, we have had to nullify.
      There are certain needs, certain tendencies of development in nations as
      well as in individuals,&mdash;needs stronger than the state, stronger than
      the law or constitution. In order to make our resources effective,
      combinations of capital are more and more necessary, and no more to be
      denied than a chemical process, given the proper ingredients, can be
      thwarted. The men who control capital must have a free hand, or the
      structure will be destroyed. This compels us to do many things which we
      would rather not do, which we might accomplish openly and unopposed if
      conditions were frankly recognized, and met by wise statesmanship which
      sought to bring about harmony by the reshaping of laws and policies. Do
      you follow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But I have never heard the situation stated so
      clearly. Do you think the day will come when statesmanship will recognize
      this need?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'm afraid not&mdash;in my time, at least. But we shall
      have to develop that kind of statesmen or go on the rocks. Public opinion
      in the old democratic sense is a myth; it must be made by strong
      individuals who recognize and represent evolutionary needs, otherwise it's
      at the mercy of demagogues who play fast and loose with the prejudice and
      ignorance of the mob. The people don't value the vote, they know nothing
      about the real problems. So far as I can see, they are as easily swayed
      to-day as the crowd that listened to Mark Antony's oration about Caesar.
      You've seen how we have to handle them, in this election and&mdash;in
      other matters. It isn't a pleasant practice, something we'd indulge in out
      of choice, but the alternative is unthinkable. We'd have chaos in no time.
      We've just got to keep hold, you understand&mdash;we can't leave it to the
      irresponsible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said. In this mood he was more impressive than I had ever known
      him, and his confidence flattered and thrilled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime, we're criminals,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;From now on we'll have
      to stand more and more denunciation from the visionaries, the
      dissatisfied, the trouble makers. We may as well make up our minds to it.
      But we've got something on our side worth fighting for, and the man who is
      able to make that clear will be great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&mdash;you are going to the Senate,&rdquo; I reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time has not yet come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Confusion and misunderstanding must
      increase before they can diminish. But I have hopes of you, Hugh, or I
      shouldn't have spoken. I shan't be here now&mdash;of course I'll keep in
      touch with you. I wanted to be sure that you had the right view of this
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it now,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I had thought of it, but never&mdash;never as a
      whole&mdash;not in the large sense in which you have expressed it.&rdquo; To
      attempt to acknowledge or deprecate the compliment he had paid me was
      impossible; I felt that he must have read my gratitude and appreciation in
      my manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn't keep you up until morning.&rdquo; He glanced at the clock, and went
      with me through the hall into the open air. A meteor darted through the
      November night. &ldquo;We're like that,&rdquo; he observed, staring after it, a &ldquo;flash
      across the darkness, and we're gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only&mdash;there are many who haven't the satisfaction of a flash,&rdquo; I was
      moved to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and put his hand on my shoulder as he bade me good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, you ought to get married. I'll have to find a nice girl for you,&rdquo;
       he said. With an elation not unmingled with awe I made my way homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore Watling had given me a creed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week or so after the election I received a letter from George Hutchins
      asking me to come to Elkington. I shall not enter into the details of the
      legal matter involved. Many times that winter I was a guest at the
      yellow-brick house, and I have to confess, as spring came on, that I made
      several trips to Elkington which business necessity did not absolutely
      demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I considered Maude Hutchins, and found the consideration rather a
      delightful process. As became an eligible and successful young man, I was
      careful not to betray too much interest; and I occupied myself at first
      with a review of what I deemed her shortcomings. Not that I was thinking
      of marriage&mdash;but I had imagined the future Mrs. Paret as tall; Maude
      was up to my chin: again, the hair of the fortunate lady was to be dark,
      and Maude's was golden red: my ideal had esprit, lightness of touch, the
      faculty of seizing just the aspect of a subject that delighted me, and a
      knowledge of the world; Maude was simple, direct, and in a word
      provincial. Her provinciality, however, was negative rather than positive,
      she had no disagreeable mannerisms, her voice was not nasal; her
      plasticity appealed to me. I suppose I was lost without knowing it when I
      began to think of moulding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this went on at frequent intervals during the winter, and while I
      was organizing the Elkington Power and Traction Company for George I found
      time to dine and sup at Maude's house, and to take walks with her. I
      thought I detected an incense deliciously sweet; by no means overpowering,
      like the lily's, but more like the shy fragrance of the wood flower. I
      recall her kind welcomes, the faint deepening of colour in her cheeks when
      she greeted me, and while I suspected that she looked up to me she had a
      surprising and tantalizing self-command.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came moments when I grew slightly alarmed, as, for instance, one
      Sunday in the early spring when I was dining at the Ezra Hutchins's house
      and surprised Mrs. Hutchins's glance on me, suspecting her of seeking to
      divine what manner of man I was. I became self-conscious; I dared not look
      at Maude, who sat across the table; thereafter I began to feel that the
      Hutchins connection regarded me as a suitor. I had grown intimate with
      George and his wife, who did not refrain from sly allusions; and George
      himself once remarked, with characteristic tact, that I was most
      conscientious in my attention to the traction affair; I have reason to
      believe they were even less delicate with Maude. This was the logical time
      to withdraw&mdash;but I dallied. The experience was becoming more
      engrossing,&mdash;if I may so describe it,&mdash;and spring was
      approaching. The stars in their courses were conspiring. I was by no means
      as yet a self-acknowledged wooer, and we discussed love in its lighter
      phases through the medium of literature. Heaven forgive me for calling it
      so! About that period, it will be remembered, a mushroom growth of volumes
      of a certain kind sprang into existence; little books with &ldquo;artistic&rdquo;
       bindings and wide margins, sweetened essays, some of them written in
      beautiful English by dilettante authors for drawing-room consumption; and
      collections of short stories, no doubt chiefly bought by philanderers like
      myself, who were thus enabled to skate on thin ice over deep water. It was
      a most delightful relationship that these helped to support, and I fondly
      believed I could reach shore again whenever I chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came a Sunday in early May, one of those days when the feminine
      assumes a large importance. I had been to the Hutchinses' church; and
      Maude, as she sat and prayed decorously in the pew beside me, suddenly
      increased in attractiveness and desirability. Her voice was very sweet,
      and I felt a delicious and languorous thrill which I identified not only
      with love, but also with a reviving spirituality. How often the two seem
      to go hand in hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore a dress of a filmy material, mauve, with a design in gold thread
      running through it. Of late, it seemed, she had had more new dresses: and
      their modes seemed more cosmopolitan; at least to the masculine eye. How
      delicately her hair grew, in little, shining wisps, around her white neck!
      I could have reached out my hand and touched her. And it was this desire,&mdash;although
      by no means overwhelming,&mdash;that startled me. Did I really want her?
      The consideration of this vital question occupied the whole time of the
      sermon; made me distrait at dinner,&mdash;a large family gathering. Later
      I found myself alone with heron a bench in the Hutchinses' garden where we
      had walked the day of my arrival, during the campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardens were very different, now. The trees had burst forth again into
      leaf, the spiraea bushes seemed weighted down with snow, and with a note
      like that of the quivering bass string of a 'cello the bees hummed among
      the fruit blossoms. And there beside me in her filmy dress was Maude, a
      part of it all&mdash;the meaning of all that set my being clamouring. She
      was like some ripened, delicious flower ready to be picked.... One of
      those pernicious, make-believe volumes had fallen on the bench between us,
      for I could not read any more; I could not think; I touched her hand, and
      when she drew it gently away I glanced at her. Reason made a valiant but
      hopeless effort to assert itself. Was I sure that I wanted her&mdash;for
      life? No use! I wanted her now, no matter what price that future might
      demand. An awkward silence fell between us&mdash;awkward to me, at least&mdash;and
      I, her guide and mentor, became banal, apologetic, confused. I made some
      idiotic remark about being together in the Garden of Eden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember Mr. Doddridge saying in Bible class that it was supposed to be
      on the Euphrates,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But it's been destroyed by the flood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's make another&mdash;one of our own,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how silly you are this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's to prevent us&mdash;Maude?&rdquo; I demanded, with a dry throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she laughed. In proportion as I lost poise she seemed to gain
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not nonsense,&rdquo; I faltered. &ldquo;If we were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last the fateful words were pronounced&mdash;irrevocably. And, instead
      of qualms, I felt nothing but relief, joy that I had been swept along by
      the flood of feeling. She did not look at me, but gazed straight ahead of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I love you, Maude?&rdquo; I stammered, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't love you,&rdquo; she replied, steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never in my life had I been so utterly taken aback.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; I managed to say, &ldquo;that after all these months you don't
      like me a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Liking' isn't loving.&rdquo; She looked me full in the face. &ldquo;I like you very
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; there I stopped, paralyzed by what appeared to me the
      quintessence of feminine inconsistency and caprice. Yet, as I stared at
      her, she certainly did not appear capricious. It is not too much to say
      that I was fairly astounded at this evidence of self-command and decision,
      of the strength of mind to refuse me. Was it possible that she had felt
      nothing and I all? I got to my feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to hurt your feelings,&rdquo; I heard her say. &ldquo;I'm very sorry.&rdquo;... She
      looked up at me. Afterwards, when reflecting on the scene, I seemed to
      remember that there were tears in her eyes. I was not in a condition to
      appreciate her splendid sincerity. I was overwhelmed and inarticulate. I
      left her there, on the bench, and went back to George's, announcing my
      intention of taking the five o'clock train....
    </p>
    <p>
      Maude Hutchins had become, at a stroke, the most desirable of women. I
      have often wondered how I should have felt on that five-hour journey back
      to the city if she had fallen into my arms! I should have persuaded
      myself, no doubt, that I had not done a foolish thing in yielding to an
      impulse and proposing to an inexperienced and provincial young woman, yet
      there would have been regrets in the background. Too deeply chagrined to
      see any humour in the situation, I settled down in a Pullman seat and went
      over and over again the event of that afternoon until the train reached
      the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the days wore on, and I attended to my cases, I thought of Maude a
      great deal, and in those moments when the pressure of business was
      relaxed, she obsessed me. She must love me,&mdash;only she did not realize
      it. That was the secret! Her value had risen amazingly, become supreme;
      the very act of refusing me had emphasized her qualifications as a wife,
      and I now desired her with all the intensity of a nature which had been
      permitted always to achieve its objects. The inevitable process of
      idealization began. In dusty offices I recalled her freshness as she had
      sat beside me in the garden,&mdash;the freshness of a flower; with
      Berkeleyan subjectivism I clothed the flower with colour, bestowed it with
      fragrance. I conferred on Maude all the gifts and graces that woman had
      possessed since the creation. And I recalled, with mingled bitterness and
      tenderness, the turn of her head, the down on her neck, the half-revealed
      curve of her arm.... In spite of the growing sordidness of Lyme Street, my
      mother and I still lived in the old house, for which she very naturally
      had a sentiment. In vain I had urged her from time to time to move out
      into a brighter and fresher neighbourhood. It would be time enough, she
      said, when I was married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wait for that, mother,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;we shall spend the rest of
      our lives here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall spend the rest of my life here,&rdquo; she would declare. &ldquo;But you&mdash;you
      have your life before you, my dear. You would be so much more contented if&mdash;if
      you could find some nice girl. I think you live&mdash;too feverishly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do not know whether or not she suspected me of being in love, nor indeed
      how much she read of me in other ways. I did not confide in her, nor did
      it strike me that she might have yearned for confidences; though
      sometimes, when I dined at home, I surprised her gentle face&mdash;framed
      now with white hair&mdash;lifted wistfully toward me across the table. Our
      relationship, indeed, was a pathetic projection of that which had existed
      in my childhood; we had never been confidants then. The world in which I
      lived and fought, of great transactions and merciless consequences
      frightened her; her own world was more limited than ever. She heard
      disquieting things, I am sure, from Cousin Robert Breck, who had become
      more and more querulous since the time-honoured firm of Breck and Company
      had been forced to close its doors and the home at Claremore had been
      sold. My mother often spent the day in the scrolled suburban cottage with
      the coloured glass front door where he lived with the Kinleys and
      Helen....
    </p>
    <p>
      If my mother suspected that I was anticipating marriage, and said nothing,
      Nancy Durrett suspected and spoke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life is such a curious succession of contradictions and surprises that I
      record here without comment the fact that I was seeing much more of Nancy
      since her marriage than I had in the years preceding it. A comradeship
      existed between us. I often dined at her house and had fallen into the
      habit of stopping there frequently on my way home in the evening. Ham did
      not seem to mind. What was clear, at any rate, was that Nancy, before
      marriage, had exacted some sort of an understanding by which her &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;
       was not to be interfered with. She was the first among us of the &ldquo;modern
      wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ham, whose heartstrings and purse-strings were oddly intertwined, had
      stipulated that they were to occupy the old Durrett mansion; but when
      Nancy had made it &ldquo;livable,&rdquo; as she expressed it, he is said to have
      remarked that he might as well have built a new house and been done with
      it. Not even old Nathaniel himself would have recognized his home when
      Nancy finished what she termed furnishing: out went the horsehair, the
      hideous chandeliers, the stuffy books, the Recamier statuary, and an army
      of upholsterers, wood-workers, etc., from Boston and New York invaded the
      place. The old mahogany doors were spared, but matched now by Chippendale
      and Sheraton; the new, polished floors were covered with Oriental rugs,
      the dreary Durrett pictures replaced by good canvases and tapestries.
      Nancy had what amounted to a genius for interior effects, and she was the
      first to introduce among us the luxury that was to grow more and more
      prevalent as our wealth increased by leaps and bounds. Only Nancy's
      luxury, though lavish, was never vulgar, and her house when completed had
      rather marvellously the fine distinction of some old London mansion filled
      with the best that generations could contribute. It left Mrs. Frederick
      Grierson&mdash;whose residence on the Heights had hitherto been our
      &ldquo;grandest&rdquo;&mdash;breathless with despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      With characteristic audacity Nancy had chosen old Nathaniel's sanctum for
      her particular salon, into which Ham himself did not dare to venture
      without invitation. It was hung in Pompeiian red and had a little
      wrought-iron balcony projecting over the yard, now transformed by an
      expert into a garden. When I had first entered this room after the
      metamorphosis had taken place I inquired after the tombstone mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've pulled it up by the roots,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you afraid of ghosts?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look it?&rdquo; she asked. And I confessed that she didn't. Indeed, all
      ghosts were laid, nor was there about her the slightest evidence of
      mourning or regret. One was forced to acknowledge her perfection in the
      part she had chosen as the arbitress of social honours. The candidates
      were rapidly increasing; almost every month, it seemed, someone turned up
      with a fortune and the aspirations that go with it, and it was Mrs.
      Durrett who decided the delicate question of fitness. With these, and with
      the world at large, her manner might best be described as difficult; and I
      was often amused at the way in which she contrived to keep them at arm's
      length and make them uncomfortable. With her intimates&mdash;of whom there
      were few&mdash;she was frank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you enjoy it,&rdquo; I said to her once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I enjoy it, or I shouldn't do it,&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;It isn't the
      real thing, as I told you once. But none of us gets the real thing. It's
      power.... Just as you enjoy what you're doing&mdash;sorting out the unfit.
      It's a game, it keeps us from brooding over things we can't help. And
      after all, when we have good appetites and are fairly happy, why should we
      complain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not complaining,&rdquo; I said, taking up a cigarette, &ldquo;since I still enjoy
      your favour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She regarded me curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you get married, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sufficient unto the day,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I get along, I wonder, with that simple and unsophisticated
      lady when she appears?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you wouldn't marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head at me, and smiled....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she corrected me, &ldquo;you like me better as Hams' wife than you would
      have as your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I merely laughed at this remark.... It would indeed have been difficult to
      analyze the new relationship that had sprung up between us, to say what
      elements composed it. The roots of it went back to the beginning of our
      lives; and there was much of sentiment in it, no doubt. She understood me
      as no one else in the world understood me, and she was fond of me in spite
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, when I became infatuated with Maude Hutchins, after that Sunday
      when she so unexpectedly had refused me, I might have known that Nancy's
      suspicions would be aroused. She startled me by accusing me, out of a
      clear sky, of being in love. I denied it a little too emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't you tell me, Hugh, if it's so?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I didn't
      hesitate to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was just before her departure for the East to spend the summer. We were
      on the balcony, shaded by the big maple that grew at the end of the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there's nothing to tell,&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay back in her chair, regarding me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think that I'd be jealous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing to be jealous about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've always expected you to get married, Hugh. I've even predicted the
      type.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had, in truth, with an accuracy almost uncanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only thing I'm afraid of is that she won't like me. She lives in that
      place you've been going to so much, lately,&mdash;doesn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course she had put two and two together, my visits to Elkington and my
      manner, which I had flattered myself had not been distrait. On the chance
      that she knew more, from some source, I changed my tactics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean Maude Hutchins,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that's her name!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the name of a girl in Elkington. I've been doing legal work for the
      Hutchinses, and I imagine some idiot has been gossiping. She's just a
      young girl&mdash;much too young for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men are queer creatures,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Did you think I should be
      jealous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was exactly what I had thought, but I denied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you be&mdash;even if there were anything to be jealous about?
      You didn't consult me when you got married. You merely announced an
      irrevocable decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy leaned forward and laid her hand on my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;strange as it may seem, I want you to be happy. I
      don't want you to make a mistake, Hugh, too great a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised and moved. Once more I had a momentary glimpse of the real
      Nancy....
    </p>
    <p>
      Our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Ralph Hambleton....

    <h2>
      XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      However, thoughts of Maude continued to possess me. She still appeared the
      most desirable of beings, and a fortnight after my repulse, without any
      excuse at all, I telegraphed the George Hutchinses that I was coming to
      pay them a visit. Mrs. George, wearing a knowing smile, met me at the
      station in a light buck-board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've asked Maude to dinner,&rdquo; she said....
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus with masculine directness I returned to the charge, and Maude's
      continued resistance but increased my ardour; could not see why she
      continued to resist me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I don't love you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was incredible. I suggested that she didn't know what love was, and
      she admitted it was possible: she liked me very, very much. I told her,
      sagely, that this was the best foundation for matrimony. That might be,
      but she had had other ideas. For one thing, she felt that she did not know
      me.... In short, she was charming and maddening in her defensive ruses, in
      her advances and retreats, for I pressed her hard during the four weeks
      which followed, and in them made four visits. Flinging caution to the
      winds, I did not even pretend to George that I was coming to see him on
      business. I had the Hutchins family on my side, for they had the sense to
      see that the match would be an advantageous one; I even summoned up enough
      courage to talk to Ezra Hutchins on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not attempt to influence Maude, Mr. Paret&mdash;I've always said I
      wouldn't interfere with her choice. But as you are a young man of sound
      habits, sir, successful in your profession, I should raise no objection. I
      suppose we can't keep her always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To conceal his emotion, he pulled out the watch he lived by. &ldquo;Why, it's
      church time!&rdquo; he said.... I attended church regularly at Elkington....
    </p>
    <p>
      On a Sunday night in June, following a day during which victory seemed
      more distant than ever, with startling unexpectedness Maude capitulated.
      She sat beside me on the bench, obscured, yet the warm night quivered with
      her presence. I felt her tremble.... I remember the first exquisite touch
      of her soft cheek. How strange it was that in conquest the tumult of my
      being should be stilled, that my passion should be transmuted into awe
      that thrilled yet disquieted! What had I done? It was as though I had
      suddenly entered an unimagined sanctuary filled with holy flame....
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, when we began to talk, I found myself seeking more familiar
      levels. I asked her why she had so long resisted me, accusing her of
      having loved me all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I did, Hugh. Only&mdash;I didn't know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have felt something, that afternoon when I first proposed to
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't really want me, Hugh. Not then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surprised, and a little uncomfortable at this evidence of intuition, I
      started to protest. It seemed to me then as though I had always wanted
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you didn't. You were carried away by your
      feelings&mdash;you hadn't made up your mind. Indeed, I can't see why you
      want me now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe I do,&rdquo; I said, and drew her toward me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&mdash;I believe it, now. But I can't see why. There must be so
      many attractive girls in the city, who know so much more than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sought fervidly to reassure her on this point.... At length when we went
      into the house she drew away from me at arm's length and gave me one long
      searching look, as though seeking to read my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, you will always love me&mdash;to the very end, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the library, one on each side of the table, under the lamp, Ezra
      Hutchins and his wife sat reading. Mrs. Hutchins looked up, and I saw that
      she had divined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I am engaged to Hugh,&rdquo; Maude said, and bent over and kissed her.
      Ezra and I stood gazing at them. Then he turned to me and pressed my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I never saw the man who was good enough for her, Hugh. But God
      bless you, my son. I hope you will prize her as we prize her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hutchins embraced me. And through her tears she, too, looked long
      into my face. When she had released me Ezra had his watch in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're going on the ten o'clock train, Hugh&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father!&rdquo; Maude protested, laughing, &ldquo;I must say I don't call that very
      polite.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      In the train I slept but fitfully, awakening again and again to recall the
      extraordinary fact that I was now engaged to be married, to go over the
      incidents of the evening. Indifferent to the backings and the bumpings of
      the car, the voices in the stations, the clanging of locomotive bells and
      all the incomprehensible startings and stoppings, exalted yet troubled I
      beheld Maude luminous with the love I had amazingly awakened, a love
      somewhere beyond my comprehension. For her indeed marriage was made in
      heaven. But for me? Could I rise now to the ideal that had once been mine,
      thrust henceforth evil out of my life? Love forever, live always in this
      sanctuary she had made for me? Would the time come when I should feel a
      sense of bondage?...
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was set for the end of September. I continued to go every week
      to Elkington, and in August, Maude and I spent a fortnight at the sea.
      There could be no doubt as to my mother's happiness, as to her approval of
      Maude; they loved each other from the beginning. I can picture them now,
      sitting together with their sewing on the porch of the cottage at
      Mattapoisett. Out on the bay little white-caps danced in the sunlight,
      sail-boats tacked hither and thither, the strong cape breeze, laden with
      invigorating salt, stirred Maude's hair, and occasionally played havoc
      with my papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is just the wife for you, Hugh,&rdquo; my mother confided to me. &ldquo;If I had
      chosen her myself I could not have done better,&rdquo; she added, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was inclined to believe it, but Maude would have none of this illusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He just stumbled across me,&rdquo; she insisted....
    </p>
    <p>
      We went on long sails together, towards Wood's Hole and the open sea, the
      sprays washing over us. Her cheeks grew tanned.... Sometimes, when I
      praised her and spoke confidently of our future, she wore a troubled
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo; I asked her once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't put me on a pedestal,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;I want you to see me
      as I am&mdash;I don't want you to wake up some day and be disappointed.
      I'll have to learn a lot of things, and you'll have to teach me. I can't
      get used to the fact that you, who are so practical and successful in
      business, should be such a dreamer where I am concerned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and told her, comfortably, that she was talking nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think of me, when you first knew me?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she answered, with the courage that characterized her, &ldquo;I thought
      you were rather calculating, that you put too high a price on success. Of
      course you attracted me. I own it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hid your opinions rather well,&rdquo; I retorted, somewhat discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you changed them?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you have that side, and I think it a weak side, Hugh. It's hard
      to tell you this, but it's better to say so now, since you ask me. I do
      think you set too high a value on success.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now that I know what success really is, perhaps I shall reform,&rdquo; I
      told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like to think that you fool yourself,&rdquo; she replied, with a
      perspicacity I should have found extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my life there have been days and incidents, some trivial, some
      important, that linger in my memory because they are saturated with
      &ldquo;atmosphere.&rdquo; I recall, for instance, a gala occasion in youth when my
      mother gave one of her luncheon parties; on my return from school, the
      house and its surroundings wore a mysterious, exciting and unfamiliar
      look, somehow changed by the simple fact that guests sat decorously
      chatting in a dining-room shining with my mother's best linen and
      treasured family silver and china. The atmosphere of my wedding-day is no
      less vivid. The house of Ezra Hutchins was scarcely recognizable: its
      doors and windows were opened wide, and all the morning people were being
      escorted upstairs to an all-significant room that contained a collection
      like a jeweller's exhibit,&mdash;a bewildering display. There was a
      massive punch-bowl from which dangled the card of Mr. and Mrs. Adolf
      Scherer, a really wonderful tea set of old English silver given by Senator
      and Mrs. Watling, and Nancy Willett, with her certainty of good taste, had
      sent an old English tankard of the time of the second Charles. The secret
      was in that room. And it magically transformed for me (as I stood,
      momentarily alone, in the doorway where I had first beheld Maude) the
      accustomed scene, and charged with undivined significance the blue shadows
      under the heavy foliage of the maples. The September sunlight was heavy,
      tinged with gold....
    </p>
    <p>
      So fragmentary and confused are the events of that day that a cubist
      literature were necessary to convey the impressions left upon me. I had
      something of the feeling of a recruit who for the first time is taking
      part in a brilliant and complicated manoeuvre. Tom and Susan Peters flit
      across the view, and Gene Hollister and Perry Blackwood and the Ewanses,&mdash;all
      of whom had come up in a special car; Ralph Hambleton was &ldquo;best man,&rdquo;
       looking preternaturally tall in his frock-coat: and his manner, throughout
      the whole proceeding, was one of good-natured tolerance toward a folly
      none but he might escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you must do it, Hughie, I suppose you must,&rdquo; he had said to me. &ldquo;I'll
      see you through, of course. But don't blame me afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maude was a little afraid of him....
    </p>
    <p>
      I dressed at George's; then, like one of those bewildering shifts of a
      cinematograph, comes the scene in church, the glimpse of my mother's
      wistful face in the front pew; and I found myself in front of the austere
      Mr. Doddridge standing beside Maude&mdash;or rather beside a woman I tried
      hard to believe was Maude&mdash;so veiled and generally encased was she. I
      was thinking of this all the time I was mechanically answering Mr.
      Doddridge, and even when the wedding march burst forth and I led her out
      of the church. It was as though they had done their best to disguise her,
      to put our union on the other-worldly plane that was deemed to be its only
      justification, to neutralize her sex at the very moment it should have
      been most enhanced. Well, they succeeded. If I had not been as
      conventional as the rest, I should have preferred to have run away with
      her in the lavender dress she wore when I first proposed to her. It was
      only when we had got into the carriage and started for the house and she
      turned to me her face from which the veil had been thrown back that I
      realized what a sublime meaning it all had for her. Her eyes were wet.
      Once more I was acutely conscious of my inability to feel deeply at
      supreme moments. For months I had looked forward with anticipation and
      impatience to my wedding-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I kissed her gently. But I felt as though she had gone to heaven, and that
      the face I beheld enshrouded were merely her effigy. Commonplace words
      were inappropriate, yet it was to these I resorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;it wasn't so bad after all! Was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want to take it back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was a beautiful wedding, Hugh. I'm so glad we had a good
      day.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed shy, at once very near and very remote. I held her hand
      awkwardly until the carriage stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later we were standing in a corner of the parlour, the atmosphere
      of which was heavy with the scent of flowers, submitting to the onslaught
      of relatives. Then came the wedding breakfast: croquettes, champagne,
      chicken salad, ice-cream, the wedding-cake, speeches and more kisses.... I
      remember Tom Peters holding on to both my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, and God bless you, old boy,&rdquo; he was saying. Susan, in view of
      the occasion, had allowed him a little more champagne than usual&mdash;enough
      to betray his feelings, and I knew that these had not changed since our
      college days. I resolved to see more of him. I had neglected him and
      undervalued his loyalty.... He had followed me to my room in George's
      house where I was dressing for the journey, and he gave it as his
      deliberate judgment that in Maude I had &ldquo;struck gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's just the girl for you, Hughie,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Susan thinks so,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later in the afternoon, as we sat in the state-room of the car that was
      bearing us eastward, Maude began to cry. I sat looking at her helplessly,
      unable to enter into her emotion, resenting it a little. Yet I tried
      awkwardly to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't bear to leave them,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will see them often, when we come back,&rdquo; I reassured her. It was
      scarcely the moment for reminding her of what she was getting in return.
      This peculiar family affection she evinced was beyond me; I had never
      experienced it in any poignant degree since I had gone as a freshman to
      Harvard, and yet I was struck by the fact that her emotions were so
      rightly placed. It was natural to love one's family. I began to feel,
      vaguely, as I watched her, that the new relationship into which I had
      entered was to be much more complicated than I had imagined. Twilight was
      coming on, the train was winding through the mountain passes, crossing and
      re-crossing a swift little stream whose banks were massed with alder; here
      and there, on the steep hillsides, blazed the goldenrod.... Presently I
      turned, to surprise in her eyes a wide, questioning look,&mdash;the look
      of a child. Even in this irrevocable hour she sought to grasp what manner
      of being was this to whom she had confided her life, and with whom she was
      faring forth into the unknown. The experience was utterly unlike my
      anticipation. Yet I responded. The kiss I gave her had no passion in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take good care of you, Maude,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, in the fading light, she flung her arms around me, pressing me
      tightly, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know you will, Hugh, dear. And you'll forgive me, won't you, for
      being so horrid to-day, of all days? I do love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of us had ever been abroad. And although it was before the days of
      swimming-pools and gymnasiums and a la carte cafes on ocean liners, the
      Atlantic was imposing enough. Maude had a more lasting capacity for
      pleasure than I, a keener enjoyment of new experiences, and as she lay
      beside me in the steamer-chair where I had carefully tucked her she would
      exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply can't believe it, Hugh! It seems so unreal. I'm sure I shall
      wake up and find myself back in Elkington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't speak so loud, my dear,&rdquo; I cautioned her. There were some very
      formal-looking New Yorkers next us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;But I'm so happy I feel as though I should
      like to tell everyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no need,&rdquo; I answered smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh, I don't want to disgrace you!&rdquo; she exclaimed, in real alarm.
      &ldquo;Otherwise, so far as I am concerned, I shouldn't care who knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      People smiled at her. Women came up and took her hands. And on the fourth
      day the formidable New Yorkers unexpectedly thawed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had once thought of Maude as plastic. Then I had discovered she had a
      mind and will of her own. Once more she seemed plastic; her love had made
      her so. Was it not what I had desired? I had only to express a wish, and
      it became her law. Nay, she appealed to me many times a day to know
      whether she had made any mistakes, and I began to drill her in my silly
      traditions,&mdash;gently, very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shouldn't be quite so familiar with people, quite so ready to
      make acquaintances, Maude. You have no idea who they may be. Some of them,
      of course, like the Sardells, I know by reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sardells were the New Yorkers who sat next us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll try, Hugh, to be more reserved, more like the wife of an important
      man.&rdquo; She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't that you're not reserved,&rdquo; I replied, ignoring the latter half
      of her remark. &ldquo;Nor that I want you to change,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I only want to
      teach you what little of the world I know myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I want to learn, Hugh. You don't know how I want to learn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sight of mist-ridden Liverpool is not a cheering one for the American
      who first puts foot on the mother country's soil, a Liverpool of
      yellow-browns and dingy blacks, of tilted funnels pouring out smoke into
      an atmosphere already charged with it. The long wharves and shed roofs
      glistened with moisture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think, Hugh, it's actually England!&rdquo; she cried, as we stood on the
      wet deck. But I felt as though I'd been there before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder they're addicted to cold baths,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;They must feel
      perfectly at home in them, especially if they put a little lampblack in
      the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maude laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You grumpy old thing!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could dampen her ardour, not the sight of the rain-soaked stone
      houses when we got ashore, nor even the frigid luncheon we ate in the
      lugubrious hotel. For her it was all quaint and new. Finally we found
      ourselves established in a compartment upholstered in light grey, with
      tassels and arm-supporters, on the window of which was pasted a poster
      with the word reserved in large, red letters. The guard inquired
      respectfully, as the porter put our new luggage in the racks, whether we
      had everything we wanted. The toy locomotive blew its toy whistle, and we
      were off for the north; past dingy, yellow tenements of the smoking
      factory towns, and stretches of orderly, hedge-spaced rain-swept country.
      The quaint cottages we glimpsed, the sight of distant, stately mansions on
      green slopes caused Maude to cry out with rapture:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Hugh,
      there's a manor-house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More vivid than were the experiences themselves of that journey are the
      memories of them. We went to windswept, Sabbath-keeping Edinburgh, to high
      Stirling and dark Holyrood, and to Abbotsford. It was through Sir Walter's
      eyes we beheld Melrose bathed in autumn light, by his aid repeopled it
      with forgotten monks eating their fast-day kale.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as we sat reading and dreaming in the still, sunny corners I forgot,
      that struggle for power in which I had been so furiously engaged since
      leaving Cambridge. Legislatures, politicians and capitalists receded into
      a dim background; and the gift I had possessed, in youth, of living in a
      realm of fancy showed astonishing signs of revival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hugh,&rdquo; Maude exclaimed, &ldquo;you ought to have been a writer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've only just begun to fathom my talents,&rdquo; I replied laughingly. &ldquo;Did
      you think you'd married just a dry old lawyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you capable of anything,&rdquo; she said....
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew more and more to depend on her for little things.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a born housewife. It was pleasant to have her do all the packing,
      while I read or sauntered in the queer streets about the inns. And she
      took complete charge of my wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a talent for drawing, and as we went southward through England she
      made sketches of the various houses that took our fancy&mdash;suggestions
      for future home-building; we spent hours in the evenings in the inn
      sitting-rooms incorporating new features into our residence, continually
      modifying our plans. Now it was a Tudor house that carried us away, now a
      Jacobean, and again an early Georgian with enfolding wings and a
      wrought-iron grill. A stage of bewilderment succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maude, I knew, loved the cottages best. She said they were more
      &ldquo;homelike.&rdquo; But she yielded to my liking for grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, I should feel lost in a palace like that!&rdquo; she cried, as we gazed at
      the Marquis of So-and-So's country-seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course we should have to modify it,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps
      our family will be larger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand on my lips, and blushed a fiery red....
    </p>
    <p>
      We examined, with other tourists, at a shilling apiece historic mansions
      with endless drawing-rooms, halls, libraries, galleries filled with family
      portraits; elaborate, formal bedrooms where famous sovereigns had slept,
      all roped off and carpeted with canvas strips to protect the floors.
      Through mullioned windows we caught glimpses of gardens and geometrical
      parterres, lakes, fountains, statuary, fantastic topiary and distant
      stretches of park. Maude sighed with admiration, but did not covet. She
      had me. But I was often uncomfortable, resenting the vulgar, gaping
      tourists with whom we were herded and the easy familiarity of the guides.
      These did not trouble Maude, who often annoyed me by asking naive
      questions herself. I would nudge her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon when, with other compatriots, we were being hurried through
      a famous castle, the guide unwittingly ushered us into a drawing-room
      where the owner and several guests were seated about a tea-table. I shall
      never forget the stares they gave us before we had time precipitately to
      retreat, nor the feeling of disgust and rebellion that came over me. This
      was heightened by the remark of a heavy, six-foot Ohioan with an infantile
      face and a genial manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I notice that they didn't invite us to sit down and have a bite,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I call that kind of inhospitable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was 'is lordship himself!&rdquo; exclaimed the guide, scandalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say!&rdquo; drawled our fellow-countryman. &ldquo;I guess I owe you another
      shilling, my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guide, utterly bewildered, accepted it. The transatlantic point of
      view towards the nobility was beyond him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His lordship could make a nice little income if he set up as a side
      show,&rdquo; added the Ohioan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maude giggled, but I was furious. And no sooner were we outside the gates
      than I declared I should never again enter a private residence by the back
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hugh, how queer you are sometimes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I maybe queer, but I have a sense of fitness,&rdquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asserted herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see what difference it makes. They didn't know us. And if they
      admit people for money&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it. And as for the man from Ohio&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was so funny!&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;And he was really very nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was silent. Her point of view, eminently sensible as it was, exasperated
      me. We were leaning over the parapet of a little-stone bridge. Her face
      was turned away from me, but presently I realized that she was crying. Men
      and women, villagers, passing across the bridge, looked at us curiously. I
      was miserable, and somewhat appalled; resentful, yet striving to be gentle
      and conciliatory. I assured her that she was talking nonsense, that I
      loved her. But I did not really love her at that moment; nor did she
      relent as easily as usual. It was not until we were together in our
      sitting-room, a few hours later, that she gave in. I felt a tremendous
      sense of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, I'll try to be what you want. You know I am trying. But don't kill
      what is natural in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was touched by the appeal, and repentant...
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to say when the little worries, annoyances and
      disagreements began, when I first felt a restlessness creeping over me. I
      tried to hide these moods from her, but always she divined them. And yet I
      was sure that I loved Maude; in a surprisingly short period I had become
      accustomed to her, dependent on her ministrations and the normal, cosy
      intimacy of our companionship. I did not like to think that the keen edge
      of the enjoyment of possession was wearing a little, while at the same
      time I philosophized that the divine fire, when legalized, settles down to
      a comfortable glow. The desire to go home that grew upon me I attributed
      to the irritation aroused by the spectacle of a fixed social order
      commanding such unquestioned deference from the many who were content to
      remain resignedly outside of it. Before the setting in of the Liberal
      movement and the &ldquo;American invasion&rdquo; England was a country in which (from
      my point of view) one must be &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; in order to be happy. I was
      &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; at home; or at least rapidly becoming so....
    </p>
    <p>
      London was shrouded, parliament had risen, and the great houses were
      closed. Day after day we issued forth from a musty and highly respectable
      hotel near Piccadilly to a gloomy Tower, a soggy Hampton Court or a
      mournful British Museum. Our native longing for luxury&mdash;or rather my
      native longing&mdash;impelled me to abandon Smith's Hotel for a huge
      hostelry where our suite overlooked the Thames, where we ran across a man
      I had known slightly at Harvard, and other Americans with whom we made
      excursions and dined and went to the theatre. Maude liked these persons; I
      did not find them especially congenial. My life-long habit of
      unwillingness to accept what life sent in its ordinary course was
      asserting itself; but Maude took her friends as she found them, and I was
      secretly annoyed by her lack of discrimination. In addition to this, the
      sense of having been pulled up by the roots grew upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; Maude surprised me by suggesting one morning as we sat at
      breakfast watching the river craft flit like phantoms through the
      yellow-green fog&mdash;&ldquo;suppose we don't go to France, after all, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not go to France!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Are you tired of the trip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh!&rdquo; Her voice caught. &ldquo;I could go on, always, if you were
      content.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;what makes you think that I'm not content?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her smile had in it just a touch of wistfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you, Hugh, better than you think. You want to get back to
      your work, and&mdash;and I should be happier. I'm not so silly and so
      ignorant as to think that I can satisfy you always. And I'd like to get
      settled at home,&mdash;I really should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There surged up within me a feeling of relief. I seized her hand as it lay
      on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll come abroad another time, and go to France,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Maude, you're
      splendid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I'm not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do satisfy me,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;It isn't that at all. But I think,
      perhaps, it would be wiser to go back. It's rather a crucial time with me,
      now that Mr. Watling's in Washington. I've just arrived at a position
      where I shall be able to make a good deal of money, and later on&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't the money, Hugh,&rdquo; she cried, with a vehemence which struck me as
      a little odd. &ldquo;I sometimes think we'd be a great deal happier without&mdash;without
      all you are going to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven't made it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She possessed the frugality of the Hutchinses. And some times my
      lavishness had frightened her, as when we had taken the suite of rooms we
      now occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you can afford them, Hugh?&rdquo; she had asked when we first
      surveyed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began married life, and carried it on without giving her any conception
      of the state of my finances. She had an allowance from the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the steamer slipped westward my spirits rose, to reach a climax of
      exhilaration when I saw the towers of New York rise gleaming like huge
      stalagmites in the early winter sun. Maude likened them more happily&mdash;to
      gigantic ivory chessmen. Well, New York was America's chessboard, and the
      Great Players had already begun to make moves that astonished the world.
      As we sat at breakfast in a Fifth Avenue hotel I ran my eye eagerly over
      the stock-market reports and the financial news, and rallied Maude for a
      lack of spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you glad to be home?&rdquo; I asked her, as we sat in a hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am, Hugh!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;But&mdash;I can't look upon New
      York as home, somehow. It frightens me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed indulgently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get used to it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;We'll be coming here a great deal, off
      and on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. But later, when we took a hansom and entered the streams
      of traffic, she responded to the stimulus of the place: the movement, the
      colour, the sight of the well-appointed carriages, of the well-fed,
      well-groomed people who sat in them, the enticement of the shops in which
      we made our purchases had their effect, and she became cheerful again....
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening we took the &ldquo;Limited&rdquo; for home.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lived for a month with my mother, and then moved into our own house. It
      was one which I had rented from Howard Ogilvy, and it stood on the corner
      of Baker and Clinton streets, near that fashionable neighbourhood called
      &ldquo;the Heights.&rdquo; Ogilvy, who was some ten years older than I, and who
      belonged to one of our old families, had embarked on a career then
      becoming common, but which at first was regarded as somewhat meteoric:
      gradually abandoning the practice of law, and perceiving the possibilities
      of the city of his birth, he had &ldquo;gambled&rdquo; in real estate and other
      enterprises, such as our local water company, until he had quadrupled his
      inheritance. He had built a mansion on Grant Avenue, the wide thoroughfare
      bisecting the Heights. The house he had vacated was not large, but
      essentially distinctive; with the oddity characteristic of the revolt
      against the banal architecture of the 80's. The curves of the tiled roof
      enfolded the upper windows; the walls were thick, the note one of mystery.
      I remember Maude's naive delight when we inspected it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd never guess what the inside was like, would you, Hugh?&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the panelled box of an entrance hall one went up a few steps to a
      drawing-room which had a bowed recess like an oriel, and window-seats. The
      dining-room was an odd shape, and was wainscoted in oak; it had a tiled
      fireplace and (according to Maude) the &ldquo;sweetest&rdquo; china closet built into
      the wall. There was a &ldquo;den&rdquo; for me, and an octagonal reception-room on the
      corner. Upstairs, the bedrooms were quite as unusual, the plumbing of the
      new pattern, heavy and imposing. Maude expressed the air of seclusion when
      she exclaimed that she could almost imagine herself in one of the
      mediaeval towns we had seen abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a dream, Hugh,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;But&mdash;do you think we can afford
      it?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This house,&rdquo; I announced, smiling, &ldquo;is only a stepping-stone to the
      palace I intend to build you some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want a palace!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I'd rather live here, like this,
      always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A certain vehemence in her manner troubled me. I was charmed by this
      disposition for domesticity, and yet I shrank from the contemplation of
      its permanency. I felt vaguely, at the time, the possibility of a future
      conflict of temperaments. Maude was docile, now. But would she remain
      docile? and was it in her nature to take ultimately the position that was
      desirable for my wife? Well, she must be moulded, before it were too late.
      Her ultra-domestic tendencies must be halted. As yet blissfully unaware of
      the inability of the masculine mind to fathom the subtleties of feminine
      relationships, I was particularly desirous that Maude and Nancy Durrett
      should be intimates. The very day after our arrival, and while we were
      still at my mother's, Nancy called on Maude, and took her out for a drive.
      Maude told me of it when I came home from the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old Nancy!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I know you liked her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Hugh. I should like her for your sake, anyway. She's&mdash;she's
      one of your oldest and best friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want you to like her for her own sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall,&rdquo; said Maude. She was so scrupulously truthful! &ldquo;I was a
      little afraid of her, at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of Nancy!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know, she's much older than I. I think she is sweet. But she
      knows so much about the world&mdash;so much that she doesn't say. I can't
      describe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only her manner. You'll get used to that, when you know what she
      really is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope so,&rdquo; answered Maude. &ldquo;I'm very anxious to like her&mdash;I do
      like her. But it takes me such a lot of time to get to know people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy asked us to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to help Maude all I can,&mdash;if she'll let me,&rdquo; Nancy said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't she let you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may not like me,&rdquo; Nancy replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be my fault, at any rate, if she doesn't,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wanted
      her to meet at first just the right people your old friends and a few
      others. It is hard for a woman&mdash;especially a young woman&mdash;coming
      among strangers.&rdquo; She glanced down the table to where Maude sat talking to
      Ham. &ldquo;She has an air about her,&mdash;a great deal of self-possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I, too, had noticed this, with pride and relief. For I knew Maude had been
      nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are luckier than you deserve to be,&rdquo; Nancy reminded me. &ldquo;But I hope
      you realize that she has a mind of her own, that she will form her own
      opinions of people, independently of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I must have betrayed the fact that I was a little startled, for the remark
      came as a confirmation of what I had dimly felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she has,&rdquo; I agreed, somewhat lamely. &ldquo;Every woman has, who is
      worth her salt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy's smile bespoke a knowledge that seemed to transcend my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do like her?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like her very much indeed,&rdquo; said Nancy, a little gravely. &ldquo;She's
      simple, she's real, she has that which so few of us possess nowadays&mdash;character.
      But&mdash;I've got to be prepared for the possibility that she may not get
      along with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are again, with your old unwillingness to analyze a situation
      and face it. For heaven's sake, now that you have married her, study her.
      Don't take her for granted. Can't you see that she doesn't care for the
      things that amuse me, that make my life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you insist on making yourself out a hardened, sophisticated
      woman&mdash;&rdquo; I protested. But she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her roots are deeper,&mdash;she is in touch, though she may not realize
      it, with the fundamentals. She is one of those women who are race-makers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though somewhat perturbed, I was struck by the phrase. And I lost sight of
      Nancy's generosity. She looked me full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether you can rise to her,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I were you, I should
      try. You will be happier&mdash;far happier than if you attempt to use her
      for your own ends, as a contributor to your comfort and an auxiliary to
      your career. I was afraid&mdash;I confess it&mdash;that you had married an
      aspiring, simpering and empty-headed provincial like that Mrs. George
      Hutchins' whom I met once, and who would sell her soul to be at my table.
      Well, you escaped that, and you may thank God for it. You've got a chance,
      think it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A chance!&rdquo; I repeated, though I gathered something of her meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think it over, said Nancy again. And she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;do you want me to bury myself in domesticity?&rdquo; I demanded,
      without grasping the significance of my words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll find her reasonable, I think. You've got a chance now, Hugh. Don't
      spoil it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Leonard Dickinson, who sat on her other side....
    </p>
    <p>
      When we got home I tried to conceal my anxiety as to Maude's impressions
      of the evening. I lit a cigarette, and remarked that the dinner had been a
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I've been wondering all evening?&rdquo; Maude asked. &ldquo;Why you
      didn't marry Nancy instead of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;it just didn't come off. And Nancy was telling me at
      dinner how fortunate I was to have married you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maude passed this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see why she accepted Hambleton Durrett. It seems horrible that
      such a woman as she is could have married&mdash;just for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy has an odd streak in her,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But then we all have odd
      streaks. She's the best friend in the world, when she is your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure of it,&rdquo; Maude agreed, with a little note of penitence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You enjoyed it,&rdquo; I ventured cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;And everyone was so nice to me&mdash;for your sake
      of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be ridiculous!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I shan't tell you what Nancy and the
      others said about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maude had the gift of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a beautiful house!&rdquo; she sighed presently. &ldquo;I know you'll think me
      silly, but so much luxury as that frightens me a little. In England, in
      those places we saw, it seemed natural enough, but in America&mdash;! And
      they all your friends&mdash;seem to take it as a matter of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no reason why we shouldn't have beautiful things and well served
      dinners, too, if we have the money to pay for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; she agreed, absently.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      That winter many other entertainments were given in our honour. But the
      conviction grew upon me that Maude had no real liking for the social side
      of life, that she acquiesced in it only on my account. Thus, at the very
      outset of our married career, an irritant developed: signs of it, indeed,
      were apparent from the first, when we were preparing the house we had
      rented for occupancy. Hurrying away from my office at odd times to
      furniture and department stores to help decide such momentous questions as
      curtains, carpets, chairs and tables I would often spy the tall,
      uncompromising figure of Susan Peters standing beside Maude's, while an
      obliging clerk spread out, anxiously, rugs or wall-papers for their
      inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you get Nancy to help you, too!&rdquo; I ventured to ask her once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ours is such a little house&mdash;compared to Nancy's, Hugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My attitude towards Susan had hitherto remained undefined. She was Tom's
      wife and Tom's affair. In spite of her marked disapproval of the modern
      trend in business and social life,&mdash;a prejudice she had communicated
      to Tom, as a bachelor I had not disliked her; and it was certain that
      these views had not mitigated Tom's loyalty and affection for me. Susan
      had been my friend, as had her brother Perry, and Lucia, Perry's wife:
      they made no secret of the fact that they deplored in me what they were
      pleased to call plutocratic obsessions, nor had their disapproval always
      been confined to badinage. Nancy, too, they looked upon as a renegade. I
      was able to bear their reproaches with the superior good nature that
      springs from success, to point out why the American tradition to which
      they so fatuously clung was a things of the past. The habit of taking
      dinner with them at least once a week had continued, and their arguments
      rather amused me. If they chose to dwell in a backwater out of touch with
      the current of great affairs, this was a matter to be deplored, but I did
      not feel strongly enough to resent it. So long as I remained a bachelor
      the relationship had not troubled me, but now that I was married I began
      to consider with some alarm its power to affect my welfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had remained for Nancy to inform me that I had married a woman with a
      mind of her own. I had flattered myself that I should be able to control
      Maude, to govern her predilections, and now at the very beginning of our
      married life she was showing a disquieting tendency to choose for herself.
      To be sure, she had found my intimacy with the Peterses and Blackwoods
      already formed; but it was an intimacy from which I was growing away. I
      should not have quarrelled with her if she had not discriminated: Nancy
      made overtures, and Maude drew back; Susan presented herself, and with
      annoying perversity and in an extraordinarily brief time Maude had become
      her intimate. It seemed to me that she was always at Susan's, lunching or
      playing with the children, who grew devoted to her; or with Susan,
      choosing carpets and clothes; while more and more frequently we dined with
      the Peterses and the Blackwoods, or they with us. With Perry's wife Maude
      was scarcely less intimate than with Susan. This was the more surprising
      to me since Lucia Blackwood was a dyed-in-the-wool &ldquo;intellectual,&rdquo; a
      graduate of Radcliffe, the daughter of a Harvard professor. Perry had
      fallen in love with her during her visit to Susan. Lucia was, perhaps, the
      most influential of the group; she scorned the world, she held strong
      views on the higher education of women; she had long discarded orthodoxy
      for what may be called a Cambridge stoicism of simple living and high
      thinking; while Maude was a strict Presbyterian, and not in the least
      given to theories. When, some months after our homecoming, I ventured to
      warn her gently of the dangers of confining one's self to a coterie&mdash;especially
      one of such narrow views&mdash;her answer was rather bewildering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn't Tom your best friend?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I admitted that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you always went there such a lot before we were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, too, was undeniable. &ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I have other
      friends. I'm fond of the Blackwoods and the Peterses, I'm not advocating
      seeing less of them, but their point of view, if taken without any
      antidote, is rather narrowing. We ought to see all kinds,&rdquo; I suggested,
      with a fine restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;more worldly people,&rdquo; she said with her disconcerting
      directness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily worldly,&rdquo; I struggled on. &ldquo;People who know more of the
      world&mdash;yes, who understand it better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maude sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do try, Hugh,&mdash;I return their calls,&mdash;I do try to be nice to
      them. But somehow I don't seem to get along with them easily&mdash;I'm not
      myself, they make me shy. It's because I'm provincial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I protested, &ldquo;you're not a bit provincial.&rdquo; And it was true;
      her dignity and self-possession redeemed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy was not once mentioned. But I think she was in both our minds....
    </p>
    <p>
      Since my marriage, too, I had begun to resent a little the attitude of Tom
      and Susan and the Blackwoods of humorous yet affectionate tolerance toward
      my professional activities and financial creed, though Maude showed no
      disposition to take this seriously. I did suspect, however, that they were
      more and more determined to rescue Maude from what they would have termed
      a frivolous career; and on one of these occasions&mdash;so exasperating in
      married life when a slight cause for pique tempts husband or wife to try
      to ask myself whether this affair were only a squall, something to be
      looked for once in a while on the seas of matrimony, and weathered: or
      whether Maude had not, after all, been right when she declared that I had
      made a mistake, and that we were not fitted for one another? In this
      gloomy view endless years of incompatibility stretched ahead; and for the
      first time I began to rehearse with a certain cold detachment the chain of
      apparently accidental events which had led up to my marriage: to consider
      the gradual blindness that had come over my faculties; and finally to
      wonder whether judgment ever entered into sexual selection. Would Maude
      have relapsed into this senseless fit if she had realized how fortunate
      she was? For I was prepared to give her what thousands of women longed
      for, position and influence. My resentment rose again against Perry and
      Tom, and I began to attribute their lack of appreciation of my
      achievements to jealousy. They had not my ability; this was the long and
      short of it.... I pondered also, regretfully, on my bachelor days. And for
      the first time, I, who had worked so hard to achieve freedom, felt the
      pressure of the yoke I had fitted over my own shoulders. I had
      voluntarily, though unwittingly, returned to slavery. This was what had
      happened. And what was to be done about it? I would not consider divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I should have to make the best of it. Whether this conclusion
      brought on a mood of reaction, I am unable to say. I was still annoyed by
      what seemed to the masculine mind a senseless and dramatic performance on
      Maude's part, an incomprehensible case of &ldquo;nerves.&rdquo; Nevertheless, there
      stole into my mind many recollections of Maude's affection, many passages
      between us; and my eye chanced to fall on the ink-well she had bought me
      out of the allowance I gave her. An unanticipated pity welled up within me
      for her loneliness, her despair in that room upstairs. I got up&mdash;and
      hesitated. A counteracting, inhibiting wave passed through me. I hardened.
      I began to walk up and down, a prey to conflicting impulses. Something
      whispered, &ldquo;go to her&rdquo;; another voice added, &ldquo;for your own peace of mind,
      at any rate.&rdquo; I rejected the intrusion of this motive as unworthy, turned
      out the light and groped my way upstairs. The big clock in the hall struck
      twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I listened outside the door of the bedroom, but all was silent within. I
      knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maude!&rdquo; I said, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maude&mdash;let me in! I didn't mean to be unkind&mdash;I'm sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After an interval I heard her say: &ldquo;I'd rather stay here,&mdash;to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at length, after more entreaty and self-abasement on my part, she
      opened the door. The room was dark. We sat down together on the
      window-seat, and all at once she relaxed and her head fell on my shoulder,
      and she began weeping again. I held her, the alternating moods still
      running through me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; she said at length, &ldquo;how could you be so cruel? when you know I
      love you and would do anything for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to be cruel, Maude,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you didn't. But at times you seem so&mdash;indifferent, and you
      can't understand how it hurts. I haven't anybody but you, now, and it's in
      your power to make me happy or&mdash;or miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later on I tried to explain my point of view, to justify myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I mean,&rdquo; I concluded at length, &ldquo;is that my position is a little
      different from Perry's and Tom's. They can afford to isolate themselves,
      but I'm thrown professionally with the men who are building up this city.
      Some of them, like Ralph Hambleton and Mr. Ogilvy, I've known all my life.
      Life isn't so simple for us, Maude&mdash;we can't ignore the social side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; she said contentedly. &ldquo;You are more of a man of affairs&mdash;much
      more than Tom or Perry, and you have greater responsibilities and wider
      interests. I'm really very proud of you. Only&mdash;don't you think you
      are a little too sensitive about yourself, when you are teased?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I let this pass....
    </p>
    <p>
      I give a paragraph from a possible biography of Hugh Paret which, as then
      seemed not improbable, might in the future have been written by some
      aspiring young worshipper of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On his return from a brief but delightful honeymoon in England Mr. Paret
      took up again, with characteristic vigour, the practice of the law. He was
      entering upon the prime years of manhood; golden opportunities confronted
      him as, indeed, they confronted other men&mdash;but Paret had the
      foresight to take advantage of them. And his training under Theodore
      Watling was now to produce results.... The reputations had already been
      made of some of that remarkable group of financial geniuses who were
      chiefly instrumental in bringing about the industrial evolution begun
      after the Civil War: at the same time, as is well known, a political
      leadership developed that gave proof of a deplorable blindness to the
      logical necessity of combinations in business. The lawyer with initiative
      and brains became an indispensable factor,&rdquo; etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biography might have gone on to relate my association with and
      important services to Adolf Scherer in connection with his constructive
      dream. Shortly after my return from abroad, in answer to his summons, I
      found him at Heinrich's, his napkin tucked into his shirt front, and a
      dish of his favourite sausages before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, the honeymoon is over!&rdquo; he said, and pressed my hand. &ldquo;You are right
      to come back to business, and after awhile you can have another honeymoon,
      eh? I have had many since I married. And how long do you think was my
      first? A day! I was a foreman then, and the wedding was at six o'clock in
      the morning. We went into the country, the wife and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid down his knife and fork, possessed by the memory. &ldquo;I have grown
      rich since, and we've been to Europe and back to Germany, and travelled on
      the best ships and stayed at the best hotels, but I never enjoyed a
      holiday more than that day. It wasn't long afterwards I went to Mr.
      Durrett and told him how he could save much money. He was always ready to
      listen, Mr. Durrett, when an employee had anything to say. He was a big
      man,&mdash;an iron-master. Ah, he would be astonished if only he could
      wake up now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not only have to be an iron-master,&rdquo; I agreed, &ldquo;but a financier
      and a railroad man to boot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A jack of all trades,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Scherer. &ldquo;That's what we are&mdash;men
      in my position. Well, it was comparatively simple then, when we had no
      Sherman law and crazy statutes, such as some of the states are passing, to
      bother us. What has got into the politicians, that they are indulging in
      such foolishness?&rdquo; he exclaimed, more warmly. &ldquo;We try to build up a trade
      for this country, and they're doing their best to tie our hands and tear
      it down. When I was in Washington the other day I was talking with one of
      those Western senators whose state has passed those laws. He said to me,
      'Mr. Scherer, I've been making a study of the Boyne Iron Works. You are
      clever men, but you are building up monopolies which we propose to stop.'
      'By what means?'&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;'Rebates, for one,' said he, 'you get
      preferential rates from your railroad which give you advantages over your
      competitors.' Foolishness!&rdquo; Mr. Scherer exclaimed. &ldquo;I tell him the
      railroad is a private concern, built up by private enterprise, and it has
      a right to make special rates for large shippers. No,&mdash;railroads are
      public carriers with no right to make special rates. I ask him what else
      he objects to, and he says patented processes. As if we don't have a right
      to our own patents! We buy them. I buy them, when other steel companies
      won't touch 'em. What is that but enterprise, and business foresight, and
      taking risks? And then he begins to talk about the tariff taking money out
      of the pockets of American consumers and making men like me rich. I have
      come to Washington to get the tariff raised on steel rails; and Watling
      and other senators we send down there are raising it for us. We are
      building up monopolies! Well, suppose we are. We can't help it, even if we
      want to. Has he ever made a study of the other side of the question&mdash;the
      competition side? Of course he hasn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He brought down his beer mug heavily on the table. In times of excitement
      his speech suggested the German idiom. Abruptly his air grew mysterious;
      he glanced around the room, now becoming empty, and lowered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking a long time, I have a little scheme,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
      I have been to Washington to see Watling, to talk over it. Well, he thinks
      much of you. Fowndes and Ripon are good lawyers, but they are not smart
      like you. See Paret, he says, and he can come down and talk to me. So I
      ask you to come here. That is why I say you are wise to get home.
      Honeymoons can wait&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled appreciatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They talk about monopoly, those Populist senators, but I ask you what is
      a man in my place to do? If you don't eat, somebody eats you&mdash;is it
      not so? Like the boa-constrictors&mdash;that is modern business. Look at
      the Keystone Plate people, over there at Morris. For years we sold them
      steel billets from which to make their plates, and three months ago they
      serve notice on us that they are getting ready to make their own billets,
      they buy mines north of the lakes and are building their plant. Here is a
      big customer gone. Next year, maybe, the Empire Tube Company goes into the
      business of making crude steel, and many more thousands of tons go from
      us. What is left for us, Paret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obviously you've got to go into the tube and plate business yourselves,&rdquo;
       I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; cried Mr. Scherer, triumphantly, &ldquo;or it is close up. We are not
      fools, no, we will not lie down and be eaten like lambs for any law.
      Dickinson can put his hand on the capital, and I&mdash;I have already
      bought a tract on the lakes, at Bolivar, I have already got a plant
      designed with the latest modern machinery. I can put the ore right there,
      I can send the coke back from here in cars which would otherwise be empty,
      and manufacture tubes at eight dollars a ton less than they are selling.
      If we can make tubes we can make plates, and if we can make plates we can
      make boilers, and beams and girders and bridges.... It is not like it was
      but where is it all leading, my friend? The time will come&mdash;is right
      on us now, in respect to many products&mdash;when the market will be
      flooded with tubes and plates and girders, and then we'll have to find a
      way to limit production. And the inefficient mills will all be forced to
      shut down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The logic seemed unanswerable, even had I cared to answer it.... He
      unfolded his campaign. The Boyne Iron Works was to become the Boyne Iron
      Works, Ltd., owner of various subsidiary companies, some of which were as
      yet blissfully ignorant of their fate. All had been thought out as calmly
      as the partition of Poland&mdash;only, lawyers were required; and
      ultimately, after the process of acquisition should have been completed, a
      delicate document was to be drawn up which would pass through the meshes
      of that annoying statutory net, the Sherman Anti-trust Law. New mines were
      to be purchased, extending over a certain large area; wide coal deposits;
      little strips of railroad to tap them. The competition of the Keystone
      Plate people was to be met by acquiring and bringing up to date the plate
      mills of King and Son, over the borders of a sister state; the Somersworth
      Bridge and Construction Company and the Gring Steel and Wire Company were
      to be absorbed. When all of this should have been accomplished, there
      would be scarcely a process in the steel industry, from the smelting of
      the ore to the completion of a bridge, which the Boyne Iron Works could
      not undertake. Such was the beginning of the &ldquo;lateral extension&rdquo; period.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two can play at that game,&rdquo; Mr. Scherer said. &ldquo;And if those fellows could
      only be content to let well enough alone, to continue buying their crude
      steel from us, there wouldn't be any trouble.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident, however, that he really welcomed the &ldquo;trouble,&rdquo; that he
      was going into battle with enthusiasm. He had already picked out his
      points of attack and was marching on them. Life, for him, would have been
      a poor thing without new conflicts to absorb his energy; and he had
      already made of the Boyne Iron Works, with its open-hearth furnaces, a
      marvel of modern efficiency that had opened the eyes of the Steel world,
      and had drawn the attention of a Personality in New York,&mdash;a
      Personality who was one of the new and dominant type that had developed
      with such amazing rapidity, the banker-dinosaur; preying upon and
      superseding the industrial-dinosaur, conquering type of the preceding age,
      builder of the railroads, mills and manufactories. The banker-dinosaurs,
      the gigantic ones, were in Wall Street, and strove among themselves for
      the industrial spoils accumulated by their predecessors. It was
      characteristic of these monsters that they never fought in the open unless
      they were forced to. Then the earth rocked, huge economic structures
      tottered and fell, and much dust arose to obscure the vision of smaller
      creatures, who were bewildered and terrified. Such disturbances were
      called &ldquo;panics,&rdquo; and were blamed by the newspapers on the Democratic
      party, or on the reformers who had wantonly assailed established
      institutions. These dominant bankers had contrived to gain control of the
      savings of thousands and thousands of fellow-citizens who had deposited
      them in banks or paid them into insurance companies, and with the power
      thus accumulated had sallied forth to capture railroads and industries.
      The railroads were the strategic links. With these in hand, certain
      favoured industrial concerns could be fed, and others starved into
      submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adolf Scherer might be said to represent a transitional type. For he was
      not only an iron-master who knew every detail of his business, who kept it
      ahead of the times; he was also a strategist, wise in his generation,
      making friends with the Railroad while there had yet been time, at length
      securing rebates and favours. And when that Railroad (which had been
      constructed through the enterprise and courage of such men as Nathaniel
      Durrett) had passed under the control of the banker-personality to whom I
      have referred, and had become part of a system, Adolf Scherer remained in
      alliance, and continued to receive favours.... I can well remember the
      time when the ultimate authority of our Railroad was transferred, quietly,
      to Wall Street. Alexander Barbour, its president, had been a great man,
      but after that he bowed, in certain matters, to a greater one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have digressed.... Mr. Scherer unfolded his scheme, talking about
      &ldquo;units&rdquo; as calmly as though they were checkers on a board instead of huge,
      fiery, reverberating mills where thousands and thousands of human beings
      toiled day and night&mdash;beings with families, and hopes and fears,
      whose destinies were to be dominated by the will of the man who sat
      opposite me. But&mdash;did not he in his own person represent the triumph
      of that American creed of opportunity? He, too, had been through the fire,
      had sweated beside the blasts, had handled the ingots of steel. He was one
      of the &ldquo;fittest&rdquo; who had survived, and looked it. Had he no memories of
      the terrors of that struggle?... Adolf Scherer had grown to be a giant.
      And yet without me, without my profession he was a helpless giant, at the
      mercy of those alert and vindictive lawmakers who sought to restrain and
      hamper him, to check his growth with their webs. How stimulating the idea
      of his dependence! How exhilarating too, the thought that that vision
      which had first possessed me as an undergraduate&mdash;on my visit to
      Jerry Kyme&mdash;was at last to be realized! I had now become the
      indispensable associate of the few who divided the spoils, I was to have a
      share in these myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're young, Paret,&rdquo; Mr. Scherer concluded. &ldquo;But Watling has confidence
      in you, and you will consult him frequently. I believe in the young men,
      and I have already seen something of you&mdash;so?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      When I returned to the office I wrote Theodore Watling a letter expressing
      my gratitude for the position he had, so to speak, willed me, of
      confidential legal adviser to Adolf Scherer. Though the opportunity had
      thrust itself upon me suddenly, and sooner than I expected it, I was
      determined to prove myself worthy of it. I worked as I had never worked
      before, making trips to New York to consult leading members of this new
      branch of my profession there, trips to Washington to see my former chief.
      There were, too, numerous conferences with local personages, with Mr.
      Dickinson and Mr. Grierson, and Judah B. Tallant,&mdash;whose newspaper
      was most useful; there were consultations and negotiations of a delicate
      nature with the owners and lawyers of other companies to be &ldquo;taken in.&rdquo;
       Nor was it all legal work, in the older and narrower sense. Men who are
      playing for principalities are making war. Some of our operations had all
      the excitement of war. There was information to be got, and it was got&mdash;somehow.
      Modern war involves a spy system, and a friendly telephone company is not
      to be despised. And all of this work from first to last had to be done
      with extreme caution. Moribund distinctions of right and wrong did not
      trouble me, for the modern man labours religiously when he knows that
      Evolution is on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all of these operations a corps of counsel had been employed,
      including the firm of Harrington and Bowes next to Theodore Watling, Joel
      Harrington was deemed the ablest lawyer in the city. We organized in due
      time the corporation known as the Boyne Iron Works, Limited; a trust
      agreement was drawn up that was a masterpiece of its kind, one that
      caused, first and last, meddling officials in the Department of Justice at
      Washington no little trouble and perplexity. I was proud of the fact that
      I had taken no small part in its composition.... In short, in addition to
      certain emoluments and opportunities for investment, I emerged from the
      affair firmly established in the good graces of Adolf Scherer, and with a
      reputation practically made.
    </p>
    <p>
      A year or so after the Boyne Company, Ltd., came into existence I chanced
      one morning to go down to the new Ashuela Hotel to meet a New Yorker of
      some prominence, and was awaiting him in the lobby, when I overheard a
      conversation between two commercial travellers who were sitting with their
      backs to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice that fellow who went up to the desk a moment ago?&rdquo; asked
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young fellow in the grey suit? Sure. Who is he? He looks as if he was
      pretty well fixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he is,&rdquo; replied the first. &ldquo;That's Paret. He's Scherer's
      confidential counsel. He used to be Senator Watling's partner, but they
      say he's even got something on the old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the feverish life I led, I was still undoubtedly
      young-looking, and in this I was true to the incoming type of successful
      man. Our fathers appeared staid at six and thirty. Clothes, of course,
      made some difference, and my class and generation did not wear the sombre
      and cumbersome kind, with skirts and tails; I patronized a tailor in New
      York. My chestnut hair, a little darker than my father's had been, showed
      no signs of turning grey, although it was thinning a little at the crown
      of the forehead, and I wore a small moustache, clipped in a straight line
      above the mouth. This made me look less like a college youth. Thanks to a
      strong pigment in my skin, derived probably from Scotch-Irish ancestors,
      my colour was fresh. I have spoken of my life as feverish, and yet I am
      not so sure that this word completely describes it. It was full to
      overflowing&mdash;one side of it; and I did not miss (save vaguely, in
      rare moments of weariness) any other side that might have been developed.
      I was busy all day long, engaged in affairs I deemed to be alone of vital
      importance in the universe. I was convinced that the welfare of the city
      demanded that supreme financial power should remain in the hands of the
      group of men with whom I was associated, and whose battles I fought in the
      courts, in the legislature, in the city council, and sometimes in
      Washington,&mdash;although they were well cared for there. By every means
      ingenuity could devise, their enemies were to be driven from the field,
      and they were to be protected from blackmail.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of importance sustained me; and I remember in that first flush of
      a success for which I had not waited too long&mdash;what a secret
      satisfaction it was to pick up the Era and see my name embedded in certain
      dignified notices of board meetings, transactions of weight, or cases
      known to the initiated as significant. &ldquo;Mr. Scherer's interests were taken
      care of by Mr. Hugh Paret.&rdquo; The fact that my triumphs were modestly set
      forth gave me more pleasure than if they had been trumpeted in headlines.
      Although I might have started out in practice for myself, my affection and
      regard for Mr. Watling kept me in the firm, which became Watling, Fowndes
      and Paret, and a new, arrangement was entered into: Mr. Ripon retired on
      account of ill health.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were instances, however, when a certain amount of annoying publicity
      was inevitable. Such was the famous Galligan case, which occurred some
      three or four years after my marriage. Aloysius Galligan was a brakeman,
      and his legs had become paralyzed as the result of an accident that was
      the result of defective sills on a freight car. He had sued, and been
      awarded damages of $15,000. To the amazement and indignation of Miller
      Gorse, the Supreme Court, to which the Railroad had appealed, affirmed the
      decision. It wasn't the single payment of $15,000 that the Railroad cared
      about, of course; a precedent might be established for compensating maimed
      employees which would be expensive in the long run. Carelessness could not
      be proved in this instance. Gorse sent for me. I had been away with Maude
      at the sea for two months, and had not followed the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to take charge, Paret, and get a rehearing. See Bering, and
      find out who in the deuce is to blame for this. Chesley's one, of course.
      We ought never to have permitted his nomination for the Supreme Bench. It
      was against my judgment, but Varney and Gill assured me that he was all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I saw Judge Bering that evening. We sat on a plush sofa in the parlour of
      his house in Baker Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a notion Gorse'd be mad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it looked to me as if they
      had it on us, Paret. I didn't see how we could do anything else but affirm
      without being too rank. Of course, if he feels that way, and you want to
      make a motion for a rehearing, I'll see what can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something's got to be done,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Can't you see what such a
      decision lets them in for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the judge, who knew an order when he heard one, &ldquo;I guess
      we can find an error.&rdquo; He was not a little frightened by the report of Mr.
      Gorse's wrath, for election-day was approaching. &ldquo;Say, you wouldn't take
      me for a sentimental man, now, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled at the notion of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll own up to you this kind of got under my skin. That Galligan is
      a fine-looking fellow, if there ever was one, and he'll never be of a bit
      of use any more. Of course the case was plain sailing, and they ought to
      have had the verdict, but that lawyer of his handled it to the queen's
      taste, if I do say so. He made me feel real bad, by God,&mdash;as if it
      was my own son Ed who'd been battered up. Lord, I can't forget the look in
      that man Galligan's eyes. I hate to go through it again, and reverse it,
      but I guess I'll have to, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge sat gazing at the flames playing over his gas log.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the lawyer?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man by the name of Krebs,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Never heard of him before. He's
      just moved to the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This city?&rdquo; I ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge glanced at me interestedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This city, of course. What do you know about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I answered, when I had recovered a little from the shock&mdash;for
      it was a distinct shock&mdash;&ldquo;he lived in Elkington. He was the man who
      stirred up the trouble in the legislature about Bill 709.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge slapped his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and ruminated. &ldquo;Why didn't somebody tell me?&rdquo;
       he added, complainingly. &ldquo;Why didn't Miller Gorse let me know about it,
      instead of licking up a fuss after it's all over?&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all men of my acquaintance I had thought the Judge the last to grow
      maudlin over the misfortunes of those who were weak or unfortunate enough
      to be defeated and crushed in the struggle for existence, and it was not
      without food for reflection that I departed from his presence. To make Mr.
      Bering &ldquo;feel bad&rdquo; was no small achievement, and Krebs had been responsible
      for it, of course,&mdash;not Galligan. Krebs had turned up once more! It
      seemed as though he were destined to haunt me. Well, I made up my mind
      that he should not disturb me again, at any rate: I, at least, had learned
      to eliminate sentimentality from business, and it was not without
      deprecation I remembered my experience with him at the Capital, when he
      had made me temporarily ashamed of my connection with Bill 709. I had got
      over that. And when I entered the court room (the tribunal having
      graciously granted a rehearing on the ground that it had committed an
      error in the law!) my feelings were of lively curiosity and zest. I had no
      disposition to underrate his abilities, but I was fortified by the
      consciousness of a series of triumphs behind me, by a sense of association
      with prevailing forces against which he was helpless. I could afford to
      take a superior attitude in regard to one who was destined always to be
      dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the case proceeded I was rather disappointed on the whole that he was
      not dramatic&mdash;not even as dramatic as he had been when he defied the
      powers in the Legislature. He had changed but little, he still wore
      ill-fitting clothes, but I was forced to acknowledge that he seemed to
      have gained in self-control, in presence. He had nodded at me before the
      case was called, as he sat beside his maimed client; and I had been on the
      alert for a hint of reproach in his glance: there was none. I smiled back
      at him....
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not rant. He seemed to have rather a remarkable knowledge of the
      law. In a conversational tone he described the sufferings of the man in
      the flannel shirt beside him, but there could be no question of the fact
      that he did produce an effect. The spectators were plainly moved, and it
      was undeniable that some of the judges wore rather a sheepish look as they
      toyed with their watch chains or moved the stationery in front of them.
      They had seen maimed men before, they had heard impassioned, sentimental
      lawyers talk about wives and families and God and justice. Krebs did none
      of this. Just how he managed to bring the thing home to those judges, to
      make them ashamed of their role, just how he managed&mdash;in spite of my
      fortified attitude to revive something of that sense of discomfort I had
      experienced at the State House is difficult to say. It was because, I
      think, he contrived through the intensity of his own sympathy to enter
      into the body of the man whose cause he pleaded, to feel the despair in
      Galligan's soul&mdash;an impression that was curiously conveyed despite
      the dignified limits to which he confined his speech. It was strange that
      I began to be rather sorry for him, that I felt a certain reluctant regret
      that he should thus squander his powers against overwhelming odds. What
      was the use of it all!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end his voice became more vibrant&mdash;though he did not raise it&mdash;as
      he condemned the Railroad for its indifference to human life, for its
      contention that men were cheaper than rolling-stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      I encountered him afterward in the corridor. I had made a point of seeking
      him out, perhaps from some vague determination to prove that our last
      meeting in the little restaurant at the Capital had left no traces of
      embarrassment in me: I was, in fact, rather aggressively anxious to reveal
      myself to him as one who has thriven on the views he condemned, as one in
      whose unity of mind there is no rift. He was alone, apparently waiting for
      someone, leaning against a steam radiator in one of his awkward, angular
      poses, looking out of the court-house window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; I said blithely. &ldquo;So you've left Elkington for a wider
      field.&rdquo; I wondered whether my alert cousin-in-law, George Hutchins, had
      made it too hot for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to me unexpectedly a face of profound melancholy; his expression
      had in it, oddly, a trace of sternness; and I was somewhat taken aback by
      this evidence that he was still bearing vicariously the troubles of his
      client. So deep had been the thought I had apparently interrupted that he
      did not realize my presence at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you, Paret. Yes, I've left Elkington,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of a surprise to run up against you suddenly, like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected to see you,&rdquo; he answered gravely, and the slight emphasis he
      gave the pronoun implied not only a complete knowledge of the situation
      and of the part I had taken in it, but also a greater rebuke than if his
      accusation had been direct. But I clung to my affability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can do anything for you, let me know,&rdquo; I told him. He said nothing,
      he did not even smile. At this moment he was opportunely joined by a man
      who had the appearance of a labour leader, and I walked away. I was
      resentful; my mood, in brief, was that of a man who has done something
      foolish and is inclined to talk to himself aloud: but the mood was
      complicated, made the more irritating by the paradoxical fact that that
      last look he had given me seemed to have borne the traces of affection....
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perhaps needless to add that the court reversed its former decision.

      XVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Pilot published a series of sensational articles and editorials about
      the Galligan matter, a picture of Galligan, an account of the destitute
      state of his wife and family. The time had not yet arrived when such
      newspapers dared to attack the probity of our courts, but a system of law
      that permitted such palpable injustice because of technicalities was
      bitterly denounced. What chance had a poor man against such a moloch as
      the railroad, even with a lawyer of such ability as had been exhibited by
      Hermann Krebs? Krebs was praised, and the attention of Mr. Lawler's
      readers was called to the fact that Krebs was the man who, some years
      before, had opposed single-handed in the legislature the notorious Bill
      No. 709. It was well known in certain circles&mdash;the editorial went on
      to say&mdash;that this legislation had been drawn by Theodore Watling in
      the interests of the Boyne Iron Works, etc., etc. Hugh Paret had learned
      at the feet of an able master. This first sight of my name thus
      opprobriously flung to the multitude gave me an unpleasant shock. I had
      seen Mr. Scherer attacked, Mr. Gorse attacked, and Mr. Watling: I had all
      along realized, vaguely, that my turn would come, and I thought myself to
      have acquired a compensating philosophy. I threw the sheet into the waste
      basket, presently picked it out again and reread the sentence containing
      my name. Well, there were certain penalties that every career must pay. I
      had become, at last, a marked man, and I recognized the fact that this
      assault would be the forerunner of many.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tried to derive some comfort and amusement from the thought of certain
      operations of mine that Mr. Lawler had not discovered, that would have
      been matters of peculiar interest to his innocent public: certain
      extra-legal operations at the time when the Bovine corporation was being
      formed, for instance. And how they would have licked their chops had they
      learned of that manoeuvre by which I had managed to have one of Mr.
      Scherer's subsidiary companies in another state, with property and assets
      amounting to more than twenty millions, reorganized under the laws of New
      Jersey, and the pending case thus transferred to the Federal court, where
      we won hands down! This Galligan affair was nothing to that. Nevertheless,
      it was annoying. As I sat in the street car on my way homeward, a man
      beside me was reading the Pilot. I had a queer sensation as he turned the
      page, and scanned the editorial; and I could not help wondering what he
      and the thousands like him thought of me; what he would say if I
      introduced myself and asked his opinion. Perhaps he did not think at all:
      undoubtedly he, and the public at large, were used to Mr. Lawler's daily
      display of &ldquo;injustices.&rdquo; Nevertheless, like slow acid, they must be eating
      into the public consciousness. It was an outrage&mdash;this freedom of the
      press.
    </p>
    <p>
      With renewed exasperation I thought of Krebs, of his disturbing and almost
      uncanny faculty of following me up. Why couldn't he have remained in
      Elkington? Why did he have to follow me here, to make capital out of a
      case that might never have been heard of except for him?... I was still in
      this disagreeable frame of mind when I turned the corner by my house and
      caught sight of Maude, in the front yard, bending bareheaded over a bed of
      late flowers which the frost had spared. The evening was sharp, the dusk
      already gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll catch cold,&rdquo; I called to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at the sound of my voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll soon be gone,&rdquo; she sighed, referring to the flowers. &ldquo;I hate
      winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her hand through my arm, and we went into the house. The curtains
      were drawn, a fire was crackling on the hearth, the lamps were lighted,
      and as I dropped into a chair this living-room of ours seemed to take on
      the air of a refuge from the vague, threatening sinister things of the
      world without. I felt I had never valued it before. Maude took up her
      sewing and sat down beside the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;I read something in the newspaper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My exasperation flared up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get that disreputable sheet?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the dressmaker's!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&mdash;I just happened to see the
      name, Paret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just politics,&rdquo; I declared, &ldquo;stirring up discontent by
      misrepresentation. Jealousy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward in her chair, gazing into the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it isn't true that this poor man, Galligan&mdash;isn't that his
      name?&mdash;was cheated out of the damages he ought to have to keep
      himself and his family alive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been talking to Perry or Susan,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;They seem to be
      convinced that I am an oppressor of the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo; The tone in which she spoke my name smote me. &ldquo;How can you say
      that? How can you doubt their loyalty, and mine? Do you think they would
      undermine you, and to me, behind your back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean that, of course, Maude. I was annoyed about something else.
      And Tom and Perry have an air of deprecating most of the enterprises in
      which I am professionally engaged. It's very well for them to talk. All
      Perry has to do is to sit back and take in receipts from the Boyne Street
      car line, and Tom is content if he gets a few commissions every week.
      They're like militiamen criticizing soldiers under fire. I know they're
      good friends of mine, but sometimes I lose patience with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got up and walked to the window, and came back again and stood before
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry for this man, Galligan,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;I can't tell you how
      sorry. But few people who are not on the inside, so to speak, grasp the
      fact that big corporations, like the Railroad, are looked upon as fair
      game for every kind of parasite. Not a day passes in which attempts are
      not made to bleed them. Some of these cases are pathetic. It had cost the
      Railroad many times fifteen thousand dollars to fight Galligan's case. But
      if they had paid it, they would have laid themselves open to thousands of
      similar demands. Dividends would dwindle. The stockholders have a right to
      a fair return on their money. Galligan claims that there was a defective
      sill on the car which is said to have caused the wreck. If damages are
      paid on that basis, it means the daily inspection of every car which
      passes over their lines. And more than that: there are certain defects, as
      in the present case, which an inspection would not reveal. When a man
      accepts employment on a railroad he assumes a certain amount of personal
      risk,&mdash;it's not precisely a chambermaid's job. And the lawyer who
      defends such cases, whatever his personal feelings may be, cannot afford
      to be swayed by them. He must take the larger view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me about it before?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I didn't think it of enough importance&mdash;these things are all
      in the day's work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mr. Krebs? How strange that he should be here, connected with the
      case!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made an effort to control myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your old friend,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I believe you have a sentiment about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely that,&rdquo; she replied gravely, with the literalness that often
      characterized her, &ldquo;but he isn't a person easily forgotten. He may be
      queer, one may not agree with his views, but after the experience I had
      with him I've never been able to look at him in the way George does, for
      instance, or even as father does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or even as I do,&rdquo; I supplied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps not even as you do,&rdquo; she answered calmly. &ldquo;I believe you
      once told me, however, that you thought him a fanatic, but sincere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's certainly a fanatic!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But sincere, Hugh-you still think him sincere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem a good deal concerned about a man you've laid eyes on but once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She considered this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is surprising,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;but it's true. I was sorry for
      him, but I admired him. I was not only impressed by his courage in taking
      charge of me, but also by the trust and affection the work-people showed.
      He must be a good man, however mistaken he may be in the methods he
      employs. And life is cruel to those people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is-life,&rdquo; I observed. &ldquo;Neither you nor I nor Krebs is able to change
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he come here to practice?&rdquo; she asked, after a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you want me to invite him to dinner?&rdquo; and seeing that she did not
      reply I continued: &ldquo;In spite of my explanation I suppose you think,
      because Krebs defended the man Galligan, that a monstrous injustice has
      been done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is unworthy of you,&rdquo; she said, bending over her stitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to pace the room again, as was my habit when overwrought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was going to tell you about this affair if you had not
      forestalled me by mentioning it yourself. It isn't pleasant to be vilified
      by rascals who make capital out of vilification, and a man has a right to
      expect some sympathy from his wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I ever deny you that, Hugh?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Only you don't ever seem to
      need it, to want it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there are things,&rdquo; I pursued, &ldquo;things in a man's province that a
      woman ought to accept from her husband, things which in the very nature of
      the case she can know nothing about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a woman must think for herself,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;She shouldn't become
      a mere automaton,&mdash;and these questions involve so much! People are
      discussing them, the magazines and periodicals are beginning to take them
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared at her, somewhat appalled by this point of view. There had,
      indeed, been signs of its development before now, but I had not heeded
      them. And for the first time I beheld Maude in a new light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's not that I don't trust you,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I'm open to
      conviction, but I must be convinced. Your explanation of this Galligan
      case seems a sensible one, although it's depressing. But life is hard and
      depressing sometimes I've come to realize that. I want to think over what
      you've said, I want to talk over it some more. Why won't you tell me more
      of what you are doing? If you only would confide in me&mdash;as you have
      now! I can't help seeing that we are growing farther and farther apart,
      that business, your career, is taking all of you and leaving me nothing.&rdquo;
       She faltered, and went on again. &ldquo;It's difficult to tell you this&mdash;you
      never give me the chance. And it's not for my sake alone, but for yours,
      too. You are growing more and more self-centred, surrounding yourself with
      a hard shell. You don't realize it, but Tom notices it, Perry notices it,
      it hurts them, it's that they complain of. Hugh!&rdquo; she cried appealingly,
      sensing my resentment, forestalling the words of defence ready on my lips.
      &ldquo;I know that you are busy, that many men depend on you, it isn't that I'm
      not proud of you and your success, but you don't understand what a woman
      craves,&mdash;she doesn't want only to be a good housekeeper, a good
      mother, but she wants to share a little, at any rate, in the life of her
      husband, in his troubles as well as in his successes. She wants to be of
      some little use, of some little help to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My feelings were reduced to a medley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are a help to me&mdash;a great help,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. &ldquo;I wish I were,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It suddenly occurred to me that she might be. I was softened, and alarmed
      by the spectacle she had revealed of the widening breach between us. I
      laid my hand on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll try to do better, Maude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at me, questioningly yet gratefully, through a mist of
      tears. But her reply&mdash;whatever it might have been&mdash;was
      forestalled by the sound of shouts and laughter in the hallway. She sprang
      up and ran to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the children,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;they've come home from Susan's
      party!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It begins indeed to look as if I were writing this narrative upside down,
      for I have said nothing about children. Perhaps one reason for this
      omission is that I did not really appreciate them, that I found it
      impossible to take the same minute interest in them as Tom, for instance,
      who was, apparently, not content alone with the six which he possessed,
      but had adopted mine. One of them, little Sarah, said &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rdquo; before
      &ldquo;Father.&rdquo; I do not mean to say that I had not occasional moments of
      tenderness toward them, but they were out of my thoughts much of the time.
      I have often wondered, since, how they regarded me; how, in their little
      minds, they defined the relationship. Generally, when I arrived home in
      the evening I liked to sit down before my study fire and read the
      afternoon newspapers or a magazine; but occasionally I went at once to the
      nursery for a few moments, to survey with complacency the medley of toys
      on the floor, and to kiss all three. They received my caresses with a
      certain shyness&mdash;the two younger ones, at least, as though they were
      at a loss to place me as a factor in the establishment. They tumbled over
      each other to greet Maude, and even Tom. If I were an enigma to them, what
      must they have thought of him? Sometimes I would discover him on the
      nursery floor, with one or two of his own children, building towers and
      castles and railroad stations, or forts to be attacked and demolished by
      regiments of lead soldiers. He was growing comfortable-looking, if not
      exactly stout; prematurely paternal, oddly willing to renounce the fiercer
      joys of life, the joys of acquisition, of conquest, of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better come home with me, Chickabiddy,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;that father
      of yours doesn't appreciate you. He's too busy getting rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chickabiddy,&rdquo; was his name for little Sarah. Half of the name stuck to
      her, and when she was older we called her Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would gaze at him questioningly, her eyes like blue flower cups, a
      strange little mixture of solemnity and bubbling mirth, of shyness and
      impulsiveness. She had fat legs that creased above the tops of the absurd
      little boots that looked to be too tight; sometimes she rolled and tumbled
      in an ecstasy of abandon, and again she would sit motionless, as though
      absorbed in dreams. Her hair was like corn silk in the sun, twisting up
      into soft curls after her bath, when she sat rosily presiding over her
      supper table.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I look back over her early infancy, I realize that I loved her,
      although it is impossible for me to say how much of this love is
      retrospective. Why I was not mad about her every hour of the day is a
      puzzle to me now. Why, indeed, was I not mad about all three of them?
      There were moments when I held and kissed them, when something within me
      melted: moments when I was away from them, and thought of them. But these
      moments did not last. The something within me hardened again, I became
      indifferent, my family was wiped out of my consciousness as though it had
      never existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Matthew, for instance, the oldest. When he arrived, he was to
      Maude a never-ending miracle, she would have his crib brought into her
      room, and I would find her leaning over the bedside, gazing at him with a
      rapt expression beyond my comprehension. To me he was just a brick-red
      morsel of humanity, all folds and wrinkles, and not at all remarkable in
      any way. Maude used to annoy me by getting out of bed in the middle of the
      night when he cried, and at such times I was apt to wonder at the odd
      trick the life-force had played me, and ask myself why I got married at
      all. It was a queer method of carrying on the race. Later on, I began to
      take a cursory interest in him, to watch for signs in him of certain
      characteristics of my own youth which, in the philosophy of my manhood, I
      had come to regard as defects. And it disturbed me somewhat to see these
      signs appear. I wished him to be what I had become by force of will&mdash;a
      fighter. But he was a sensitive child, anxious for approval; not robust,
      though spiritual rather than delicate; even in comparative infancy he
      cared more for books than toys, and his greatest joy was in being read to.
      In spite of these traits&mdash;perhaps because of them&mdash;there was a
      sympathy between us. From the time that he could talk the child seemed to
      understand me. Occasionally I surprised him gazing at me with a certain
      wistful look that comes back to me as I write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreton, Tom used to call Alexander the Great because he was a fighter
      from the cradle, beating his elder brother, too considerate to strike
      back, and likewise&mdash;when opportunity offered&mdash;his sister; and
      appropriating their toys. A self-sufficient, doughty young man, with the
      round head that withstands many blows, taking by nature to competition and
      buccaneering in general. I did not love him half so much as I did Matthew&mdash;if
      such intermittent emotions as mine may be called love. It was a standing
      joke of mine&mdash;which Maude strongly resented&mdash;that Moreton
      resembled Cousin George of Elkington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imbued with the highest ambition of my time, I had set my barque on a
      great circle, and almost before I realized it the barque was burdened with
      a wife and family and the steering had insensibly become more difficult;
      for Maude cared nothing about the destination, and when I took any hand
      off the wheel our ship showed a tendency to make for a quiet harbour. Thus
      the social initiative, which I believed should have been the woman's, was
      thrust back on me. It was almost incredible, yet indisputable, in a day
      when most American women were credited with a craving for social ambition
      that I, of all men, should have married a wife in whom the craving was
      wholly absent! She might have had what other women would have given their
      souls for. There were many reasons why I wished her to take what I deemed
      her proper place in the community as my wife&mdash;not that I cared for
      what is called society in the narrow sense; with me, it was a logical part
      of a broader scheme of life; an auxiliary rather than an essential, but a
      needful auxiliary; a means of dignifying and adorning the position I was
      taking. Not only that, but I felt the need of intercourse&mdash;of
      intercourse of a lighter and more convivial nature with men and women who
      saw life as I saw it. In the evenings when we did not go out into that
      world our city afforded ennui took possession of me: I had never learned
      to care for books, I had no resources outside of my profession, and when I
      was not working on some legal problem I dawdled over the newspapers and
      went to bed. I don't mean to imply that our existence, outside of our
      continued intimacy with the Peterses and the Blackwoods, was socially
      isolated. We gave little dinners that Maude carried out with skill and
      taste; but it was I who suggested them; we went out to other dinners,
      sometimes to Nancy's&mdash;though we saw less and less of her&mdash;sometimes
      to other houses. But Maude had given evidence of domestic tastes and a
      disinclination for gaiety that those who entertained more were not slow to
      sense. I should have liked to take a larger house, but I felt the futility
      of suggesting it; the children were still small, and she was occupied with
      them. Meanwhile I beheld, and at times with considerable irritation, the
      social world changing, growing larger and more significant, a more
      important function of that higher phase of American existence the new
      century seemed definitely to have initiated. A segregative process was
      away to which Maude was wholly indifferent. Our city was throwing off its
      social conservatism; wealth (which implied ability and superiority) was
      playing a greater part, entertainments were more luxurious, lines more
      strictly drawn. We had an elaborate country club for those who could
      afford expensive amusements. Much of this transformation had been due to
      the initiative and leadership of Nancy Durrett....
    </p>
    <p>
      Great and sudden wealth, however, if combined with obscure antecedents and
      questionable qualifications, was still looked upon askance. In spite of
      the fact that Adolf Scherer had &ldquo;put us on the map,&rdquo; the family of the
      great iron-master still remained outside of the social pale. He himself
      might have entered had it not been for his wife, who was supposed to be
      &ldquo;queer,&rdquo; who remained at home in her house opposite Gallatin Park and made
      little German cakes,&mdash;a huge house which an unknown architect had
      taken unusual pains to make pretentious and hideous, for it was Rhenish,
      Moorish and Victorian by turns. Its geometric grounds matched those of the
      park, itself a monument to bad taste in landscape. The neighbourhood was
      highly respectable, and inhabited by families of German extraction. There
      were two flaxen-haired daughters who had just graduated from an expensive
      boarding-school in New York, where they had received the polish needful
      for future careers. But the careers were not forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was thrown constantly with Adolf Scherer; I had earned his gratitude, I
      had become necessary to him. But after the great coup whereby he had
      fulfilled Mr. Watling's prophecy and become the chief factor in our
      business world he began to show signs of discontent, of an irritability
      that seemed foreign to his character, and that puzzled me. One day,
      however, I stumbled upon the cause of this fermentation, to wonder that I
      had not discovered it before. In many ways Adolf Scherer was a child. We
      were sitting in the Boyne Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money&mdash;yes!&rdquo; he exclaimed, apropos of some demand made upon him by a
      charitable society. &ldquo;They come to me for my money&mdash;there is always
      Scherer, they say. He will make up the deficit in the hospitals. But what
      is it they do for me? Nothing. Do they invite me to their houses, to their
      parties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was what he wanted, then,&mdash;social recognition. I said nothing,
      but I saw my opportunity: I had the clew, now, to a certain attitude he
      had adopted of late toward me, an attitude of reproach; as though, in
      return for his many favours to me, there were something I had left undone.
      And when I went home I asked Maude to call on Mrs. Scherer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Mrs. Scherer!&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I want you to invite them to dinner.&rdquo; The proposal seemed to take
      away her breath. &ldquo;I owe her husband a great deal, and I think he feels
      hurt that the wives of the men he knows down town haven't taken up his
      family.&rdquo; I felt that it would not be wise, with Maude, to announce my
      rather amazing discovery of the iron-master's social ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Hugh, they must be very happy, they have their friends. And after
      all this time wouldn't it seem like an intrusion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I'm sure it would please him, and them. You
      know how kind he's been to us, how he sent us East in his private car last
      year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'll go if you wish it, if you're sure they feel that way.&rdquo; She
      did make the call, that very week, and somewhat to my surprise reported
      that she liked Mrs. Scherer and the daughters: Maude's likes and dislikes,
      needless to say, were not governed by matters of policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right, Hugh,&rdquo; she informed me, almost with enthusiasm, &ldquo;they did
      seem lonely. And they were so glad to see me, it was rather pathetic. Mr.
      Scherer, it seems, had talked to them a great deal about you. They wanted
      to know why I hadn't come before. That was rather embarrassing.
      Fortunately they didn't give me time to talk, I never heard people talk as
      they do. They all kissed me when I went away, and came down the steps with
      me. And Mrs. Scherer went into the conservatory and picked a huge bouquet.
      There it is,&rdquo; she said, laughingly, pointing to several vases. &ldquo;I
      separated the colours as well as I could when I got home. We had coffee,
      and the most delicious German cakes in the Turkish room, or the Moorish
      room, whichever it is. I'm sure I shan't be able to eat anything more for
      days. When do you wish to have them for dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we ought to have time to get the right people to meet
      them. We'll ask Nancy and Ham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maude opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy! Do you think Nancy would like them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to give her a chance, anyway,&rdquo; I replied....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, in some ways, a memorable dinner. I don't know what I expected in
      Mrs. Scherer&mdash;from Maude's description a benevolent and somewhat
      stupid, blue-eyed German woman, of peasant extraction. There could be no
      doubt about the peasant extraction, but when she hobbled into our little
      parlour with the aid of a stout, gold-headed cane she dominated it. Her
      very lameness added to a distinction that evinced itself in a dozen ways.
      Her nose was hooked, her colour high,&mdash;despite the years in
      Steelville,&mdash;her peculiar costume heightened the effect of her
      personality; her fire-lit black eyes bespoke a spirit accustomed to rule,
      and instead of being an aspirant for social honours, she seemed to confer
      them. Conversation ceased at her entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry we are late, my dear,&rdquo; she said, as she greeted Maude
      affectionately, &ldquo;but we have far to come. And this is your husband!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, as I was introduced. She scrutinized me. &ldquo;I have heard
      something of you, Mr. Paret. You are smart. Shall I tell you the smartest
      thing you ever did?&rdquo; She patted Maude's shoulder. &ldquo;When you married your
      wife&mdash;that was it. I have fallen in love with her. If you do not know
      it, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next, Nancy was introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are Mrs. Hambleton Durrett?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy acknowledged her identity with a smile, but the next remark was a
      bombshell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The leader of society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; exclaimed Nancy, &ldquo;I have been accused of many terrible things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their glances met. Nancy's was amused, baffling, like a spark in amber.
      Each, in its way, was redoubtable. A greater contrast between two women
      could scarcely have been imagined. It was well said (and not snobbishly)
      that generations had been required to make Nancy's figure: she wore a
      dress of blue sheen, the light playing on its ripples; and as she stood,
      apparently wholly at ease, looking down at the wife of Adolf Scherer, she
      reminded me of an expert swordsman who, with remarkable skill, was keeping
      a too pressing and determined aspirant at arm's length. I was keenly aware
      that Maude did not possess this gift, and I realized for the first time
      something of the similarity between Nancy's career and my own. She, too,
      in her feminine sphere, exercised, and subtly, a power in which human
      passions were deeply involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Nancy Durrett symbolized aristocracy, established order and prestige,
      what did Mrs. Scherer represent? Not democracy, mob rule&mdash;certainly.
      The stocky German peasant woman with her tightly drawn hair and heavy
      jewels seemed grotesquely to embody something that ultimately would have
      its way, a lusty and terrible force in the interests of which my own
      services were enlisted; to which the old American element in business and
      industry, the male counterpart of Nancy Willett, had already succumbed.
      And now it was about to storm the feminine fastnesses! I beheld a woman
      who had come to this country with a shawl aver her head transformed into a
      new species of duchess, sure of herself, scorning the delicate euphemisms
      in which Fancy's kind were wont to refer to asocial realm, that was no
      less real because its boundaries had not definitely been defined. She held
      her stick firmly, and gave Nancy an indomitable look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to meet my daughters. Gretchen, Anna, come here and be
      introduced to Mrs. Durrett.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not without curiosity I watched these of the second generation as
      they made their bows, noted the differentiation in the type for which an
      American environment and a &ldquo;finishing school&rdquo; had been responsible.
      Gretchen and Anna had learned&mdash;in crises, such as the present&mdash;to
      restrain the superabundant vitality they had inherited. If their
      cheekbones were a little too high, their Delft blue eyes a little too
      small, their colour was of the proverbial rose-leaves and cream. Gene
      Hollister's difficulty was to know which to marry. They were nice girls,&mdash;of
      that there could be no doubt; there was no false modesty in their attitude
      toward &ldquo;society&rdquo;; nor did they pretend&mdash;as so many silly people did,
      that they were not attempting to get anywhere in particular, that it was
      less desirable to be in the centre than on the dubious outer walks. They,
      too, were so glad to meet Mrs. Durrett.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy's eyes twinkled as they passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see what I have let you in for?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Hugh,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;sooner or later we should have had to face
      them anyhow. I have recognized that for some time. With their money, and
      Mr. Scherer's prestige, and the will of that lady with the stick, in a few
      years we should have had nothing to say. Why, she's a female Napoleon.
      Hilda's the man of the family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that, Nancy invariably referred to Mrs. Scherer as Hilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. Scherer was a surprise to us, her husband was a still greater one;
      and I had difficulty in recognizing the Adolf Scherer who came to our
      dinner party as the personage of the business world before whom lesser men
      were wont to cringe. He seemed rather mysteriously to have shed that
      personality; become an awkward, ingratiating, rather too exuberant,
      ordinary man with a marked German accent. From time to time I found myself
      speculating uneasily on this phenomenon as I glanced down the table at his
      great torso, white waist-coated for the occasion. He was plainly &ldquo;making
      up&rdquo; to Nancy, and to Mrs. Ogilvy, who sat opposite him. On the whole, the
      atmosphere of our entertainment was rather electric. &ldquo;Hilda&rdquo; was chiefly
      responsible for this; her frankness was of the breath-taking kind. Far
      from attempting to hide or ignore the struggle by which she and her
      husband had attained their present position, she referred with the utmost
      naivete to incidents in her career, while the whole table paused to
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before we had a carriage, yes, it was hard for me to get about. I had to
      be helped by the conductors into the streetcars. I broke my hip when we
      lived in Steelville, and the doctor was a numbskull. He should be put in
      prison, is what I tell Adolf. I was standing on a clothes-horse, when it
      fell. I had much washing to do in those days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;can nothing be done, Mrs. Scherer?&rdquo; asked Leonard Dickinson,
      sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For an old woman? I am fifty-five. I have had many doctors. I would put
      them all in prison. How much was it you paid Dr. Stickney, in New York,
      Adolf? Five thousand dollars? And he did nothing&mdash;nothing. I'd rather
      be poor again, and work. But it is well to make the best of it.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grandfather was a fine man, Mr. Durrett,&rdquo; she informed Hambleton.
      &ldquo;It is a pity for you, I think, that you do not have to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ham, who sat on her other side, was amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather did enough work for both of us,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had been your grandfather, I would have started you in puddling,&rdquo;
       she observed, as she eyed with disapproval the filling of his third glass
      of champagne. &ldquo;I think there is too much gay life, too much games for rich
      young men nowadays. You will forgive me for saying what I think to young
      men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll forgive you for not being my grandfather, at any rate,&rdquo; replied Ham,
      with unaccustomed wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him with grim humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is bad for you I am not,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no gainsaying her. What can be done with a lady who will not
      recognize that morality is not discussed, and that personalities are
      tabooed save between intimates. Hilda was a personage as well as a Tartar.
      Laws, conventions, usages&mdash;to all these she would conform when it
      pleased her. She would have made an admirable inquisitorial judge, and
      quite as admirable a sick nurse. A rare criminal lawyer, likewise, was
      wasted in her. She was one of those individuals, I perceived, whose
      loyalties dominate them; and who, in behalf of those loyalties, carry
      chips on their shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long time that I have been wanting to meet you,&rdquo; she informed me.
      &ldquo;You are smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled, yet I was inclined to resent her use of the word, though I was
      by no means sure of the shade of meaning she meant to put into it. I had,
      indeed, an uneasy sense of the scantiness of my fund of humour to meet and
      turn such a situation; for I was experiencing, now, with her, the same
      queer feeling I had known in my youth in the presence of Cousin Robert
      Breck&mdash;the suspicion that this extraordinary person saw through me.
      It was as though she held up a mirror and compelled me to look at my soul
      features. I tried to assure myself that the mirror was distorted. I lost,
      nevertheless, the sureness of touch that comes from the conviction of
      being all of a piece. She contrived to resolve me again into conflicting
      elements. I was, for the moment, no longer the self-confident and
      triumphant young attorney accustomed to carry all before him, to command
      respect and admiration, but a complicated being whose unity had suddenly
      been split. I glanced around the table at Ogilvy, at Dickinson, at Ralph
      Hambleton. These men were functioning truly. But was I? If I were not,
      might not this be the reason for the lack of synthesis&mdash;of which I
      was abruptly though vaguely aware between my professional life, my
      domestic relationships, and my relationships with friends. The loyalty of
      the woman beside me struck me forcibly as a supreme trait. Where she had
      given, she did not withdraw. She had conferred it instantly on Maude. Did
      I feel that loyalty towards a single human being? towards Maude herself&mdash;my
      wife? or even towards Nancy? I pulled myself together, and resolved to
      give her credit for using the word &ldquo;smart&rdquo; in its unobjectionable sense.
      After all; Dickens had so used it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lawyer must needs know something of what he is about, Mrs. Scherer, if
      he is to be employed by such a man as your husband,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her black eyes snapped with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I suppose that is so,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;I knew he was a great man when I
      married him, and that was before Mr. Nathaniel Durrett found it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely you did not think, in those days, that he would be as big as
      he has become? That he would not only be president of the Boyne Iron
      Works, but of a Boyne Iron Works that has exceeded Mr. Durrett's wildest
      dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what I told him when he married me? I said, 'Adolf, it is a
      pity you are born in Germany.' And when he asked me why, I told him that
      some day he might have been President of the United States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that won't be a great deprivation to him,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;Mr. Scherer
      can do what he wants, and the President cannot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adolf always does as he wants,&rdquo; she declared, gazing at him as he sat
      beside the brilliant wife of the grandson of the man whose red-shirted
      foreman he had been. &ldquo;He does what he wants, and gets what he wants. He is
      getting what he wants now,&rdquo; she added, with such obvious meaning that I
      found no words to reply. &ldquo;She is pretty, that Mrs. Durrett, and clever,&mdash;is
      it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I agreed. A new and indescribable note had come into Mrs. Scherer's voice,
      and I realized that she, too, was aware of that flaw in the redoubtable
      Mr. Scherer which none of his associates had guessed. It would have been
      strange if she had not discovered it. &ldquo;She is beautiful, yes,&rdquo; the lady
      continued critically, &ldquo;but she is not to compare with your wife. She has
      not the heart,&mdash;it is so with all your people of society. For them it
      is not what you are, but what you have done, and what you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The banality of this observation was mitigated by the feeling she threw
      into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you misjudge Mrs. Durrett,&rdquo; I said, incautiously. &ldquo;She has never
      before had the opportunity of meeting Mr. Scherer of appreciating him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Durrett is an old friend of yours?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was brought up with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and turned her penetrating glance upon me. I was
      startled. Could it be that she had discerned and interpreted those
      renascent feelings even then stirring within me, and of which I myself was
      as yet scarcely conscious? At this moment, fortunately for me, the women
      rose; the men remained to smoke; and Scherer, as they discussed matters of
      finance, became himself again. I joined in the conversation, but I was
      thinking of those instants when in flashes of understanding my eyes had
      met Nancy's; instants in which I was lifted out of my humdrum, deadly
      serious self and was able to look down objectively upon the life I led,
      the life we all led&mdash;and Nancy herself; to see with her the comic
      irony of it all. Nancy had the power to give me this exquisite sense of
      detachment that must sustain her. And was it not just this sustenance she
      could give that I needed? For want of it I was hardening, crystallizing,
      growing blind to the joy and variety of existence. Nancy could have saved
      me; she brought it home to me that I needed salvation.... I was struck by
      another thought; in spite of our separation, in spite of her marriage and
      mine, she was still nearer to me&mdash;far nearer&mdash;than any other
      being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, I sought her out. She looked up at me amusedly from the window-seat
      in our living-room, where she had been talking to the Scherer girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how did you get along with Hilda?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I thought I saw you
      struggling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's somewhat disconcerting,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I felt as if she were turning me
      inside out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hilda's a discovery&mdash;a genius. I'm going to have them to dinner
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Adolf?&rdquo; I inquired. &ldquo;I believe she thought you were preparing to run
      away with him. You seemed to have him hypnotized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid your great man won't be able to stand&mdash;elevation,&rdquo; she
      declared. &ldquo;He'll have vertigo. He's even got it now, at this little
      height, and when he builds his palace on Grant Avenue, and later moves to
      New York, I'm afraid he'll wobble even more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he thinking of doing all that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I merely predict New York&mdash;it's inevitable,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Grant
      Avenue, yes; he wants me to help him choose a lot. He gave me ten thousand
      dollars for our Orphans' Home, but on the whole I think I prefer Hilda
      even if she doesn't approve of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy rose. The Scherers were going. While Mr. Scherer pressed my hand in
      a manner that convinced me of his gratitude, Hilda was bidding an
      affectionate good night to Maude. A few moments later she bore her husband
      and daughters away, and we heard the tap-tap of her cane on the walk
      outside....
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The remembrance of that dinner when with my connivance the Scherers made
      their social debut is associated in my mind with the coming of the fulness
      of that era, mad and brief, when gold rained down like manna from our
      sooty skies. Even the church was prosperous; the Rev. Carey Heddon, our
      new minister, was well abreast of the times, typical of the new and
      efficient Christianity that has finally buried the hatchet with
      enlightened self-interest. He looked like a young and prosperous man of
      business, and indeed he was one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fame of our city spread even across the Atlantic, reaching obscure
      hamlets in Europe, where villagers gathered up their lares and penates,
      mortgaged their homes, and bought steamship tickets from philanthropists,&mdash;philanthropists
      in diamonds. Our Huns began to arrive, their Attilas unrecognized among
      them: to drive our honest Americans and Irish and Germans out of the mills
      by &ldquo;lowering the standard of living.&rdquo; Still&mdash;according to the learned
      economists in our universities, enlightened self-interest triumphed. Had
      not the honest Americans and Germans become foremen and even presidents of
      corporations? What greater vindication for their philosophy could be
      desired?
    </p>
    <p>
      The very aspect of the city changed like magic. New buildings sprang high
      in the air; the Reliance Trust (Mr. Grierson's), the Scherer Building, the
      Hambleton Building; a stew hotel, the Ashuela, took proper care of our
      visitors from the East,&mdash;a massive, grey stone, thousand-awninged
      affair on Boyne Street, with a grill where it became the fashion to go for
      supper after the play, and a head waiter who knew in a few weeks everyone
      worth knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return for a moment to the Huns. Maude had expressed a desire to see a
      mill, and we went, one afternoon, in Mr. Scherer's carriage to Steelville,
      with Mr. Scherer himself,&mdash;a bewildering, educative, almost
      terrifying experience amidst fumes and flames, gigantic forces and titanic
      weights. It seemed a marvel that we escaped being crushed or burned alive
      in those huge steel buildings reverberating with sound. They appeared a
      very bedlam of chaos, instead of the triumph of order, organization and
      human skill. Mr. Scherer was very proud of it all, and ours was a sort of
      triumphal procession, accompanied by superintendents, managers and other
      factotums. I thought of my childhood image of Shadrach, Meshach and
      Abednego, and our progress through the flames seemed no less remarkable
      and miraculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maude, with alarm in her eyes, kept very close to me, as I supplemented
      the explanations they gave her. I had been there many times before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hugh,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you seem to know a lot about it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scherer laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's had to talk about it once or twice in court&mdash;eh, Hugh? You
      didn't realize how clever your husband was did you, Mrs. Paret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is so&mdash;complicated,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It is overwhelming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I found out how much trouble he had taken to learn about my
      business,&rdquo; added Mr. Scherer, &ldquo;there was only one thing to do. Make him my
      lawyer. Hugh, you have the floor, and explain the open-hearth process.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had almost forgotten the Huns. I saw Maude gazing at them with a new
      kind of terror. And when we sat at home that evening they still haunted
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow, I can't bear to think about them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'm sure we'll
      have to pay for it, some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pay for what?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For making them work that way. And twelve hours! It can't be right, while
      we have so much, and are so comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be foolish,&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;They're used to it. They think
      themselves lucky to get the work&mdash;and they are. Besides, you give
      them credit for a sensitiveness that they don't possess. They wouldn't
      know what to do with such a house as this if they had it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never realized before that our happiness and comfort were built on such
      foundations;&rdquo; she said, ignoring my remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have seen your father's operatives, in Elkington, many times a
      week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I was too young to think about such things,&rdquo; she reflected.
      &ldquo;Besides, I used to be sorry for them, sometimes. But these men at the
      steel mills&mdash;I can't tell you what I feel about them. The sight of
      their great bodies and their red, sullen faces brought home to me the
      cruelty of life. Did you notice how some of them stared at us, as though
      they were but half awake in the heat, with that glow on their faces? It
      made me afraid&mdash;afraid that they'll wake up some day, and then they
      will be terrible. I thought of the children. It seems not only wicked, but
      mad to bring ignorant foreigners over here and make them slaves like that,
      and so many of them are hurt and maimed. I can't forget them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're talking Socialism,&rdquo; I said crossly, wondering whether Lucia had
      taken it up as her latest fad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I'm not,&rdquo; said Maude, &ldquo;I don't know what Socialism is. I'm
      talking about something that anyone who is not dazzled by all this luxury
      we are living in might be able to see, about something which, when it
      comes, we shan't be able to help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I ridiculed this. The prophecy itself did not disturb me half as much as
      the fact that she had made it, as this new evidence that she was beginning
      to think for herself, and along lines so different from my own
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it lasted, before novelists, playwrights, professors and ministers
      of the Gospel abandoned their proper sphere to destroy it, that Golden Age
      was heaven; the New Jerusalem&mdash;in which we had ceased to believe&mdash;would
      have been in the nature of an anticlimax to any of our archangels of
      finance who might have attained it. The streets of our own city turned out
      to be gold; gold likewise the acres of unused, scrubby land on our
      outskirts, as the incident of the Riverside Franchise&mdash;which I am
      about to relate&mdash;amply proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      That scheme originated in the alert mind of Mr. Frederick Grierson, and in
      spite of the fact that it has since become notorious in the eyes of a
      virtue-stricken public, it was entered into with all innocence at the
      time: most of the men who were present at the &ldquo;magnate's&rdquo; table at the
      Boyne Club the day Mr. Grierson broached it will vouch for this. He
      casually asked Mr. Dickinson if he had ever noticed a tract lying on the
      river about two miles beyond the Heights, opposite what used to be in the
      old days a road house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This city is growing so fast, Leonard,&rdquo; said Grierson, lighting a special
      cigar the Club kept for him, &ldquo;that it might pay a few of us to get
      together and buy that tract, have the city put in streets and sewers and
      sell it in building lots. I think I can get most of it at less than three
      hundred dollars an acre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dickinson was interested. So were Mr. Ogilvy and Ralph Hambleton, and
      Mr. Scherer, who chanced to be there. Anything Fred Grierson had to say on
      the question of real estate was always interesting. He went on to describe
      the tract, its size and location.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all very well, Fred,&rdquo; Dickinson objected presently, &ldquo;but how are
      your prospective householders going to get out there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I was coming to,&rdquo; cried Grierson, triumphantly, &ldquo;we'll get a
      franchise, and build a street-railroad out Maplewood Avenue, an extension
      of the Park Street line. We can get the franchise for next to nothing, if
      we work it right.&rdquo; (Mr. Grierson's eye fell on me), &ldquo;and sell it out to
      the public, if you underwrite it, for two million or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you've got your nerve with you, Fred, as usual,&rdquo; said Dickinson.
      But he rolled his cigar in his mouth, an indication, to those who knew him
      well, that he was considering the matter. When Leonard Dickinson didn't
      say &ldquo;no&rdquo; at once, there was hope. &ldquo;What do you think the property holders
      on Maplewood Avenue would say? Wasn't it understood, when that avenue was
      laid out, that it was to form part of the system of boulevards?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does it make what they say?&rdquo; Ralph interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dickinson smiled. He, too, had an exaggerated respect for Ralph. We all
      thought the proposal daring, but in no way amazing; the public existed to
      be sold things to, and what did it matter if the Maplewood residents, as
      Ralph said; and the City Improvement League protested?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perry Blackwood was the Secretary of the City Improvement League, the
      object of which was to beautify the city by laying out a system of
      parkways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day some of us gathered in Dickinson's office and decided that
      Grierson should go ahead and get the options. This was done; not, of
      course, in Grierson's name. The next move, before the formation of the
      Riverside Company, was to &ldquo;see&rdquo; Mr. Judd Jason. The success or failure of
      the enterprise was in his hands. Mahomet must go to the mountain, and I
      went to Monahan's saloon, first having made an appointment. It was not the
      first time I had been there since I had made that first memorable visit,
      but I never quite got over the feeling of a neophyte before Buddha, though
      I did not go so far as to analyze the reason,&mdash;that in Mr. Jason I
      was brought face to face with the concrete embodiment of the philosophy I
      had adopted, the logical consequence of enlightened self-interest. If he
      had ever heard of it, he would have made no pretence of being anything
      else. Greatness, declares some modern philosopher, has no connection with
      virtue; it is the continued, strong and logical expression of some
      instinct; in Mr. Jason's case, the predatory instinct. And like a true
      artist, he loved his career for itself&mdash;not for what its fruits could
      buy. He might have built a palace on the Heights with the tolls he took
      from the disreputable houses of the city; he was contented with Monahan's
      saloon: nor did he seek to propitiate a possible God by endowing churches
      and hospitals with a portion of his income. Try though I might, I never
      could achieve the perfection of this man's contempt for all other
      philosophies. The very fact of my going there in secret to that dark place
      of his from out of the bright, respectable region in which I lived was in
      itself an acknowledgment of this. I thought him a thief&mdash;a necessary
      thief&mdash;and he knew it: he was indifferent to it; and it amused him, I
      think, to see clinging to me, when I entered his presence, shreds of that
      morality which those of my world who dealt with him thought so needful for
      the sake of decency.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in bed, reading newspapers, as usual. An empty coffee-cup and a
      plate were on the littered table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sit down, Paret,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What do you hear from the Senator?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat down, and gave him the news of Mr. Watling. He seemed, as usual,
      distrait, betraying no curiosity as to the object of my call, his lean,
      brown fingers playing with the newspapers on his lap. Suddenly, he flashed
      out at me one of those remarks which produced the uncanny conviction that,
      so far as affairs in the city were concerned, he was omniscient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear somebody has been getting options on that tract of land beyond the
      Heights, on the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had &ldquo;focussed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you hear that?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Grierson, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's Grierson,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you going to get your folks out there?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I've come to see you about. We want a franchise for Maplewood
      Avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maplewood Avenue!&rdquo; He lay back with his eyes closed, as though trying to
      visualize such a colossal proposal....
    </p>
    <p>
      When I left him, two hours later, the details were all arranged, down to
      Mr. Jason's consideration from Riverside Company and the &ldquo;fee&rdquo; which his
      lawyer, Mr. Bitter, was to have for &ldquo;presenting the case&rdquo; before the Board
      of Aldermen. I went back to lunch at the Boyne Club, and to receive the
      congratulations of my friends. The next week the Riverside Company was
      formed, and I made out a petition to the Board of Aldermen for a
      franchise; Mr. Bitter appeared and argued: in short, the procedure so
      familiar to modern students of political affairs was gone through. The
      Maplewood Avenue residents rose en masse, supported by the City
      Improvement League. Perry Blackwood, as soon as he heard of the petition,
      turned up at my office. By this time I was occupying Mr. Watling's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he began, as soon as the office-boy had closed the door
      behind him, &ldquo;this is going it a little too strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is?&rdquo; I asked, leaning back in my chair and surveying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This proposed Maplewood Avenue Franchise. Hugh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you and I have
      been friends a good many years, Lucia and I are devoted to Maude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've seen all along that we've been growing apart,&rdquo; he added sadly.
      &ldquo;You've got certain ideas about things which I can't share. I suppose I'm
      old fashioned. I can't trust myself to tell you what I think&mdash;what
      Tom and I think about this deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead, Perry,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up, plainly agitated, and walked to the window. Then he turned to
      me appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of it, for God's sake get out of it, before it's too late. For
      your own sake, for Maude's, for the children's. You don't realize what you
      are doing. You may not believe me, but the time will come when these
      fellows you are in with will be repudiated by the community,&mdash;their
      money won't help them. Tom and I are the best friends you have,&rdquo; he added,
      a little irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think I'm going to the dogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't take it the wrong way,&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you object to about the Maplewood franchise?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;If
      you'll look at a map of the city, you'll see that development is bound to
      come on that side. Maplewood Avenue is the natural artery, somebody will
      build a line out there, and if you'd rather have eastern capitalists&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you going to get this franchise?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Because we
      haven't a decent city charter, and a healthy public spirit, you fellows
      are buying it from a corrupt city boss, and bribing a corrupt board of
      aldermen. That's the plain language of it. And it's only fair to warn you
      that I'm going to say so, openly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sensible,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;We've got to have street railroads,&mdash;your
      family has one. We know what the aldermen are, what political conditions
      are. If you feel this way about it, the thing to do is to try to change
      them. But why blame me for getting a franchise for a company in the only
      manner in which, under present conditions, a franchise can be got? Do you
      want the city to stand still? If not, we have to provide for the new
      population.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every time you bribe these rascals for a franchise you entrench them,&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;You make it more difficult to oust them. But you mark my words, we
      shall get rid of them some day, and when that fight comes, I want to be in
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had grown very much excited; and it was as though this excitement
      suddenly revealed to me the full extent of the change that had taken place
      in him since he had left college. As he stood facing me, almost glaring at
      me through his eye-glasses, I beheld a slim, nervous, fault-finding
      doctrinaire, incapable of understanding the world as it was, lacking the
      force of his pioneer forefathers. I rather pitied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry we can't look at this thing alike, Perry,&rdquo; I told him. &ldquo;You've
      said solve pretty hard things, but I realize that you hold your point of
      view in good faith, and that you have come to me as an old friend. I hope
      it won't make any difference in our personal relations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how it can help making a difference,&rdquo; he answered slowly. His
      excitement had cooled abruptly: he seemed dazed. At this moment my private
      stenographer entered to inform me that I was being called up on the
      telephone from New York. &ldquo;Well, you have more important affairs to attend
      to, I won't bother you any more,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; I exclaimed, &ldquo;this call can wait. I'd like to talk it over with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid it wouldn't be any use, Hugh,&rdquo; he said, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      After talking with the New York client whose local interests I represented
      I sat thinking over the conversation with Perry. Considering Maude's
      intimacy with and affection for the Blackwoods, the affair was awkward,
      opening up many uncomfortable possibilities; and it was the prospect of
      discomfort that bothered me rather than regret for the probable loss of
      Perry's friendship. I still believed myself to have an affection for him:
      undoubtedly this was a sentimental remnant....
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening after dinner Tom came in alone, and I suspected that Perry
      had sent him. He was fidgety, ill at ease, and presently asked if I could
      see him a moment in my study. Maude's glance followed us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Hugh, this is pretty stiff,&rdquo; he blurted out characteristically, when
      the door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean the Riverside Franchise,&rdquo; I said. He looked up at me,
      miserably, from the chair into which he had sunk, his hands in his
      pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll forgive me for talking about it, won't you? You used to lecture me
      once in a while at Cambridge, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right&mdash;go ahead,&rdquo; I replied, trying to speak amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I've always admired you, Hugh,&mdash;I never had your ability,&rdquo;
       he began painfully, &ldquo;you've gone ahead pretty fast,&mdash;the truth is
      that Perry and I have been worried about you for some time. We've tried
      not to be too serious in showing it, but we've felt that these modern
      business methods were getting into your system without your realizing it.
      There are some things a man's friends can tell him, and it's their duty to
      tell him. Good God, haven't you got enough, Hugh,&mdash;enough success and
      enough money, without going into a thing like this Riverside scheme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was intensely annoyed, if not angry; and I hesitated a moment to calm
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tom, you don't understand my position,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I'm willing to discuss
      it with you, now that you've opened up the subject. Perry's been talking
      to you, I can see that. I think Perry's got queer ideas,&mdash;to be plain
      with you, and they're getting queerer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down again while, with what I deemed a rather exemplary patience, I
      went over the arguments in favour of my position; and as I talked, it
      clarified in my own mind. It was impossible to apply to business an
      individual code of ethics,&mdash;even to Perry's business, to Tom's
      business: the two were incompatible, and the sooner one recognized that
      the better: the whole structure of business was built up on natural, as
      opposed to ethical law. We had arrived at an era of frankness&mdash;that
      was the truth&mdash;and the sooner we faced this truth the better for our
      peace of mind. Much as we might deplore the political system that had
      grown up, we had to acknowledge, if we were consistent, that it was the
      base on which our prosperity was built. I was rather proud of having
      evolved this argument; it fortified my own peace of mind, which had been
      disturbed by Tom's attitude. I began to pity him. He had not been very
      successful in life, and with the little he earned, added to Susan's
      income, I knew that a certain ingenuity was required to make both ends
      meet. He sat listening with a troubled look. A passing phase of feeling
      clouded for a brief moment my confidence when there arose in my mind an
      unbidden memory of my youth, of my father. He, too, had mistrusted my
      ingenuity. I recalled how I had out-manoeuvred him and gone to college; I
      remembered the March day so long ago, when Tom and I had stood on the
      corner debating how to deceive him, and it was I who had suggested the
      nice distinction between a boat and a raft. Well, my father's illogical
      attitude towards boyhood nature, towards human nature, had forced me into
      that lie, just as the senseless attitude of the public to-day forced
      business into a position of hypocrisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's clever,&rdquo; he said, slowly and perplexedly, when I had
      finished. &ldquo;It's damned clever, but somehow it looks to me all wrong. I
      can't pick it to pieces.&rdquo; He got up rather heavily. &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess I
      ought to be going. Susan doesn't know where I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was exasperated. It was clear, though he did not say so, that he thought
      me dishonest. The pain in his eyes had deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you feel that way&mdash;&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God, I don't know how I feel!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You're the oldest friend I
      have, Hugh,&mdash;I can't forget that. We'll say nothing more about it.&rdquo;
       He picked up his hat and a moment later I heard the front door close
      behind him. I stood for a while stock-still, and then went into the
      living-room, where Maude was sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, where's Tom?&rdquo; she inquired, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he went home. He said Susan didn't know where he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How queer! Hugh, was there anything the matter? Is he in trouble?&rdquo; she
      asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood toying with a book-mark, reflecting. She must inevitably come to
      suspect that something had happened, and it would be as well to fortify
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; I said after a moment, &ldquo;that Perry and Tom would like to
      run modern business on the principle of a charitable institution.
      Unfortunately, it is not practical. They're upset because I have been
      retained by a syndicate whose object is to develop some land out beyond
      Maplewood Avenue. They've bought the land, and we are asking the city to
      give us a right to build a line out Maplewood Avenue, which is the obvious
      way to go. Perry says it will spoil the avenue. That's nonsense, in the
      first place. The avenue is wide, and the tracks will be in a grass plot in
      the centre. For the sake of keeping tracks off that avenue he would
      deprive people of attractive homes at a small cost, of the good air they
      can get beyond the heights; he would stunt the city's development.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does seem a little unreasonable,&rdquo; Maude admitted. &ldquo;Is that all he
      objects to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he thinks it an outrage because, in order to get the franchise, we
      have to deal with the city politicians. Well, it so happens, and always
      has happened, that politics have been controlled by leaders, whom Perry
      calls 'bosses,' and they are not particularly attractive men. You wouldn't
      care to associate with them. My father once refused to be mayor of the
      city for this reason. But they are necessities. If the people didn't want
      them, they'd take enough interest in elections to throw them out. But
      since the people do want them, and they are there, every time a new
      street-car line or something of that sort needs to be built they have to
      be consulted, because, without their influence nothing could be done. On
      the other hand, these politicians cannot afford to ignore men of local
      importance like Leonard Dickinson and Adolf Scherer and Miller Gorse who
      represent financial substance and' responsibility. If a new
      street-railroad is to be built, these are the logical ones to build it.
      You have just the same situation in Elkington, on a smaller scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your family, the Hutchinses, own the mills and the street-railroads, and
      any new enterprise that presents itself is done with their money, because
      they are reliable and sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't pleasant to think that there are such people as the politicians,
      is it?&rdquo; said Maude, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unquestionably not,&rdquo; I agreed. &ldquo;It isn't pleasant to think of some other
      crude forces in the world. But they exist, and they have to be dealt with.
      Suppose the United States should refuse to trade with Russia because, from
      our republican point of view, we regarded her government as tyrannical and
      oppressive? or to cooperate with England in some undertaking for the
      world's benefit because we contended that she ruled India with an iron
      hand? In such a case, our President and Senate would be scoundrels for
      making and ratifying a treaty. Yet here are Perry and Tom, and no doubt
      Susan and Lucia, accusing me, a lifetime friend, of dishonesty because I
      happen to be counsel for a syndicate that wishes to build a
      street-railroad for the convenience of the people of the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not of dishonesty!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I can't&mdash;I won't believe
      they would do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty near it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;If I listened to them, I should have to give up
      the law altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; she answered in a low voice, &ldquo;sometimes I wish you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have expected that you would take their point of view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As I was turning away she got up quickly and put her hand on my shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, please don't say such things&mdash;you've no right to say them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see,&rdquo; she continued pleadingly, &ldquo;don't you see that we are
      growing apart? That's the only reason I said what I did. It isn't that I
      don't trust you, that I don't want you to have your work, that I demand
      all of you. I know a woman can't ask that,&mdash;can't have it. But if you
      would only give me&mdash;give the children just a little, if I could feel
      that we meant something to you and that this other wasn't gradually
      becoming everything, wasn't absorbing you more and more, killing the best
      part of you. It's poisoning our marriage, it's poisoning all your
      relationships.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that appeal the real Maude, the Maude of the early days of our marriage
      flashed forth again so vividly that I was taken aback. I understood that
      she had had herself under control, had worn a mask&mdash;a mask I had
      forced on her; and the revelation of the continued existence of that other
      Maude was profoundly disturbing. Was it true, as she said, that my
      absorption in the great game of modern business, in the modern American
      philosophy it implied was poisoning my marriage? or was it that my
      marriage had failed to satisfy and absorb me? I was touched&mdash;but
      sentimentally touched: I felt that this was a situation that ought to
      touch me; I didn't wish to face it, as usual: I couldn't acknowledge to
      myself that anything was really wrong... I patted her on the shoulder, I
      bent over and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man in my position can't altogether choose just how busy he will be,&rdquo; I
      said smiling. &ldquo;Matters are thrust upon me which I have to accept, and I
      can't help thinking about some of them when I come home. But we'll go off
      for a real vacation soon, Maude, to Europe&mdash;and take the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope so,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time on, as may be supposed, our intercourse with both the
      Blackwoods began to grow less frequent, although Maude continued to see a
      great deal of Lucia; and when we did dine in their company, or they with
      us, it was quite noticeable that their former raillery was suppressed.
      Even Tom had ceased to refer to me as the young Napoleon of the Law: he
      clung to me, but he too kept silent on the subject of business. Maude of
      course must have noticed this, must have sensed the change of atmosphere,
      have known that the Blackwoods, at least, were maintaining appearances for
      her sake. She did not speak to me of the change, nor I to her; but when I
      thought of her silence, it was to suspect that she was weighing the
      question which had led up to the difference between Perry and me, and I
      had a suspicion that the fact that I was her husband would not affect her
      ultimate decision. This faculty of hers of thinking things out instead of
      accepting my views and decisions was, as the saying goes, getting a little
      &ldquo;on my nerves&rdquo;: that she of all women should have developed it was a
      recurring and unpleasant surprise. I began at times to pity myself a
      little, to feel the need of sympathetic companionship&mdash;feminine
      companionship....
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not go into the details of the procurement of what became known as
      the Riverside Franchise. In spite of the Maplewood residents, of the City
      Improvement League and individual protests, we obtained it with absurd
      ease. Indeed Perry Blackwood himself appeared before the Public Utilities
      Committee of the Board of Aldermen, and was listened to with deference and
      gravity while he discoursed on the defacement of a beautiful boulevard to
      satisfy the greed of certain private individuals. Mr. Otto Bitter and
      myself, who appeared for the petitioners, had a similar reception. That
      struggle was a tempest in a tea-pot. The reformer raged, but he was feeble
      in those days, and the great public believed what it read in the
      respectable newspapers. In Mr. Judah B. Tallant's newspaper, for instance,
      the Morning Era, there were semi-playful editorials about
      &ldquo;obstructionists.&rdquo; Mr. Perry Blackwood was a well-meaning, able gentleman
      of an old family, etc., but with a sentiment for horse-cars. The Era
      published also the resolutions which (with interesting spontaneity!) had
      been passed by our Board of Trade and Chamber of Commerce and other
      influential bodies in favour of the franchise; the idea&mdash;unknown to
      the public&mdash;of Mr. Hugh Paret, who wrote drafts of the resolutions
      and suggested privately to Mr. Leonard Dickinson that a little enthusiasm
      from these organizations might be helpful. Mr. Dickinson accepted the
      suggestion eagerly, wondering why he hadn't thought of it himself. The
      resolutions carried some weight with a public that did not know its right
      hand from its left.
    </p>
    <p>
      After fitting deliberation, one evening in February the Board of Aldermen
      met and granted the franchise. Not unanimously, oh, no! Mr. Jason was not
      so simple as that! No further visits to Monahan's saloon on my part, in
      this connection were necessary; but Mr. Otto Bitter met me one day in the
      hotel with a significant message from the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all fixed,&rdquo; he informed me. &ldquo;Murphy and Scott and Ottheimer and
      Grady and Loth are the decoys. You understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I gather your meaning,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bitter smiled by pulling down one corner of a crooked mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll vote against it on principle, you know,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We get a
      little something from the Maple Avenue residents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I've forgotten what the Riverside Franchise cost. The sum was paid in a
      lump sum to Mr. Bitter as his &ldquo;fee,&rdquo;&mdash;so, to their chagrin, a grand
      jury discovered in later years, when they were barking around Mr. Jason's
      hole with an eager district attorney snapping his whip over them. I
      remember the cartoon. The municipal geese were gone, but it was impossible
      to prove that this particular fox had used his enlightened reason in their
      procurement. Mr. Bitter was a legally authorized fox, and could take fees.
      How Mr. Jason was to be rewarded by the land company's left-hand, unknown,
      to the land company's right hand, became a problem worthy of a genius. The
      genius was found, but modesty forbids me to mention his name, and the
      problem was solved, to wit: the land company bought a piece of downtown
      property from&mdash;Mr. Ryerson, who was Mr. Grierson's real estate man
      and the agent for the land company, for a consideration of thirty thousand
      dollars. An unconfirmed rumour had it that Mr. Ryerson turned over the
      thirty thousand to Mr. Jason. Then the Riverside Company issued a secret
      deed of the same property back to Mr. Ryerson, and this deed was not
      recorded until some years later.

      Such are the elaborate transactions progress and prosperity demand. Nature
      is the great teacher, and we know that her ways are at times complicated
      and clumsy. Likewise, under the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; laws of economics, new
      enterprises are not born without travail, without the aid of legal
      physicians well versed in financial obstetrics. One hundred and fifty to
      two hundred thousand, let us say, for the right to build tracks on
      Maplewood Avenue, and we sold nearly two million dollars worth of the
      securities back to the public whose aldermen had sold us the franchise. Is
      there a man so dead as not to feel a thrill at this achievement? And let
      no one who declares that literary talent and imagination are nonexistent
      in America pronounce final judgment until he reads that prospectus, in
      which was combined the best of realism and symbolism, for the labours of
      Alonzo Cheyne were not to be wasted, after all. Mr. Dickinson, who was a
      director in the Maplewood line, got a handsome underwriting percentage,
      and Mr. Berringer, also a director, on the bonds and preferred stock he
      sold. Mr. Paret, who entered both companies on the ground floor, likewise
      got fees. Everybody was satisfied except the trouble makers, who were
      ignored. In short, the episode of the Riverside Franchise is a triumphant
      proof of the contention that business men are the best fitted to conduct
      the politics of their country.

      We had learned to pursue our happiness in packs, we knew that the Happy
      Hunting-Grounds are here and now, while the Reverend Carey Heddon
      continued to assure the maimed, the halt and the blind that their kingdom
      was not of this world, that their time was coming later. Could there have
      been a more idyl arrangement! Everybody should have been satisfied, but
      everybody was not. Otherwise these pages would never have been written.

      XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the name of our city grew to be more and more a byword for sudden and
      fabulous wealth, not only were the Huns and the Slavs, the Czechs and the
      Greeks drawn to us, but it became the fashion for distinguished Englishmen
      and Frenchmen and sometimes Germans and Italians to pay us a visit when
      they made the grand tour of America. They had been told that they must not
      miss us; scarcely a week went by in our community&mdash;so it was said&mdash;in
      which a full-fledged millionaire was not turned out. Our visitors did not
      always remain a week,&mdash;since their rapid journeyings from the
      Atlantic to the Pacific, from Canada to the Gulf rarely occupied more than
      four,&mdash;but in the books embodying their mature comments on the
      manners, customs and crudities of American civilization no less than a
      chapter was usually devoted to us; and most of the adjectives in their
      various languages were exhausted in the attempt to prove how symptomatic
      we were of the ambitions and ideals of the Republic. The fact that many of
      these gentlemen&mdash;literary and otherwise&mdash;returned to their own
      shores better fed and with larger balances in the banks than when they
      departed is neither here nor there. Egyptians are proverbially created to
      be spoiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wiser and more fortunate of these travellers and students of life
      brought letters to Mr. and Mrs. Hambleton Durrett. That household was
      symptomatic&mdash;if they liked&mdash;of the new order of things; and it
      was rare indeed when both members of it were at home to entertain them. If
      Mr. Durrett were in the city, and they did not happen to be Britons with
      sporting proclivities, they simply were not entertained: when Mrs. Durrett
      received them dinners were given in their honour on the Durrett gold
      plate, and they spent cosey and delightful hours conversing with her in
      the little salon overlooking the garden, to return to their hotels and jot
      down paragraphs on the superiority of the American women over the men.
      These particular foreigners did not lay eyes on Mr. Durrett, who was in
      Florida or in the East playing polo or engaged in some other pursuit. One
      result of the lavishness and luxury that amazed them they wrote&mdash;had
      been to raise the standard of culture of the women, who were our leisure
      class. But the travellers did not remain long enough to arrive at any
      conclusions of value on the effect of luxury and lavishness on the sacred
      institution of marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Nathaniel Durrett could have returned to his native city after
      fifteen years or so in the grave, not the least of the phenomena to
      startle him would have been that which was taking place in his own house.
      For he would have beheld serenely established in that former abode of
      Calvinism one of the most reprehensible of exotic abominations, a 'mariage
      de convenance;' nor could he have failed to observe, moreover, the
      complacency with which the descendants of his friends, the pew holders in
      Dr. Pound's church, regarded the matter: and not only these, but the city
      at large. The stronghold of Scotch Presbyterianism had become a London or
      a Paris, a Gomorrah!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hambleton Durrett went her way, and Mr. Durrett his. The less said
      about Mr. Durrett's way&mdash;even in this suddenly advanced age&mdash;the
      better. As for Nancy, she seemed to the distant eye to be walking through
      life in a stately and triumphant manner. I read in the newspapers of her
      doings, her comings and goings; sometimes she was away for months
      together, often abroad; and when she was at home I saw her, but
      infrequently, under conditions more or less formal. Not that she was
      formal,&mdash;or I: our intercourse seemed eloquent of an intimacy in a
      tantalizing state of suspense. Would that intimacy ever be renewed? This
      was a question on which I sometimes speculated. The situation that had
      suspended or put an end to it, as the case might be, was never referred to
      by either of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon in the late winter of the year following that in which we
      had given a dinner to the Scherers (where the Durretts had rather
      marvellously appeared together) I left my office about three o'clock&mdash;a
      most unusual occurrence. I was restless, unable to fix my mind on my work,
      filled with unsatisfied yearnings the object of which I sought to keep
      vague, and yet I directed my steps westward along Boyne Street until I
      came to the Art Museum, where a loan exhibition was being held. I entered,
      bought a catalogue, and presently found myself standing before number 103,
      designated as a portrait of Mrs. Hambleton Durrett,&mdash;painted in Paris
      the autumn before by a Polish artist then much in vogue, Stanislaus
      Czesky. Nancy&mdash;was it Nancy?&mdash;was standing facing me, tall,
      superb in the maturity of her beauty, with one hand resting on an antique
      table, a smile upon her lips, a gentle mockery in her eyes as though
      laughing at the world she adorned. With the smile and the mockery&mdash;somehow
      significant, too, of an achieved inaccessibility&mdash;went the sheen of
      her clinging gown and the glint of the heavy pearls drooping from her high
      throat to her waist. These caught the eye, but failed at length to hold
      it, for even as I looked the smile faded, the mockery turned to
      wistfulness. So I thought, and looked again&mdash;to see the wistfulness:
      the smile had gone, the pearls seemed heavier. Was it a trick of the
      artist? had he seen what I saw, or thought I saw? or was it that
      imagination which by now I might have learned to suspect and distrust.
      Wild longings took possession of me, for the portrait had seemed to
      emphasize at once how distant now she was from me, and yet how near! I
      wanted to put that nearness to the test. Had she really changed? did
      anyone really change? and had I not been a fool to accept the presentment
      she had given me? I remembered those moments when our glances had met as
      across barriers in flashes of understanding. After all, the barriers were
      mere relics of the superstition of the past. What if I went to her now? I
      felt that I needed her as I never had needed anyone in all my life.... I
      was aroused by the sound of lowered voices beside me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Mrs. Hambleton Durrett,&rdquo; I heard a woman say. &ldquo;Isn't she
      beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The note of envy struck me sharply&mdash;horribly. Without waiting to
      listen to the comment of her companion I hurried out of the building into
      the cold, white sunlight that threw into bold relief the mediocre houses
      of the street. Here was everyday life, but the portrait had suggested that
      which might have been&mdash;might be yet. What did I mean by this? I
      didn't know, I didn't care to define it,&mdash;a renewal of her
      friendship, of our intimacy. My being cried out for it, and in the world
      in which I lived we took what we wanted&mdash;why not this? And yet for an
      instant I stood on the sidewalk to discover that in new situations I was
      still subject to unaccountable qualms of that thing I had been taught to
      call &ldquo;conscience&rdquo;; whether it were conscience or not must be left to the
      psychologists. I was married&mdash;terrible word! the shadow of that
      Institution fell athwart me as the sun went under a cloud; but the sun
      came out again as I found myself walking toward the Durrett house
      reflecting that numbers of married men called on Nancy, and that what I
      had in mind in regard to her was nothing that the court would have
      pronounced an infringement upon the Institution.... I reached her steps,
      the long steps still guarded by the curved wrought-iron railings
      reminiscent of Nathaniel's day, though the &ldquo;portals&rdquo; were gone, a modern
      vestibule having replaced them; I rang the bell; the butler, flung open
      the doors. He, at any rate, did not seem surprised to see me here, he
      greeted me with respectful cordiality and led me, as a favoured guest,
      through the big drawing-room into the salon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Paret, Madam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, rose quickly from the low chair where she sat cutting the pages of
      a French novel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I'm out if anyone calls. Bring tea,&rdquo; she added to
      the man, who retired. For a moment we stood gazing at each other,
      questioningly. &ldquo;Well, won't you sit down and stay awhile?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took a chair on the opposite side of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just thought I'd drop in,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am flattered,&rdquo; said Nancy, &ldquo;that a person so affaire should find time
      to call on an old friend. Why, I thought you never left your office until
      seven o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't, as a rule, but to-day I wasn't particularly busy, and I thought
      I'd go round to the Art Museum and look at your portrait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More flattery! Hugh, you're getting quite human. What do you think of
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like it. I think it quite remarkable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a cigarette!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you really like it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think it's a trifle&mdash;romantic,&rdquo; she replied &ldquo;But that's
      Czesky. He made me quite cross,&mdash;the feminine presentation of
      America, the spoiled woman who has shed responsibilities and is beginning
      to have a glimpse&mdash;just a little one&mdash;of the emptiness of it
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why do you accept it, if it isn't you?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;One doesn't
      refuse Czesky's canvases,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;And what difference does it make?
      It amused him, and he was fairly subtle about it. Only those who are
      looking for romance, like you, are able to guess what he meant, and they
      would think they saw it anyway, even if he had painted me&mdash;extinct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extinct!&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, you're a silly old goose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why I came here, I think, to be told so,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea was brought in. A sense of at-homeness stole over me,&mdash;I was more
      at home here in this room with Nancy, than in any other place in the
      world; here, where everything was at once soothing yet stimulating,
      expressive of her, even the smaller objects that caught my eye,&mdash;the
      crystal inkstand tipped with gold, the racks for the table books, her
      paper-cutter. Nancy's was a discriminating luxury. And her talk! The
      lightness with which she touched life, the unexplored depths of her,
      guessed at but never fathomed! Did she feel a little the need of me as I
      felt the need of her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I believe you're incurably romantic, Hugh,&rdquo; she said laughingly,
      when the men had left the room. &ldquo;Here you are, what they call a paragon of
      success, a future senator, Ambassador to England. I hear of those
      remarkable things you have done&mdash;even in New York the other day a man
      was asking me if I knew Mr. Paret, and spoke of you as one of the coming
      men. I suppose you will be moving there, soon. A practical success! It
      always surprises me when I think of it, I find it difficult to remember
      what a dreamer you were and here you turn out to be still a dreamer! Have
      you discovered, too, the emptiness of it all?&rdquo; she inquired provokingly.
      &ldquo;I must say you don't look it&rdquo;&mdash;she gave me a critical, quizzical
      glance&mdash;&ldquo;you look quite prosperous and contented, as though you
      enjoyed your power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;and then one day when your luncheon has
      disagreed with you&mdash;you walk into a gallery and see a portrait of&mdash;of
      an old friend for whom in youth, when you were a dreamer, you professed a
      sentimental attachment, and you exclaim that the artist is a discerning
      man who has discovered the secret that she has guarded so closely. She's
      sorry that she ever tried to console herself with baubles it's what you've
      suspected all along. But you'll just run around to see for yourself&mdash;to
      be sure of it.&rdquo; And she handed me my tea. &ldquo;Come now, confess. Where are
      your wits&mdash;I hear you don't lack them in court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if that amuses you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does amuse me,&rdquo; said Nancy, twining her fingers across her knee and
      regarding me smilingly, with parted lips, &ldquo;it amuses me a lot&mdash;it's
      so characteristic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's not true, it's unjust,&rdquo; I protested vigorously, smiling, too,
      because the attack was so characteristic of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in the first place, my luncheon didn't disagree with me. It never
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed. &ldquo;But the sentiment&mdash;come now&mdash;the sentiment? Do you
      perceive any hint of emptiness&mdash;despair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Our chairs were very close, and she leaned forward a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emptiness or no emptiness,&rdquo; I said a little tremulously, &ldquo;I know that I
      haven't been so contented, so happy for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat very still, but turned her gaze on the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really wouldn't want to find that, Hugh,&rdquo; she said in another voice,
      at which I exclaimed. &ldquo;No, I'm not being sentimental. But, to be serious,
      I really shouldn't care to think that of you. I'd like to think of you as
      a friend&mdash;a good friend&mdash;although we don't see very much of one
      another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's why I came, Nancy,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;It wasn't just an impulse&mdash;that
      is, I've been thinking of you a great deal, all along. I miss you, I miss
      the way you look at things&mdash;your point of view. I can't see any
      reason why we shouldn't see something of each other&mdash;now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued to stare into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said at length, &ldquo;I suppose there isn't any reason.&rdquo; Her mood
      seemed suddenly to change as she bent over and extinguished the flame
      under the kettle. &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; she added gaily, &ldquo;we live in a tolerant
      age, we've reached the years of discretion, and we're both too
      conventional to do anything silly&mdash;even if we wanted to&mdash;which
      we don't. We're neither of us likely to quarrel with the world as it is, I
      think, and we might as well make fun of it together. We'll begin with our
      friends. What do you think of Mr. Scherer's palace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you're building it for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him to get Eyre,&rdquo; said Nancy, laughingly, &ldquo;I was afraid he'd
      repeat the Gallatin Park monstrosity on a larger scale, and Eyre's the
      only man in this country who understands the French. It's been rather
      amusing,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I've had to fight Hilda, and she's no mean
      antagonist. How she hates me! She wanted a monstrosity, of course, a
      modernized German rock-grotto sort of an affair, I can imagine. She's been
      so funny when I've met her at dinner. 'I understand you take a great
      interest in the house, Mrs. Durrett.' Can't you hear her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you did get ahead of her,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to. I couldn't let our first citizen build a modern Rhine castle,
      could I? I have some public spirit left. And besides, I expect to build on
      Grant Avenue myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leave here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's too grubby, it's in the slums,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;But I really owe
      you a debt of gratitude, Hugh, for the Scherers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm told Adolf's lost his head over you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not only over me, but over everything. He's so ridiculously proud of
      being on the board of the Children's Hospital.... You ought to hear him
      talking to old Mrs. Ogilvy, who of course can't get used to him at all,&mdash;she
      always has the air of inquiring what he's doing in that galley. She still
      thinks of him as Mr. Durrett's foreman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The time flew. Her presence was like a bracing, tingling atmosphere in
      which I felt revived and exhilarated, self-restored. For Nancy did not
      question&mdash;she took me as I was. We looked out on the world, as it
      were, from the same window, and I could not help thinking that ours, after
      all, was a large view. The topics didn't matter&mdash;our conversation was
      fragrant with intimacy; and we were so close to each other it seemed
      incredible that we ever should be parted again. At last the little clock
      on the mantel chimed an hour, she started and looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's seven, Hugh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, rising. &ldquo;I'd no idea it was so
      late, and I'm dining with the Dickinsons. I've only just time to dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been like a reunion, hasn't it?&mdash;a reunion after many years,&rdquo; I
      said. I held her hand unconsciously&mdash;she seemed to be drawing me to
      her, I thought she swayed, and a sudden dizziness seized me. Then she drew
      away abruptly, with a little cry. I couldn't be sure about the cry,
      whether I heard it or not, a note was struck in the very depths of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in again,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;whenever you're not too busy.&rdquo; And a minute
      later I found myself on the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the beginning of a new intimacy with Nancy, resembling the old
      intimacy yet differing from it. The emotional note of our parting on the
      occasion I have just related was not again struck, and when I went eagerly
      to see her again a few days later I was conscious of limitations,&mdash;not
      too conscious: the freedom she offered and which I gladly accepted was a
      large freedom, nor am I quite sure that even I would have wished it
      larger, though there were naturally moments when I thought so: when I
      asked myself what I did wish, I found no answer. Though I sometimes
      chafed, it would have been absurd of me to object to a certain timidity or
      caution I began to perceive in her that had been absent in the old Nancy;
      but the old Nancy had ceased to exist, and here instead was a highly
      developed, highly specialized creature in whom I delighted; and after
      taking thought I would not have robbed her of fine acquired attribute. As
      she had truly observed, we were both conventional; conventionality was
      part of the price we had willingly paid for membership in that rarer world
      we had both achieved. It was a world, to be sure, in which we were rapidly
      learning to take the law into our own hands without seeming to defy it, in
      order that the fear of it might remain in those less fortunately placed
      and endowed: we had begun with the appropriation of the material property
      of our fellow-citizens, which we took legally; from this point it was, of
      course, merely a logical step to take&mdash;legally, too other gentlemen's
      human property&mdash;their wives, in short: the more progressive East had
      set us our example, but as yet we had been chary to follow it.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time rebellious voices were beginning to make themselves heard
      in the literary wilderness proclaiming liberty&mdash;liberty of the sexes.
      There were Russian novels and French novels, and pioneer English novels
      preaching liberty with Nietzschean stridency, or taking it for granted. I
      picked these up on Nancy's table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reading them?&rdquo; she said, in answer to my query. &ldquo;Of course I'm reading
      them. I want to know what these clever people are thinking, even if I
      don't always agree with them, and you ought to read them too. It's quite
      true what foreigners say about our men,&mdash;that they live in a groove,
      that they haven't any range of conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm quite willing to be educated,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;I haven't a doubt that I
      need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was leaning back in her chair, her hands behind her head, a posture
      she often assumed. She looked up at me amusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll acknowledge that you're more teachable than most of them,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Do you know, Hugh, sometimes you puzzle me greatly. When you are here and
      we're talking together I can never think of you as you are out in the
      world, fighting for power&mdash;and getting it. I suppose it's part of
      your charm, that there is that side of you, but I never consciously
      realize it. You're what they call a dual personality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a pretty hard name!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it&mdash;you are. Oh, not disagreeably so, quite normally&mdash;that's
      the odd thing about you. Sometimes I believe that you were made for
      something different, that in spite of your success you have missed your
      'metier.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ought I to have been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I tell? A Goethe, perhaps&mdash;a Goethe smothered by a
      twentieth-century environment. Your love of adventure isn't dead, it's
      been merely misdirected, real adventure, I mean, forth faring, straying
      into unknown paths. Perhaps you haven't yet found yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How uncanny!&rdquo; I said, stirred and startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a taste for literature, you know, though you've buried it. Give
      me Turgeniev. We'll begin with him....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her reading and the talks that followed it were exciting, amazingly
      stimulating.... Once Nancy gave me an amusing account of a debate which
      had taken place in the newly organized woman's discussion club to which
      she belonged over a rather daring book by an English novelist. Mrs.
      Dickinson had revolted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she wasn't really shocked, not in the way she thought she was,&rdquo; said
      Nancy, in answer to a query of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was she shocked, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you and I are shocked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm not shocked,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you are, and so am I&mdash;not on the moral side, nor is it the
      moral aspect that troubles Lula Dickinson. She thinks it's the moral
      aspect, but it's really the revolutionary aspect, the menace to those
      precious institutions from which we derive our privileges and comforts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I considered this, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use of being a humbug about it,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're talking like a revolutionary,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may be talking like one, but I'm not one. I once had the makings of one&mdash;of
      a good one,&mdash;a 'proper' one, as the English would say.&rdquo; She sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You regret it?&rdquo; I asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I regret it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What woman worth her salt doesn't
      regret it, doesn't want to live, even if she has to suffer for it? And
      those people&mdash;the revolutionaries, I mean, the rebels&mdash;they
      live, they're the only ones who do live. The rest of us degenerate in a
      painless paralysis we think of as pleasure. Look at me! I'm incapable of
      committing a single original act, even though I might conceive one. Well,
      there was a time when I should have been equal to anything and wouldn't
      have cared a&mdash;a damn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I believed her....
    </p>
    <p>
      I fell into the habit of dropping in on Nancy at least twice a week on my
      way from the office, and I met her occasionally at other houses. I did not
      tell Maude of that first impulsive visit; but one evening a few weeks
      later she asked me where I had been, and when I told her she made no
      comment. I came presently to the conclusion that this renewed intimacy did
      not trouble her&mdash;which was what I wished to believe. Of course I had
      gone to Nancy for a stimulation I failed to get at home, and it is the
      more extraordinary, therefore, that I did not become more discontented and
      restless: I suppose this was because I had grown to regard marriage as
      most of the world regarded it, as something inevitable and humdrum, as a
      kind of habit it is useless to try to shake off. But life is so full of
      complexities and anomalies that I still had a real affection for Maude,
      and I liked her the more because she didn't expect too much of me, and
      because she didn't complain of my friendship with Nancy although I should
      vehemently have denied there was anything to complain of. I respected
      Maude. If she was not a squaw, she performed religiously the traditional
      squaw duties, and made me comfortable: and the fact that we lived separate
      mental existences did not trouble me because I never thought of hers&mdash;or
      even that she had one. She had the children, and they seemed to suffice.
      She never renewed her appeal for my confidence, and I forgot that she had
      made it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless I always felt a tug at my heartstrings when June came around
      and it was time for her and the children to go to Mattapoisett for the
      summer; when I accompanied them, on the evening of their departure, to the
      smoky, noisy station and saw deposited in the sleeping-car their luggage
      and shawls and bundles. They always took the evening train to Boston; it
      was the best. Tom and Susan were invariably there with candy and toys to
      see them off&mdash;if Susan and her children had not already gone&mdash;and
      at such moments my heart warmed to Tom. And I was astonished as I clung to
      Matthew and Moreton and little Biddy at the affection that welled up
      within me, saddened when I kissed Maude good-bye. She too was sad, and
      always seemed to feel compunctions for deserting me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel so selfish in leaving you all alone!&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;If it
      weren't for the children&mdash;they need the sea air. But I know you don't
      miss me as I miss you. A man doesn't, I suppose.... Please don't work so
      hard, and promise me you'll come on and stay a long time. You can if you
      want to. We shan't starve.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;That nice room, which is yours,
      at the southeast corner, is always waiting for you. And you do like the
      sea, and seeing the sail-boats in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt an emptiness when the train pulled out. I did love my family, after
      all! I would go back to the deserted house, and I could not bear to look
      in at the nursery door, at the little beds with covers flung over them.
      Why couldn't I appreciate these joys when I had them?
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, as we went home in an open street-car together, after such a
      departure, Tom blurted out:&mdash;&ldquo;Hugh, I believe I care for your family
      as much as for my own. I often wonder if you realize how wonderful these
      children are! My boys are just plain ruffians&mdash;although I think
      they're pretty decent ruffians, but Matthew has a mind&mdash;he's
      thoughtful&mdash;and an imagination. He'll make a name for himself some
      day if he's steered properly and allowed to develop naturally. Moreton's
      more like my boys. And as for Chickabiddy!&mdash;&rdquo; words failed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put my hand on his knee. I actually loved him again as I had loved and
      yearned for him as a child,&mdash;he was so human, so dependable. And why
      couldn't this feeling last? He disapproved&mdash;foolishly, I thought&mdash;of
      my professional career, and this was only one of his limitations. But I
      knew that he was loyal. Why hadn't I been able to breathe and be
      reasonably happy in that atmosphere of friendship and love in which I had
      been placed&mdash;or rather in which I had placed myself?... Before the
      summer was a day or two older I had grown accustomed to being alone, and
      enjoyed the liberty; and when Maude and the children returned in the
      autumn, similarly, it took me some days to get used to the restrictions
      imposed by a household. I run the risk of shocking those who read this by
      declaring that if my family had been taken permanently out of my life, I
      should not long have missed them. But on the whole, in those years my
      marriage relation might be called a negative one. There were moments, as I
      have described, when I warmed to Maude, moments when I felt something akin
      to a violent antagonism aroused by little mannerisms and tricks she had.
      The fact that we got along as well as we did was probably due to the
      orthodox teaching with which we had been inoculated,&mdash;to the effect
      that matrimony was a moral trial, a shaking-down process. But moral trials
      were ceasing to appeal to people, and more and more of them were refusing
      to be shaken down. We didn't cut the Gordian knot, but we managed to
      loosen it considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have spoken of a new species of titans who inhabited the giant buildings
      in Wall Street, New York, and fought among themselves for possession of
      the United States of America. It is interesting to note that in these
      struggles a certain chivalry was observed among the combatants, no matter
      how bitter the rivalry: for instance, it was deemed very bad form for one
      of the groups of combatants to take the public into their confidence;
      cities were upset and stirred to the core by these conflicts, and the
      citizens never knew who was doing the fighting, but imagined that some
      burning issue was at stake that concerned them. As a matter of fact the
      issue always did concern them, but not in the way they supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, out of the chaotic melee in which these titans were engaged had
      emerged one group more powerful than the rest and more respectable, whose
      leader was the Personality to whom I have before referred. He and his
      group had managed to gain control of certain conservative fortresses in
      various cities such as the Corn National Bank and the Ashuela Telephone
      Company&mdash;to mention two of many: Adolf Scherer was his ally, and the
      Boyne Iron Works, Limited, was soon to be merged by him into a greater
      corporation still. Leonard Dickinson might be called his local
      governor-general. We manned the parapets and kept our ears constantly to
      the ground to listen for the rumble of attacks; but sometimes they burst
      upon us fiercely and suddenly, without warning. Such was the assault on
      the Ashuela, which for years had exercised an apparently secure monopoly
      of the city's telephone service, which had been able to ignore with
      complacency the shrillest protests of unreasonable subscribers. Through
      the Pilot it was announced to the public that certain benevolent &ldquo;Eastern
      capitalists&rdquo; were ready to rescue them from their thraldom if the city
      would grant them a franchise. Mr. Lawler, the disinterestedness of whose
      newspaper could not be doubted, fanned the flame day by day, sent his
      reporters about the city gathering instances of the haughty neglect of the
      Ashuela, proclaiming its instruments antiquated compared with those used
      in more progressive cities, as compared with the very latest inventions
      which the Automatic Company was ready to install provided they could get
      their franchise. And the prices! These, too, would fall&mdash;under
      competition. It was a clever campaign. If the city would give them a
      franchise, that Automatic Company&mdash;so well named! would provide
      automatic instruments. Each subscriber, by means of a numerical disk,
      could call up any other, subscriber; there would be no central operator,
      no listening, no tapping of wires; the number of calls would be unlimited.
      As a proof of the confidence of these Eastern gentlemen in our city, they
      were willing to spend five millions, and present more than six hundred
      telephones free to the city departments! What was fairer, more generous
      than this! There could be no doubt that popular enthusiasm was enlisted in
      behalf of the &ldquo;Eastern Capitalists,&rdquo; who were made to appear in the light
      of Crusaders ready to rescue a groaning people from the thrall of
      monopoly. The excitement approached that of a presidential election, and
      became the dominant topic at quick-lunch counters and in street-cars.
      Cheap and efficient service! Down with the Bastille of monopoly!
    </p>
    <p>
      As counsel for the Ashuela, Mr. Ogilvy sent for me, and by certain secret
      conduits of information at my disposal I was not long in discovering the
      disquieting fact that a Mr. Orthwein, who was described as a gentleman
      with fat fingers and a plausible manner, had been in town for a week and
      had been twice seen entering and emerging from Monahan's saloon. In short,
      Mr. Jason had already been &ldquo;seen.&rdquo; Nevertheless I went to him myself, to
      find him for the first time in my experience absolutely non-committal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the Ashuela willing to do?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mentioned a sum, and he shook his head. I mentioned another, and still
      he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come 'round again,&rdquo; he said...
    </p>
    <p>
      I was compelled to report this alarming situation to Ogilvy and Dickinson
      and a few chosen members of a panicky board of directors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's that damned Grannis crowd,&rdquo; said Dickinson, mentioning an aggressive
      gentleman who had migrated from Chicago to Wall Street some five years
      before in a pink collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what's to be done?&rdquo; demanded Ogilvy, playing nervously with a gold
      pencil on the polished table. He was one of those Americans who in a
      commercial atmosphere become prematurely white, and today his boyish,
      smooth-shaven face was almost as devoid of colour as his hair. Even
      Leonard Dickinson showed anxiety, which was unusual for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got to fix it, Hugh,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not see my way, but I had long ago learned to assume the unruffled
      air and judicial manner of speaking that inspires the layman with almost
      superstitious confidence in the lawyer....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll find a way out,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jason, of course, held the key to the situation, and just how I was to
      get around him was problematical. In the meantime there was the public: to
      permit the other fellow to capture that was to be lacking in ordinary
      prudence; if its votes counted for nothing, its savings were desirable;
      and it was fast getting into a state of outrage against monopoly. The
      chivalry of finance did not permit of a revelation that Mr. Grannis and
      his buccaneers were behind the Automatic, but it was possible to direct
      and strengthen the backfire which the Era and other conservative
      newspapers had already begun. Mr. Tallant for delicate reasons being
      persona non grata at the Boyne Club, despite the fact that he had so many
      friends there, we met for lunch in a private room at the new hotel, and as
      we sipped our coffee and smoked our cigars we planned a series of
      editorials and articles that duly appeared. They made a strong appeal to
      the loyalty of our citizens to stand by the home company and home capital
      that had taken generous risks to give them service at a time when the
      future of the telephone business was by no means assured; they belittled
      the charges made by irresponsible and interested &ldquo;parties,&rdquo; and finally
      pointed out, not without effect, that one logical consequence of having
      two telephone companies would be to compel subscribers in self-defence to
      install two telephones instead of one. And where was the saving in that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Paret,&rdquo; said Judah B. when we had finished our labours; &ldquo;if you ever
      get sick of the law, I'll give you a job on the Era's staff. This is fine,
      the way you put it. It'll do a lot of good, but how in hell are you going
      to handle Judd?...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For three days the inspiration was withheld. And then, as I was strolling
      down Boyne Street after lunch gazing into the store windows it came
      suddenly, without warning. Like most inspirations worth anything, it was
      very simple. Within half an hour I had reached Monahan's saloon and found
      Mr. Jason out of bed, but still in his bedroom, seated meditatively at the
      window that looked over the alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know the crowd in New York behind this Automatic company as well as I
      do, Jason,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why do you want to deal with them when we've always
      been straight with you, when we're ready to meet them and go one better?
      Name your price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I do&mdash;what then,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;This thing's gone pretty far.
      Under that damned new charter the franchise has got to be bid for&mdash;hasn't
      it? And the people want this company. There'll be a howl from one end of
      this town to the other if we throw 'em down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll look out for the public,&rdquo; I assured him, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with one of his glances that were like flashes, &ldquo;what you
      got up your sleeve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose another telephone company steps in, and bids a little higher for
      the franchise. That relieves, your aldermen of all responsibility, doesn't
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another telephone company!&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had already named it on my walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Interurban,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dummy company?&rdquo; said Mr. Jason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lively enough to bid something over a hundred thousand to the city for
      its franchise,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judd Jason, with a queer look, got up and went to a desk in a dark corner,
      and after rummaging for a few moments in one of the pigeon-holes, drew
      forth a glass cylinder, which he held out as he approached me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You get it, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;a bomb!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That,&rdquo; he announced, as he twisted the tube about in his long fingers,
      holding it up to the light, &ldquo;is the finest brand of cigars ever made in
      Cuba. A gentleman who had every reason to be grateful to me&mdash;I won't
      say who he was&mdash;gave me that once. Well, the Lord made me so's I
      can't appreciate any better tobacco than those five-cent 'Bobtails'
      Monahan's got downstairs, and I saved it. I saved it for the man who would
      put something over me some day, and&mdash;you get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said, unconsciously falling in with the semi-ceremony of
      his manner. &ldquo;I do not flatter myself that the solution I have suggested
      did not also occur to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll smoke it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now? Here with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I agreed, a little puzzled. As I broke the seal, pulled out
      the cork and unwrapped the cigar from its gold foil he took a stick and
      rapped loudly on the floor. After a brief interval footsteps were heard on
      the stairs and Mike Monahan, white aproned and scarlet faced, appeared at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bobtails,&rdquo; said Mr. Jason, laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's them I thought ye'd be wanting,&rdquo; said the saloon-keeper, holding out
      a handful. Judd Jason lighted one, and began smoking reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gazed about the mean room, with its litter of newspapers and reports,
      its shabby furniture, and these seemed to have become incongruous, out of
      figure in the chair facing me keeping with the thoughtful figure in the
      chair facing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had a college education, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; he remarked at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life's a queer thing. Now if I'd had a college education, like you, and
      you'd been thrown on the world, like me, maybe I'd be livin' up there on
      Grant Avenue and you'd be down here over the saloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; I said, wondering uneasily whether he meant to imply a similarity
      in our gifts. But his manner remained impassive, speculative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever read Carlyle's 'French Revolution'?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, part of it, a good while ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you was in college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got a little library here,&rdquo; he said, getting up and raising the
      shades and opening the glass doors of a bookcase which had escaped my
      attention. He took down a volume of Carlyle, bound in half calf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't think I cared for such things, would you?&rdquo; he demanded as he
      handed it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you never can tell what a man's real tastes are until you know
      him,&rdquo; I observed, to conceal my surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;I like books&mdash;some books. If I'd had an
      education, I'd have liked more of 'em, known more about 'em. Now I can
      read this one over and over. That feller Carlyle was a genius, he could
      look right into the bowels of the volcano, and he was on to how men and
      women feet down there, how they hate, how they square 'emselves when they
      get a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had managed to bring before me vividly that terrible, volcanic flow on
      Versailles of the Paris mob. He put back the book and resumed his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know how these people fed down here, below the crust,&rdquo; he went on,
      waving his cigar out of the window, as though to indicate the whole of
      that mean district. &ldquo;They hate, and their hate is molten hell. I've been
      through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you've got on top,&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I've got on top. Do you know why? it's because I hated&mdash;that's
      why. A man's feelings, if they're strong enough, have a lot to do with
      what he becomes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has to have ability, too,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, he has to have ability, but his feeling is the driving power if he
      feels strong enough, he can make a little ability go a long way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was struck by the force of this remark. I scarcely recognized Judd
      Jason. The man, as he revealed himself, had become at once more sinister
      and more fascinating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can guess how some of those Jacobins felt when they had the aristocrats
      in the dock. They'd got on top&mdash;the Jacobins, I mean. It's human
      nature to want to get on top&mdash;ain't it?&rdquo; He looked at me and smiled,
      but he did not seem to expect a reply. &ldquo;Well, what you call society, rich,
      respectable society like you belong to would have made a bum and a
      criminal out of me if I hadn't been too smart for 'em, and it's a kind of
      satisfaction to have 'em coming down here to Monahan's for things they
      can't have without my leave. I've got a half Nelson on 'em. I wouldn't
      live up on Grant Avenue if you gave me Scherer's new house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of starting my career in college, I started in jail,&rdquo; he went on,
      apparently ignoring any effect he may have produced. So subtly, so
      dispassionately indeed was he delivering himself of these remarks that it
      was impossible to tell whether he meant their application to be personal,
      to me, or general, to my associates. &ldquo;I went to jail when I was fourteen
      because I wanted a knife to make kite sticks, and I stole a razor from a
      barber. I was bitter when they steered me into a lockup in Hickory Street.
      It was full of bugs and crooks, and they put me in the same cell with an
      old-timer named 'Red' Waters; who was one of the slickest safe-blowers
      around in those days. Red took a shine to me, found out I had a head
      piece, and said their gang could use a clever boy. If I'd go in with him,
      I could make all kinds of money. I guess I might have joined the gang if
      Red hadn't kept talking&mdash;about how the boss of his district named
      Gallagher would come down and get him out,&mdash;and sure enough Gallagher
      did come down and get him out. I thought I'd rather be Gallagher than Red&mdash;Red
      had to serve time once in a while. Soon as he got out I went down to
      Gallagher's saloon, and there was Red leaning over the bar. 'Here's a
      smart kid! he says, 'He and me were room-mates over in Hickory Street.' He
      got to gassing me, and telling me I'd better come along with him, when
      Gallagher came in. 'What is it ye'd like to be, my son?' says he. A
      politician, I told him. I was through going to jail. Gallagher had a laugh
      you could hear all over the place. He took me on as a kind of handy boy
      around the establishment, and by and by I began to run errands and find
      out things for him. I was boss of that ward myself when I was
      twenty-six.... How'd you like that cigar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I praised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to have been a good one,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Well, I don't want to
      keep you here all afternoon telling you my life story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I assured him I had been deeply interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty slick idea of yours, that dummy company, Mr. Paret. Go ahead and
      organize it.&rdquo; He rose, which was contrary to his custom on the departure
      of a visitor. &ldquo;Drop in again. We'll talk about the books.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked slowly back reflecting on this conversation, upon the motives
      impelling Mr. Jason to become thus confidential; nor was it the most
      comforting thought in the world that the artist in me had appealed to the
      artist in him, that he had hailed me as a breather. But for the grace of
      God I might have been Mr. Jason and he Mr. Paret: undoubtedly that was
      what he had meant to imply... And I was forced to admit that he had
      succeeded&mdash;deliberately or not&mdash;in making the respectable Mr.
      Paret just a trifle uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the marble vestibule of the Corn National Bank I ran into Tallant,
      holding his brown straw hat in his hand and looking a little more
      moth-eaten than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Paret,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;how is that telephone business getting along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Dickinson in?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tallant nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went through the cool bank, with its shining brass and red mahogany,
      its tiled floor, its busy tellers attending to files of clients, to the
      president's sanctum in the rear. Leonard Dickinson, very spruce and
      dignified in a black cutaway coat, was dictating rapidly to a woman,
      stenographer, whom he dismissed when he saw us. The door was shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just asking Paret about the telephone affair,&rdquo; said Mr. Tallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you found a way out?&rdquo; Leonard Dickinson looked questioningly
      at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I've seen Jason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; they both ejaculated at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We win,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood gazing at me. Even Dickinson, who was rarely ruffled, seemed
      excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say you've fixed it?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. They stared at me in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How the deuce did you manage it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We organize the Interurban Telephone Company, and bid for the franchise&mdash;that's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A dummy company!&rdquo; cried Tallant. &ldquo;Why, it's simple as ABC!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dickinson smiled. He was tremendously relieved, and showed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true about all great ideas, Tallant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They're simple,
      only it takes a clever man to think of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jason agrees?&rdquo; Tallant demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded again. &ldquo;We'll have to outbid the Automatic people. I haven't seen
      Bitter yet about the&mdash;about the fee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Leonard Dickinson, quickly. &ldquo;I take off my hat to
      you. You've saved us. You can ask any fee you like,&rdquo; he added genially.
      &ldquo;Let's go over to&mdash;to the Ashuela and get some lunch.&rdquo; He had been
      about to say the Club, but he remembered Mr. Tallant's presence in time.
      &ldquo;Nothing's worrying you, Hugh?&rdquo; he added, as we went out, followed by the
      glances of his employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; I said....

    <h2>
      XVIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Making money in those days was so ridiculously easy! The trouble was to
      know how to spend it. One evening when I got home I told Maude I had a
      surprise for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A surprise?&rdquo; she asked, looking up from a little pink smock she was
      making for Chickabiddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've bought that lot on Grant Avenue, next to the Ogilvys'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dropped her sewing, and stared at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you pleased?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;At last we are going to have a house of
      our very own. What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't bear the thought of leaving here. I'm so used to it. I've grown
      to love it. It's part of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I exclaimed, a little exasperated, &ldquo;you didn't expect to live here
      always, did you? The house has been too small for us for years. I thought
      you'd be delighted.&rdquo; (This was not strictly true, for I had rather
      expected some such action on her part.) &ldquo;Most women would. Of course, if
      it's going to make such a difference to you as that, I'll sell the lot.
      That won't be difficult.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got up, and started to go into my study. She half rose, and her sewing
      fell to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why are we always having misunderstandings? Do sit down a minute,
      Hugh. Don't think I'm not appreciative,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;It was&mdash;such a
      shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat down rather reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't express what I think,&rdquo; she continued, rather breathlessly, &ldquo;but
      sometimes I'm actually frightened, we're going through life so fast in
      these days, and it doesn't seem as if we were getting the real things out
      of it. I'm afraid of your success, and of all the money you're making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not so rich yet, as riches go in these days, that you need be
      alarmed,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me helplessly a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that it isn't&mdash;right, somehow, that you'll pay for it, that
      we'll pay for it. Goodness knows, we have everything we want, and more
      too. This house&mdash;this house is real, and I'm afraid that won't be a
      home, won't be real. That we'll be overwhelmed with&mdash;with things!&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      She was interrupted by the entrance of the children. But after dinner,
      when she had seen them to bed, as was her custom, she came downstairs into
      my study and said quietly:&mdash;&ldquo;I was wrong, Hugh. If you want to build
      a house, if you feel that you'd be happier, I have no right to object. Of
      course my sentiment for this house is natural, the children were born
      here, but I've realized we couldn't live here always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you look at it that way,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Why, we're already getting
      cramped, Maude, and now you're going to have a governess I don't know
      where you'd put her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too large, a house,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I know you think I'm silly, but
      this extravagance we see everywhere does make me uneasy. Perhaps it's
      because I'm provincial, and always shall be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must have a house large enough to be comfortable in,&rdquo; I said.
      &ldquo;There's no reason why we shouldn't be comfortable.&rdquo; I thought it as well
      not to confess my ambitions, and I was greatly relieved that she did not
      reproach me for buying the lot without consulting her. Indeed, I was
      grateful for this unanticipated acquiescence, I felt nearer to her, than I
      had for a long time. I drew up another chair to my desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down and we'll make a few sketches, just for fun,&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; she said presently, as we were blacking out prospective rooms, &ldquo;do
      you remember all those drawings and plans we made in England, on our
      wedding trip, and how we knew just what we wanted, and changed our minds
      every few days? And now we're ready to build, and haven't any ideas at
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered&mdash;but I did not look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the book still&mdash;it's in the attic somewhere, packed away in a
      box. I suppose those plans would seem ridiculous now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was quite true,&mdash;now that we were ready to build the home that had
      been deferred so long, now that I had the money to spend without stint on
      its construction, the irony of life had deprived me of those strong
      desires and predilections I had known on my wedding trip. What a joy it
      would have been to build then! But now I found myself: wholly lacking in
      definite ideas as to style and construction. Secretly, I looked forward to
      certain luxuries, such as a bedroom and dressing-room and warm tiled
      bathroom all to myself bachelor privacies for which I had longed. Two
      mornings later at the breakfast table Maude asked me if I had thought of
      an architect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Archie Lammerton, I suppose. Who else is there? Have you anyone else
      in mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; said Maude. &ldquo;But I heard of such a clever man in Boston, who
      doesn't charge Mr. Lammerton's prices; and who designs such beautiful
      private houses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can afford to pay Lammerton's prices,&rdquo; I replied, smiling. &ldquo;And
      why shouldn't we have the best?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure&mdash;he is the best, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody has him,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maude smiled in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that's a good reason,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it's a good reason,&rdquo; I assured her. &ldquo;These people&mdash;the
      people we know&mdash;wouldn't have had Lammerton unless he was
      satisfactory. What's the matter with his houses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Maude, &ldquo;they're not very original. I don't say they're not
      good, in away, but they lack a certain imagination. It's difficult for me
      to express what I mean, 'machine made' isn't precisely the idea, but there
      should be a certain irregularity in art&mdash;shouldn't there? I saw a
      reproduction in one of the architectural journals of a house in Boston by
      a man named Frey, that seemed to me to have great charm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was Lucia, unmistakably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all very well,&rdquo; I said impatiently, &ldquo;but when one has to live in a
      house, one wants something more than artistic irregularity. Lammerton
      knows how to build for everyday existence; he's a practical man, as well
      as a man of taste, he may not be a Christopher Wrenn, but he understands
      conveniences and comforts. His chimneys don't smoke, his windows are
      tight, he knows what systems of heating are the best, and whom to go to:
      he knows what good plumbing is. I'm rather surprised you don't appreciate
      that, Maude, you're so particular as to what kind of rooms the children
      shall have, and you want a schoolroom-nursery with all the latest devices,
      with sun and ventilation. The Berringers wouldn't have had him, the
      Hollisters and Dickinsons wouldn't have had him if his work lacked taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Nancy wouldn't have had him,&rdquo; added Maude, and she smiled once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven't consulted Nancy, or anyone else,&rdquo; I replied&mdash;a
      little tartly, perhaps. &ldquo;You don't seem to realize that some fashions may
      have a basis of reason. They are not all silly, as Lucia seems to think.
      If Lammerton builds satisfactory houses, he ought to be forgiven for being
      the fashion, he ought to have a chance.&rdquo; I got up to leave. &ldquo;Let's see
      what kind of a plan he'll draw up, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her glance was almost indulgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Hugh. I want you to be satisfied, to be pleased,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; I questioned, &ldquo;you are to live in the house more than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm sure it will turn out all right,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Now you'd better
      run along, I know you're late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am late,&rdquo; I admitted, rather lamely. &ldquo;If you don't care for Lammerton's
      drawings, we'll get another architect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several years before Mr. Lammerton had arrived among us with a Beaux Arts
      moustache and letters of introduction to Mrs. Durrett and others. We found
      him the most adaptable, the most accommodating of young men, always ready
      to donate his talents and his services to private theatricals, tableaux,
      and fancy-dress balls, to take a place at a table at the last moment. One
      of his most appealing attributes was his &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in our city,&mdash;a
      form of patriotism that culminated, in later years, in &ldquo;million
      population&rdquo; clubs. I have often heard him declare, when the ladies had
      left the dining-room, that there was positively no limit to our future
      growth; and, incidentally, to our future wealth. Such sentiments as these
      could not fail to add to any man's popularity, and his success was a
      foregone conclusion. Almost before we knew it he was building the new
      Union Station of which he had foreseen the need, to take care of the
      millions to which our population was to be swelled; building the new Post
      Office that the unceasing efforts of Theodore Watling finally procured for
      us: building, indeed, Nancy's new house, the largest of our private
      mansions save Mr. Scherer's, a commission that had immediately brought
      about others from the Dickinsons and the Berringers.... That very day I
      called on him in his offices at the top of one of our new buildings, where
      many young draftsmen were bending over their boards. I was ushered into
      his private studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you want something handsome, Hugh,&rdquo; he said, looking at me over
      his cigarette, &ldquo;something commensurate with these fees I hear you are
      getting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want to be comfortable,&rdquo; I admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      We lunched at the Club together, where we talked over the requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to dinner the next week and spread out his sketch on the
      living-room table Maude drew in her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Hugh,&rdquo; she exclaimed in dismay, &ldquo;it's as big as&mdash;as big as the
      White House!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; I answered, laughing with Archie. &ldquo;We may as well take our
      ease in our old age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take our ease!&rdquo; echoed Maude. &ldquo;We'll rattle 'round in it. I'll never get
      used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a month, Mrs. Paret, I'll wager you'll be wondering how you ever
      got along without it,&rdquo; said Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not as big as the White House, yet it could not be called small. I
      had seen, to that. The long facade was imposing, dignified, with a touch
      of conventionality and solidity in keeping with my standing in the city.
      It was Georgian, of plum-coloured brick with marble trimmings and marble
      wedges over the ample windows, some years later I saw the house by
      Ferguson, of New York, from which Archie had cribbed it. At one end, off
      the dining-room, was a semicircular conservatory. There was a small
      portico, with marble pillars, and in the ample, swift sloping roof many
      dormers; servants' rooms, Archie explained. The look of anxiety on Maude's
      face deepened as he went over the floor plans, the reception-room; dining
      room to seat thirty, the servants' hall; and upstairs Maude's room,
      boudoir and bath and dress closet, my &ldquo;apartments&rdquo; adjoining on one side
      and the children's on the other, and the guest-rooms with baths....
    </p>
    <p>
      Maude surrendered, as one who gives way to the inevitable. When the actual
      building began we both of us experienced, I think; a certain mild
      excitement; and walked out there, sometimes with the children, in the
      spring evenings, and on Sunday afternoons. &ldquo;Excitement&rdquo; is, perhaps, too
      strong a word for my feelings: there was a pleasurable anticipation on my
      part, a looking forward to a more decorous, a more luxurious existence; a
      certain impatience at the delays inevitable in building. But a new legal
      commercial enterprise of magnitude began to absorb me at his time, and
      somehow the building of this home&mdash;the first that we possessed was
      not the event it should have been; there were moments when I felt cheated,
      when I wondered what had become of that capacity for enjoyment which in my
      youth had been so keen. I remember indeed, one grey evening when I went
      there alone, after the workmen had departed, and stood in the litter of
      mortar and bricks and boards gazing at the completed front of the house.
      It was even larger than I had imagined it from the plans; in the Summer
      twilight there was an air about it,&mdash;if not precisely menacing, at
      least portentous, with its gaping windows and towering roof. I was a
      little tired from a hard day; I had the odd feeding of having raised up
      something with which&mdash;momentarily at least&mdash;I doubted my ability
      to cope: something huge, impersonal; something that ought to have
      represented a fireside, a sanctuary, and yet was the embodiment of an
      element quite alien to the home; a restless element with which our
      American atmosphere had, by invisible degrees, become charged. As I stared
      at it, the odd fancy seized me that the building somehow typified my own
      career.... I had gained something, in truth, but had I not also missed
      something? something a different home would have embodied?
    </p>
    <p>
      Maude and the children had gone, to the seaside.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a vague uneasiness I turned away from the contemplation of those
      walls. The companion mansions were closed, their blinds tightly drawn; the
      neighbourhood was as quiet as the country, save for a slight but
      persistent noise that impressed itself on my consciousness. I walked
      around the house to spy in the back yard; a young girl rather stealthily
      gathering laths, and fragments of joists and flooring, and loading them
      into a child's express-wagon. She started when she saw me. She was little,
      more than a child, and the loose calico dress she wore seemed to emphasize
      her thinness. She stood stock-still, staring at me with frightened yet
      defiant eyes. I, too, felt a strange timidity in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you stop?&rdquo; I asked at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, is this your heap?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I acknowledged it. A hint of awe widened her eyes. Then site glanced at
      the half-filled wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This stuff ain't no use to you, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm glad to have you take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shifted to the other foot, but did not continue her gathering. An
      impulse seized me, I put down my walkingstick and began picking up pieces
      of wood, flinging them into the wagon. I looked at her again, rather
      furtively; she had not moved. Her attitude puzzled me, for it was one
      neither of surprise nor of protest. The spectacle of the &ldquo;millionaire&rdquo;
       owner of the house engaged in this menial occupation gave her no thrills.
      I finished the loading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; I said, and drew a dollar bill out of my pocket and gave it to
      her. Even then she did not thank me, but took up the wagon tongue and went
      off, leaving on me a disheartening impression of numbness, of life crushed
      out. I glanced up once more at the mansion I had built for myself looming
      in the dusk, and walked hurriedly away....
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon some three weeks after we had moved into the new house, I
      came out of the Club, where I had been lunching in conference with Scherer
      and two capitalists from New York. It was after four o'clock, the day was
      fading, the street lamps were beginning to cast sickly streaks of
      jade-coloured light across the slush of the pavements. It was the sight of
      this slush (which for a brief half hour that morning had been pure snow,
      and had sent Matthew and Moreton and Biddy into ecstasies at the notion of
      a &ldquo;real Christmas&rdquo;), that brought to my mind the immanence of the
      festival, and the fact that I had as yet bought no presents. Such was the
      predicament in which I usually found myself on Christmas eve; and it was
      not without a certain sense of annoyance at the task thus abruptly
      confronting me that I got into my automobile and directed the chauffeur to
      the shopping district. The crowds surged along the wet sidewalks and
      overflowed into the street, and over the heads of the people I stared at
      the blazing shop-windows decked out in Christmas greens. My chauffeur, a
      bristly-haired Parisian, blew his horn insolently, men and women jostled
      each other to get out of the way, their holiday mood giving place to
      resentment as they stared into the windows of the limousine. With the
      American inability to sit still I shifted from one corner of the seat to
      another, impatient at the slow progress of the machine: and I felt a
      certain contempt for human beings, that they should make all this fuss,
      burden themselves with all these senseless purchases, for a tradition. The
      automobile stopped, and I fought my way across the sidewalk into the store
      of that time-honoured firm, Elgin, Yates and Garner, pausing uncertainly
      before the very counter where, some ten years before, I had bought an
      engagement ring. Young Mr. Garner himself spied me, and handing over a
      customer to a tired clerk, hurried forward to greet me, his manner
      implying that my entrance was in some sort an event. I had become used to
      this aroma of deference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I show you, Mr. Paret?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;I'm looking around,&rdquo; I said, vaguely, bewildered by
      the glittering baubles by which I was confronted. What did Maude want?
      While I was gazing into the case, Mr. Garner opened a safe behind him,
      laying before me a large sapphire set with diamonds in a platinum brooch;
      a beautiful stone, in the depths of it gleaming a fire like a star in an
      arctic sky. I had not given Maude anything of value of late. Decidedly,
      this was of value; Mr. Garner named the price glibly; if Mrs. Paret didn't
      care for it, it might be brought back or exchanged. I took it, with a sigh
      of relief. Leaving the store, I paused on the edge of the rushing stream
      of humanity, with the problem of the children's gifts still to be solved.
      I thought of my own childhood, when at Christmastide I had walked with my
      mother up and down this very street, so changed and modernized now;
      recalling that I had had definite desires, desperate ones; but my
      imagination failed me when I tried to summon up the emotions connected
      with them. I had no desires now: I could buy anything in reason in the
      whole street. What did Matthew and Moreton want? and little Biddy? Maude
      had not &ldquo;spoiled&rdquo; them; but they didn't seem to have any definite wants.
      The children made me think, with a sudden softening, of Tom Peters, and I
      went into a tobacconist's and bought him a box of expensive cigars. Then I
      told the chauffeur to take me to a toy-shop, where I stood staring through
      a plate-glass window at the elaborate playthings devised for the modern
      children of luxury. In the centre was a toy man-of-war, three feet in
      length, with turrets and guns, and propellers and a real steam-engine. As
      a boy I should have dreamed about it, schemed for it, bartered my immortal
      soul for it. But&mdash;if I gave it to Matthew, what was there for
      Moreton? A steam locomotive caught my eye, almost as elaborate. Forcing my
      way through the doors, I captured a salesman, and from a state bordering
      on nervous collapse he became galvanized into an intense alertness and
      respect when he understood my desires. He didn't know the price of the
      objects in question. He brought the proprietor, an obsequious little
      German who, on learning my name, repeated it in every sentence. For Biddy
      I chose a doll that was all but human; when held by a young woman for my
      inspection, it elicited murmurs of admiration from the women shoppers by
      whom we were surrounded. The proprietor promised to make a special
      delivery of the three articles before seven o'clock....
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the automobile, after speeding up the asphalt of Grant Avenue,
      stopped before the new house. In spite of the change that house had made
      in my life, in three weeks I had become amazingly used to it; yet I had an
      odd feeling that Christmas eve as I stood under the portico with my key in
      the door, the same feeling of the impersonality of the place which I had
      experienced before. Not that for one moment I would have exchanged it for
      the smaller house we had left. I opened the door. How often, in that other
      house, I had come in the evening seeking quiet, my brain occupied with a
      problem, only to be annoyed by the romping of the children on the landing
      above. A noise in one end of it echoed to the other. But here, as I
      entered the hall, all was quiet: a dignified, deep-carpeted stairway swept
      upward before me, and on either side were wide, empty rooms; and in the
      subdued light of one of them I saw a dark figure moving silently about&mdash;the
      butler. He came forward to relieve me, deftly, of my hat and overcoat.
      Well, I had it at last, this establishment to which I had for so long
      looked forward. And yet that evening, as I hesitated in the hall, I
      somehow was unable to grasp that it was real and permanent, the very
      solidity of the walls and doors paradoxically suggested transientness, the
      butler a flitting ghost. How still the place was! Almost oppressively
      still. I recalled oddly a story of a peasant who, yearning for the great
      life, had stumbled upon an empty palace, its tables set with food in
      golden dishes. Before two days had passed he had fled from it in horror
      back to his crowded cottage and his drudgery in the fields. Never once had
      the sense of possession of the palace been realized. Nor did I feel that I
      possessed this house, though I had the deeds of it in my safe and the
      receipted bills in my files. It eluded me; seemed, in my bizarre mood of
      that evening, almost to mock me. &ldquo;You have built me,&rdquo; it seemed to say,
      &ldquo;but I am stronger than you, because you have not earned me.&rdquo; Ridiculous,
      when the years of my labour and the size of my bank account were
      considered! Such, however, is the verbal expression of my feeling. Was the
      house empty, after all? Had something happened? With a slight panicky
      sensation I climbed the stairs, with their endless shallow treads, to
      hurry through the silent hallway to the schoolroom. Reassuring noises came
      faintly through the heavy door. I opened it. Little Biddy was careening
      round and round, crying out:&mdash;&ldquo;To-morrow's Chris'mas! Santa Claus is
      coming tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew was regarding her indulgently, sympathetically, Moreton rather
      scornfully. The myth had been exploded for both, but Matthew still hugged
      it. That was the difference between them. Maude, seated on the floor,
      perceived me first, and glanced up at me with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's father!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy stopped in the midst of a pirouette. At the age of seven she was
      still shy with me, and retreated towards Maude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't we going to have a tree, father?&rdquo; demanded Moreton, aggressively.
      &ldquo;Mother won't tell us&mdash;neither will Miss Allsop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Allsop was their governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you want a tree?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for Biddy,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't be Christmas without a tree,&rdquo; Matthew declared, &ldquo;&mdash;and
      Santa Claus,&rdquo; he added, for his sister's benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Santa Claus, when he sees we've got this big house, will think we
      don't need anything, and go on to some poorer children,&rdquo; said Maude. &ldquo;You
      wouldn't blame him if he did that,&mdash;would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The response to this appeal cannot be said to have been enthusiastic....
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, when at last all of them were in bed, we dressed the tree;
      it might better be said that Maude and Miss Allsop dressed it, while I
      gave a perfunctory aid. Both the women took such a joy in the process,
      vying with each other in getting effects, and as I watched them eagerly
      draping the tinsel and pinning on the glittering ornaments I wondered why
      it was that I was unable to find the same joy as they. Thus it had been
      every Christmas eve. I was always tired when I got home, and after dinner
      relaxation set in.
    </p>
    <p>
      An electrician had come while we were at the table, and had fastened on
      the little electric bulbs which did duty as candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Maude, as she stood off to survey the effect, &ldquo;isn't it
      beautiful! Come, Miss Allsop, let's get the presents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They flew out of the room, and presently hurried back with their arms full
      of the usual parcels: parcels from Maude's family in Elkington, from my
      own relatives, from the Blackwoods and the Peterses, from Nancy. In the
      meantime I had had my own contributions brought up, the man of war, the
      locomotive, the big doll. Maude stood staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, they'll be utterly ruined!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The boys might as well have something instructive,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and as
      for Biddy&mdash;nothing's too good for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might have known you wouldn't forget them, although you are so
      busy.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      We filled the three stockings hung by the great fireplace. Then, with a
      last lingering look at the brightness of the tree, she stood in the
      doorway and turned the electric switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not before seven to-morrow morning, Miss Allsop,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Hugh, you
      will get up, won't you? You mustn't miss seeing them. You can go back to
      bed again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently, this was Reality to Maude. And had it not been one of my dreams
      of marriage, this preparing for the children's Christmas, remembering the
      fierce desires of my own childhood? It struck me, after I had kissed her
      good night and retired to my dressing-room, that fierce desires burned
      within me still, but the objects towards which their flames leaped out
      differed. That was all. Had I remained a child, since my idea of pleasure
      was still that of youth? The craving far excitement, adventure, was still
      unslaked; the craving far freedom as keen as ever. During the whole of my
      married life, I had been conscious of an inner protest against &ldquo;settling
      down,&rdquo; as Tom Peters had settled down. The smaller house from which we had
      moved, with its enforced propinquity, hard emphasized the bondage of
      marriage. Now I had two rooms to myself, in the undisputed possession of
      which I had taken a puerile delight. On one side of my dressing-room
      Archie Lammerton had provided a huge closet containing the latest devices
      for the keeping of a multitudinous wardrobe; there was a reading-lamp, and
      the easiest of easy-chairs, imported from England, while between the
      windows were shelves of Italian walnut which I had filled with the books I
      had bought while at Cambridge, and had never since opened. As I sank down
      in my chair that odd feeling of uneasiness, of transience and unreality,
      of unsatisfaction I had had ever since we had moved suddenly became
      intensified, and at the very moment when I had gained everything I had
      once believed a man could desire! I was successful, I was rich, my health
      had not failed, I had a wife who catered to my wishes, lovable children
      who gave no trouble and yet&mdash;there was still the void to be filled,
      the old void I had felt as a boy, the longing for something beyond me, I
      knew not what; there was the strange inability to taste any of these
      things, the need at every turn for excitement, for a stimulus. My marriage
      had been a disappointment, though I strove to conceal this from myself; a
      disappointment because it had not filled the requirements of my category&mdash;excitement
      and mystery: I had provided the setting and lacked the happiness. Another
      woman Nancy&mdash;might have given me the needed stimulation; and yet my
      thoughts did not dwell on Nancy that night, my longings were not directed
      towards her, but towards the vision of a calm, contented married happiness
      I had looked forward to in youth,&mdash;a vision suddenly presented once
      more by the sight of Maude's simple pleasure in dressing the Christmas
      tree. What restless, fiendish element in me prevented my enjoying that? I
      had something of the fearful feeling of a ghost in my own house and among
      my own family, of a spirit doomed to wander, unable to share in what
      should have been my own, in what would have saved me were I able to
      partake of it. Was it too late to make that effort?... Presently the
      strains of music pervaded my consciousness, the chimes of Trinity ringing
      out in the damp night the Christmas hymn, Adeste Fideles. It was midnight
      it was Christmas. How clear the notes rang through the wet air that came
      in at my window! Back into the dim centuries that music led me, into
      candle-lit Gothic chapels of monasteries on wind-swept heights above the
      firs, and cathedrals in mediaeval cities. Twilight ages of war and scourge
      and stress and storm&mdash;and faith. &ldquo;Oh, come, all ye Faithful!&rdquo; What a
      strange thing, that faith whose flame so marvellously persisted, piercing
      the gloom; the Christmas myth, as I had heard someone once call it. Did it
      possess the power to save me? Save me from what? Ah, in this hour I knew.
      In the darkness the Danger loomed up before me, vague yet terrible, and I
      trembled. Why was not this Thing ever present, to chasten and sober me?
      The Thing was myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into my remembrance, by what suggestion I know not, came that March
      evening when I had gone to Holder Chapel at Harvard to listen to a
      preacher, a personality whose fame and influence had since spread
      throughout the land. Some dim fear had possessed me then. I recalled
      vividly the man, and the face of Hermann Krebs as I drew back from the
      doorway....
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke my disquieting, retrospective mood had disappeared, and yet
      there clung to me, minus the sanction of fear or reward or revealed truth,
      a certain determination to behave, on this day at least, more like a
      father and a husband: to make an effort to enter into the spirit of the
      festival, and see what happened. I dressed in cheerful haste, took the
      sapphire pendant from its velvet box, tiptoed into the still silent
      schoolroom and hung it on the tree, flooding on the electric light that
      set the tinsel and globes ablaze. No sooner had I done this than I heard
      the patter of feet in the hallway, and a high-pitched voice&mdash;Biddy's&mdash;crying
      out:&mdash;&ldquo;It's Santa Claus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three small, flannel-wrappered figures stood in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it's father!&rdquo; exclaimed Moreton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he's all dressed!&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh-h-h!&rdquo; cried Biddy, staring at the blazing tree, &ldquo;isn't it beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maude was close behind them. She gave an exclamation of delighted surprise
      when she saw me, and then stood gazing with shining eyes at the children,
      especially at Biddy, who stood dazzled by the glory of the constellation
      confronting her.... Matthew, too, wished to prolong the moment of mystery.
      It was the practical Moreton who cried:&mdash;&ldquo;Let's see what we've got!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assault and the sacking began. I couldn't help thinking as I watched
      them of my own wildly riotous, Christmas-morning sensations, when all the
      gifts had worn the aura of the supernatural; but the arrival of these toys
      was looked upon by my children as a part of the natural order of the
      universe. At Maude's suggestion the night before we had placed my
      presents, pieces de resistance, at a distance from the tree, in the hope
      that they would not be spied at once, that they would be in some sort a
      climax. It was Matthew who first perceived the ship, and identified it, by
      the card, as his property. To him it was clearly wonderful, but no
      miracle. He did not cry out, or call the attention of the others to it,
      but stood with his feet apart, examining it, his first remark being a
      query as to why it didn't fly the American flag. It's ensign was British.
      Then Moreton saw the locomotive, was told that it was his, and took
      possession of it violently. Why wasn't there more track? Wouldn't I get
      more track? I explained that it would go by steam, and he began unscrewing
      the cap on the little boiler until he was distracted by the man-of-war,
      and with natural acquisitiveness started to take possession of that. Biddy
      was bewildered by the doll, which Maude had taken up and was holding in
      her lap. She had had talking dolls before, and dolls that closed their
      eyes; she recognized this one, indeed, as a sort of super-doll, but her
      little mind was modern, too, and set no limits on what might be
      accomplished. She patted it, but was more impressed by the raptures of
      Miss Allsop, who had come in and was admiring it with some extravagance.
      Suddenly the child caught sight of her stocking, until now forgotten, and
      darted for the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned to Maude, who stood beside me, watching them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you haven't looked on the tree yourself,&rdquo; I reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me an odd, questioning glance, and got up and set down the doll.
      As she stood for a moment gazing at the lights, she seemed very girlish in
      her dressing-gown, with her hair in two long plaits down her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh!&rdquo; She lifted the pendant from the branch and held it up. Her
      gratitude, her joy at receiving a present was deeper than the children's!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You chose it for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt something like a pang when I thought how little trouble it had
      been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't like it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;or wish to have it changed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Changed!&rdquo; she exclaimed reproachfully. &ldquo;Do you think I'd change it? Only&mdash;it's
      much too valuable&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled.... Miss Allsop deftly undid the clasp and hung it around Maude's
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How it suits you, Mrs. Paret!&rdquo; she cried....
    </p>
    <p>
      This pendant was by no means the only present I had given Maude in recent
      years, and though she cared as little for jewels as for dress she seemed
      to attach to it a peculiar value and significance that disturbed and smote
      me, for the incident had revealed a love unchanged and unchangeable. Had
      she taken my gift as a sign that my indifference was melting?
    </p>
    <p>
      As I went downstairs and into the library to read the financial page of
      the morning newspaper I asked myself, with a certain disquiet, whether, in
      the formal, complicated, and luxurious conditions in which we now lived it
      might be possible to build up new ties and common interests. I reflected
      that this would involve confessions and confidences on my part, since
      there was a whole side of my life of which Maude knew nothing. I had
      convinced myself long ago that a man's business career was no affair of
      his wife's: I had justified that career to myself: yet I had always had a
      vague feeling that Maude, had she known the details, would not have
      approved of it. Impossible, indeed, for a woman to grasp these problems.
      They were outside of her experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, something might be done to improve our relationship,
      something which would relieve me of that uneasy lack of unity I felt when
      at home, of the lassitude and ennui I was wont to feel creeping over me on
      Sundays and holidays....

    <h2>
      XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I find in relating those parts of my experience that seem to be of most
      significance I have neglected to tell of my mother's death, which occurred
      the year before we moved to Grant Avenue. She had clung the rest of her
      days to the house in which I had been born. Of late years she had lived in
      my children, and Maude's devotion to her had been unflagging. Truth
      compels me to say that she had long ceased to be a factor in my life. I
      have thought of her in later years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coincident with the unexpected feeling of fruitlessness that came to me
      with the Grant Avenue house, of things achieved but not realized or
      appreciated, was the appearance of a cloud on the business horizon; or
      rather on the political horizon, since it is hard to separate the two
      realms. There were signs, for those who could read, of a rising popular
      storm. During the earliest years of the new century the political
      atmosphere had changed, the public had shown a tendency to grow restless;
      and everybody knows how important it is for financial operations, for
      prosperity, that the people should mind their own business. In short, our
      commercial-romantic pilgrimage began to meet with unexpected resistance.
      It was as though the nation were entering into a senseless conspiracy to
      kill prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, in regard to the Presidency of the United States, a
      cog had unwittingly been slipped. It had always been recognized&mdash;as I
      have said&mdash;by responsible financial personages that the impulses of
      the majority of Americans could not be trusted, that these&mdash;who had
      inherited illusions of freedom&mdash;must be governed firmly yet with
      delicacy; unknown to them, their Presidents must be chosen for them,
      precisely as Mr. Watling had been chosen for the people of our state, and
      the popular enthusiasm manufactured later. There were informal meetings in
      New York, in Washington, where candidates were discussed; not that such
      and such a man was settled upon,&mdash;it was a process of elimination.
      Usually the affair had gone smoothly. For instance, a while before, a
      benevolent capitalist of the middle west, an intimate of Adolf Scherer,
      had become obsessed with the idea that a friend of his was the safest and
      sanest man for the head of the nation, had convinced his
      fellow-capitalists of this, whereupon he had gone ahead to spend his
      energy and his money freely to secure the nomination and election of this
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Republican National Committee, the Republican National Convention were
      allowed to squabble to their hearts' content as to whether Smith, Jones or
      Brown should be nominated, but it was clearly understood that if Robinson
      or White were chosen there would be no corporation campaign funds. This
      applied also to the Democratic party, on the rare occasions when it seemed
      to have an opportunity of winning. Now, however, through an unpardonable
      blunder, there had got into the White House a President who was inclined
      to ignore advice, who appealed over the heads of the &ldquo;advisers&rdquo; to the
      populace; who went about tilting at the industrial structures we had so
      painfully wrought, and in frequent blasts of presidential messages
      enunciated new and heretical doctrines; who attacked the railroads,
      encouraged the brazen treason of labour unions, inspired an army of
      &ldquo;muck-rakers&rdquo; to fill the magazines with the wildest and most violent of
      language. State legislatures were emboldened to pass mischievous and
      restrictive laws, and much of my time began to be occupied in inducing, by
      various means, our courts to declare these unconstitutional. How we sighed
      for a business man or a lawyer in the White House! The country had gone
      mad, the stock-market trembled, the cry of &ldquo;corporation control&rdquo; resounded
      everywhere, and everywhere demagogues arose to inaugurate &ldquo;reform
      campaigns,&rdquo; in an abortive attempt to &ldquo;clean up politics.&rdquo; Down with the
      bosses, who were the tools of the corporations!
    </p>
    <p>
      In our own city, which we fondly believed to be proof against the
      prevailing madness, a slight epidemic occurred; slight, yet momentarily
      alarming. Accidents will happen, even in the best regulated political
      organizations,&mdash;and accidents in these days appeared to be the rule.
      A certain Mr. Edgar Greenhalge, a middle-aged, mild-mannered and
      inoffensive man who had made a moderate fortune in wholesale drugs, was
      elected to the School Board. Later on some of us had reason to suspect
      that Perry Blackwood&mdash;with more astuteness than he had been given
      credit for&mdash;was responsible for Mr. Greenhalge's candidacy. At any
      rate, he was not a man to oppose, and in his previous life had given no
      hint that he might become a trouble maker. Nothing happened for several
      months. But one day on which I had occasion to interview Mr. Jason on a
      little matter of handing over to the Railroad a piece of land belonging to
      the city, which was known as Billings' Bowl, he inferred that Mr.
      Greenhaige might prove a disturber of that profound peace with which the
      city administration had for many years been blessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the hell is he?&rdquo; was Mr. Jason's question.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that Mr. G.'s private life had been investigated, with
      disappointingly barren results; he was, seemingly, an anomalistic being in
      our Nietzschean age, an unaggressive man; he had never sold any drugs to
      the city; he was not a church member; nor could it be learned that he had
      ever wandered into those byways of the town where Mr. Jason might easily
      have got trace of him: if he had any vices, he kept them locked up in a
      safe-deposit box that could not be &ldquo;located.&rdquo; He was very genial, and had
      a way of conveying disturbing facts&mdash;when he wished to convey them&mdash;under
      cover of the most amusing stories. Mr. Jason was not a man to get panicky.
      Greenhalge could be handled all right, only&mdash;what was there in it for
      Greenhalge?&mdash;a nut difficult for Mr. Jason to crack. The two other
      members of the School Board were solid. Here again the wisest of men was
      proved to err, for Mr. Greenhalge turned out to have powers of persuasion;
      he made what in religious terms would have been called a conversion in the
      case of another member of the board, an hitherto staunch old reprobate by
      the name of Muller, an ex-saloon-keeper in comfortable circumstances to
      whom the idea of public office had appealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Greenhalge, having got wind of certain transactions that interested
      him extremely, brought them in his good-natured way to the knowledge of
      Mr. Gregory, the district attorney, suggesting that he investigate. Mr.
      Gregory smiled; undertook, as delicately as possible, to convey to Mr.
      Greenhalge the ways of the world, and of the political world in
      particular, wherein, it seemed, everyone was a good fellow. Mr. Greenhalge
      was evidently a good fellow, and didn't want to make trouble over little
      things. No, Mr. Greenhalge didn't want to make trouble; he appreciated a
      comfortable life as much as Mr. Gregory; he told the district attorney a
      funny story which might or might not have had an application to the
      affair, and took his leave with the remark that he had been happy to make
      Mr. Gregory's acquaintance. On his departure the district attorney's
      countenance changed. He severely rebuked a subordinate for some trivial
      mistake, and walked as rapidly as he could carry his considerable weight
      to Monahan's saloon.... One of the things Mr. Gregory had pointed out
      incidentally was that Mr. Greenhalge's evidence was vague, and that a
      grand jury wanted facts, which might be difficult to obtain. Mr.
      Greenhalge, thinking over the suggestion, sent for Krebs. In the course of
      a month or two the investigation was accomplished, Greenhalge went back to
      Gregory; who repeated his homilies, whereupon he was handed a hundred or
      so typewritten pages of evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dramatic moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gregory resorted to pleading. He was sure that Mr. Greenhalge didn't
      want to be disagreeable, it was true and unfortunate that such things were
      so, but they would be amended: he promised all his influence to amend
      them. The public conscience, said Mr. Gregory, was being aroused. Now how
      much better for the party, for the reputation, the fair name of the city
      if these things could be corrected quietly, and nobody indicted or tried!
      Between sensible and humane men, wasn't that the obvious way? After the
      election, suit could be brought to recover the money. But Mr. Greenhalge
      appeared to be one of those hopeless individuals without a spark of party
      loyalty; he merely continued to smile, and to suggest that the district
      attorney prosecute. Mr. Gregory temporized, and presently left the city on
      a vacation. A day or two after his second visit to the district attorney's
      office Mr. Greenhalge had a call from the city auditor and the purchasing
      agent, who talked about their families,&mdash;which was very painful. It
      was also intimated to Mr. Greenhalge by others who accosted him that he
      was just the man for mayor. He smiled, and modestly belittled his
      qualifications....
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, one fine morning, a part of the evidence Krebs had gathered
      appeared in the columns of the Mail and State, a new and enterprising
      newspaper for which the growth and prosperity of our city were
      responsible; the sort of &ldquo;revelations&rdquo; that stirred to amazement and wrath
      innocent citizens of nearly every city in our country: politics and
      &ldquo;graft&rdquo; infesting our entire educational system, teachers and janitors
      levied upon, prices that took the breath away paid to favoured firms for
      supplies, specifications so worded that reasonable bids were barred. The
      respectable firm of Ellery and Knowles was involved. In spite of our
      horror, we were Americans and saw the humour of the situation, and laughed
      at the caricature in the Mail and State representing a scholar holding up
      a pencil and a legend under it, &ldquo;No, it's not gold, but it ought to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here I must enter into a little secret history. Any affair that threatened
      the integrity of Mr. Jason's organization was of serious moment to the
      gentlemen of the financial world who found that organization invaluable
      and who were also concerned about the fair name of their community; a
      conference in the Boyne Club decided that the city officials were being
      persecuted, and entitled therefore to &ldquo;the very best of counsel,&rdquo;&mdash;in
      this instance, Mr. Hugh Paret. It was also thought wise by Mr. Dickinson,
      Mr. Gorse, and Mr. Grierson, and by Mr. Paret himself that he should not
      appear in the matter; an aspiring young attorney, Mr. Arbuthnot, was
      retained to conduct the case in public. Thus capital came to the
      assistance of Mr. Jason, a fund was raised, and I was given carte blanche
      to defend the miserable city auditor and purchasing agent, both of whom
      elicited my sympathy; for they were stout men, and rapidly losing weight.
      Our first care was to create a delay in the trial of the case in order to
      give the public excitement a chance to die down. For the public is
      proverbially unable to fix its attention for long on one object,
      continually demanding the distraction that our newspapers make it their
      business to supply. Fortunately, a murder was committed in one of our
      suburbs, creating a mystery that filled the &ldquo;extras&rdquo; for some weeks, and
      this was opportunely followed by the embezzlement of a considerable sum by
      the cashier of one of our state banks. Public interest was divided between
      baseball and the tracking of this criminal to New Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our resentment was directed, not so much against Commissioner Greenhalge
      as against Krebs. It is curious how keen is the instinct of men like
      Grierson, Dickinson, Tallant and Scherer for the really dangerous
      opponent. Who the deuce was this man Krebs? Well, I could supply them with
      some information: they doubtless recalled the Galligan, case; and Miller
      Gorse, who forgot nothing, also remembered his opposition in the
      legislature to House Bill 709. He had continued to be the obscure legal
      champion of &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; labour, but how he had managed to keep body and
      soul together I knew not. I had encountered him occasionally in court
      corridors or on the street; he did not seem to change much; nor did he
      appear in our brief and perfunctory conversations to bear any resentment
      against me for the part I had taken in the Galligan affair. I avoided him
      when it was possible.... I had to admit that he had done a remarkably good
      piece of work in collecting Greenhalge's evidence, and how the erring city
      officials were to be rescued became a matter of serious concern. Gregory,
      the district attorney, was in an abject funk; in any case a mediocre
      lawyer, after the indictment he was no help at all. I had to do all the
      work, and after we had selected the particular &ldquo;Railroad&rdquo; judge before
      whom the case was to be tried, I talked it over with him. His name was
      Notting, he understood perfectly what was required of him, and that he was
      for the moment the chief bulwark on which depended the logical interests
      of capital and sane government for their defence; also, his re-election
      was at stake. It was indicated to newspapers (such as the Mail and State)
      showing a desire to keep up public interest in the affair that their
      advertising matter might decrease; Mr. Sherrill's great department store,
      for instance, did not approve of this sort of agitation. Certain
      stationers, booksellers and other business men had got &ldquo;cold feet,&rdquo; as Mr.
      Jason put it, the prospect of bankruptcy suddenly looming ahead of them,&mdash;since
      the Corn National Bank held certain paper....
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, when the case did come to trial, it &ldquo;blew up,&rdquo; as one of our
      ward leaders dynamically expressed it. Several important witnesses were
      mysteriously lacking, and two or three school-teachers had suddenly
      decided&mdash;to take a trip to Europe. The district attorney was ill, and
      assigned the prosecution to a mild assistant; while a sceptical jury&mdash;composed
      largely of gentlemen who had the business interests of the community, and
      of themselves, at heart returned a verdict of &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo; This was the
      signal for severely dignified editorials in Mr. Tallant's and other
      conservative newspapers, hinting that it might be well in the future for
      all well-meaning but misguided reformers to think twice before subjecting
      the city to the cost of such trials, and uselessly attempting to inflame
      public opinion and upset legitimate business. The Era expressed the
      opinion that no city in the United States was &ldquo;more efficiently and
      economically governed than our own.&rdquo; &ldquo;Irregularities&rdquo; might well occur in
      every large organization; and it would better have become Mr. Greenhalge
      if, instead of hiring an unknown lawyer thirsting for notoriety to cook up
      charges, he had called the attention of the proper officials to the
      matter, etc., etc. The Pilot alone, which relied on sensation for its
      circulation, kept hammering away for a time with veiled accusations. But
      our citizens had become weary....
    </p>
    <p>
      As a topic, however, this effective suppression of reform was referred to
      with some delicacy by my friends and myself. Our interference had been
      necessary and therefore justified, but we were not particularly proud of
      it, and our triumph had a temporarily sobering effect. It was about this
      time, if I remember correctly, that Mr. Dickinson gave the beautiful
      stained-glass window to the church....
    </p>
    <p>
      Months passed. One day, having occasion to go over to the Boyne Iron Works
      to get information at first hand from certain officials, and having
      finished my business, I boarded a South Side electric car standing at the
      terminal. Just before it started Krebs came down the aisle of the car and
      took the seat in front of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo; He turned in surprise, and thrust his big,
      bony hand across the back of the seat. &ldquo;Come and sit here.&rdquo; He came. &ldquo;Do
      you ever get back to Cambridge in these days?&rdquo; I asked cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since I graduated from newspaper work in Boston. That's a good many
      years ago. By the way, our old landlady died this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;?&rdquo; &ldquo;Granite Face,&rdquo; I was about to say. I had forgotten
      her name, but that homesick scene when Tom and I stood before our open
      trunks, when Krebs had paid us a visit, came back to me. &ldquo;You've kept in
      touch with her?&rdquo; I asked, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Krebs, &ldquo;she was one of the few friends I had at Cambridge. I
      had a letter from the daughter last week. She's done very well, and is an
      instructor in biology in one of the western universities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was silent a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you,&mdash;you never married, did you?&rdquo; I inquired, somewhat
      irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His semi-humorous gesture seemed to deny that such a luxury was for him.
      The conversation dragged a little; I began to feel the curiosity he
      invariably inspired. What was his life? What were his beliefs? And I was
      possessed by a certain militancy, a desire to &ldquo;smoke him out.&rdquo; I did not
      stop to reflect that mine was in reality a defensive rather than an
      aggressive attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you live down here, in this part of the city?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he boarded in Fowler Street. I knew it as in a district given over to
      the small houses of working-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are still a socialist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am,&rdquo; he admitted, and added, &ldquo;at any rate, that is as near as
      you can get to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it fairly definite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fairly, if my notions are taken in general as the antithesis of what you
      fellows believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The abolition of property, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The abolition of too much property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by 'too much'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it ceases to be real to a man, when it represents more than his
      need, when it drives him and he becomes a slave to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Involuntarily I thought of my new house,&mdash;not a soothing reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who is going to decree how much property, a man should have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody&mdash;everybody. That will gradually tend to work itself out as we
      become more sensible and better educated, and understand more clearly what
      is good for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I retorted with the stock, common-sense phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we had a division to-morrow, within a few years or so the most
      efficient would contrive to get the bulk of it back in their hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But we're not going to have a division
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 'efficient' will have to die or be educated first. That will take
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Educated!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paret, have you ever read any serious books on what you call socialism?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I threw out an impatient negative. I was going on to protest that I was
      not ignorant of the doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what you call socialism is merely what you believe to be the more or
      less crude and utopian propaganda of an obscure political party. That
      isn't socialism. Nor is the anomalistic attempt that the Christian
      Socialists make to unite modern socialistic philosophy with Christian
      orthodoxy, socialism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is socialism, then?&rdquo; I demanded, somewhat defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's call it education, science,&rdquo; he said smilingly, &ldquo;economics and
      government based on human needs and a rational view of religion. It has
      been taught in German universities, and it will be taught in ours whenever
      we shall succeed in inducing your friends, by one means or another, not to
      continue endowing them. Socialism, in the proper sense, is merely the
      application of modern science to government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was puzzled and angry. What he said made sense somehow, but it sounded
      to me like so much gibberish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Germany is a monarchy,&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a modern, scientific system with monarchy as its superstructure. It
      is anomalous, but frank. The monarchy is there for all men to see, and
      some day it will be done away with. We are supposedly a democracy, and our
      superstructure is plutocratic. Our people feel the burden, but they have
      not yet discovered what the burden is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when they do?&rdquo; I asked, a little defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they do,&rdquo; replied Krebs, &ldquo;they will set about making the plutocrats
      happy. Now plutocrats are discontented, and never satisfied; the more they
      get, the more they want, the more they are troubled by what other people
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled in spite of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your interest in&mdash;in plutocrats is charitable, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my interest in all kinds of people is charitable.
      However improbable it may seem, I have no reason to dislike or envy people
      who have more than they know what to do with.&rdquo; And the worst of it was he
      looked it. He managed somehow simply by sitting there with his strange
      eyes fixed upon me&mdash;in spite of his ridiculous philosophy&mdash;to
      belittle my ambitions, to make of small worth my achievements, to bring
      home to me the fact that in spite of these I was neither contented nor
      happy though he kept his humour and his poise, he implied an experience
      that was far deeper, more tragic and more significant than mine. I was
      goaded into making an injudicious remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your campaign against Ennerly and Jackson fell through, didn't it?&rdquo;
       Ennerly and Jackson were the city officials who had been tried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't a campaign against them,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;And considering the
      subordinate part I took in it, it could scarcely be called mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greenhalge turned to you to get the evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I got it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I say, Paret,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;You ought to know, if
      anyone knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I considered this a moment, more soberly. I thought I might have counted
      on my fingers the number of men cognizant of my connection with the case.
      I decided that he was guessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you should explain that,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time may come, when you'll have to explain it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that a threat?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A threat?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are accusing me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; he interrupted suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made it necessary for me to define the nature of his charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of having had some connection with the affair in question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever else I may be, I'm not a fool,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Neither the
      district attorney's office, nor young Arbuthnot had brains enough to get
      them out of that scrape. Jason didn't have influence enough with the
      judiciary, and, as I happen to know, there was a good deal of money
      spent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be called upon to prove it,&rdquo; I retorted, rather hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone, far from being defiant, had in it a note of sadness. I looked at
      him. What were his potentialities? Was it not just possible that I should
      have to revise my idea of him, acknowledge that he might become more
      formidable than I had thought?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an awkward silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't imagine, Paret, that I have any personal animus against you,
      or against any of the men with whom you're associated,&rdquo; he went on, after
      a moment. &ldquo;I'm sorry you're on that side, that's all,&mdash;I told you so
      once before. I'm not calling you names, I'm not talking about morality and
      immorality. Immorality, when you come down to it, is often just the
      opposition to progress that comes from blindness. I don't make the mistake
      of blaming a few individuals for the evils of modern industrial society,
      and on the other hand you mustn't blame individuals for the discomforts of
      what you call the reform movement, for that movement is merely a symptom&mdash;a
      symptom of a disease due to a change in the structure of society. We'll
      never have any happiness or real prosperity until we cure that disease. I
      was inclined to blame you once, at the capital that time, because it
      seemed to me that a man with all the advantages you have had and a mind
      like yours didn't have much excuse. But I've thought about it since; I
      realize now that I've had a good many more 'advantages' than you, and to
      tell you the truth, I don't see how you could have come out anywhere else
      than where you are,&mdash;all your surroundings and training were against
      it. That doesn't mean that you won't grasp the situation some day&mdash;I
      have an idea you will. It's just an idea. The man who ought to be
      condemned isn't the man that doesn't understand what's going on, but the
      man who comes to understand and persists in opposing it.&rdquo; He rose and
      looked down at me with the queer, disturbing smile I remembered. &ldquo;I get
      off at this corner,&rdquo; he added, rather diffidently. &ldquo;I hope you'll forgive
      me for being personal. I didn't mean to be, but you rather forced it on
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right,&rdquo; I replied. The car stopped, and he hurried off. I
      watched his tall figure as it disappeared among the crowd on the
      sidewalk....
    </p>
    <p>
      I returned to my office in one of those moods that are the more
      disagreeable because conflicting. To-day in particular I had been aroused
      by what Tom used to call Krebs's &ldquo;crust,&rdquo; and as I sat at my desk warm
      waves of resentment went through me at the very notion of his telling me
      that my view was limited and that therefore my professional conduct was to
      be forgiven! It was he, the fanatic, who saw things in the larger scale!
      an assumption the more exasperating because at the moment he made it he
      almost convinced me that he did, and I was unable to achieve for him the
      measure of contempt I desired, for the incident, the measure of ridicule
      it deserved. My real animus was due to the fact that he had managed to
      shake my self-confidence, to take the flavour out of my achievements,&mdash;a
      flavour that was in the course of an hour to be completely restored by one
      of those interesting coincidences occasionally occurring in life. A young
      member of my staff entered with a telegram; I tore it open, and sat
      staring at it a moment before I realized that it brought to me the
      greatest honour of my career.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Banker-Personality in New York had summoned me for consultation. To be
      recognized by him conferred indeed an ennoblement, the Star and Garter, so
      to speak, of the only great realm in America, that of high finance; and
      the yellow piece of paper I held in my hand instantly re-magnetized me,
      renewed my energy, and I hurried home to pack my bag in order to catch the
      seven o'clock train. I announced the news to Maude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagine it's because he knows I have made something of a study of the
      coal roads situation,&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad, Hugh,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I suppose it's a great compliment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Never had her inadequacy to appreciate my career been more apparent! I
      looked at her curiously, to realize once more with peculiar sharpness how
      far we were apart; but now the resolutions I had made&mdash;and never
      carried out&mdash;on that first Christmas in the new home were lacking.
      Indeed, it was the futility of such resolutions that struck me at this
      moment. If her manner had been merely one of indifference, it would in a
      way have been easier to bear; she was simply incapable of grasping the
      significance of the event, the meaning to me of the years of unceasing,
      ambitious effort it crowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is something of a recognition,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Is there anything I
      can get for you in New York? I don't know how long I shall have to stay&mdash;I'll
      telegraph you when I'm getting back.&rdquo; I kissed her and hurried out to the
      automobile. As I drove off I saw her still standing in the doorway looking
      after me.... In the station I had a few minutes to telephone Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't see me for a few days it's because I've gone to New York,&rdquo; I
      informed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something important, I'm sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you guess?&rdquo; I demanded, and heard her laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back soon and tell me about it,&rdquo; she said, and I walked,
      exhilarated, to the train.... As I sped through the night, staring out of
      the window into the darkness, I reflected on the man I was going to see.
      But at that time, although he represented to me the quintessence of
      achievement and power, I did not by any means grasp the many sided
      significance of the phenomenon he presented, though I was keenly aware of
      his influence, and that men spoke of him with bated breath. Presidents
      came and went, kings and emperors had responsibilities and were subject
      daily to annoyances, but this man was a law unto himself. He did exactly
      what he chose, and compelled other men to do it. Wherever commerce
      reigned,&mdash;and where did it not?&mdash;he was king and head of its
      Holy Empire, Pope and Emperor at once. For he had his code of ethics, his
      religion, and those who rebelled, who failed to conform, he
      excommunicated; a code something like the map of Europe,&mdash;apparently
      inconsistent in places. What I did not then comprehend was that he was the
      American Principle personified, the supreme individual assertion of the
      conviction that government should remain modestly in the background while
      the efficient acquired the supremacy that was theirs by natural right; nor
      had I grasped at that time the crowning achievement of a unity that fused
      Christianity with those acquisitive dispositions said to be inherent in
      humanity. In him the Lion and the Lamb, the Eagle and the Dove dwelt
      together in amity and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      New York, always a congenial place to gentlemen of vitality and means and
      influential connections, had never appeared to me more sparkling, more
      inspiring. Winter had relented, spring had not as yet begun. And as I sat
      in a corner of the dining-room of my hotel looking out on the sunlit
      avenue I was conscious of partaking of the vigour and confidence of the
      well-dressed, clear-eyed people who walked or drove past my window with
      the air of a conquering race. What else was there in the world more worth
      having than this conquering sense? Religion might offer charms to the
      weak. Yet here religion itself became sensible, and wore the garb of
      prosperity. The stonework of the tall church on the corner was all lace;
      and the very saints in their niches, who had known martyrdom and poverty,
      seemed to have renounced these as foolish, and to look down complacently
      on the procession of wealth and power.. Across the street, behind a sheet
      of glass, was a carrosserie where were displayed the shining yellow and
      black panels of a closed automobile, the cost of which would have built a
      farm-house and stocked a barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o'clock, the appointed hour, I was in Wall Street. Sending in my
      name, I was speedily ushered into a room containing a table, around which
      were several men; but my eyes were drawn at once to the figure of the
      great banker who sat, massive and preponderant, at one end, smoking a
      cigar, and listening in silence to the conversation I had interrupted. He
      rose courteously and gave me his hand, and a glance that is unforgettable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good of you to come, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; he said simply, as though his
      summons had not been a command. &ldquo;Perhaps you know some of these
      gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of them was our United States Senator, Theodore Watling. He, as it
      turned out, had been summoned from Washington. Of course I saw him
      frequently, having from time to time to go to Washington on various
      errands connected with legislation. Though spruce and debonnair as ever,
      in the black morning coat he invariably wore, he appeared older than he
      had on the day when I had entered his office. He greeted me warmly, as
      always.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, I'm glad to see you here,&rdquo; he said, with a slight emphasis on the
      last word. My legal career was reaching its logical climax, the climax he
      had foreseen. And he added, to the banker, that he had brought me up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he was trained in a good school,&rdquo; remarked that personage, affably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barbour, the president of our Railroad, was present, and nodded to me
      kindly; also a president of a smaller road. In addition, there were two
      New York attorneys of great prominence, whom I had met. The banker's own
      special lieutenant of the law, Mr. Clement T. Grolier, for whom I looked,
      was absent; but it was forthwith explained that he was offering, that
      morning, a resolution of some importance in the Convention of his Church,
      but that he would be present after lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have asked you to come here, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; said the banker, &ldquo;not only
      because I know something personally of your legal ability, but because I
      have been told by Mr. Scherer and Mr. Barbour that you happen to have
      considerable knowledge of the situation we are discussing, as well as some
      experience with cases involving that statute somewhat hazy to lay minds,
      the Sherman anti-trust law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile went around the table. Mr. Watling winked at me; I nodded, but
      said nothing. The banker was not a man to listen to superfluous words. The
      keynote of his character was despatch....
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of the conference, like many questions bitterly debated and
      fought over in their time, has in the year I write these words come to be
      of merely academic interest. Indeed, the very situation we discussed that
      day has been cited in some of our modern text-books as a classic
      consequence of that archaic school of economics to which the name of
      Manchester is attached. Some half dozen or so of the railroads running
      through the anthracite coal region had pooled their interests,&mdash;an
      extremely profitable proceeding. The public paid. We deemed it quite
      logical that the public should pay&mdash;having been created largely for
      that purpose; and very naturally we resented the fact that the meddling
      Person who had got into the White House without asking anybody's leave,&mdash;who
      apparently did not believe in the infallibility of our legal Bible, the
      Constitution,&mdash;should maintain that the anthracite roads had formed a
      combination in restraint of trade, should lay down the preposterous
      doctrine&mdash;so subversive of the Rights of Man&mdash;that railroads
      should not own coal mines. Congress had passed a law to meet this
      contention, suit had been brought, and in the lower court the government
      had won.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day wore on our numbers increased, we were joined by other lawyers
      of renown, not the least of whom was Mr. Grolier himself, fresh from his
      triumph over religious heresy in his Church Convention. The note of the
      conference became tinged with exasperation, and certain gentlemen seized
      the opportunity to relieve their pent-up feelings on the subject of the
      President and his slavish advisers,&mdash;some of whom, before they came
      under the spell of his sorcery, had once been sound lawyers and sensible
      men. With the exception of the great Banker himself, who made few
      comments, Theodore Watling was accorded the most deference; as one of the
      leaders of that indomitable group of senators who had dared to stand up
      against popular clamour, his opinions were of great value, and his
      tactical advice was listened to with respect. I felt more pride than ever
      in my former chief, who had lost none of his charm. While in no way
      minimizing the seriousness of the situation, his wisdom was tempered, as
      always, with humour; he managed, as it were, to neutralize the acid
      injected into the atmosphere by other gentlemen present; he alone seemed
      to bear no animus against the Author of our troubles; suave and calm, good
      natured, he sometimes brought the company into roars of laughter and even
      succeeded in bringing occasional smiles to the face of the man who had
      summoned us&mdash;when relating some characteristic story of the queer
      genius whom the fates (undoubtedly as a practical joke) had made the chief
      magistrate of the United States of America. All geniuses have weaknesses;
      Mr. Wading had made a study of the President's, and more than once had
      lured him into an impasse. The case had been appealed to the Supreme
      Court, and Mr. Wading, with remarkable conciseness and penetration,
      reviewed the characteristics of each and every member of that tribunal,
      all of whom he knew intimately. They were, of course, not subject to
      &ldquo;advice,&rdquo; as were some of the gentlemen who sat on our state courts; no
      sane and self-respecting American would presume to &ldquo;approach&rdquo; them.
      Nevertheless they were human, and it were wise to take account, in the
      conduct of the case, of the probable bias of each individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      The President, overstepping his constitutional, Newtonian limits, might
      propose laws, Congress might acquiesce in them, but the Supreme Court,
      after listening to lawyers like Grolier (and he bowed to the attorney),
      made them: made them, he might have added, without responsibility to any
      man in our unique Republic that scorned kings and apotheosized lawyers. A
      Martian with a sense of humour witnessing a stormy session of Congress
      would have giggled at the thought of a few tranquil gentlemen in another
      room of the Capitol waiting to decide what the people's representatives
      meant&mdash;or whether they meant anything....
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since I had known Theodore Watling, however, I saw him
      in the shadow of another individual; a man who, like a powerful magnet,
      continually drew our glances. When we spoke, we almost invariably
      addressed him, his rare words fell like bolts upon the consciousness.
      There was no apparent rift in that personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, about five o'clock, the conference was ended and we were dismissed,
      United States Senator, railroad presidents, field-marshals of the law, the
      great banker fell into an eager conversation with Grolier over the Canon
      on Divorce, the subject of warm debate in the convention that day.
      Grolier, it appeared, had led his party against the theological liberals.
      He believed that law was static, but none knew better its plasticity; that
      it was infallible, but none so well as he could find a text on either
      side. His reputation was not of the popular, newspaper sort, but was known
      to connoisseurs, editors, financiers, statesmen and judges,&mdash;to
      those, in short, whose business it is to make themselves familiar with the
      instruments of power. He was the banker's chief legal adviser, the
      banker's rapier of tempered steel, sheathed from the vulgar view save when
      it flashed forth on a swift errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad to be associated with you in this case, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; Mr. Grolier
      said modestly, as we emerged into the maelstrom of Wall Street. &ldquo;If you
      can make it convenient to call at my office in the morning, we'll go over
      it a little. And I'll see you in a day or two in Washington, Watling. Keep
      your eye on the bull,&rdquo; he added, with a twinkle, &ldquo;and don't let him break
      any more china than you can help. I don't know where we'd be if it weren't
      for you fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By &ldquo;you fellows,&rdquo; he meant Mr. Watling's distinguished associates in the
      Senate....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watling and I dined together at a New York club. It was not a dinner
      of herbs. There was something exceedingly comfortable about that club,
      where the art of catering to those who had earned the right to be catered
      to came as near perfection as human things attain. From the great, heavily
      curtained dining-room the noises of the city had been carefully excluded;
      the dust of the Avenue, the squalour and smells of the brown stone fronts
      and laddered tenements of those gloomy districts lying a pistol-shot east
      and west. We had a vintage champagne, and afterwards a cigar of the club's
      special importation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Watling, &ldquo;mow that you're a member of the royal council,
      what do you think of the King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been thinking a great deal about him,&rdquo; I said, and indeed it was
      true. He had made, perhaps, his greatest impression when I had shaken his
      hand in parting. The manner in which he had looked at me then had puzzled
      me; it was as though he were seeking to divine something in me that had
      escaped him. &ldquo;Why doesn't the government take him over?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watling smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean, instead of his mines and railroads and other properties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But that's your idea. Don't you remember you said something of the
      kind the night of the election, years ago? It occurred to me to-day, when
      I was looking at him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed thoughtfully, &ldquo;if some American genius could find a way
      to legalize that power and utilize the men who created it the worst of our
      problems would be solved. A man with his ability has a right to power, and
      none would respond more quickly or more splendidly to a call of the
      government than he. All this fight is waste, Hugh, damned waste of the
      nation's energy.&rdquo; Mr. Watling seldom swore. &ldquo;Look at the President!
      There's a man of remarkable ability, too. And those two oughtn't to be
      fighting each other. The President's right, in a way. Yes, he is, though
      I've got to oppose him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I smiled at this from Theodore Watling, though I admired him the more for
      it. And suddenly, oddly, I happened to remember what Krebs had said, that
      our troubles were not due to individuals, but to a disease that had
      developed in industrial society. If the day should come when such men as
      the President and the great banker would be working together, was it not
      possible, too, that the idea of Mr. Watling and the vision of Krebs might
      coincide? I was struck by a certain seeming similarity in their views; but
      Mr. Watling interrupted this train of thought by continuing to express his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&mdash;they're running right into a gale when they might be sailing
      with it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think we'll have more trouble?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More and more,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It'll be worse before it's better I'm
      afraid.&rdquo; At this moment a club servant announced his cab, and he rose.
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye, my son,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll hope to see you in Washington
      soon. And remember there's no one thinks any more of you than I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I escorted him to the door, and it was with a real pang I saw him wave to
      me from his cab as he drove away. My affection for him was never more
      alive than in this hour when, for the first time in my experience, he had
      given real evidence of an inner anxiety and lack of confidence in the
      future.

    <h2>
      XXI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In spite of that unwonted note of pessimism from Mr. Watling, I went home
      in a day or two flushed with my new honours, and it was impossible not to
      be conscious of the fact that my aura of prestige was increased&mdash;tremendously
      increased&mdash;by the recognition I had received. A certain subtle
      deference in the attitude of the small minority who owed allegiance to the
      personage by whom I had been summoned was more satisfying than if I had
      been acclaimed at the station by thousands of my fellow-citizens who knew
      nothing of my journey and of its significance, even though it might have a
      concern for them. To men like Berringer, Grierson and Tallant and our
      lesser great lights the banker was a semi-mythical figure, and many times
      on the day of my return I was stopped on the street to satisfy the
      curiosity of my friends as to my impressions. Had he, for instance, let
      fall any opinions, prognostications on the political and financial
      situation? Dickinson and Scherer were the only other men in the city who
      had the honour of a personal acquaintance with him, and Scherer was away,
      abroad, gathering furniture and pictures for the house in New York Nancy
      had predicted, and which he had already begun to build! With Dickinson I
      lunched in private, in order to give him a detailed account of the
      conference. By five o'clock I was ringing the door-bell of Nancy's new
      mansion on Grant Avenue. It was several blocks below my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how does it feel to be sent for by the great sultan?&rdquo; she asked, as
      I stood before her fire. &ldquo;Of course, I have always known that ultimately
      he couldn't get along without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if he has been a little late in realizing it,&rdquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down and tell me all about him,&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him once, when Ham had the yacht at Bar Harbor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did he strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As somewhat wrapped up in himself,&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We laughed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I fell a victim,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I might have sailed off with him, if
      he had asked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm surprised he didn't ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect that it was not quite convenient,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Women are
      secondary considerations to sultans, we're all very well when they haven't
      anything more serious to occupy them. Of course that's why they fascinate
      us. What did he want with you, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was evidently afraid that the government would win the coal roads suit
      unless I was retained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More laurels!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to be proud to know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's exactly what I've been trying to impress on you all these years,&rdquo;
       I declared. &ldquo;I've laid the laurels at your feet, in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat with her head back on the cushions, surveying me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your dress is very becoming,&rdquo; I said irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped it would meet your approval,&rdquo; she mocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been trying to identify the shade. It's elusive&mdash;like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be banal.... What is the colour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poinsetta!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty nearly,&rdquo; she agreed, critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the soft crepe between my fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poet!&rdquo; she smiled. &ldquo;No, it isn't quite poinsetta. It's nearer the
      red-orange of a tree I remember one autumn, in the White Mountains, with
      the setting sun on it. But that wasn't what we were talking about.
      Laurels! Your laurels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My laurels,&rdquo; I repeated. &ldquo;Such as they are, I fling them into your lap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think they increase your value to me, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; I said thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's you I like&mdash;not the laurels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you care for me&mdash;?&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted up her hands and folded them behind the knot of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's extraordinary how little you have changed since we were children,
      Hugh. You are still sixteen years old, that's why I like you. If you got
      to be the sultan of sultans yourself, I shouldn't like you any better, or
      any worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you have just declared that power appeals to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Power&mdash;yes. But a woman&mdash;a woman like me&mdash;wants to be
      first, or nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are first,&rdquo; I asserted. &ldquo;You always have been, if you had only
      realized it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gazed up at me dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had only realized it! If you had only realized that all I wanted
      of you was to be yourself. It wasn't what you achieved. I didn't want you
      to be like Ralph or the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Myself? What are you trying to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yourself. Yes, that is what I like about you. If you hadn't been in such
      a hurry&mdash;if you hadn't misjudged me so. It was the power in you, the
      craving, the ideal in you that I cared for&mdash;not the fruits of it. The
      fruits would have come naturally. But you forced them, Hugh, for quicker
      results.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of fruits?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;how can I tell what they might have been! You have
      striven and striven, you have done extraordinary things, but have they
      made you any happier? have you got what you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stooped down and seized her wrists from behind her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you, Nancy,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I have always wanted you. You're more
      wonderful to-day than you have ever been. I could find myself&mdash;with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes. A dreamy smile was on her face, and she lay
      unresisting, very still. In that tremendous moment, for which it seemed I
      had waited a lifetime, I could have taken her in my arms&mdash;and yet I
      did not. I could not tell why: perhaps it was because she seemed to have
      passed beyond me&mdash;far beyond&mdash;in realization. And she was so
      still!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have missed the way, Hugh,&rdquo; she whispered, at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can find it again, if we seek it together,&rdquo; I urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if I only could!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I could have once. But now I'm afraid&mdash;afraid
      of getting lost.&rdquo; Slowly she straightened up, her hands falling into her
      lap. I seized them again, I was on my knees in front of her, before the
      fire, and she, intent, looking down at me, into me, through me it seemed&mdash;at
      something beyond which yet was me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what do you believe? Anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I don't mean any cant, cut-and-dried morality. The world is getting
      beyond that. But have you, in your secret soul, any religion at all? Do
      you ever think about it? I'm not speaking about anything orthodox, but
      some religion&mdash;even a tiny speck of it, a germ&mdash;harmonizing with
      life, with that power we feel in us we seek to express and continually
      violate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me&mdash;answer me truthfully,&rdquo; she said....
    </p>
    <p>
      I was silent, my thoughts whirling like dust atoms in a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have always taken things&mdash;taken what you wanted. But they
      haven't satisfied you, convinced you that that is all of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;that we should renounce?&rdquo; I faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what I mean. I am asking, Hugh, asking. Haven't you any
      clew? Isn't there any voice in you, anywhere, deep down, that can tell me?
      give me a hint? just a little one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was wracked. My passion had not left me, it seemed to be heightened, and
      I pressed her hands against her knees. It was incredible that my hands
      should be there, in hers, feeling her. Her beauty seemed as fresh, as
      un-wasted as the day, long since, when I despaired of her. And yet and yet
      against the tumult and beating of this passion striving to throb down
      thought, thought strove. Though I saw her as a woman, my senses and my
      spirit commingled and swooned together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is life,&rdquo; I murmured, scarcely knowing what I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear!&rdquo; she cried, and her voice pierced me with pain, &ldquo;are we to
      be lost, overpowered, engulfed, swept down its stream, to come up below
      drifting&mdash;wreckage? Where, then, would be your power? I'm not
      speaking of myself. Isn't life more than that? Isn't it in us, too,&mdash;in
      you? Think, Hugh. Is there no god, anywhere, but this force we feel,
      restlessly creating only to destroy? You must answer&mdash;you must find
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I cannot describe the pleading passion in her voice, as though hell and
      heaven were wrestling in it. The woman I saw, tortured yet uplifted, did
      not seem to be Nancy, yet it was the woman I loved more than life itself
      and always had loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't think,&rdquo; I answered desperately, &ldquo;I can only feel&mdash;and I
      can't express what I feel. It's mixed, it's dim, and yet bright and
      shining&mdash;it's you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's you,&rdquo; she said vehemently. &ldquo;You must interpret it.&rdquo; Her voice
      sank: &ldquo;Could it be God?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!&rdquo; I exclaimed sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands fell away from mine.... The silence was broken only by the
      crackling of the wood fire as a log turned over and fell. Never before, in
      all our intercourse that I could remember, had she spoken to me about
      religion.... With that apparent snap in continuity incomprehensible to the
      masculine mind-her feminine mood had changed. Elements I had never
      suspected, in Nancy, awe, even a hint of despair, entered into it, and
      when my hand found hers again, the very quality of its convulsive pressure
      seemed to have changed. I knew then that it was her soul I loved most; I
      had been swept all unwittingly to its very altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is God,&rdquo; I said. But she continued to gaze at me, her lips
      parted, her eyes questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;that after all these centuries of certainty we
      should have to start out to find him again? Why is it when something
      happens like&mdash;like this, that we should suddenly be torn with doubts
      about him, when we have lived the best part of our lives without so much
      as thinking of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you have qualms?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Isn't this enough? and doesn't it
      promise&mdash;all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. They're not qualms&mdash;in the old sense.&rdquo; She smiled down
      at me a little tearfully. &ldquo;Hugh, do you remember when we used to go to
      Sunday-school at Dr. Pound's church, and Mrs. Ewan taught us? I really
      believed something then&mdash;that Moses brought down the ten commandments
      of God from the mountain, all written out definitely for ever and ever.
      And I used to think of marriage&rdquo; (I felt a sharp twinge), &ldquo;of marriage as
      something sacred and inviolable,&mdash;something ordained by God himself.
      It ought to be so&mdash;oughtn't it? That is the ideal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but aren't you confusing&mdash;?&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am confusing and confused. I shouldn't be&mdash;I shouldn't care if
      there weren't something in you, in me, in our&mdash;friendship, something
      I can't explain, something that shines still through the fog and the smoke
      in which we have lived our lives&mdash;something which, I think, we saw
      clearer as children. We have lost it in our hasty groping. Oh, Hugh, I
      couldn't bear to think that we should never find it! that it doesn't
      really exist! Because I seem to feel it. But can we find it this way, my
      dear?&rdquo; Her hand tightened on mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if the force drawing us together, that has always drawn us together,
      is God?&rdquo; I objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The time must come when you must answer, Hugh.
      It may be too late, but you must answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in taking life in my own hands,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to be life,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;It&mdash;it might have been life....
      It is only when a moment, a moment like this comes that the quality of
      what we have lived seems so tarnished, that the atmosphere which we
      ourselves have helped to make is so sordid. When I think of the intrigues,
      and divorces, the self-indulgences,&mdash;when I think of my own marriage&mdash;&rdquo;
       her voice caught. &ldquo;How are we going to better it, Hugh, this way? Am I to
      get that part of you I love, and are you to get what you crave in me? Can
      we just seize happiness? Will it not elude us just as much as though we
      believed firmly in the ten commandments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I declared obstinately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I'm afraid of is that the world isn't made that way&mdash;for you&mdash;for
      me. We're permitted to seize those other things because they're just
      baubles, we've both found out how worthless they are. And the worst of it
      is they've made me a coward, Hugh. It isn't that I couldn't do without
      them, I've come to depend on them in another way. It's because they give
      me a certain protection,&mdash;do you see? they've come to stand in the
      place of the real convictions we've lost. And&mdash;well, we've taken the
      baubles, can we reach out our hands and take&mdash;this? Won't we be
      punished for it, frightfully punished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care if we are,&rdquo; I said, and surprised myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I care. It's weak, it's cowardly, but it's so. And yet I want to face
      the situation&mdash;I'm trying to get you to face it, to realize how
      terrible it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only know that I want you above everything else in the world&mdash;I'll
      take care of you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I seized her arms, I drew her down to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, don't!&rdquo; and struggled to her feet and stood
      before me panting. &ldquo;You must go away now&mdash;please, Hugh. I can't bear
      any more&mdash;I want to think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I released her. She sank into the chair and hid her face in her hands....
    </p>
    <p>
      As may be imagined, the incident I have just related threw my life into a
      tangle that would have floored a less persistent optimist and romanticist
      than myself, yet I became fairly accustomed to treading what the old
      moralists called the devious paths of sin. In my passion I had not
      hesitated to lay down the doctrine that the courageous and the strong took
      what they wanted,&mdash;a doctrine of which I had been a consistent
      disciple in the professional and business realm. A logical buccaneer,
      superman, &ldquo;master of life&rdquo; would promptly have extended this doctrine to
      the realm of sex. Nancy was the mate for me, and Nancy and I, our
      development, was all that mattered, especially my development. Let every
      man and woman look out for his or her development, and in the end the
      majority of people would be happy. This was going Adam Smith one better.
      When it came to putting that theory into practice, however, one needed
      convictions: Nancy had been right when she had implied that convictions
      were precisely what we lacked; what our world in general lacked. We had
      desires, yes convictions, no. What we wanted we got not by defying the
      world, but by conforming to it: we were ready to defy only when our
      desires overcame the resistance of our synapses, and even then not until
      we should have exhausted every legal and conventional means.
    </p>
    <p>
      A superman with a wife and family he had acquired before a great passion
      has made him a superman is in rather a predicament, especially if he be
      one who has achieved such superhumanity as he possesses not by challenging
      laws and conventions, but by getting around them. My wife and family loved
      me; and paradoxically I still had affection for them, or thought I had.
      But the superman creed is, &ldquo;be yourself, realize yourself, no matter how
      cruel you may have to be in order to do so.&rdquo; One trouble with me was that
      remnants of the Christian element of pity still clung to me. I would be
      cruel if I had to, but I hoped I shouldn't have to: something would turn
      up, something in the nature of an intervening miracle that would make it
      easy for me. Perhaps Maude would take the initiative and relieve me....
      Nancy had appealed for a justifying doctrine, and it was just what I
      didn't have and couldn't evolve. In the meanwhile it was quite in
      character that I should accommodate myself to a situation that might well
      be called anomalous.
    </p>
    <p>
      This &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; was not unaccompanied by fever. My longing to realize
      my love for Nancy kept me in a constant state of tension&mdash;of
      &ldquo;nerves&rdquo;; for our relationship had merely gone one step farther, we had
      reached a point where we acknowledged that we loved each other, and
      paradoxically halted there; Nancy clung to her demand for new sanctions
      with a tenacity that amazed and puzzled and often irritated me. And yet,
      when I look back upon it all, I can see that some of the difficulty lay
      with me: if she had her weakness&mdash;which she acknowledged&mdash;I had
      mine&mdash;and kept it to myself. It was part of my romantic nature not to
      want to break her down. Perhaps I loved the ideal better than the woman
      herself, though that scarcely seems possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw each other constantly. And though we had instinctively begun to be
      careful, I imagine there was some talk among our acquaintances. It is to
      be noted that the gossip never became riotous, for we had always been
      friends, and Nancy had a saving reputation for coldness. It seemed
      incredible that Maude had not discovered my secret, but if she knew of it,
      she gave no sign of her knowledge. Often, as I looked at her, I wished she
      would. I can think of no more expressive sentence in regard to her than
      the trite one that she pursued the even tenor of her way; and I found the
      very perfection of her wifehood exasperating. Our relationship would, I
      thought, have been more endurable if we had quarrelled. And yet we had
      grown as far apart, in that big house, as though we had been separated by
      a continent; I lived in my apartments, she in hers; she consulted me about
      dinner parties and invitations; for, since we had moved to Grant Avenue,
      we entertained and went out more than before. It seemed as though she were
      making every effort consistent with her integrity and self-respect to
      please me. Outwardly she conformed to the mould; but I had long been aware
      that inwardly a person had developed. It had not been a spontaneous
      development, but one in resistance to pressure; and was probably all the
      stronger for that reason. At times her will revealed itself in astonishing
      and unexpected flashes, as when once she announced that she was going to
      change Matthew's school.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's old enough to go to boarding-school,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I'll look up a place
      for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't wish him to go to boarding-school yet, Hugh,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's just what he needs,&rdquo; I objected. &ldquo;He ought to have the
      rubbing-up against other boys that boarding-school will give him. Matthew
      is timid, he should have learned to take care of himself. And he will make
      friendships that will help him in a larger school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't intend to send him,&rdquo; Maude said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I think it wise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have begun to consider such things many years ago. You have
      always been too&mdash;busy to think of the children. You have left them to
      me. I am doing the best I can with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a man should have something to say about boys. He understands them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have thought of that before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They haven't been old enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had taken your share of responsibility for them, I would listen to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maude!&rdquo; I exclaimed reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Hugh,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you have been too busy making money. You have
      left them to me. It is my task to see that the money they are to inherit
      doesn't ruin them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk as though it were a great fortune,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not press the matter. I had a presentiment that to press it
      might lead to unpleasant results.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this sense of not being free, of having gained everything but
      freedom that was at times galling in the extreme: this sense of living
      with a woman for whom I had long ceased to care, a woman with a baffling
      will concealed beneath an unruffled and serene exterior. At moments I
      looked at her across the table; she did not seem to have aged much: her
      complexion was as fresh, apparently, as the day when I had first walked
      with her in the garden at Elkington; her hair the same wonderful colour;
      perhaps she had grown a little stouter. There could be no doubt about the
      fact that her chin was firmer, that certain lines had come into her face
      indicative of what is called character. Beneath her pliability she was now
      all firmness; the pliability had become a mockery. It cannot be said that
      I went so far as to hate her for this,&mdash;when it was in my mind,&mdash;but
      my feelings were of a strong antipathy. And then again there were rare
      moments when I was inexplicably drawn to her, not by love and passion; I
      melted a little in pity, perhaps, when my eyes were opened and I saw the
      tragedy, yet I am not referring now to such feelings as these. I am
      speaking of the times when I beheld her as the blameless companion of the
      years, the mother of my children, the woman I was used to and should&mdash;by
      all canons I had known&mdash;have loved....
    </p>
    <p>
      And there were the children. Days and weeks passed when I scarcely saw
      them, and then some little incident would happen to give me an unexpected
      wrench and plunge me into unhappiness. One evening I came home from a long
      talk with Nancy that had left us both wrought up, and I had entered the
      library before I heard voices. Maude was seated under the lamp at the end
      of the big room reading from &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo;; Matthew and Biddy were at her
      feet, and Moreton, less attentive, at a little distance was taking apart a
      mechanical toy. I would have tiptoed out, but Biddy caught sight of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's father!&rdquo; she cried, getting up and flying to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father, do come and listen! The story's so exciting, isn't it,
      Matthew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked down into the boy's eyes shining with an expression that suddenly
      pierced my heart with a poignant memory of myself. Matthew was far away
      among the mountains and castles of Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matthew,&rdquo; demanded his sister, &ldquo;why did he want to go fighting with all
      those people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he was dotty,&rdquo; supplied Moreton, who had an interesting habit of
      picking up slang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't at all,&rdquo; cried Matthew, indignantly, interrupting Maude's
      rebuke of his brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, then?&rdquo; Moreton demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't understand if I told you,&rdquo; Matthew was retorting, when Maude
      put her hand on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that's enough for to-night,&rdquo; she said, as she closed the book.
      &ldquo;There are lessons to do&mdash;and father wants to read his newspaper in
      quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought a protest from Biddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little more, mother! Can't we go into the schoolroom? We shan't
      disturb father there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll read to them&mdash;a few minutes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I took the volume from her and sat down Maude shot at me a swift look
      of surprise. Even Matthew glanced at me curiously; and in his glance I
      had, as it were, a sudden revelation of the boy's perplexity concerning
      me. He was twelve, rather tall for his age, and the delicate modelling of
      his face resembled my father's. He had begun to think.. What did he think
      of me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Biddy clapped her hands, and began to dance across the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father's going to read to us, father's going to read to us,&rdquo; she cried,
      finally clambering up on my knee and snuggling against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the place?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Maude had left the room. She had gone swiftly and silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll find it,&rdquo; said Moreton.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began to read, but I scarcely knew what I was reading, my fingers
      tightening over Biddy's little knee....
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Miss Allsop, the governess, came in. She had been sent by Maude.
      There was wistfulness in Biddy's voice as I kissed her good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, if you would only read oftener!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I like it when you
      read&mdash;better than anyone else.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      Maude and I were alone that night. As we sat in the library after our
      somewhat formal, perfunctory dinner, I ventured to ask her why she had
      gone away when I had offered to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't bear it, Hugh,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked, intending to justify myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got up abruptly, and left me. I did not follow her. In my heart I
      understood why....
    </p>
    <p>
      Some years had passed since Ralph's prophecy had come true, and Perry and
      the remaining Blackwoods had been &ldquo;relieved&rdquo; of the Boyne Street line. The
      process need not be gone into in detail, being the time-honoured one
      employed in the Ribblevale affair of &ldquo;running down&rdquo; the line, or perhaps
      it would be better to say &ldquo;showing it up.&rdquo; It had not justified its
      survival in our efficient days, it had held out&mdash;thanks to Perry&mdash;with
      absurd and anachronous persistence against the inevitable consolidation.
      Mr. Tallant's newspaper had published many complaints of the age and
      scarcity of the cars, etc.; and alarmed holders of securities, in whose
      vaults they had lain since time immemorial, began to sell.... I saw little
      of Perry in those days, as I have explained, but one day I met him in the
      Hambleton Building, and he was white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your friends are doing thus, Hugh,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doing what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undermining the reputation of a company as sound as any in this city, a
      company that's not overcapitalized, either. And we're giving better
      service right now than any of your consolidated lines.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in no frame of mind to argue with; the conversation was distinctly
      unpleasant. I don't remember what I said something to the effect that he
      was excited, that his language was extravagant. But after he had walked
      off and left me I told Dickinson that he ought to be given a chance, and
      one of our younger financiers, Murphree, went to Perry and pointed out
      that he had nothing to gain by obstruction; if he were only reasonable, he
      might come into the new corporation on the same terms with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that Murphree got for his pains was to be ordered out of the office by
      Perry, who declared that he was being bribed to desert the other
      stockholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He utterly failed to see the point of view,&rdquo; Murphree reported in some
      astonishment to Dickinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else did he say?&rdquo; Mr. Dickinson asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Murphree hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;what?&rdquo; the banker insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn't quite himself,&rdquo; said Murphree, who was a comparative newcomer
      in the city and had a respect for the Blackwood name. &ldquo;He said that that
      was the custom of thieves: when they were discovered, they offered to
      divide. He swore that he would get justice in the courts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dickinson smiled....
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Perry, through his obstinacy and inability to adapt himself to new
      conditions, had gradually lost both caste and money. He resigned from the
      Boyne Club. I was rather sorry for him. Tom naturally took the matter to
      heart, but he never spoke of it; I found that I was seeing less of him,
      though we continued to dine there at intervals, and he still came to my
      house to see the children. Maude continued to see Lucia. For me, the
      situation would have been more awkward had I been less occupied, had my
      relationship with Maude been a closer one. Neither did she mention Perry
      in those days. The income that remained to him being sufficient for him
      and his family to live on comfortably, he began to devote most of his time
      to various societies of a semipublic nature until&mdash;in the spring of
      which I write his activities suddenly became concentrated in the
      organization of a &ldquo;Citizens Union,&rdquo; whose avowed object was to make a
      campaign against &ldquo;graft&rdquo; and political corruption the following autumn.
      This announcement and the call for a mass-meeting in Kingdon Hall was
      received by the newspapers with a good-natured ridicule, and in
      influential quarters it was generally hinted that this was Mr. Blackwood's
      method of &ldquo;getting square&rdquo; for having been deprived of the Boyne Street
      line. It was quite characteristic of Ralph Hambleton that he should go,
      out of curiosity, to the gathering at Kingdon Hall, and drop into my
      office the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Hughie, they're after you,&rdquo; he said with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After me? Why not include yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and stretched his long legs and his long arms, and smiled as
      he gaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they'll never get me,&rdquo; he said. And I knew, as I gazed at him, that
      they never would.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of things did they say?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you read the Pilot and the Mail and State?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just glanced over them. Did they call names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call names! I should say they did. They got drunk on it, worked
      themselves up like dervishes. They didn't cuss you personally,&mdash;that'll
      come later, of course. Judd Jason got the heaviest shot, but they said he
      couldn't exist a minute if it wasn't for the 'respectable' crowd&mdash;capitalists,
      financiers, millionaires and their legal tools. Fact is, they spoke a good
      deal of truth, first and last, in a fool kind of way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truth!&rdquo; I exclaimed irritatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph laughed. He was evidently enjoying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is any of it news to you, Hughie, old boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's an outrage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's funny,&rdquo; said Ralph. &ldquo;We haven't had such a circus for years.
      Never had. Of course I shouldn't like to see you go behind the bars,&mdash;not
      that. But you fellows can't expect to go on forever skimming off the cream
      without having somebody squeal sometime. You ought to be reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've skimmed as much cream as anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've skimmed the cream, Hughie,&mdash;you and Dickinson and Scherer and
      Grierson and the rest,&mdash;I've only filled my jug. Well, these fellows
      are going to have a regular roof-raising campaign, take the lid off of
      everything, dump out the red-light district some of our friends are so
      fond of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dump it where?&rdquo; I asked curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; answered Ralph, &ldquo;they didn't say. Out into the country, anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's damned foolishness,&rdquo; I declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't say it wasn't,&rdquo; Ralph admitted. &ldquo;They talked a lot of that, too,
      incidentally. They're going to close the saloons and dance halls and make
      this city sadder than heaven. When they get through, it'll all be over but
      the inquest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Perry do?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he opened the meeting,&mdash;made a nice, precise, gentlemanly
      speech. Greenhalge and a few young highbrows and a reformed crook named
      Harrod did most of the hair-raising. They're going to nominate Greenhalge
      for mayor; and he told 'em something about that little matter of the
      school board, and said he would talk more later on. If one of the ablest
      lawyers in the city hadn't been hired by the respectable crowd and a lot
      of other queer work done, the treasurer and purchasing agent would be
      doing time. They seemed to be interested, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I turned over some papers on my desk, just to show Ralph that he hadn't
      succeeded in disturbing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was in the audience? anyone you ever heard of?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure thing. Your cousin Robert Breck; and that son-in-law of his&mdash;what's
      his name? And some other representatives of our oldest families,&mdash;Alec
      Pound. He's a reformer now, you know. They put him on the resolutions
      committee. Sam Ogilvy was there, he'd be classed as respectably
      conservative. And one of the Ewanses. I could name a few others, if you
      pressed me. That brother of Fowndes who looks like an up-state minister. A
      lot of women&mdash;Miller Gorse's sister, Mrs. Datchet, who never approved
      of Miller. Quite a genteel gathering, I give you my word, and all
      astonished and mad as hell when the speaking was over. Mrs. Datchet said
      she had been living in a den of iniquity and vice, and didn't know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been amusing,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; said Ralph. &ldquo;It'll be more amusing later on. Oh, yes, there was
      another fellow who spoke I forgot to mention&mdash;that queer Dick who was
      in your class, Krebs, got the school board evidence, looked as if he'd
      come in by freight. He wasn't as popular as the rest, but he's got more
      sense than all of them put together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why wasn't he popular?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he didn't crack up the American people,&mdash;said they deserved
      all they got, that they'd have to learn to think straight and be straight
      before they could expect a square deal. The truth was, they secretly
      envied these rich men who were exploiting their city, and just as long as
      they envied them they hadn't any right to complain of them. He was going
      into this campaign to tell the truth, but to tell all sides of it, and if
      they wanted reform, they'd have to reform themselves first. I admired his
      nerve, I must say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He always had that,&rdquo; I remarked. &ldquo;How did they take it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they didn't like it much, but I think most of them had a respect
      for him. I know I did. He has a whole lot of assurance, an air of knowing
      what he's talking about, and apparently he doesn't give a continental
      whether he's popular or not. Besides, Greenhalge had cracked him up to the
      skies for the work he'd done for the school board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk as if he'd converted you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralph laughed as he rose and stretched himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm only the intelligent spectator, you ought to know that by this
      time, Hughie. But I thought it might interest you, since you'll have to go
      on the stump and refute it all. That'll be a nice job. So long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he departed. Of course I knew that he had been baiting me, his scent
      for the weaknesses of his friends being absolutely fiendish. I was angry
      because he had succeeded,&mdash;because he knew he had succeeded. All the
      morning uneasiness possessed me, and I found it difficult to concentrate
      on the affairs I had in hand. I felt premonitions, which I tried in vain
      to suppress, that the tide of the philosophy of power and might were
      starting to ebb: I scented vague calamities ahead, calamities I associated
      with Krebs; and when I went out to the Club for lunch this sense of
      uneasiness, instead of being dissipated, was increased. Dickinson was
      there, and Scherer, who had just got back from Europe; the talk fell on
      the Citizens Union, which Scherer belittled with an air of consequence and
      pompousness that struck me disagreeably, and with an eye newly critical I
      detected in him a certain disintegration, deterioration. Having dismissed
      the reformers, he began to tell of his experiences abroad, referring in
      one way or another to the people of consequence who had entertained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh,&rdquo; said Leonard Dickinson to me as we walked to the bank together,
      &ldquo;Scherer will never be any good any more. Too much prosperity. And he's
      begun to have his nails manicured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After I had left the bank president an uncanny fancy struck me that in
      Adolf Scherer I had before me a concrete example of the effect of my
      philosophy on the individual....
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing seemed to go right that spring, and yet nothing was absolutely
      wrong. At times I became irritated, bewildered, out of tune, and unable to
      understand why. The weather itself was uneasy, tepid, with long spells of
      hot wind and dust. I no longer seemed to find refuge in my work. I was
      unhappy at home. After walking for many years in confidence and security
      along what appeared to be a certain path, I had suddenly come out into a
      vague country in which it was becoming more and more difficult to
      recognize landmarks. I did not like to confess this; and yet I heard
      within me occasional whispers. Could it be that I, Hugh Paret, who had
      always been so positive, had made a mess of my life? There were moments
      when the pattern of it appeared to have fallen apart, resolved itself into
      pieces that refused to fit into each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course my relationship with Nancy had something to do with this....
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening late in the spring, after dinner, Maude came into the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you busy, Hugh?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I put down my newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she went on, as she took a chair near the table where I was
      writing, &ldquo;I wanted to tell you that I have decided to go to Europe, and
      take the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Europe!&rdquo; I exclaimed. The significance of the announcement failed at
      once to register in my brain, but I was aware of a shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right away. The end of this month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the summer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't decided how long I shall stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I stared at her in bewilderment. In contrast to the agitation I felt
      rising within me, she was extraordinarily calm, unbelievably so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where do you intend to go in Europe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go to London for a month or so, and after that to some quiet
      place in France, probably at the sea, where the children can learn French
      and German. After that, I have no plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;you talk as if you might stay indefinitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't decided,&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why&mdash;why are you doing this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I would have recalled the words as soon as I had spoken them. There was
      the slightest unsteadiness in her voice as she replied:&mdash;&ldquo;Is it
      necessary to go into that, Hugh? Wouldn't it be useless as well as a
      little painful? Surely, going to Europe without one's husband is not an
      unusual thing in these days. Let it just be understood that I want to go,
      that the children have arrived at an age when it will do them good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got up and began to walk up and down the room, while she watched me with
      a silent calm which was incomprehensible. In vain I summoned my faculties
      to meet it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not thought her capable of such initiative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see why you want to leave me,&rdquo; I said at last, though with a full
      sense of the inadequacy of the remark, and a suspicion of its hypocrisy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't quite true,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;In the first place, you don't need
      me. I am not of the slightest use in your life, I haven't been a factor in
      it for years. You ought never to have married me,&mdash;it was all a
      terrible mistake. I began to realize that after we had been married a few
      months&mdash;even when we were on our wedding trip. But I was too
      inexperienced&mdash;perhaps too weak to acknowledge it to myself. In the
      last few years I have come to see it plainly. I should have been a fool if
      I hadn't. I am not your wife in any real sense of the word, I cannot hold
      you, I cannot even interest you. It's a situation that no woman with
      self-respect can endure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't those rather modern sentiments, for you, Maude?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed a little, but otherwise retained her remarkable composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care whether they are 'modern' or not, I only know that my
      position has become impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked to the other end of the room, and stood facing the carefully
      drawn curtains of the windows; fantastically, they seemed to represent the
      impasse to which my mind had come. Did she intend, ultimately, to get a
      divorce? I dared not ask her. The word rang horribly in my ears, though
      unpronounced; and I knew then that I lacked her courage, and the knowledge
      was part of my agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      I turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think you've overdrawn things, Maude exaggerated them? No
      marriages are perfect. You've let your mind dwell until it has become
      inflamed on matters which really don't amount to much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was never saner, Hugh,&rdquo; she replied instantly. And indeed I was forced
      to confess that she looked it. That new Maude I had seen emerging of late
      years seemed now to have found herself; she was no longer the woman I had
      married,&mdash;yielding, willing to overlook, anxious to please, living in
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't influence you, or help you in any way. I never have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's not true,&rdquo; I protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she cut me short, going on inexorably:&mdash;&ldquo;I am merely your
      housekeeper, and rather a poor one at that, from your point of view. You
      ignore me. I am not blaming you for it&mdash;you are made that way. It's
      true that you have always supported me in luxury,&mdash;that might have
      been enough for another woman. It isn't enough for me&mdash;I, too, have a
      life to live, a soul to be responsible for. It's not for my sake so much
      as for the children's that I don't want it to be crushed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crushed!&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You are stifling it. I say again that I'm not blaming you, Hugh. You
      are made differently from me. All you care for, really, is your career.
      You may think that you care, at times, for&mdash;other things, but it
      isn't so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took, involuntarily, a deep breath. Would she mention Nancy? Was it in
      reality Nancy who had brought about this crisis? And did Maude suspect the
      closeness of that relationship?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly I found myself begging her not to go; the more astonishing since,
      if at any time during the past winter this solution had presented itself
      to me as a possibility, I should eagerly have welcomed it! But should I
      ever have had the courage to propose a separation? I even wished to delude
      myself now into believing that what she suggested was in reality not a
      separation. I preferred to think of it as a trip.... A vision of freedom
      thrilled me, and yet I was wracked and torn. I had an idea that she was
      suffering, that the ordeal was a terrible one for her; and at that moment
      there crowded into my mind, melting me, incident after incident of our
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that we have got along pretty well together, Maude. I have
      been negligent&mdash;I'll admit it. But I'll try to do better in the
      future. And&mdash;if you'll wait a month or so, I'll go to Europe with
      you, and we'll have a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me sadly,&mdash;pityingly, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Hugh, I've thought it all out. You really don't want me. You only say
      this because you are sorry for me, because you dislike to have your
      feelings wrung. You needn't be sorry for me, I shall be much happier away
      from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think it over, Maude,&rdquo; I pleaded. &ldquo;I shall miss you and the children. I
      haven't paid much attention to them, either, but I am fond of them, and
      depend upon them, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use, Hugh. I tell you I've thought it all out. You don't care for
      the children, you were never meant to have any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you rather severe in your judgments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I'm willing to admit my faults, that I
      am a failure so far as you are concerned. Your ideas of life and mine are
      far apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; I exclaimed bitterly, &ldquo;that you are referring to my
      professional practices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A note of weariness crept into her voice. I might have known that she was
      near the end of her strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think it's that,&rdquo; she said dispassionately. &ldquo;I prefer to put
      it down, that part of it, to a fundamental difference of ideas. I do not
      feel qualified to sit in judgment on that part of your life, although I'll
      admit that many of the things you have done, in common with the men with
      whom you are associated, have seemed to me unjust and inconsiderate of the
      rights and feelings of others. You have alienated some of your best
      friends. If I were to arraign you at all, it would be on the score of
      heartlessness. But I suppose it isn't your fault, that you haven't any
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's unfair,&rdquo; I put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't wish to be unfair,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Only, since you ask me, I have
      to tell you that that is the way it seems to me. I don't want to introduce
      the question of right and wrong into this, Hugh, I'm not capable of
      unravelling it; I can't put myself into your life, and see things from
      your point of view, weigh your problems and difficulties. In the first
      place, you won't let me. I think I understand you, partly&mdash;but only
      partly. You have kept yourself shut up. But why discuss it? I have made up
      my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The legal aspect of the matter occurred to me. What right had she to leave
      me? I might refuse to support her. Yet even as these thoughts came I
      rejected them; I knew that it was not in me to press this point. And she
      could always take refuge with her father; without the children, of course.
      But the very notion sickened me. I could not bear to think of Maude
      deprived of the children. I had seated myself again at the table. I put my
      hand to my forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't make it hard, Hugh,&rdquo; I heard her say, gently. &ldquo;Believe me, it is
      best. I know. There won't be any talk about it,&mdash;right away, at any
      rate. People will think it natural that I should wish to go abroad for the
      summer. And later&mdash;well, the point of view about such affairs has
      changed. They are better understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had risen. She was pale, still outwardly composed,&mdash;but I had a
      strange, hideous feeling that she was weeping inwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you coming back&mdash;ever?&rdquo; I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; and left the room abruptly....
    </p>
    <p>
      I wanted to follow her, but something withheld me. I got up and walked
      around the room in a state of mind that was near to agony, taking one of
      the neglected books out of the shelves, glancing at its meaningless print,
      and replacing it; I stirred the fire, opened the curtains and gazed out
      into the street and closed them again. I looked around me, a sudden
      intensity of hatred seized me for this big, silent, luxurious house; I
      recalled Maude's presentiment about it. Then, thinking I might still
      dissuade her, I went slowly up the padded stairway&mdash;to find her door
      locked; and a sense of the finality of her decision came over me. I knew
      then that I could not alter it even were I to go all the lengths of
      abjectness. Nor could I, I knew, have brought myself to have feigned a
      love I did not feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was it I felt? I could not define it. Amazement, for one thing, that
      Maude with her traditional, Christian view of marriage should have come to
      such a decision. I went to my room, undressed mechanically and got into
      bed....
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave no sign at the breakfast table of having made the decision of the
      greatest moment in our lives; she conversed as usual, asked about the
      news, reproved the children for being noisy; and when the children had
      left the table there were no tears, reminiscences, recriminations. In
      spite of the slight antagonism and envy of which I was conscious,&mdash;that
      she was thus superbly in command of the situation, that she had developed
      her pinions and was thus splendidly able to use them,&mdash;my admiration
      for her had never been greater. I made an effort to achieve the frame of
      mind she suggested: since she took it so calmly, why should I be tortured
      by the tragedy of it? Perhaps she had ceased to love me, after all!
      Perhaps she felt nothing but relief. At any rate, I was grateful to her,
      and I found a certain consolation, a sop to my pride in the reflection
      that the initiative must have been hers to take. I could not have deserted
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you think of leaving?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two weeks from Saturday on the Olympic, if that is convenient for you.&rdquo;
       Her manner seemed one of friendly solicitude. &ldquo;You will remain in the
      house this summer, as usual, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sunny, warm morning, and I went downtown in the motor almost
      blithely. It was the best solution after all, and I had been a fool to
      oppose it.... At the office, there was much business awaiting me; yet once
      in a while, during the day, when the tension relaxed, the recollection of
      what had happened flowed back into my consciousness. Maude was going!
    </p>
    <p>
      I had telephoned Nancy, making an appointment for the afternoon. Sometimes&mdash;not
      too frequently&mdash;we were in the habit of going out into the country in
      one of her motors, a sort of landaulet, I believe, in which we were
      separated from the chauffeur by a glass screen. She was waiting for me
      when I arrived, at four; and as soon as we had shot clear of the city,
      &ldquo;Maude is going away,&rdquo; I told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going away?&rdquo; she repeated, struck more by the tone of my voice than by
      what I had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She announced last night that she was going abroad indefinitely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had been more than anxious to see how Nancy would take the news. A flush
      gradually deepened in her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that she is going to leave you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks that way. In fact, she as much as said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she explained it pretty thoroughly. Apparently, it isn't a sudden
      decision,&rdquo; I replied, trying to choose my words, to speak composedly as I
      repeated the gist of our conversation. Nancy, with her face averted,
      listened in silence&mdash;a silence that continued some time after I had
      ceased to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She didn't&mdash;she didn't mention&mdash;?&rdquo; the sentence remained
      unfinished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said quickly, &ldquo;she didn't. She must know, of course, but I'm sure
      that didn't enter into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy's eyes as they returned to me were wet, and in them was an
      expression I had never seen before,&mdash;of pain, reproach, of
      questioning. It frightened me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh, how little you know!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what has brought her to this decision&mdash;you and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that&mdash;that Maude loves me? That she is jealous?&rdquo; I don't
      know how I managed to say it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman likes to think that she is a failure,&rdquo; murmured Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but she isn't really,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;She could have made another man
      happy&mdash;a better man. It was all one of those terrible mistakes our
      modern life seems to emphasize so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a woman,&rdquo; Nancy said, with what seemed a touch of vehemence. &ldquo;It's
      useless to expect you to understand.... Do you remember what I said to you
      about her? How I appealed to you when you married to try to appreciate
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't that I didn't appreciate her,&rdquo; I interrupted, surprised that
      Nancy should have recalled this, &ldquo;she isn't the woman for me, we aren't
      made for each other. It was my mistake, my fault, I admit, but I don't
      agree with you at all, that we had anything to do with her decision. It is
      just the&mdash;the culmination of a long period of incompatibility. She
      has come to realize that she has only one life to live, and she seems
      happier, more composed, more herself than she has ever been since our
      marriage. Of course I don't mean to say it isn't painful for her.... But I
      am sure she isn't well, that it isn't because of our seeing one another,&rdquo;
       I concluded haltingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is finer than either of us, Hugh,&mdash;far finer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not relish this statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's fine, I admit. But I can't see how under the circumstances any of
      us could have acted differently.&rdquo; And Nancy not replying, I continued:
      &ldquo;She has made up her mind to go,&mdash;I suppose I could prevent it by
      taking extreme measures,&mdash;but what good would it do? Isn't it, after
      all, the most sensible, the only way out of a situation that has become
      impossible? Times have changed, Nancy, and you yourself have been the
      first to admit it. Marriage is no longer what it was, and people are
      coming to look upon it more sensibly. In order to perpetuate the
      institution, as it was, segregation, insulation, was the only course. Men
      segregated their wives, women their husbands,&mdash;the only logical
      method of procedure, but it limited the individual. Our mothers and
      fathers thought it scandalous if husband or wife paid visits alone. It
      wasn't done. But our modern life has changed all that. A marriage, to be a
      marriage, should be proof against disturbing influences, should leave the
      individuals free; the binding element should be love, not the force of an
      imposed authority. You seemed to agree to all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;But I cannot think that happiness will ever
      grow out of unhappiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Maude will not be unhappy,&rdquo; I insisted. &ldquo;She will be happier, far
      happier, now that she has taken the step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wish I thought so,&rdquo; Nancy exclaimed. &ldquo;Hugh, you always believe what
      you want to believe. And the children. How can you bear to part with
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was torn, I had a miserable sense of inadequacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall miss them,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I have never really appreciated them. I
      admit I don't deserve to have them, and I am willing to give them up for
      you, for Maude...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We had made one of our favourite drives among the hills on the far side of
      the Ashuela, and at six were back at Nancy's house. I did not go in, but
      walked slowly homeward up Grant Avenue. It had been a trying afternoon. I
      had not expected, indeed, that Nancy would have rejoiced, but her
      attitude, her silences, betraying, as they did, compunctions, seemed to
      threaten our future happiness.

    <h2>
      XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      One evening two or three days later I returned from the office to gaze up
      at my house, to realize suddenly that it would be impossible for me to
      live there, in those great, empty rooms, alone; and I told Maude that I
      would go to the Club&mdash;during her absence. I preferred to keep up the
      fiction that her trip would only be temporary. She forbore from
      contradicting me, devoting herself efficiently to the task of closing the
      house, making it seem, somehow, a rite,&mdash;the final rite in her
      capacity as housewife. The drawing-room was shrouded, and the library; the
      books wrapped neatly in paper; a smell of camphor pervaded the place; the
      cheerful schoolroom was dismantled; trunks and travelling bags appeared.
      The solemn butler packed my clothes, and I arranged for a room at the Club
      in the wing that recently had been added for the accommodation of
      bachelors and deserted husbands. One of the ironies of those days was that
      the children began to suggest again possibilities of happiness I had
      missed&mdash;especially Matthew. With all his gentleness, the boy seemed
      to have a precocious understanding of the verities, and the capacity for
      suffering which as a child I had possessed. But he had more self-control.
      Though he looked forward to the prospect of new scenes and experiences
      with the anticipation natural to his temperament, I thought he betrayed at
      moments a certain intuition as to what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you coming over, father?&rdquo; he asked once. &ldquo;How soon will your
      business let you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had been brought up in the belief that my business was a tyrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, soon, Matthew,&mdash;sometime soon,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a feeling that he understood me, not intellectually, but
      emotionally. What a companion he might have been!... Moreton and Biddy
      moved me less. They were more robust, more normal, less introspective and
      imaginative; Europe meant nothing to them, but they were frankly delighted
      and excited at the prospect of going on the ocean, asking dozens of
      questions about the great ship, impatient to embark.....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't need all that, Hugh,&rdquo; Maude said, when I handed her a letter of
      credit. &ldquo;I&mdash;I intend to live quite simply, and my chief expenses will
      be the children's education. I am going to give them the best, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But I want you to live over there as you have
      been accustomed to live here. It's not exactly generosity on my part,&mdash;I
      have enough, and more than enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another thing&mdash;I'd rather you didn't go to New York with us, Hugh. I
      know you are busy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'm going,&rdquo; I started to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she went on, firmly. &ldquo;I'd rather you didn't. The hotel people will
      put me on the steamer very comfortably,&mdash;and there are other reasons
      why I do not wish it.&rdquo; I did not insist.... On the afternoon of her
      departure, when I came uptown, I found her pinning some roses on her
      jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perry and Lucia sent them,&rdquo; she informed me. She maintained the friendly,
      impersonal manner to the very end; but my soul, as we drove to the train,
      was full of un-probed wounds. I had had roses put in her compartments in
      the car; Tom and Susan Peters were there with more roses, and little
      presents for the children. Their cheerfulness seemed forced, and I
      wondered whether they suspected that Maude's absence would be prolonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write us often, and tell us all about it, dear,&rdquo; said Susan, as she sat
      beside Maude and held her hand; Tom had Biddy on his knee. Maude was pale,
      but smiling and composed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to get a little villa in France, near the sea,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll
      send you a photograph of it, Susan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Chickabiddy, when she comes back, will be rattling off French like a
      native,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, giving her a hug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate French,&rdquo; said Biddy, and she looked at him solemnly. &ldquo;I wish you
      were coming along, Uncle Tom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bells resounded through the great station. The porter warned us off. I
      kissed the children one by one, scarcely realizing what I was doing. I
      kissed Maude. She received my embrace passively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Hugh,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I alighted, and stood on the platform as the train pulled out. The
      children crowded to the windows, but Maude did not appear.... I found
      myself walking with Tom and Susan past hurrying travellers and porters to
      the Decatur Street entrance, where my automobile stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take you home, Susan,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're ever so much obliged, Hugh,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but the street-cars go
      almost to ferry's door. We're dining there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were filled with tears, and she seemed taller, more ungainly than
      ever&mdash;older. A sudden impression of her greatness of heart was borne
      home to me, and I grasped the value of such rugged friendship as hers&mdash;as
      Tom's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shouldn't know how to behave in an automobile,&rdquo; he said, as though to
      soften her refusal. And I stood watching their receding figures as they
      walked out into the street and hailed the huge electric car that came to a
      stop beyond them. Above its windows was painted &ldquo;The Ashuela Traction
      Company,&rdquo; a label reminiscent of my professional activities. Then I heard
      the chauffeur ask:&mdash;&ldquo;Where do you wish to go, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Club,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My room was ready, my personal belongings, my clothes had been laid out,
      my photographs were on the dressing-table. I took up, mechanically, the
      evening newspaper, but I could not read it; I thought of Maude, of the
      children, memories flowed in upon me,&mdash;a flood not to be dammed....
      Presently the club valet knocked at my door. He had a dinner card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be dining here, sir?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went downstairs. Fred Grierson was the only man in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Hugh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come and sit down. I hear your wife's gone
      abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;she thought she'd try it instead of the South Shore
      this summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps I imagined that he looked at me queerly. I had made a great deal
      of money out of my association with Grierson, I had valued very highly
      being an important member of the group to which he belonged; but to-night,
      as I watched him eating and drinking greedily, I hated him even as I hated
      myself. And after dinner, when he started talking with a ridicule that was
      a thinly disguised bitterness about the Citizens Union and their
      preparations for a campaign I left him and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before a week had passed my painful emotions had largely subsided, and
      with my accustomed resiliency I had regained the feeling of self-respect
      so essential to my happiness. I was free. My only anxiety was for Nancy,
      who had gone to New York the day after my last talk with her; and it was
      only by telephoning to her house that I discovered when she was expected
      to return.... I found her sitting beside one of the open French windows of
      her salon, gazing across at the wooded hills beyond the Ashuela. She was
      serious, a little pale; more exquisite, more desirable than ever; but her
      manner implied the pressure of control, and her voice was not quite steady
      as she greeted me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been away a long time,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dressmakers,&rdquo; she answered. Her colour rose a little. &ldquo;I thought
      they'd never get through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why didn't you drop me a line, let me know when you were coming?&rdquo; I
      asked, taking a chair beside her, and laying my hand on hers. She drew it
      gently away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been thinking it all over&mdash;what we're doing. It doesn't seem
      right, it seems terribly wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I thought we'd gone over all that,&rdquo; I replied, as patiently as I
      could. &ldquo;You're putting it on an old-fashioned, moral basis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there must be same basis,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;There are responsibilities,
      obligations&mdash;there must be!&mdash;that we can't get away from. I
      can't help feeling that we ought to stand by our mistakes, and by our
      bargains; we made a choice&mdash;it's cheating, somehow, and if we take
      this&mdash;what we want&mdash;we shall be punished for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm willing to be punished, to suffer, as I told you. If you loved me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and I was silent. &ldquo;You don't understand,&rdquo; she went
      on, a little breathlessly, &ldquo;what I mean by punishment is deterioration. Do
      you remember once, long ago, when you came to me before I was married, I
      said we'd both run after false gods, and that we couldn't do without them?
      Well, and now this has come; it seems so wonderful to me, coming again
      like that after we had passed it by, after we thought it had gone forever;
      it's opened up visions for me that I never hoped to see again. It ought to
      restore us, dear&mdash;that's what I'm trying to say&mdash;to redeem us,
      to make us capable of being what we were meant to be. If it doesn't do
      that, if it isn't doing so, it's the most horrible of travesties, of
      mockeries. If we gain life only to have it turn into death&mdash;slow
      death; if we go to pieces again, utterly. For now there's hope. The more I
      think, the more clearly I see that we can't take any step without
      responsibilities. If we take this, you'll have me, and I'll have you. And
      if we don't save each other&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we will,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;if we could start new, without any past. I married
      Ham with my eyes open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't know that he would become&mdash;well, as flagrant as he is.
      You didn't really know what he was then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no reason why I shouldn't have anticipated it. I can't claim that
      I was deceived, that I thought my marriage was made in heaven. I entered
      into a contract, and Ham has kept his part of it fairly well. He hasn't
      interfered with my freedom. That isn't putting it on a high plane, but
      there is an obligation involved. You yourself, in your law practice, are
      always insisting upon the sacredness of contract as the very basis of our
      civilization.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here indeed would have been a home thrust, had I been vulnerable at the
      time. So intent was I on overcoming her objections, that I resorted
      unwittingly to the modern argument I had more than once declared in court
      to be anathema-the argument of the new reform in reference to the common
      law and the constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A contract, no matter how seriously entered into at the time it was made,
      that later is seen to violate the principles of humanity should be void.
      And not only this, but you didn't consent that he should disgrace you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never told you that he paid my father's debts, I never told anyone,&rdquo;
       she said, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even then,&rdquo; I answered after a moment, &ldquo;you ought to see that it's too
      terrible a price to pay for your happiness. And Ham hasn't ever pretended
      to consider you in any way. It's certain you didn't agree that he should
      do&mdash;what he is doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I admitted it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there remain Maude and your children.
      Their happiness, their future becomes my responsibility as well as yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't love Maude, and Maude doesn't love me. I grant it's my fault,
      that I did her a wrong in marrying her, but she is right in leaving me. I
      should be doing her a double wrong. And the children will be happy with
      her, they will be well brought up. I, too, have thought this out, Nancy,&rdquo;
       I insisted, &ldquo;and the fact is that in our respective marriages we have
      been, each of us, victims of our time, of our education. We were born in a
      period of transition, we inherited views of life that do not fit
      conditions to-day. It takes courage to achieve happiness, initiative to
      emancipate one's self from a morality that begins to hamper and bind. To
      stay as we are, to refuse to take what is offered us, is to remain between
      wind and water. I don't mean that we should do anything&mdash;hastily. We
      can afford to take a reasonable time, to be dignified about it. But I have
      come to the conclusion that the only thing that matters in the world is a
      love like ours, and its fulfilment. Achievement, success, are empty and
      meaningless without it. And you do love me&mdash;you've admitted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't want to talk about it,&rdquo; she exclaimed, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have to talk about it,&rdquo; I persisted. &ldquo;We have to thrash it out, to
      see it straight, as you yourself have said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak of convictions, Hugh,&mdash;new convictions, in place of the
      old we have discarded. But what are they? And is there no such thing as
      conscience&mdash;even though it be only an intuition of happiness or
      unhappiness? I do care for you, I do love you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not let that suffice?&rdquo; I exclaimed, leaning towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to respect you, too,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was shocked, too shocked to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to respect you,&rdquo; she repeated, more gently. &ldquo;I don't want to think
      that&mdash;that what we feel for each other is&mdash;unconsecrated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It consecrates itself,&rdquo; I declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely it has its roots in everything that is fine in both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We both went wrong,&rdquo; said Nancy. &ldquo;We both sought to wrest power and
      happiness from the world, to make our own laws. How can we assert that&mdash;this
      is not merely a continuation of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can't we work out our beliefs together?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;Won't you trust
      me, trust our love for one another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her breath came and went quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know that I want you, Hugh, as much as you want me, and more. The
      time may come when I can't resist you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you resist me?&rdquo; I cried, seizing her hands convulsively, and swept
      by a gust of passion at her confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to understand that I am fighting for both of us!&rdquo; she pleaded&mdash;an
      appeal that wrung me in spite of the pitch to which my feelings had been
      raised. &ldquo;Hugh, dear, we must think it out. Don't now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I let her hands drop....
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the range of hills rising from the far side of the Ashuela was the
      wide valley in which was situated the Cloverdale Country Club, with its
      polo field, golf course and tennis courts; and in this same valley some of
      our wealthy citizens, such as Howard Ogilvy and Leonard Dickinson, had
      bought &ldquo;farms,&rdquo; week-end playthings for spring and autumn. Hambleton
      Durrett had started the fashion. Capriciously, as he did everything else,
      he had become the owner of several hundred acres of pasture, woodland and
      orchard, acquired some seventy-five head of blooded stock, and proceeded
      to house them in model barns and milk by machinery; for several months he
      had bored everyone in the Boyne Club whom he could entice into
      conversation on the subject of the records of pedigreed cows, and spent
      many bibulous nights on the farm in company with those parasites who
      surrounded him when he was in town. Then another interest had intervened;
      a feminine one, of course, and his energies were transferred (so we
      understood) to the reconstruction and furnishing of a little residence in
      New York, not far from Fifth Avenue. The farm continued under the expert
      direction of a superintendent who was a graduate of the State Agricultural
      College, and a select clientele, which could afford to pay the prices,
      consumed the milk and cream and butter. Quite consistent with their
      marital relations was the fact that Nancy should have taken a fancy to the
      place after Ham's interest had waned. Not that she cared for the
      Guernseys, or Jerseys, or whatever they may have been; she evinced a
      sudden passion for simplicity,&mdash;occasional simplicity, at least,&mdash;for
      a contrast to and escape from a complicated life of luxury. She built
      another house for the superintendent banished him from the little
      farmhouse (where Ham had kept two rooms); banished along with the
      superintendent the stiff plush furniture, the yellow-red carpets, the
      easels and the melodeon, and decked it out in bright chintzes, with
      wall-papers to match, dainty muslin curtains, and rag-carpet rugs on the
      hardwood floors. The pseudo-classic porch over the doorway, which had
      suggested a cemetery, was removed, and a wide piazza added, furnished with
      wicker lounging chairs and tables, and shaded with gay awnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, to the farm, accompanied by a maid, she had been in the habit of
      retiring from time to time, and here she came in early July. Here, dressed
      in the simplest linen gowns of pink or blue or white, I found a Nancy
      magically restored to girlhood,&mdash;anew Nancy, betraying only traces of
      the old, a new Nancy in a new Eden. We had all the setting, all the
      illusion of that perfect ideal of domesticity, love in a cottage. Nancy
      and I, who all our lives had spurned simplicity, laughed over the joy we
      found in it: she made a high art of it, of course; we had our simple
      dinners, which Mrs. Olsen cooked and served in the open air; sometimes on
      the porch, sometimes under the great butternut tree spreading its shade
      over what in a more elaborate country-place, would have been called a
      lawn,&mdash;an uneven plot of grass of ridges and hollows that ran down to
      the orchard. Nancy's eyes would meet mine across the little table, and
      often our gaze would wander over the pastures below, lucent green in the
      level evening light, to the darkening woods beyond, gilt-tipped in the
      setting sun. There were fields of ripening yellow grain, of lusty young
      corn that grew almost as we watched it: the warm winds of evening were
      heavy with the acrid odours of fecundity. Fecundity! In that lay the
      elusive yet insistent charm of that country; and Nancy's, of course, was
      the transforming touch that made it paradise. It was thus, in the country,
      I suggested that we should spend the rest of our existence. What was the
      use of amassing money, when happiness was to be had so simply?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you think you could stand it?&rdquo; she asked, as she handed me a
      plate of blackberries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forever, with the right woman,&rdquo; I announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long could the woman stand it?&rdquo;.... She humoured, smilingly, my
      crystal-gazing into our future, as though she had not the heart to deprive
      me of the pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply can't believe in it, Hugh,&rdquo; she said when I pressed her for an
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it's because I believe in continuity, I haven't the romantic
      temperament,&mdash;I always see the angel with the flaming sword. It isn't
      that I want to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we shall redeem ourselves,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It won't be curiosity and
      idleness. We are not just taking this thing, and expecting to give nothing
      for it in return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we give that is worth it?&rdquo; she exclaimed, with one of her
      revealing flashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't take it lightly, but seriously,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;We shall find
      something to give, and that something will spring naturally out of our
      love. We'll read together, and think and plan together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh, you are incorrigible,&rdquo; was all she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The male tendency in me was forever strained to solve her, to deduce from
      her conversation and conduct a body of consistent law. The effort was
      useless. Here was a realm, that of Nancy's soul, in which there was
      apparently no such thing as relevancy. In the twilight, after dinner, we
      often walked through the orchard to a grassy bank beside the little
      stream, where we would sit and watch the dying glow in the sky. After a
      rain its swollen waters were turbid, opaque yellow-red with the clay of
      the hills; at other times it ran smoothly, temperately, almost clear
      between the pasture grasses and wild flowers. Nancy declared that it
      reminded her of me. We sat there, into the lush, warm nights, and the moon
      shone down on us, or again through long silences we searched the
      bewildering, starry chart of the heavens, with the undertones of the
      night-chorus of the fields in our ears. Sometimes she let my head rest
      upon her knee; but when, throbbing at her touch, with the life-force
      pulsing around us, I tried to take her in my arms, to bring her lips to
      mine, she resisted me with an energy of will and body that I could not
      overcome, I dared not overcome. She acknowledged her love for me, she
      permitted me to come to her, she had the air of yielding but never
      yielded. Why, then, did she allow the words of love to pass? and how draw
      the line between caresses? I was maddened and disheartened by that elusive
      resistance in her&mdash;apparently so frail a thing!&mdash;that neither
      argument nor importunity could break down. Was there something lacking in
      me? or was it that I feared to mar or destroy the love she had. This,
      surely, had not been the fashion of other loves, called unlawful, the
      classic instances celebrated by the poets of all ages rose to mock me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incurably romantic,&rdquo; she had called me, in calmer moments, when I was
      able to discuss our affair objectively. And once she declared that I had
      no sense of tragedy. We read &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; together, I remember, one rainy
      Sunday. The modern world, which was our generation, would seem to be cut
      off from all that preceded it as with a descending knife. It was precisely
      from &ldquo;the sense of tragedy&rdquo; that we had been emancipated: from the
      &ldquo;agonized conscience,&rdquo; I should undoubtedly have said, had I been
      acquainted then with Mr. Santayana's later phrase. Conscience&mdash;the
      old kind of conscience,&mdash;and nothing inherent in the deeds
      themselves, made the tragedy; conscience was superstition, the fear of the
      wrath of the gods: conscience was the wrath of the gods. Eliminate it, and
      behold! there were no consequences. The gods themselves, that kind of
      gods, became as extinct as the deities of the Druids, the Greek fates, the
      terrible figures of German mythology. Yes, and as the God of Christian
      orthodoxy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had any dire calamities overtaken the modern Macbeths, of whose personal
      lives we happened to know something? Had not these great ones broken with
      impunity all the laws of traditional morality? They ground the faces of
      the poor, played golf and went to church with serene minds, untroubled by
      criticism; they appropriated, quite freely, other men's money, and some of
      them other men's wives, and yet they were not haggard with remorse. The
      gods remained silent. Christian ministers regarded these modern
      transgressors of ancient laws benignly and accepted their contributions.
      Here, indeed, were the supermen of the mad German prophet and philosopher
      come to life, refuting all classic tragedy. It is true that some of these
      supermen were occasionally swept away by disease, which in ancient days
      would have been regarded as a retributive scourge, but was in fact nothing
      but the logical working of the laws of hygiene, the result of overwork.
      Such, though stated more crudely, were my contentions when desire did not
      cloud my brain and make me incoherent. And I did not fail to remind Nancy,
      constantly, that this was the path on which her feet had been set; that to
      waver now was to perish. She smiled, yet she showed concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose you don't get what you want?&rdquo; she objected. &ldquo;What then?
      Suppose one doesn't become a superman? or a superwoman? What's to happen
      to one? Is there no god but the superman's god, which is himself? Are
      there no gods for those who can't be supermen? or for those who may refuse
      to be supermen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To refuse, I maintained, were a weakness of the will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there are other wills,&rdquo; she persisted, &ldquo;wills over which the superman
      may conceivably have no control. Suppose, for example, that you don't get
      me, that my will intervenes, granting it to be conceivable that your
      future happiness and welfare, as you insist, depend upon your getting me&mdash;which
      I doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've no reason to doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, granting it, then. Suppose the orthodoxies and superstitions
      succeed in inhibiting me. I may not be a superwoman, but my will, or my
      conscience, if you choose, may be stronger than yours. If you don't get
      what you want, you aren't happy. In other words, you fail. Where are your
      gods then? The trouble with you, my dear Hugh, is that you have never
      failed,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;you've never had a good, hard fall, you've always
      been on the winning side, and you've never had the world against you. No
      wonder you don't understand the meaning and value of tragedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;nor I. Yet I have come to feel, instinctively, that
      somehow concealed in tragedy is the central fact of life, the true
      reality, that nothing is to be got by dodging it, as we have dodged it.
      Your superman, at least the kind of superman you portray, is petrified.
      Something vital in him, that should be plastic and sensitive, has turned
      to stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when did you begin to feel this?&rdquo; I inquired uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since&mdash;well, since we have been together again, in the last month or
      two. Something seems to warn me that if we take&mdash;what we want, we
      shan't get it. That's an Irish saying, I know, but it expresses my
      meaning. I may be little, I may be superstitious, unlike the great women
      of history who have dared. But it's more than mere playing safe&mdash;my
      instinct, I mean. You see, you are involved. I believe I shouldn't
      hesitate if only myself were concerned, but you are the uncertain quantity&mdash;more
      uncertain than you have any idea; you think you know yourself, you think
      you have analyzed yourself, but the truth is, Hugh, you don't know the
      meaning of struggle against real resistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was about to protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that you have conquered in the world of men and affairs,&rdquo; she
      hurried on, &ldquo;against resistance, but it isn't the kind of resistance I
      mean. It doesn't differ essentially from the struggle in the animal
      kingdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have worshipped success, too. Perhaps I still do&mdash;that isn't
      the point. An animal conquers his prey, he is in competition, in constant
      combat with others of his own kind, and perhaps he brings to bear a
      certain amount of intelligence in the process. Intelligence isn't the
      point, either. I know what I'm saying is trite, it's banal, it sounds like
      moralizing, and perhaps it is, but there is so much confusion to-day that
      I think we are in danger of losing sight of the simpler verities, and that
      we must suffer for it. Your super-animal, your supreme-stag subdues the
      other stags, but he never conquers himself, he never feels the need of it,
      and therefore he never comprehends what we call tragedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gather your inference,&rdquo; I said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;I haven't stated the case with the shade of
      delicacy it deserves, but I wanted to make my meaning clear. We have
      raised up a class in America, but we have lost sight, a little&mdash;considerably,
      I think&mdash;of the distinguishing human characteristics. The men you
      were eulogizing are lords of the forest, more or less, and we women, who
      are of their own kind, what they have made us, surrender ourselves in
      submission and adoration to the lordly stag in the face of all the
      sacraments that have been painfully inaugurated by the race for the very
      purpose of distinguishing us from animals. It is equivalent to saying that
      there is no moral law; or, if there is, nobody can define it. We deny,
      inferentially, a human realm as distinguished from the animal, and in the
      denial it seems to me we are cutting ourselves off from what is essential
      human development. We are reverting to the animal. I have lost and you
      have lost&mdash;not entirely, perhaps, but still to a considerable extent&mdash;the
      bloom of that fervour, of that idealism, we may call it, that both of us
      possessed when we were in our teens. We had occasional visions. We didn't
      know what they meant, or how to set about their accomplishment, but they
      were not, at least, mere selfish aspirations; they implied, unconsciously
      no doubt, an element of service, and certainly our ideal of marriage had
      something fine in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it for a higher ideal of marriage that we are searching?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is so,&rdquo; Nancy objected, &ldquo;then all the other elements of our lives
      are sadly out of tune with it. Even the most felicitous union of the sexes
      demands sacrifice, an adjustment of wills, and these are the very things
      we balk at; and the trouble with our entire class in this country is that
      we won't acknowledge any responsibility, there's no sacrifice in our
      eminence, we have no sense of the whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get all these ideas?&rdquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;I've been thrashing around a little; and I've read
      some of the moderns, you know. Do you remember my telling you I didn't
      agree with them? and now this thing has come on me like a judgment. I've
      caught their mania for liberty, for self-realization&mdash;whatever they
      call it&mdash;but their remedies are vague, they fail to convince me that
      individuals achieve any quality by just taking what they want, regardless
      of others.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      I was unable to meet this argument, and the result was that when I was
      away from her I too began to &ldquo;thrash around&rdquo; among the books in a vain
      search for a radical with a convincing and satisfying philosophy. Thus we
      fly to literature in crises of the heart! There was no lack of writers who
      sought to deal&mdash;and deal triumphantly with the very situation in
      which I was immersed. I marked many passages, to read them over to Nancy,
      who was interested, but who accused me of being willing to embrace any
      philosophy, ancient or modern, that ran with the stream of my desires. It
      is worth recording that the truth of this struck home. On my way back to
      the city I reflected that, in spite of my protests against Maude's going&mdash;protests
      wholly sentimental and impelled by the desire to avoid giving pain on the
      spot&mdash;I had approved of her departure because I didn't want her. On
      the other hand I had to acknowledge if I hadn't wanted Nancy, or rather,
      if I had become tired of her, I should have been willing to endorse her
      scruples.... It was not a comforting thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning when I was absently opening the mail I found at my office I
      picked up a letter from Theodore Watling, written from a seaside resort in
      Maine, the contents of which surprised and touched me, troubled me, and
      compelled me to face a situation with which I was wholly unprepared to
      cope. He announced that this was to be his last term in the Senate. He did
      not name the trouble his physician had discovered, but he had been warned
      that he must retire from active life. &ldquo;The specialist whom I saw in New
      York,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;wished me to resign at once, but when I pointed out to
      him how unfair this would be to my friends in the state, to my party as a
      whole&mdash;especially in these serious and unsettled times&mdash;he
      agreed that I might with proper care serve out the remainder of my term. I
      have felt it my duty to write to Barbour and Dickinson and one or two
      others in order that they might be prepared and that no time may be lost
      in choosing my successor. It is true that the revolt within the party has
      never gained much headway in our state, but in these days it is difficult
      to tell when and where a conflagration may break out, or how far it will
      go. I have ventured to recommend to them the man who seems to me the best
      equipped to carry on the work I have been trying to do here&mdash;in
      short, my dear Hugh, yourself. The Senate, as you know, is not a bed of
      roses just now for those who think as we do; but I have the less hesitancy
      in making the recommendation because I believe you are not one to shun a
      fight for the convictions we hold in common, and because you would regard,
      with me, the election of a senator with the new views as a very real
      calamity. If sound business men and lawyers should be eliminated from the
      Senate, I could not contemplate with any peace of mind what might happen
      to the country. In thus urging you, I know you will believe me when I say
      that my affection and judgment are equally involved, for it would be a
      matter of greater pride than I can express to have you follow me here as
      you have followed me at home. And I beg of you seriously to consider
      it.... I understand that Maude and the children are abroad. Remember me to
      them affectionately when you write. If you can find it convenient to come
      here, to Maine, to discuss the matter, you may be sure of a welcome. In
      any case, I expect to be in Washington in September for a meeting of our
      special committee. Sincerely and affectionately yours, Theodore Watling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was characteristic of him that the tone of the letter should be
      uniformly cheerful, that he should say nothing whatever of the blow this
      must be to his ambitions and hopes; and my agitation at the new and
      disturbing prospect thus opened up for me was momentarily swept away by
      feelings of affection and sorrow. A sharp realization came to me of how
      much I admired and loved this man, and this was followed by a pang at the
      thought of the disappointment my refusal would give him. Complications I
      did not wish to examine were then in the back of my mind; and while I
      still sat holding the letter in my hand the telephone rang, and a message
      came from Leonard Dickinson begging me to call at the bank at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miller Gorse was there, and Tallant, waving a palm-leaf while sitting
      under the electric fan. They were all very grave, and they began to talk
      about the suddenness of Mr. Watling's illness and to speculate upon its
      nature. Leonard Dickinson was the most moved of the three; but they were
      all distressed, and showed it&mdash;even Tallant, whom I had never
      credited with any feelings; they spoke about the loss to the state. At
      length Gorse took a cigar from his pocket and lighted it; the smoke,
      impelled by the fan, drifted over the panelled partition into the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Mr. Watling mentioned to you what he wrote to us,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I attribute it to Mr. Watling's friendship,&rdquo; I replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gorse, in his businesslike manner, &ldquo;Watling's right, there's no
      one else.&rdquo; Considering the number of inhabitants of our state, this remark
      had its humorous aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; Dickinson put in, &ldquo;there's no one else available who
      understands the situation as you do, Hugh, no one else we can trust as we
      trust you. I had a wire from Mr. Barbour this morning&mdash;he agrees.
      We'll miss you here, but now that Watling will be gone we'll need you
      there. And he's right&mdash;it's something we've got to decide on right
      away, and get started on soon, we can't afford to wobble and run any
      chances of a revolt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't everybody the senatorship comes to on a platter&mdash;especially
      at your age,&rdquo; said Tallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; I answered, addressing Dickinson, &ldquo;I'm not
      prepared to talk about it now. I appreciate the honour, but I'm not at all
      sure I'm the right man. And I've been considerably upset by this news of
      Mr. Watling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally you would be,&rdquo; said the banker, sympathetically, &ldquo;and we share
      your feelings. I don't know of any man for whom I have a greater affection
      than I have for Theodore Wading. We shouldn't have mentioned it now, Hugh,
      if Watling hadn't started the thing himself, if it weren't important to
      know where we stand right away. We can't afford to lose the seat. Take
      your time, but remember you're the man we depend upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gorse nodded. I was aware, all the time Dickinson was speaking, of being
      surrounded by the strange, disquieting gaze of the counsel for the
      Railroad....
    </p>
    <p>
      I went back to my office to spend an uneasy morning. My sorrow for Mr.
      Watling was genuine, but nevertheless I found myself compelled to consider
      an honour no man lightly refuses. Had it presented itself at any other
      time, had it been due to a happier situation than that brought about by
      the illness of a man whom I loved and admired, I should have thought the
      prospect dazzling indeed, part and parcel of my amazing luck. But now&mdash;now
      I was in an emotional state that distorted the factors of life, all those
      things I hitherto had valued; even such a prize as this I weighed in terms
      of one supreme desire: how would the acceptance of the senatorship affect
      the accomplishment of this desire? That was the question. I began making
      rapid calculations: the actual election would take place in the
      legislature a year from the following January; provided I were able to
      overcome Nancy's resistance&mdash;which I was determined to do&mdash;nothing
      in the way of divorce proceedings could be thought of for more than a
      year; and I feared delay. On the other hand, if we waited until after I
      had been duly elected to get my divorce and marry Nancy my chances of
      reelection would be small. What did I care for the senatorship anyway&mdash;if
      I had her? and I wanted her now, as soon as I could get her. She&mdash;a
      life with her represented new values, new values I did not define, that
      made all I had striven for in the past of little worth. This was a bauble
      compared with the companionship of the woman I loved, the woman intended
      for me, who would give me peace of mind and soul and develop those truer
      aspirations that had long been thwarted and starved for lack of her.
      Gradually, as she regained the ascendency over my mind she ordinarily held&mdash;and
      from which she had been temporarily displaced by the arrival of Mr.
      Watling's letter and the talk in the bank&mdash;I became impatient and
      irritated by the intrusion. But what answer should I give to Dickinson and
      Gorse? what excuse for declining such an offer? I decided, as may be
      imagined, to wait, to temporize.
    </p>
    <p>
      The irony of circumstances&mdash;of what might have been&mdash;prevented
      now my laying this trophy at Nancy's feet, for I knew I had only to
      mention the matter to be certain of losing her.

    <h2>
      XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had bought a small automobile, which I ran myself, and it was my custom
      to arrive at the farm every evening about five o'clock. But as I look back
      upon those days they seem to have lost succession, to be fused together,
      as it were, into one indeterminable period by the intense pressure of
      emotion; unsatisfied emotion,&mdash;and the state of physical and mental
      disorganization set up by it is in the retrospect not a little terrifying.
      The world grew more and more distorted, its affairs were neglected, things
      upon which I had set high values became as nothing. And even if I could
      summon back something of the sequence of our intercourse, it would be a
      mere repetition&mdash;growing on my part more irrational and insistent&mdash;of
      what I have already related. There were long, troubled, and futile
      silences when we sat together on the porch or in the woods and fields;
      when I wondered whether it were weakness or strength that caused Nancy to
      hold out against my importunities: the fears she professed of retribution,
      the benumbing effects of the conventional years, or the deep-rooted
      remnants of a Calvinism which&mdash;as she proclaimed&mdash;had lost
      definite expression to persist as an intuition. I recall something she
      said when she turned to me after one of these silences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how I feel sometimes? as though you and I had wandered
      together into a strange country, and lost our way. We have lost our way,
      Hugh&mdash;it's all so clandestine, so feverish, so unnatural, so
      unrelated to life, this existence we're leading. I believe it would be
      better if it were a mere case of physical passion. I can't help it,&rdquo; she
      went on, when I had exclaimed against this, &ldquo;we are too&mdash;too
      complicated, you are too complicated. It's because we want the morning
      stars, don't you see?&rdquo; She wound her fingers tightly around mine. &ldquo;We not
      only want this, but all of life besides&mdash;you wouldn't be satisfied
      with anything less. Oh, I know it. That's your temperament, you were made
      that way, and I shouldn't be satisfied if you weren't. The time would come
      when you would blame me I don't mean vulgarly&mdash;and I couldn't stand
      that. If you weren't that way, if that weren't your nature, I mean, I
      should have given way long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made some sort of desperate protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, if I didn't know you so well I believe I should have given in long
      ago. I'm not thinking of you alone, but of myself, too. I'm afraid I
      shouldn't be happy, that I should begin to think&mdash;and then I couldn't
      stop. The plain truth, as I've told you over and over again, is that I'm
      not big enough.&rdquo; She continued smiling at me, a smile on which I could not
      bear to look. &ldquo;I was wrong not to have gone away,&rdquo; I heard her say. &ldquo;I
      will go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was, at the time, too profoundly discouraged to answer....
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening after an exhausting talk we sat, inert, on the grass hummock
      beside the stream. Heavy clouds had gathered in the sky, the light had
      deepened to amethyst, the valley was still, swooning with expectancy,
      louder and louder the thunder rolled from behind the distant hills, and
      presently a veil descended to hide them from our view. Great drops began
      to fall, unheeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go in,&rdquo; said Nancy, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      I followed her across the field and through the orchard. From the porch we
      stood gazing out at the whitening rain that blotted all save the nearer
      landscape, and the smell of wet, midsummer grasses will always be
      associated with the poignancy of that moment.... At dinner, between the
      intervals of silence, our talk was of trivial things. We made a mere
      pretence of eating, and I remember having my attention arrested by the
      sight of a strange, pitying expression on the face of Mrs. Olsen, who
      waited on us. Before that the woman had been to me a mere ministering
      automaton. But she must have had ideas and opinions, this transported
      Swedish peasant.... Presently, having cleared the table, she retired....
      The twilight deepened to dusk, to darkness. The storm, having spent the
      intensity of its passion in those first moments of heavy downpour and
      wind, had relaxed to a gentle rain that pattered on the roof, and from the
      stream came recurringly the dirge of the frogs. All I could see of Nancy
      was the dim outline of her head and shoulders: she seemed fantastically to
      be escaping me, to be fading, to be going; in sudden desperation I dropped
      on my knees beside her, and I felt her hands straying with a light yet
      agonized touch, over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I haven't suffered, too? that I don't suffer?&rdquo; I heard her
      ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some betraying note for which I had hitherto waited in vain must have
      pierced to my consciousness, yet the quiver of joy and the swift,
      convulsive movement that followed it seemed one. Her strong, lithe body
      was straining in my arms, her lips returning my kisses.... Clinging to her
      hands, I strove to summon my faculties of realization; and I began to
      speak in broken, endearing sentences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's stronger than we are&mdash;stronger than anything else in the
      world,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're not sorry?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to think&mdash;I don't care,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I only know that
      I love you. I wonder if you will ever know how much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moments lengthened into hours, and she gently reminded me that it was
      late. The lights in the little farmhouses near by had long been
      extinguished. I pleaded to linger; I wanted her, more of her, all of her
      with a fierce desire that drowned rational thought, and I feared that
      something might still come between us, and cheat me of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she cried, with fear in her voice. &ldquo;We shall have to think it
      out very carefully&mdash;what we must do. We can't afford to make any
      mistakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll talk it all over to-morrow,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a last, reluctant embrace I finally left her, walked blindly to where
      the motor car was standing, and started the engine. I looked back.
      Outlined in the light of the doorway I saw her figure in what seemed an
      attitude of supplication....
    </p>
    <p>
      I drove cityward through the rain, mechanically taking the familiar turns
      in the road, barely missing a man in a buggy at a four-corners. He shouted
      after me, but the world to which he belonged didn't exist. I lived again
      those moments that had followed Nancy's surrender, seeking to recall and
      fix in my mind every word that had escaped from her lips&mdash;the trivial
      things that to lovers are so fraught with meaning. I lived it all over
      again, as I say, but the reflection of it, though intensely emotional,
      differed from the reality in that now I was somewhat able to regard the
      thing, to regard myself, objectively; to define certain feelings that had
      flitted in filmy fashion through my consciousness, delicate shadows I
      recognized at the time as related to sadness. When she had so amazingly
      yielded, the thought for which my mind had been vaguely groping was that
      the woman who lay there in my arms, obscured by the darkness, was not
      Nancy at all! It was as if this one precious woman I had so desperately
      pursued had, in the capture, lost her identity, had mysteriously become
      just woman, in all her significance, yes, and helplessness. The particular
      had merged (inevitably, I might have known) into the general: the
      temporary had become the lasting, with a chain of consequences vaguely
      implied that even in my joy gave me pause. For the first time in my life I
      had a glimpse of what marriage might mean,&mdash;marriage in a greater
      sense than I had ever conceived it, a sort of cosmic sense, implying
      obligations transcending promises and contracts, calling for greatness of
      soul of a kind I had not hitherto imagined. Was there in me a grain of
      doubt of my ability to respond to such a high call? I began to perceive
      that such a union as we contemplated involved more obligations than one
      not opposed to traditional views of morality. I fortified myself, however,&mdash;if
      indeed I really needed fortification in a mood prevailingly triumphant and
      exalted,&mdash;with the thought that this love was different, the real
      thing, the love of maturity steeped in the ideals of youth. Here was a
      love for which I must be prepared to renounce other things on which I set
      a high value; prepared, in case the world, for some reason, should not
      look upon us with kindliness. It was curious that such reflections as
      these should have been delayed until after the achievement of my absorbing
      desire, more curious that they should have followed so closely on the
      heels of it. The affair had shifted suddenly from a basis of adventure, of
      uncertainty; to one of fact, of commitment; I am exaggerating my concern
      in order to define it; I was able to persuade myself without much
      difficulty that these little, cloudy currents in the stream of my joy were
      due to a natural reaction from the tremendous strain of the past weeks,
      mere morbid fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length I reached my room at the Club I sat looking out at the rain
      falling on the shining pavements under the arc-lights. Though waves of
      heat caused by some sudden recollection or impatient longing still ran
      through my body, a saner joy of anticipation was succeeding emotional
      tumult, and I reflected that Nancy had been right in insisting that we
      walk circumspectly in spite of passion. After all, I had outwitted
      circumstance, I had gained the prize, I could afford to wait a little. We
      should talk it over to-morrow,&mdash;no, to-day. The luminous face of the
      city hall clock reminded me that midnight was long past....
    </p>
    <p>
      I awoke with the consciousness of a new joy, suddenly to identify it with
      Nancy. She was mine! I kept repeating it as I dressed; summoning her, not
      as she had lain in my arms in the darkness&mdash;though the intoxicating
      sweetness of that pervaded me&mdash;but as she had been before the
      completeness of her surrender, dainty, surrounded by things expressing an
      elusive, uniquely feminine personality. I could afford to smile at the
      weather, at the obsidian sky, at the rain still falling persistently; and
      yet, as I ate my breakfast, I felt a certain impatience to verify what I
      knew was a certainty, and hurried to the telephone booth. I resented the
      instrument, its possibilities of betrayal, her voice sounded so
      matter-of-fact as she bade me good morning and deplored the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be out as soon as I can get away,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I have a meeting at
      three, but it should be over at four.&rdquo; And then I added irresistibly:
      &ldquo;Nancy, you're not sorry? You&mdash;you still&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, don't be foolish,&rdquo; I heard her reply, and this time the telephone
      did not completely disguise the note for which I strained. I said
      something more, but the circuit was closed....
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not attempt to recount the details of our intercourse during the
      week that followed. There were moments of stress and strain when it seemed
      to me that we could not wait, moments that strengthened Nancy's resolution
      to leave immediately for the East: there were other, calmer periods when
      the wisdom of her going appealed to me, since our ultimate union would be
      hastened thereby. We overcame by degrees the distastefulness of the
      discussion of ways and means.... We spent an unforgettable Sunday among
      the distant high hills, beside a little lake of our own discovery, its
      glinting waters sapphire and chrysoprase. A grassy wood road, at the
      inviting entrance to which we left the automobile, led down through an
      undergrowth of laurel to a pebbly shore, and there we lunched; there we
      lingered through the long summer afternoon, Nancy with her back against a
      tree, I with my head in her lap gazing up at filmy clouds drifting
      imperceptibly across the sky, listening to the droning notes of the bees,
      notes that sometimes rose in a sharp crescendo, and again were suddenly
      hushed. The smell of the wood-mould mingled with the fainter scents of
      wild flowers. She had brought along a volume by a modern poet: the verses,
      as Nancy read them, moved me,&mdash;they were filled with a new faith to
      which my being responded, the faith of the forth-farer; not the faith of
      the anchor, but of the sail. I repeated some of the lines as indications
      of a creed to which I had long been trying to convert her, though lacking
      the expression. She had let the book fall on the grass. I remember how she
      smiled down at me with the wisdom of the ages in her eyes, seeking my hand
      with a gesture that was almost maternal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You and the poets,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you never grow up. I suppose that's the
      reason why we love you&mdash;and these wonderful visions of freedom you
      have. Anyway, it's nice to dream, to recreate the world as one would like
      to have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's what you and I are doing,&rdquo; I insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We think we're doing it&mdash;or rather you think so,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;And
      sometimes, I admit that you almost persuade me to think so. Never quite.
      What disturbs me,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;is to find you and the poets founding
      your new freedom on new justifications, discarding the old law only to
      make a new one,&mdash;as though we could ever get away from necessities,
      escape from disagreeable things, except in dreams. And then, this delusion
      of believing that we are masters of our own destiny&mdash;&rdquo; She paused and
      pressed my fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you go-back to predestination!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't go back to anything, or forward to anything,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
      &ldquo;Women are elemental, but I don't expect you to understand it. Laws and
      codes are foreign to us, philosophies and dreams may dazzle us for the
      moment, but what we feel underneath and what we yield to are the primal
      forces, the great necessities; when we refuse joys it's because we know
      these forces by a sort of instinct, when we're overcome it's with a full
      knowledge that there's a price. You've talked a great deal, Hugh, about
      carving out our future. I listened to you, but I resisted you. It wasn't
      the morality that was taught me as a child that made me resist, it was
      something deeper than that, more fundamental, something I feel but can't
      yet perceive, and yet shall perceive some day. It isn't that I'm clinging
      to the hard and fast rules because I fail to see any others, it isn't that
      I believe that all people should stick together whether they are happily
      married or not, but&mdash;I must say it even now&mdash;I have a feeling I
      can't define that divorce isn't for us. I'm not talking about right and
      wrong in the ordinary sense&mdash;it's just what I feel. I've ceased to
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo; I reproached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it&mdash;I don't want to be morbid. Do you remember my
      asking you about God?&mdash;the first day this began? and whether you had
      a god? Well, that's the trouble with us all to-day, we haven't any God,
      we're wanderers, drifters. And now it's just life that's got hold of us,
      my dear, and swept us away together. That's our justification&mdash;if we
      needed one&mdash;it's been too strong for us.&rdquo; She leaned back against the
      tree and closed her eyes. &ldquo;We're like chips in the torrent of it,
      Hugh.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the shadow of the forest had crept far across the lake
      and the darkening waters were still that we rose reluctantly to put the
      dishes in the tea basket and start on our homeward journey. The tawny
      fires of the sunset were dying down behind us, the mist stealing,
      ghostlike, into the valleys below; in the sky a little moon curled like a
      freshly cut silver shaving, that presently turned to gold, the white star
      above it to fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the valleys widened we came to silent, decorous little towns and
      villages where yellow-lit windows gleaming through the trees suggested
      refuge and peace, while we were wanderers in the night. It was Nancy's
      mood; and now, in the evening's chill, it recurred to me poignantly. In
      one of these villages we passed a church, its doors flung open; the
      congregation was singing a familiar hymn. I slowed down the car; I felt
      her shoulder pressing against my own, and reached out my hand and found
      hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you warm enough?&rdquo; I asked....
    </p>
    <p>
      We spoke but little on that drive, we had learned the futility of words to
      express the greater joys and sorrows, the love that is compounded of
      these.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when we turned in between the white dates and made our way up
      the little driveway to the farmhouse. I bade her good night on the steps
      of the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do love me, don't you?&rdquo; she whispered, clinging to me with a sudden,
      straining passion. &ldquo;You will love me, always no matter what happens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, Nancy,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to hear you say it, 'I love you, I shall love you always.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I repeated it fervently....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what happens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter what happens. As if I could help it, Nancy! Why are you so sad
      to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Hugh, it makes me sad&mdash;I can't tell why. It is so great, it is
      so terrible, and yet it's so sweet and beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took my face in her hands and pressed a kiss against my forehead....
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was dark. At two o'clock in the afternoon the electric light
      was still burning over my desk when the telephone rang and I heard Nancy's
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Hugh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to go East this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked. Her agitation had communicated itself to me. &ldquo;I thought
      you weren't going until Thursday. What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've just had a telegram,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ham's been hurt&mdash;I don't know
      how badly&mdash;he was thrown from a polo pony this morning at
      Narragansett, in practice, and they're taking him to Boston to a private
      hospital. The telegram's from Johnny Shephard. I'll be at the house in
      town at four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Filled with forebodings I tried in vain to suppress I dropped the work I
      was doing and got up and paced the room, pausing now and again to gaze out
      of the window at the wet roofs and the grey skies. I was aghast at the
      idea of her going to Ham now even though he were hurt badly hurt; and yet
      I tried to think it was natural, that it was fine of her to respond to
      such a call. And she couldn't very well refuse his summons. But it was not
      the news of her husband's accident that inspired the greater fear, which
      was quelled and soothed only to rise again when I recalled the note I had
      heard in her voice, a note eloquent of tragedy&mdash;of tragedy she had
      foreseen. At length, unable to remain where I was any longer, I descended
      to the street and walked uptown in the rain. The Durrett house was closed,
      the blinds of its many windows drawn, but Nancy was watching for me and
      opened the door. So used had I grown to seeing her in the simple linen
      dresses she had worn in the country, a costume associated with exclusive
      possession, that the sight of her travelling suit and hat renewed in me an
      agony of apprehension. The unforeseen event seemed to have transformed her
      once more. Her veil was drawn up, her face was pale, in her eyes were
      traces of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going?&rdquo; I asked, as I took her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, I have to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led me through the dark, shrouded drawing room into the little salon
      where the windows were open on the silent city-garden. I took her in my
      arms; she did not resist, as I half expected, but clung to me with what
      seemed desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to go, dear&mdash;you won't make it too hard for me! It's only&mdash;ordinary
      decency, and there's no one else to go to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew me to the sofa, her eyes beseeching me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, dear, I want you to see it as I see it. I know that you will,
      that you do. I should never be able to forgive myself if I stayed away
      now, I&mdash;neither of us could ever be happy about it. You do see, don't
      you?&rdquo; she implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I admitted agitatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her grasp on my hand tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you would. But it makes me happier to hear you say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We sat for a moment in helpless silence, gazing at one another. Slowly her
      eyes had filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you heard anything more?&rdquo; I managed to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a telegram from her bag, as though the movement were a relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is from the doctor in Boston&mdash;his name is Magruder. They have
      got Ham there, it seems. A horse kicked him in the head, after he fell,&mdash;he
      had just recovered consciousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took the telegram. The wordy seemed meaningless, all save those of the
      last sentence. &ldquo;The situation is serious, but by no means hopeless.&rdquo; Nancy
      had not spoken of that. The ignorant cruelty of its convention! The man
      must have known what Hambleton Durrett was! Nancy read my thoughts, and
      took the paper from my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, dear, if it's hard for you, try to understand that it's terrible
      for me to think that he has any claim at all. I realize now, as I never
      did before, how wicked it was in me to marry him. I hate him, I can't bear
      the thought of going near him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell into wild weeping. I tried to comfort her, who could not comfort
      myself; I don't remember my inadequate words. We were overwhelmed,
      obliterated by the sense of calamity.... It was she who checked herself at
      last by an effort that was almost hysterical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn't yield to it!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's time to leave and the train goes
      at six. No, you mustn't come to the station, Hugh&mdash;I don't think I
      could stand it. I'll send you a telegram.&rdquo; She rose. &ldquo;You must go now&mdash;you
      must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll come back to me?&rdquo; I demanded thickly, as I held her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, I am yours, now and always. How can you doubt it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last I released her, when she had begged me again. And I found myself a
      little later walking past the familiar, empty houses of those streets....
    </p>
    <p>
      The front pages of the evening newspapers announced the accident to
      Hambleton Durrett, and added that Mrs. Durrett, who had been lingering in
      the city, had gone to her husband's bedside. The morning papers contained
      more of biography and ancestry, but had little to add to the bulletin; and
      there was no lack of speculation at the Club and elsewhere as to Ham's
      ability to rally from such a shock. I could not bear to listen to these
      comments: they were violently distasteful to me. The unforeseen accident
      and Nancy's sudden departure had thrown my life completely out of gear: I
      could not attend to business, I dared not go away lest the news from Nancy
      be delayed. I spent the hours in an exhausting mental state that
      alternated between hope and fear, a state of unmitigated, intense desire,
      of balked realization, sometimes heightening into that sheer terror I had
      felt when I had detected over the telephone that note in her voice that
      seemed of despair. Had she had a presentiment, all along, that something
      would occur to separate us? As I went back over the hours we had passed
      together since she had acknowledged her love, in spite of myself the
      conviction grew on me that she had never believed in the reality of our
      future. Indeed, she had expressed her disbelief in words. Had she been
      looking all along for a sign&mdash;a sign of wrath? And would she accept
      this accident of Ham's as such?
    </p>
    <p>
      Retrospection left me trembling and almost sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the second morning after her departure that I received a
      telegram giving the name of her Boston hotel, and saying that there was to
      be a consultation that day, and as soon as it had taken place she would
      write. Such consolation as I could gather from it was derived from four
      words at the end,&mdash;she missed me dreadfully. Some tremor of pity for
      her entered into my consciousness, without mitigating greatly the wildness
      of my resentment, of my forebodings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could bear no longer the city, the Club, the office, the daily contact
      with my associates and clients. Six hours distant, near Rossiter, was a
      small resort in the mountains of which I had heard. I telegraphed Nancy to
      address me there, notified the office, packed my bag, and waited
      impatiently for midday, when I boarded the train. At seven I reached a
      little station where a stage was waiting to take me to Callender's Mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until morning that I beheld my retreat, when little wisps of
      vapour were straying over the surface of the lake, and the steep green
      slopes that rose out of the water on the western side were still in
      shadow. The hotel, a much overgrown and altered farm-house, stood,
      surrounded by great trees, in an ancient clearing that sloped gently to
      the water's edge, where an old-fashioned, octagonal summerhouse overlooked
      a landing for rowboats. The resort, indeed, was a survival of simpler
      times....
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the thirty-odd guests, people of very moderate incomes who
      knew the place and had come here year after year, I was as much alone as
      if I had been the only sojourner. The place was so remote, so peaceful in
      contrast to the city I had left, which had become intolerable. And at
      night, during hours of wakefulness, the music of the waters falling over
      the dam was soothing. I used to walk down there and sit on the stones of
      the ruined mill; or climb to the crests on the far side of the pond to
      gaze for hours westward where the green billows of the Alleghenies lost
      themselves in the haze. I had discovered a new country; here, when our
      trials should be over, I would bring Nancy, and I found distraction in
      choosing sites for a bungalow. In my soul hope flowered with little
      watering. Uncertain news was good news. After two days of an impatience
      all but intolerable, her first letter arrived, I learned that the
      specialists had not been able to make a diagnosis, and I began to take
      heart again. At times, she said, Ham was delirious and difficult to
      manage; at other times he sank into a condition of coma; and again he
      seemed to know her and Ralph, who had come up from Southampton, where he
      had been spending the summer. One doctor thought that Ham's remarkable
      vitality would pull him through, in spite of what his life had been. The
      shock&mdash;as might have been surmised&mdash;had affected the brain....
      The letters that followed contained no additional news; she did not dwell
      on the depressing reactions inevitable from the situation in which she
      found herself&mdash;one so much worse than mine; she expressed a continual
      longing for me; and yet I had trouble to convince myself that they did not
      lack the note of reassurance for which I strained as I eagerly scanned
      them&mdash;of reassurance that she had no intention of permitting her
      husband's condition to interfere with that ultimate happiness on which it
      seemed my existence depended. I tried to account for the absence of this
      note by reflecting that the letters were of necessity brief, hurriedly
      scratched off at odd moments; and a natural delicacy would prevent her
      from referring to our future at such a time. They recorded no change in
      Ham's condition save that the periods of coma had ceased. The doctors were
      silent, awaiting the arrival in this country of a certain New York
      specialist who was abroad. She spent most of her days at the hospital,
      returning to the hotel at night exhausted: the people she knew in the
      various resorts around Boston had been most kind, sending her flowers, and
      calling when in town to inquire. At length came the news that the New York
      doctor was home again; and coming to Boston. In that letter was a sentence
      which rang like a cry in my ears: &ldquo;Oh, Hugh, I think these doctors know
      now what the trouble is, I think I know. They are only waiting for Dr.
      Jameson to confirm it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was always an effort for me to control my impatience after the first
      rattling was heard in the morning of the stage that brought the mail, and
      I avoided the waiting group in front of the honeycombed partition of boxes
      beside the &ldquo;office.&rdquo; On the particular morning of which I am now writing
      the proprietor himself handed me a letter of ominous thickness which I
      took with me down to the borders of the lake before tearing open the flap.
      In spite of the calmness and restraint of the first lines, because of
      them, I felt creeping over me an unnerving sensation I knew for dread....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh, the New York doctor has been here. It is as I have feared for some
      weeks, but I couldn't tell you until I was sure. Ham is not exactly
      insane, but he is childish. Sometimes I think that is even worse. I have
      had a talk with Dr. Jameson, who has simply confirmed the opinion which
      the other physicians have gradually been forming. The accident has
      precipitated a kind of mental degeneration, but his health, otherwise,
      will not be greatly affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jameson was kind, but very frank, for which I was grateful. He did not
      hesitate to say that it would have been better if the accident had been
      fatal. Ham won't be helpless, physically. Of course he won't be able to
      play polo, or take much active exercise. If he were to be helpless, I
      could feel that I might be of some use, at least of more use. He knows his
      friends. Some of them have been here to see him, and he talks quite
      rationally with them, with Ralph, with me, only once in a while he says
      something silly. It seems odd to write that he is not responsible, since
      he never has been,&mdash;his condition is so queer that I am at a loss to
      describe it. The other morning, before I arrived from the hotel and when
      the nurse was downstairs, he left the hospital, and we found him several
      blocks along Commonwealth Avenue, seated on a bench, without a hat&mdash;he
      was annoyed that he had forgotten it, and quite sensible otherwise. We
      began by taking him out every morning in an automobile. To-day he had a
      walk with Ralph, and insisted on going into a club here, to which they
      both belong. Two or three men were there whom they knew, and he talked to
      them about his fall from the pony and told them just how it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At such times only a close observer can tell from his manner that
      everything is not right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph, who always could manage him, prevented his taking anything to
      drink. He depends upon Ralph, and it will be harder for me when he is not
      with us. His attitude towards me is just about what it has always been. I
      try to amuse him by reading the newspapers and with games; we have a
      chess-board. At times he seems grateful, and then he will suddenly grow
      tired and hard to control. Once or twice I have had to call in Dr.
      Magruder, who owns the hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been terribly hard for me to write all this, but I had to do it,
      in order that you might understand the situation completely. Hugh dear, I
      simply can't leave him. This has been becoming clearer and clearer to me
      all these weeks, but it breaks my heart to have to write it. I have
      struggled against it, I have lain awake nights trying to find
      justification for going to you, but it is stronger than I. I am afraid of
      it&mdash;I suppose that's the truth. Even in those unforgettable days at
      the farm I was afraid of it, although I did not know what it was to be.
      Call it what you like, say that I am weak. I am willing to acknowledge
      that it is weakness. I wish no credit for it, it gives me no glow, the
      thought of it makes my heart sick. I'm not big enough I suppose that's the
      real truth. I once might have been; but I'm not now,&mdash;the years of
      the life I chose have made a coward of me. It's not a question of morals
      or duty it's simply that I can't take the thing for which my soul craves.
      It's too late. If I believed in prayer I'd pray that you might pity and
      forgive me. I really can't expect you to understand what I can't myself
      explain. Oh, I need pity&mdash;and I pity you, my dear. I can only hope
      that you will not suffer as I shall, that you will find relief away to
      work out your life. But I will not change my decision, I cannot change it.
      Don't come on, don't attempt to see me now. I can't stand any more than I
      am standing, I should lose my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the letter was blotted, and some words scratched out. I was unable to
      reconstruct them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ralph and I,&rdquo; she proceeded irrelevantly, &ldquo;have got Ham to agree to go to
      Buzzard's Bay, and we have taken a house near Wareham. Write and tell me
      that you forgive and pity me. I love you even more, if such a thing is
      possible, than I have ever loved you. This is my only comfort and
      compensation, that I have had and have been able to feel such a love, and
      I know I shall always feel it.&mdash;Nancy.&rdquo; The first effect of this
      letter was a paralyzing one. I was unable to realize or believe the thing
      that had happened to me, and I sat stupidly holding the sheet in my hand
      until I heard voices along the path, and then I fled instinctively, like
      an animal, to hide my injury from any persons I might meet. I wandered
      down the shore of the lake, striking at length into the woods, seeking
      some inviolable shelter; nor was I conscious of physical effort until I
      found myself panting near the crest of the ridge where there was a
      pasture, which some ancient glacier had strewn with great boulders. Beside
      one of these I sank. Heralded by the deep tones of bells, two steers
      appeared above the shoulder of a hill and stood staring at me with bovine
      curiosity, and fell to grazing again. A fleet of white clouds, like ships
      pressed with sail, hurried across the sky as though racing for some
      determined port; and the shadows they cast along the hillsides accentuated
      the high brightness of the day, emphasized the vivid and hateful beauty of
      the landscape. My numbness began to be penetrated by shooting pains, and I
      grasped little by little the fulness of my calamity, until I was in the
      state of wild rebellion of one whom life for the first time has foiled in
      a supreme desire. There was no fate about this thing, it was just an
      absurd accident. The operation of the laws of nature had sent a man to the
      ground: another combination of circumstances would have killed him, still
      another, and he would have arisen unhurt. But because of this particular
      combination my happiness was ruined, and Nancy's! She had not expected me
      to understand. Well, I didn't understand, I had no pity, in that hour I
      felt a resentment almost amounting to hate; I could see only unreasoning
      superstition in the woman I wanted above everything in the world. Women of
      other days had indeed renounced great loves: the thing was not unheard of.
      But that this should happen in these times&mdash;and to me! It was
      unthinkable that Nancy of all women shouldn't be emancipated from the
      thralls of religious inhibition! And if it wasn't &ldquo;conscience,&rdquo; what was
      it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it, as she said, weakness, lack of courage to take life when it was
      offered her?... I was suddenly filled with the fever of composing
      arguments to change a decision that appeared to me to be the result of a
      monstrous caprice and delusion; writing them out, as they occurred to me,
      in snatches on the backs of envelopes&mdash;her envelopes. Then I
      proceeded to make the draft of a letter, the effort required for
      composition easing me until the draft was finished; when I started for the
      hotel, climbing fences, leaping streams, making my way across rock faces
      and through woods; halting now and then as some reenforcing argument
      occurred to me to write it into my draft at the proper place until the
      sheets were interlined and blurred and almost illegible. It was already
      three o'clock when I reached my room, and the mail left at four. I began
      to copy and revise my scrawl, glancing from time to time at my watch,
      which I had laid on the table. Hurriedly washing my face and brushing my
      hair, I arrived downstairs just as the stage was leaving....
    </p>
    <p>
      After the letter had gone still other arguments I might have added began
      to occur to me, and I regretted that I had not softened some of the things
      I wrote and made others more emphatic. In places argument had degenerated
      into abject entreaty. Never had my desire been so importunate as now, when
      I was in continual terror of losing her. Nor could I see how I was to live
      without her, life lacking a motive being incomprehensible: yet the fire of
      optimism in me, though died down to ashes, would not be extinguished. At
      moments it flared up into what almost amounted to a conviction that she
      could not resist my appeal. I had threatened to go to her, and more than
      once I started packing....
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later I received a brief note in which she managed to convey to
      me, though tenderly and compassionately, that her decision was
      unalterable. If I came on, she would refuse to see me. I took the
      afternoon stage and went back to the city, to plunge into affairs again;
      but for weeks my torture was so acute that it gives me pain to recall it,
      to dwell upon it to-day.... And yet, amazing as it may seem, there came a
      time when hope began to dawn again out of my despair. Perhaps my life had
      not been utterly shattered, after all: perhaps Ham Durrett would get well:
      such things happened, and Nancy would no longer have an excuse for
      continuing to refuse me. Little by little my anger at what I had now
      become convinced was her weakness cooled, and&mdash;though paradoxically I
      had continued to love her in spite of the torture for which she was
      responsible, in spite of the resentment I felt, I melted toward her. True
      to my habit of reliance on miracles, I tried to reconcile myself to a
      period of waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless I was faintly aware&mdash;consequent upon if not as a result
      of this tremendous experience&mdash;of some change within me. It was not
      only that I felt at times a novel sense of uneasiness at being a prey to
      accidents, subject to ravages of feeling; the unity of mind that had
      hitherto enabled me to press forward continuously toward a concrete goal
      showed signs of breaking up:&mdash;the goal had lost its desirability. I
      seemed oddly to be relapsing into the states of questioning that had
      characterized my earlier years. Perhaps it would be an exaggeration to say
      that I actually began to speculate on the possible existence of a realm
      where the soul might find a refuge from the buffetings of life, from which
      the philosophy of prosperity was powerless to save it....

    <h2>
      XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was impossible, of course, that my friends should have failed to
      perceive the state of disorganization I was in, and some of them at least
      must have guessed its cause. Dickinson, on his return from Maine, at once
      begged me to go away. I rather congratulated myself that Tom had chosen
      these months for a long-delayed vacation in Canada. His passion for
      fishing still persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the fact I have noted, that I had lost a certain zest for
      results, to keep busy seemed to be the only way to relieve my mind of an
      otherwise intolerable pressure: and I worked sometimes far into the
      evening. In the background of my thoughts lay the necessity of coming to a
      decision on the question of the senatorship; several times Dickinson and
      Gorse had spoken of it, and I was beginning to get letters from
      influential men in other parts of the state. They seemed to take it for
      granted that there was no question of my refusing. The time came when I
      had grown able to consider the matter with a degree of calmness. What
      struck me first, when I began to debate upon it, was that the senatorship
      offered a new and possibly higher field for my energies, while at the same
      time the office would be a logical continuation of a signal legal career.
      I was now unable to deny that I no longer felt any exhilaration at the
      prospect of future legal conquests similar to those of the past; but once
      in the Senate, I might regain something of that intense conviction of
      fighting for a just and sound cause with which Theodore Wading had once
      animated me: fighting there, in the Capitol at Washington, would be
      different; no stigma of personal gain attached to it; it offered a nearer
      approach to the ideal I had once more begun to seek, held out hopes of a
      renewal of my unity of mind. Mr. Watling had declared that there was
      something to fight for; I had even glimpsed that something, but I had to
      confess that for some years I had not been consciously fighting for it. I
      needed something to fight for.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the necessity, however, of renewing my calculations. If
      Hambleton Durrett should recover, even during the ensuing year, and if
      Nancy relented it would not be possible for us to be divorced and married
      for some time. I still clung tenaciously to the belief that there were no
      relationships wholly unaffected by worldly triumphs, and as Senator I
      should have strengthened my position. It did not strike me&mdash;even
      after all my experience&mdash;that such a course as I now contemplated had
      a parallel in the one that I had pursued in regard to her when I was
      young.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed fitting that Theodore Watling should be the first to know of my
      decision. I went to Washington to meet him. It pained me to see him
      looking more worn, but he was still as cheerful, as mentally vigorous as
      ever, and I perceived that he did not wish to dwell upon his illness. I
      did venture to expostulate with him on the risk he must be running in
      serving out his term. We were sitting in the dining room of his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've only one life to live, Hugh,&rdquo; he answered, smiling at me, &ldquo;and we
      might as well get all out of it we can. A few years more or less doesn't
      make much difference&mdash;and I ought to be satisfied. I'd resign now, to
      please my wife, to please my friends, but we can't trust this governor to
      appoint a safe man. How little we suspected when we elected him that he'd
      become infected. You never can tell, in these days, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the note of devotion to his cause that I had come to hear: I felt
      it renewing me, as I had hoped. The threat of disease, the louder
      clamourings of the leaders of the mob had not sufficed to dismay him&mdash;though
      he admitted more concern over these. My sympathy and affection were
      mingled with the admiration he never failed to inspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you, Hugh,&rdquo; he said concernedly, &ldquo;you're not looking very well, my
      son. You must manage to take a good rest before coming here&mdash;before
      the campaign you'll have to go through. We can't afford to have anything
      happen to you&mdash;you're too young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I wondered whether he had heard anything.... He spoke to me again about
      the work to be done, the work he looked to me to carry on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to watch for our opportunity,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and when it comes we
      can handle this new movement not by crushing it, but by guiding it. I've
      come to the conclusion that there is a true instinct in it, that there are
      certain things we have done which have been mistakes, and which we can't
      do any more. But as for this theory that all wisdom resides in the people,
      it's buncombe. What we have to do is to work out a practical programme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His confidence in me had not diminished. It helped to restore confidence
      in myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was cool and bracing for September, and as we drove in a motor
      through the beautiful avenues of the city he pointed out a house for me on
      one of the circles, one of those distinguished residences, instances of a
      nascent good taste, that are helping to redeem the polyglot aspect of our
      national capital. Mr. Watling spoke&mdash;rather tactfully, I thought&mdash;of
      Maude and the children, and ventured the surmise that they would be
      returning in a few months. I interpreted this, indeed, as in rather the
      nature of a kindly hint that such a procedure would be wise in view of the
      larger life now dawning for me, but I made no comment.... He even
      sympathized with Nancy Durrett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did the right thing, Hugh,&rdquo; he said, with the admirable casual manner
      he possessed of treating subjects which he knew to be delicate. &ldquo;Nancy's a
      fine woman. Poor devil!&rdquo; This in reference to Ham....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Watling reassured me on the subject of his own trouble, maintaining
      that he had many years left if he took care. He drove me to the station. I
      travelled homeward somewhat lifted out of myself by this visit to him;
      with some feeling of spaciousness derived from Washington itself, with its
      dignified Presidential Mansion among the trees, its granite shaft drawing
      the eye upward, with its winged Capitol serene upon the hill. Should we
      deliver these heirlooms to the mob? Surely Democracy meant more than that!
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time I had been receiving, at intervals, letters from Maude and
      the children. Maude's were the letters of a friend, and I found it easy to
      convince myself that their tone was genuine, that the separation had
      brought contentment to her; and those independent and self-sufficient
      elements in her character I admired now rather than deplored. At Etretat,
      which she found much to her taste, she was living quietly, but making
      friends with some American and English, and one French family of the same
      name, Buffon, as the great naturalist. The father was a retired silk
      manufacturer; they now resided in Paris, and had been very kind in helping
      her to get an apartment in that city for the winter. She had chosen one on
      the Avenue Kleber, not far from the Arc. It is interesting, after her
      arraignment of me, that she should have taken such pains to record their
      daily life for my benefit in her clear, conscientious handwriting. I
      beheld Biddy, her dresses tucked above slim little knees, playing in the
      sand on the beach, her hair flying in the wind and lighted by the sun
      which gave sparkle to the sea. I saw Maude herself in her beach chair, a
      book lying in her lap, its pages whipped by the breeze. And there was
      Moreton, who must be proving something of a handful, since he had fought
      with the French boys on the beach and thrown a &ldquo;rock&rdquo; through the windows
      of the Buffon family. I remember one of his letters&mdash;made perfect
      after much correcting and scratching,&mdash;in which he denounced both
      France and the French, and appealed to me to come over at once to take him
      home. Maude had enclosed it without comment. This letter had not been
      written under duress, as most of his were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew's letters&mdash;he wrote faithfully once a week&mdash;I kept in a
      little pile by themselves and sometimes reread them. I wondered whether it
      were because of the fact that I was his father&mdash;though a most
      inadequate one&mdash;that I thought them somewhat unusual. He had learned
      French&mdash;Maude wrote&mdash;with remarkable ease. I was particularly
      struck in these letters with the boy's power of observation, with his
      facile use of language, with the vivid simplicity of his descriptions of
      the life around him, of his experiences at school. The letters were
      thoughtful&mdash;not dashed off in a hurry; they gave evidence in every
      line of the delicacy of feeling that was, I think, his most appealing
      quality, and I put them down with the impression strong on me that he,
      too, longed to return home, but would not say so. There was a certain
      pathos in this youthful restraint that never failed to touch me, even in
      those times when I had been most obsessed with love and passion.... The
      curious effect of these letters was that of knowing more than they
      expressed. He missed me, he wished to know when I was coming over. And I
      was sometimes at a loss whether to be grateful to Maude or troubled
      because she had as yet given him no hint of our separation. What effect
      would it have on him when it should be revealed to him?... It was through
      Matthew I began to apprehend certain elements in Maude I had both failed
      to note and appreciate; her little mannerisms that jarred, her habits of
      thought that exasperated, were forgotten, and I was forced to confess that
      there was something fine in the achievement of this attitude of hers that
      was without ill will or resentment, that tacitly acknowledged my continued
      rights and interest in the children. It puzzled and troubled me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Citizens Union began its campaign early that autumn, long before the
      Hons. Jonathan Parks and Timothy MacGuire&mdash;Republican and Democratic
      candidates for Mayor&mdash;thought of going on the stump. For several
      weeks the meetings were held in the small halls and club rooms of various
      societies and orders in obscure portions of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forces of &ldquo;privilege and corruption&rdquo; were not much alarmed. Perry
      Blackwood accused the newspapers of having agreed to a &ldquo;conspiracy of
      silence&rdquo;; but, as Judah B. Tallant remarked, it was the business of the
      press to give the public what it wanted, and the public as yet hadn't
      shown much interest in the struggle being waged in its behalf. When the
      meetings began to fill up it would be time to report them in the columns
      of the Era. Meanwhile, however, the city had been quietly visited by an
      enterprising representative of a New York periodical of the new type that
      developed with the opening years of the century&mdash;one making a
      specialty of passionate &ldquo;muck-raking.&rdquo; And since the people of America
      love nothing better than being startled, Yardley's Weekly had acquired a
      circulation truly fabulous. The emissary of the paper had attended several
      of the Citizens meetings; interviewed, it seemed, many persons: the result
      was a revelation to make the blood of politicians, capitalists and
      corporation lawyers run cold. I remember very well the day it appeared on
      our news stands, and the heated denunciations it evoked at the Boyne Club.
      Ralph Hambleton was the only one who took it calmly, who seemed to derive
      a certain enjoyment from the affair. Had he been a less privileged person,
      they would have put him in chancery. Leonard Dickinson asserted that
      Yardley's should be sued for libel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's just one objection to that,&rdquo; said Ralph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the banker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't libel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I defy them to prove it,&rdquo; Dickinson snapped. &ldquo;It's a d&mdash;d outrage!
      There isn't a city or village in the country that hasn't exactly the same
      conditions. There isn't any other way to run a city&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what Mr. Krebs says,&rdquo; Ralph replied, &ldquo;that the people ought to put
      Judd Jason officially in charge. He tells 'em that Jason is probably a
      more efficient man than Democracy will be able to evolve in a coon's age,
      that we ought to take him over, instead of letting the capitalists have
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Krebs say that?&rdquo; Dickinson demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't have read the article very thoroughly, Leonard,&rdquo; Ralph
      commented. &ldquo;I'm afraid you only picked out the part of it that compliments
      you. This fellow seems to have been struck by Krebs, says he's a coming
      man, that he's making original contributions to the people's cause. Quite
      a tribute. You ought to read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dickinson, who had finished his lunch, got up and left the table after
      lighting his cigar. Ralph's look followed him amusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid it's time to cash in and be good,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll get that fellow Krebs yet,&rdquo; said Grierson, wrathfully. Miller Gorse
      alone made no remarks, but in spite of his silence he emanated an
      animosity against reform and reformers that seemed to charge the very
      atmosphere, and would have repressed any man but Ralph....
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat in my room at the Club that night and reread the article, and if its
      author could have looked into my soul and observed the emotions he had set
      up, he would, no doubt, have experienced a grim satisfaction. For I, too,
      had come in for a share of the comment. Portions of the matter referring
      to me stuck in my brain like tar, such as the reference to my father, to
      the honoured traditions of the Parets and the Brecks which I had
      deliberately repudiated. I had less excuse than many others. The part I
      had played in various reprehensible transactions such as the Riverside
      Franchise and the dummy telephone company affair was dwelt upon, and I was
      dismissed with the laconic comment that I was a graduate of Harvard....
    </p>
    <p>
      My associates and myself were referred to collectively as a &ldquo;gang,&rdquo; with
      the name of our city prefixed; we were linked up with and compared to the
      gangs of other cities&mdash;the terminology used to describe us being that
      of the police reporter. We &ldquo;operated,&rdquo; like burglars; we &ldquo;looted&rdquo;: only,
      it was intimated in one place, &ldquo;second-story men&rdquo; were angels compared to
      us, who had never seen the inside of a penitentiary. Here we were, all
      arraigned before the bar of public opinion, the relentless Dickinson, the
      surfeited Scherer, the rapacious Grierson, the salacious Tallant. I have
      forgotten what Miller Gorse was called; nothing so classic as a Minotaur;
      Judd Jason was a hairy spider who spread his net and lurked in darkness
      for his victims. Every adjective was called upon to do its duty.... Even
      Theodore Watling did not escape, but it was intimated that he would be
      dealt with in another connection in a future number.
    </p>
    <p>
      The article had a crude and terrifying power, and the pain it aroused,
      following almost immediately upon the suffering caused by my separation
      from Nancy, was cumulative in character and effect, seeming actively to
      reenforce the unwelcome conviction I had been striving to suppress, that
      the world, which had long seemed so acquiescent in conforming itself to my
      desires, was turning against me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though my hunger for Nancy was still gnawing, I had begun to fear that I
      should never get her now; and the fact that she would not even write to me
      seemed to confirm this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was Matthew&mdash;I could not bear to think that he would ever
      read that article.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain I tried that night to belittle to myself its contentions and
      probable results, to summon up the heart to fight; in vain I sought to
      reconstruct the point of view, to gain something of that renewed hope and
      power, of devotion to a cause I had carried away from Washington after my
      talk with Theodore Watling. He, though stricken, had not wavered in his
      faith. Why should I?
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not as the result of the article in Yardley's, which had been
      read more or less widely in the city, the campaign of the Citizens Union
      gained ground, and people began to fill the little halls to hear Krebs,
      who was a candidate for district attorney. Evidently he was entertaining
      and rousing them, for his reputation spread, and some of the larger halls
      were hired. Dickinson and Gorse became alarmed, and one morning the banker
      turned up at the Club while I was eating my breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Hugh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we may as well face the fact that we've got a
      fight ahead of us,&mdash;we'll have to start some sort of a back-fire
      right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think Greenhalge has a chance of being elected?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not afraid of Greenhalge, but of this fellow Krebs. We can't afford
      to have him district attorney, to let a demagogue like him get a start.
      The men the Republicans and Democrats have nominated are worse than
      useless. Parks is no good, and neither is MacGuire. If only we could have
      foreseen this thing we might have had better candidates put up&mdash;but
      there's no use crying over spilt milk. You'll have to go on the stump,
      Hugh&mdash;that's all there is to it. You can answer him, and the
      newspapers will print your speeches in full. Besides it will help you when
      it comes to the senatorship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mood of extreme dejection that had followed the appearance of the
      article in Yardley's did not last. I had acquired aggressiveness: an
      aggressiveness, however, differing in quality from the feeling I once
      would have had,&mdash;for this arose from resentment, not from belief. It
      was impossible to live in the atmosphere created by the men with whom I
      associated&mdash;especially at such a time&mdash;without imbibing
      something of the emotions animating them,&mdash;even though I had been
      free from these emotions myself. I, too, had begun to be filled with a
      desire for revenge; and when this desire was upon me I did not have in my
      mind a pack of reformers, or even the writer of the article in Yardley's.
      I thought of Hermann Krebs. He was my persecutor; it seemed to me that he
      always had been....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll make speeches if you like,&rdquo; I said to Dickinson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We're all agreed, Gorse and the rest of us, that
      you ought to. We've got to get some ginger into this fight, and a good
      deal more money, I'm afraid. Jason sends word we'll need more. By the way,
      Hugh, I wish you'd drop around and talk to Jason and get his idea of how
      the land lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went, this time in the company of Judah B. Tallant. Naturally we didn't
      expect to see Mr. Jason perturbed, nor was he. He seemed to be in an odd,
      rather exultant mood&mdash;if he can be imagined as exultant. We were not
      long in finding out what pleased him&mdash;nothing less than the fact that
      Mr. Krebs had proposed him for mayor!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D&mdash;d if I wouldn't make a good one, too,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;D&mdash;d if I
      wouldn't show 'em what a real mayor is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there's no danger of your ever being mayor, Judd,&rdquo; Tallant
      observed, with a somewhat uneasy jocularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there isn't, Judah,&rdquo; replied the boss, quickly, but with a
      peculiar violet flash in his eyes. &ldquo;They won't ever make you mayor,
      either, if I can help it. And I've a notion I can. I'd rather see Krebs
      mayor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think he meant to propose you seriously,&rdquo; Tallant exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not a d&mdash;d fool,&rdquo; said the boss. &ldquo;But I'll say this, that he
      half meant it. Krebs has a head-piece on him, and I tell you if any of
      this reform dope is worth anything his is. There's some sense in what he's
      talking, and if all the voters was like him you might get a man like me
      for mayor. But they're not, and I guess they never will be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Jason. &ldquo;The people are dotty&mdash;there ain't one in ten
      thousand understands what he's driving at when he gets off things like
      that. They take it on the level.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tallant reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum, I believe you're right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You think they will blow up?&rdquo;
       he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Krebs is the whole show, I tell you. They wouldn't be anywhere without
      him. The yaps that listen to him don't understand him, but somehow he gets
      under their skins. Have you seen him lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw him,&rdquo; replied Tallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you had, you'd know he was a sick man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my business to know things,&rdquo; said Judd Jason, and added to Tallant,
      &ldquo;that your reporters don't find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter with him?&rdquo; Tallant demanded. A slight exultation in his
      tone did not escape me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got me there,&rdquo; said Jason, &ldquo;but I have it pretty straight. Any one
      of your reporters will tell you that he looks sick.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      The Era took Mr. Jason's advice and began to publish those portions of
      Krebs's speeches that were seemingly detrimental to his own cause. Other
      conservative newspapers followed suit....
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Tallant and I were surprised to hear these sentiments out of the
      mouth of Mr. Jason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think that crowd's going to win, do you?&rdquo; asked the owner of
      the Era, a trifle uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Win!&rdquo; exclaimed the boss contemptuously. &ldquo;They'll blow up, and you'll
      never hear of 'em. I'm not saying we won't need a little&mdash;powder,&rdquo; he
      added&mdash;which was one of the matters we had come to talk about. He
      gave us likewise a very accurate idea of the state of the campaign,
      mentioning certain things that ought to be done. &ldquo;You ought to print some
      of Krebs's speeches, Judah, like what he said about me. They're talking it
      all around that you're afraid to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Print things like his proposal to make you mayor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The information that I was to enter the lists against Krebs was received
      with satisfaction and approval by those of our friends who were called in
      to assist at a council of war in the directors' room of the Corn National
      Bank. I was flattered by the confidence these men seemed to have in my
      ability. All were in a state of anger against the reformers; none of them
      seriously alarmed as to the actual outcome of the campaign,&mdash;especially
      when I had given them the opinion of Mr. Jason. What disturbed them was
      the possible effect upon the future of the spread of heretical,
      socialistic doctrines, and it was decided to organize a publicity bureau,
      independently of the two dominant political parties, to be in charge of a
      certain New York journalist who made a business of such affairs, who was
      to be paid a sum commensurate with the emergency. He was to have carte
      blanche, even in the editorial columns of our newspapers. He was also to
      flood the city with &ldquo;literature.&rdquo; We had fought many wars before this, and
      we planned our campaign precisely as though we were dealing with one of
      those rebellions in the realm of finance of which I have given an
      instance. But now the war chest of our opponents was negligible; and we
      were comforted by the thought that, however disagreeable the affair might
      be while it lasted, in the long run capital was invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before setting to work to prepare my speeches it was necessary to make an
      attempt to familiarize myself with the seemingly unprecedented line of
      argument Krebs had evolved&mdash;apparently as disconcerting to his
      friends as to his opponents. It occurred to me, since I did not care to
      attend Krebs's meetings, to ask my confidential stenographer, Miss McCoy,
      to go to Turner's Hall and take down one of his speeches verbatim. Miss
      McCoy had never intruded on me her own views, and I took for granted that
      they coincided with my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to get an accurate record of what he is saying,&rdquo; I told her. &ldquo;Do
      you mind going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'll be glad to go, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's doing more harm than we thought,&rdquo; I remarked, after a moment. &ldquo;I've
      known him for a good many years. He's clever. He's sowing seeds of
      discontent, starting trouble that will be very serious unless it is headed
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss McCoy made no comment....
    </p>
    <p>
      Before noon the next day she brought in the speech, neatly typewritten,
      and laid it on my desk. Looking up and catching her eye just as she was
      about to withdraw, I was suddenly impelled to ask:&mdash;&ldquo;Well, what did
      you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She actually flushed, for the first time in my dealings with her betraying
      a feeling which I am sure she deemed most unprofessional.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked it, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; she replied simply, and I knew that she had
      understated. It was quite apparent that Krebs had captivated her. I tried
      not to betray my annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there a good audience?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated.

      &ldquo;It isn't a very large hall, you know. I should say it would hold about
      eight hundred people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;it was full?&rdquo;&mdash;I persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, there were numbers of people standing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought I detected in her tone-although it was not apologetic&mdash;a
      desire to spare my feelings. She hesitated a moment more, and then left
      the room, closing the door softly behind her...
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I took up the pages and began to read. The language was simple
      and direct, an appeal to common sense, yet the words strangely seemed
      charged with an emotional power that I found myself resisting. When at
      length I laid down the sheets I wondered whether it were imagination, or
      the uncomfortable result of memories of conversations I had had with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was, however, confronted with the task of refuting his arguments: but
      with exasperating ingenuity, he seemed to have taken the wind out of our
      sails. It is difficult to answer a man who denies the cardinal principle
      of American democracy,&mdash;that a good mayor or a governor may be made
      out of a dog-catcher. He called this the Cincinnatus theory: that any
      American, because he was an American, was fit for any job in the gift of
      state or city or government, from sheriff to Ambassador to Great Britain.
      Krebs substituted for this fallacy what may be called the doctrine of
      potentiality. If we inaugurated and developed a system of democratic
      education, based on scientific principles, and caught the dog-catcher,
      young enough, he might become a statesman or thinker or scientist and make
      his contribution to the welfare and progress of the nation: again, he
      might not; but he would have had his chance, he would not be in a position
      to complain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a doctrine, I immediately perceived, which it would be suicidal
      to attempt to refute. It ought, indeed, to have been my line. With a
      growing distaste I began to realize that all there was left for me was to
      flatter a populace that Krebs, paradoxically, belaboured. Never in the
      history of American &ldquo;uplift&rdquo; had an electorate been in this manner wooed!
      upbraided for expediency, a proneness to demand immediate results, an
      unwillingness to think, yes, and an inability to think straight. Such an
      electorate deserved to be led around by the nose by the Jasons and
      Dickinsons, the Gorses and the Griersons and the Parets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he had mentioned me. That gave me a queer sensation. How is one to
      handle an opponent who praises one with a delightful irony? We, the
      Dickinsons, Griersons, Parets, Jasons, etc., had this virtue at least, and
      it was by no means the least of the virtues,&mdash;that we did think. We
      had a plan, a theory of government, and we carried it out. He was inclined
      to believe that morality consisted largely, if not wholly, in clear
      thinking, and not in the precepts of the Sunday-school. That was the
      trouble with the so-called &ldquo;reform&rdquo; campaigns, they were conducted on
      lines of Sunday-school morality; the people worked themselves up into a
      sort of revivalist frenzy, an emotional state which, if the truth were
      told, was thoroughly immoral, unreasonable and hypocritical: like all
      frenzies, as a matter of course it died down after the campaign was over.
      Moreover, the American people had shown that they were unwilling to make
      any sacrifices for the permanent betterment of conditions, and as soon as
      their incomes began to fall off they turned again to the bosses and
      capitalists like an abject flock of sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to explain that he wasn't referring now to that part of the
      electorate known as the labour element, the men who worked with their
      hands in mills, factories, etc. They had their faults, yet they possessed
      at least the virtue of solidarity, a willingness to undergo sacrifices in
      order to advance the standard of conditions; they too had a tenacity of
      purpose and a plan, such as it was, which the small business men, the
      clerks lacked....
    </p>
    <p>
      We must wake up to the fact that we shouldn't get Utopia by turning out
      Mr. Jason and the highly efficient gentlemen who hired and financed him.
      It wasn't so simple as that. Utopia was not an achievement after all, but
      an undertaking, a state of mind, the continued overcoming of resistance by
      a progressive education and effort. And all this talk of political and
      financial &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; was rubbish; the wickedness they complained of did
      not reside merely in individuals it was a social disorder, or rather an
      order that no longer suited social conditions. If the so-called good
      citizens would take the trouble to educate themselves, to think instead of
      allowing their thinking to be done for them they would see that the
      &ldquo;evils&rdquo; which had been published broadcast were merely the symptoms of
      that disease which had come upon the social body through their collective
      neglect and indifference. They held up their hands in horror at the
      spectacle of a commercial, licensed prostitution, they shunned the
      prostitute and the criminal; but there was none of us, if honest, who
      would not exclaim when he saw them, &ldquo;there, but for the Grace of God, go
      I!&rdquo; What we still called &ldquo;sin&rdquo; was largely the result of lack of
      opportunity, and the active principle of society as at present organized
      tended more and more to restrict opportunity. Lack of opportunity, lack of
      proper nutrition,&mdash;these made sinners by the wholesale; made, too,
      nine-tenths of the inefficient of whom we self-righteously complained. We
      had a national philosophy that measured prosperity in dollars and cents,
      included in this measurement the profits of liquor dealers who were
      responsible for most of our idiots. So long as we set our hearts on that
      kind of prosperity, so long as we failed to grasp the simple and practical
      fact that the greatest assets of a nation are healthy and sane and
      educated, clear-thinking human beings, just so long was prostitution
      logical, Riverside Franchises, traction deals, Judd Jasons, and the
      respectable gentlemen who continued to fill their coffers out of the
      public purse inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker turned his attention to the &ldquo;respectable gentlemen&rdquo; with the
      full coffers, amongst whom I was by implication included. We had simply
      succeeded under the rules to which society tacitly agreed. That was our
      sin. He ventured to say that there were few men in the hall who at the
      bottom of their hearts did not envy and even honour our success. He, for
      one, did not deem these &ldquo;respectable gentlemen&rdquo; utterly reprehensible; he
      was sufficiently emancipated to be sorry for us. He suspected that we were
      not wholly happy in being winners in such a game,&mdash;he even believed
      that we could wish as much as any others to change the game and the
      prizes. What we represented was valuable energy misdirected and misplaced,
      and in a reorganized community he would not abolish us, but transform us:
      transform, at least, the individuals of our type, who were the builders
      gone wrong under the influence of an outworn philosophy. We might be made
      to serve the city and the state with the same effectiveness that we had
      served ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the best among the scientists, among the university professors and
      physicians were willing to labour&mdash;and they were&mdash;for the
      advancement of humanity, for the very love of the work and service without
      disproportionate emoluments, without the accumulation of a wealth
      difficult to spend, why surely these big business men had been moulded in
      infancy from no different clay! All were Americans. Instance after
      instance might be cited of business men and lawyers of ability making
      sacrifices, giving up their personal affairs in order to take places of
      honour in the government in which the salary was comparatively small,
      proving that even these were open to inducements other than merely
      mercenary ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was unfortunate, he went on, but true, that the vast majority of people
      of voting age in the United States to-day who thought they had been
      educated were under the obligation to reeducate themselves. He suggested,
      whimsically, a vacation school for Congress and all legislative bodies as
      a starter. Until the fact of the utter inadequacy of the old education
      were faced, there was little or no hope of solving the problems that
      harassed us. One thing was certain&mdash;that they couldn't be solved by a
      rule-of-thumb morality. Coincident with the appearance of these new and
      mighty problems, perhaps in response to them, a new and saner view of life
      itself was being developed by the world's thinkers, new sciences were
      being evolved, correlated sciences; a psychology making a truer analysis
      of human motives, impulses, of human possibilities; an economics and a
      theory of government that took account of this psychology, and of the vast
      changes applied science had made in production and distribution. We lived
      in a new world, which we sought to ignore; and the new education, the new
      viewpoint was in truth nothing but religion made practical. It had never
      been thought practical before. The motive that compelled men to work for
      humanity in science, in medicine, in art&mdash;yes, and in business, if we
      took the right view of it, was the religious motive. The application of
      religion was to-day extending from the individual to society. No religion
      that did not fill the needs of both was a true religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This meant the development of a new culture, one to be founded on the
      American tradition of equality of opportunity. But culture was not a weed
      that grew overnight; it was a leaven that spread slowly and painfully,
      first inoculating a few who suffered and often died for it, that it might
      gradually affect the many. The spread of culture implied the recognition
      of leadership: democratic leadership, but still leadership. Leadership,
      and the wisdom it implied, did not reside in the people, but in the
      leaders who sprang from the people and interpreted their needs and
      longings.... He went on to discuss a part of the programme of the Citizens
      Union....
    </p>
    <p>
      What struck me, as I laid down the typewritten sheets, was the
      extraordinary resemblance between the philosophies of Hermann Krebs and
      Theodore Watling. Only&mdash;Krebs's philosophy was the bigger, held the
      greater vision of the two; I had reluctantly and rather bitterly to admit
      it. The appeal of it had even reached and stirred me, whose task was to
      refute it! Here indeed was something to fight for&mdash;perhaps to die
      for, as he had said: and as I sat there in my office gazing out of the
      window I found myself repeating certain phrases he had used&mdash;the
      phrase about leadership, for instance. It was a tremendous conception of
      Democracy, that of acquiescence to developed leadership made responsible;
      a conception I was compelled to confess transcended Mr. Watling's, loyal
      as I was to him.... I began to reflect how novel all this was in a
      political speech&mdash;although what I have quoted was in the nature of a
      preamble. It was a sermon, an educational sermon. Well, that is what
      sermons always had been,&mdash;and even now pretended to be,&mdash;educational
      and stirring, appealing to the emotions through the intellect. It didn't
      read like the Socialism he used to preach, it had the ring of religion. He
      had called it religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort of the will I turned from this ironical and dangerous
      vision of a Hugh Paret who might have been enlisted in an inspiring
      struggle, of a modern yet unregenerate Saul kicking against the pricks,
      condemned to go forth breathing fire against a doctrine that made a true
      appeal; against the man I believed I hated just because he had made this
      appeal. In the act of summoning my counter-arguments I was interrupted by
      the entrance of Grierson. He was calling on a matter of business, but
      began to talk about the extracts from Krebs's speech he had read in the
      Mail and State.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in hell is this fellow driving at, Paret?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;It sounds
      to me like the ranting of a lunatic dervish. If he thinks so much of us,
      and the way we run the town, what's he squawking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Grierson, and conceived an intense aversion for him. I
      wondered how I had ever been able to stand him, to work with him. I saw
      him in a sudden flash as a cunning, cruel bird of prey, a gorged, drab
      vulture with beady eyes, a resemblance so extraordinary that I wondered I
      had never remarked it before. For he had the hooked vulture nose, while
      the pink baldness of his head was relieved by a few scanty tufts of hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people seem to like what he's got to say,&rdquo; I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It beats me,&rdquo; said Grierson. &ldquo;They don't understand a quarter of it&mdash;I've
      been talking to some of 'em. It's their d&mdash;d curiosity, I guess. You
      know how they'll stand for hours around a street fakir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's more than that,&rdquo; I retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grierson regarded me piercingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll put a crimp in him, all right,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was in an unenviable state of mind when he left me. I had an impulse to
      send for Miss McCoy and ask her if she had understood what Krebs was
      &ldquo;driving at,&rdquo; but for reasons that must be fairly obvious I refrained. I
      read over again that part of Krebs's speech which dealt with the immediate
      programme of the Citizens Union. After paying a tribute to Greenhalge as a
      man of common sense and dependability who would make a good mayor, he went
      on to explain the principle of the new charter they hoped ultimately to
      get, which should put the management of the city in the hands of one man,
      an expert employed by a commission; an expert whose duty it would be to
      conduct the affairs of the city on a business basis, precisely as those of
      any efficient corporation were conducted. This plan had already been
      adopted, with encouraging results, in several smaller cities of the
      country. He explained in some detail, with statistics, the waste and
      inefficiency and dishonesty in various departments under the present
      system, dwelling particularly upon the deplorable state of affairs in the
      city hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not dwell upon this portion of his remarks. Since then text-books
      and serious periodicals have dealt with these matters thoroughly. They are
      now familiar to all thinking Americans.

    <h2>
      XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      My entrance into the campaign was accompanied by a blare of publicity, and
      during that fortnight I never picked up a morning or evening newspaper
      without reading, on the first page, some such headline as &ldquo;Crowds flock to
      hear Paret.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, the crowds did flock; but I never quite
      knew as I looked down from platforms on seas of faces how much of the
      flocking was spontaneous. Much of it was so, since the struggle had then
      become sufficiently dramatic to appeal to the larger public imagination
      that is but occasionally waked; on the other hand, the magic of
      advertising cannot be underestimated; nor must the existence be ignored of
      an organized corps of shepherds under the vigilant direction of Mr. Judd
      Jason, whose duty it was to see that none of our meetings was lacking in
      numbers and enthusiasm. There was always a demonstrative gathering
      overflowing the sidewalk in front of the entrance, swaying and cheering in
      the light of the street lamps, and on the floor within an ample scattering
      of suspiciously bleary-eyed voters to start the stamping and applauding.
      In spite of these known facts, the impression of popularity, of
      repudiation of reform by a large majority of level-headed inhabitants had
      reassuring and reenforcing effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astute citizens, spectators of the fray&mdash;if indeed there were any&mdash;might
      have remarked an unique and significant feature of that campaign: that the
      usual recriminations between the two great parties were lacking. Mr.
      Parks, the Republican candidate, did not denounce Mr. MacGuire, the
      Democratic candidate. Republican and Democratic speakers alike expended
      their breath in lashing Mr. Krebs and the Citizens Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to record the fluctuations of my spirit. When I was in the
      halls, speaking or waiting to speak, I reacted to that phenomenon known as
      mob psychology, I became self-confident, even exhilarated; and in those
      earlier speeches I managed, I think, to strike the note for which I strove&mdash;the
      judicial note, suitable to a lawyer of weight and prominence, of
      deprecation rather than denunciation. I sought to embody and voice a fine
      and calm sanity at a time when everyone else seemed in danger of losing
      their heads, and to a large extent achieved it. I had known Mr. Krebs for
      more than twenty years, and while I did not care to criticise a
      fellow-member of the bar, I would go so far as to say that he was
      visionary, that the changes he proposed in government would, if adopted,
      have grave and far-reaching results: we could not, for instance, support
      in idleness those who refused to do their share of the work of the world.
      Mr. Krebs was well-meaning. I refrained from dwelling too long upon him,
      passing to Mr. Greenhalge, also well-meaning, but a man of mediocre
      ability who would make a mess of the government of a city which would one
      day rival New York and Chicago. (Loud cheers.) And I pointed out that Mr.
      Perry Blackwood had been unable to manage the affairs of the Boyne Street
      road. Such men, well-intentioned though they might be, were hindrances to
      progress. This led me naturally to a discussion of the Riverside Franchise
      and the Traction Consolidation. I was one of those whose honesty and good
      faith had been arraigned, but I would not stoop to refute the accusations.
      I dwelt upon the benefits to the city, uniform service, electricity and
      large comfortable cars instead of rattletrap conveyances, and the
      development of a large and growing population in the Riverside
      neighbourhood: the continual extension of lines to suburban districts that
      enabled hard-worked men to live out of the smoke: I called attention to
      the system of transfers, the distance a passenger might be conveyed, and
      conveyed quickly, for the sum of five cents. I spoke of our capitalists as
      men more sinned against than sinning. Their money was always at the
      service of enterprises tending to the development of our metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was not in the meetings, however, and especially when in my room at
      night, I was continually trying to fight off a sense of loneliness that
      seemed to threaten to overwhelm me. I wanted to be alone, and yet I feared
      to be. I was aware, in spite of their congratulations on my efforts, of a
      growing dislike for my associates; and in the appalling emptiness of the
      moments when my depression was greatest I was forced to the realization
      that I had no disinterested friend&mdash;not one&mdash;in whom I could
      confide. Nancy had failed me; I had scarcely seen Tom Peters that winter,
      and it was out of the question to go to him. For the third time in my
      life, and in the greatest crisis of all, I was feeling the need of
      Something, of some sustaining and impelling Power that must be presented
      humanly, possessing sympathy and understanding and love.... I think I had
      a glimpse just a pathetic glimpse&mdash;of what the Church might be of
      human solidarity, comfort and support, of human tolerance, if stripped of
      the superstition of an ancient science. My tortures weren't of the flesh,
      but of the mind. My mind was the sheep which had gone astray. Was there no
      such thing, could there be no such thing as a human association that might
      at the same time be a divine organism, a fold and a refuge for the lost
      and divided minds? The source of all this trouble was social....
    </p>
    <p>
      Then toward the end of that last campaign week, madness suddenly came upon
      me. I know now how near the breaking point I was, but the immediate cause
      of my &ldquo;flying to pieces&rdquo;&mdash;to use a vivid expression&mdash;was a
      speech made by Guptill, one of the Citizens Union candidates for alderman,
      a young man of a radical type not uncommon in these days, though new to my
      experience: an educated man in the ultra-radical sense, yet lacking poise
      and perspective, with a certain brilliance and assurance. He was a
      journalist, a correspondent of some Eastern newspapers and periodicals. In
      this speech, which was reported to me&mdash;for it did not get into the
      newspapers&mdash;I was the particular object of his attack. Men of my
      kind, and not the Judd Jasons (for whom there was some excuse) were the
      least dispensable tools of the capitalists, the greatest menace to
      civilization. We were absolutely lacking in principle, we were ready at
      any time to besmirch our profession by legalizing steals; we fouled our
      nests with dirty fees. Not all that he said was vituperation, for he knew
      something of the modern theory of the law that legal radicals had begun to
      proclaim, and even to teach in some tolerant universities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night, in the middle of a prepared speech I was delivering to a
      large crowd in Kingdom Hall there had been jeers from a group in a corner
      at some assertion I made. Guptill's accusations had been festering in my
      mind. The faces of the people grew blurred as I felt anger boiling, rising
      within me; suddenly my control gave way, and I launched forth into a
      denunciation of Greenhalge, Krebs, Guptill and even of Perry Blackwood
      that must have been without license or bounds. I can recall only fragments
      of my remarks: Greenhalge wanted to be mayor, and was willing to put the
      stigma of slander on his native city in order to gain his ambition; Krebs
      had made a failure of his profession, of everything save in bringing shame
      on the place of his adoption; and on the single occasion heretofore when
      he had been before the public, in the School Board fiasco, the officials
      indicted on his supposed evidence had triumphantly been vindicated&mdash;,
      Guptill was gaining money and notoriety out of his spleen; Perry Blackwood
      was acting out of spite.... I returned to Krebs, declaring that he would
      be the boss of the city if that ticket were elected, demanding whether
      they wished for a boss an agitator itching for power and recognition....
    </p>
    <p>
      I was conscious at the moment only of a wild relief and joy in letting
      myself go, feelings heightened by the clapping and cheers with which my
      characterizations were received. The fact that the cheers were mingled
      with hisses merely served to drive me on. At length, when I had returned
      to Krebs, the hisses were redoubled, angering me the more because of the
      evidence they gave of friends of his in my audiences. Perhaps I had made
      some of these friends for him! A voice shouted out above the uproar:&mdash;&ldquo;I
      know about Krebs. He's a d&mdash;d sight better man than you.&rdquo; And this
      started a struggle in a corner of the hall.... I managed, somehow, when
      the commotion had subsided, to regain my poise, and ended by uttering the
      conviction that the common sense of the community would repudiate the
      Citizens Union and all it stood for....
    </p>
    <p>
      But that night, as I lay awake listening to the street noises and staring
      at the glint from a street lamp on the brass knob of my bedstead, I knew
      that I had failed. I had committed the supreme violation of the self that
      leads inevitably to its final dissolution.... Even the exuberant headlines
      of the newspapers handed me by the club servant in the morning brought but
      little relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Saturday morning before the Tuesday of election there was a
      conference in the directors' room of the Corn National. The city reeked
      with smoke and acrid, stale gas, the electric lights were turned on to
      dispel the November gloom. It was not a cheerful conference, nor a
      confident one. For the first time in a collective experience the men
      gathered there were confronted with a situation which they doubted their
      ability to control, a situation for which there was no precedent. They had
      to reckon with a new and unsolvable equation in politics and finance,&mdash;the
      independent voter. There was an element of desperation in the discussion.
      Recriminations passed. Dickinson implied that Gorse with all his knowledge
      of political affairs ought to have foreseen that something like this was
      sure to happen, should have managed better the conventions of both great
      parties. The railroad counsel retorted that it had been as much
      Dickinson's fault as his. Grierson expressed a regret that I had broken
      out against the reformers; it had reacted, he said,&mdash;and this was
      just enough to sting me to retaliate that things had been done in the
      campaign, chiefly through his initiative, that were not only unwise, but
      might land some of us in the penitentiary if Krebs were elected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Grierson exclaimed, &ldquo;whether he's elected or not, I wouldn't give
      much now for your chances of getting to the Senate. We can't afford to fly
      in the face of the dear public.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tense silence followed this remark. In the street below the rumble of
      the traffic came to us muffled by the heavy plate-glass windows. I saw
      Tallant glance at Gorse and Dickinson, and I knew the matter had been
      decided between themselves, that they had been merely withholding it from
      me until after election. I was besmirched, for the present at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will do me the justice, gentlemen,&rdquo; I remember saying slowly,
      with the excessive and rather ridiculous formality of a man who is near
      the end of his tether, &ldquo;that the idea of representing you in the Senate
      was yours, not mine. You begged me to take the appointment against my
      wishes and my judgment. I had no desire to go to Washington then, I have
      less to-day. I have come to the conclusion that my usefulness to you is at
      an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got to my feet. I beheld Miller Gorse sitting impassive, with his
      encompassing stare, the strongest man of them all. A change of firmaments
      would not move him. But Dickinson had risen and put his hand on my
      shoulder. It was the first time I had ever seen him white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, Hugh,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I guess we're all a little cantankerous
      today. This confounded campaign has got on our nerves, and we say things
      we don't mean. You mustn't think we're not grateful for the services
      you've rendered us. We're all in the same boat, and there isn't a man
      who's been on our side of this fight who could take a political office at
      this time. We've got to face that fact, and I know you have the sense to
      see it, too. I, for one, won't be satisfied until I see you in the Senate.
      It's where you belong, and you deserve to be there. You understand what
      the public is, how it blows hot and cold, and in a few years they'll be
      howling to get us back, if these demagogues win.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; chimed in Grierson, who was frightened, &ldquo;that's right, Hugh. I
      didn't mean anything. Nobody appreciates you more than I do, old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tallant, too, added something, and Berringer,&mdash;I've forgotten what. I
      was tired, too tired to meet their advances halfway. I said that I had a
      speech to get ready for that night, and other affairs to attend to, and
      left them grouped together like crestfallen conspirators&mdash;all save
      Miller Gorse, whose pervasive gaze seemed to follow me after I had closed
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      An elevator took me down to the lobby of the Corn Bank Building. I paused
      for a moment, aimlessly regarding the streams of humanity hurrying in and
      out, streaking the white marble floor with the wet filth of the streets.
      Someone spoke my name. It was Bitter, Judd Jason's &ldquo;legal&rdquo; tool, and I
      permitted myself to be dragged out of the eddies into a quiet corner by
      the cigar stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, I guess we've got Krebs's goat all right, this time,&rdquo; he told me
      confidentially, in a voice a little above a whisper; &ldquo;he was busy with the
      shirt-waist girls last year, you remember, when they were striking. Well,
      one of 'em, one of the strike leaders, has taken to easy street; she's
      agreed to send him a letter to-night to come 'round to her room after his
      meeting, to say that she's sick and wants to see him. He'll go, all right.
      We'll have some fun, we'll be ready for him. Do you get me? So long. The
      old man's waiting for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may seem odd that this piece of information did not produce an
      immediately revolting effect. I knew that similar practices had been tried
      on Krebs, but this was the first time I had heard of a definite plan, and
      from a man like Bitter. As I made my way out of the building I had,
      indeed, a nauseated feeling; Jason's &ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; was a dirty little man,
      smelling of stale cigars, with a blue-black, unshaven face. In spite of
      the shocking nature of his confidence, he had actually not succeeded in
      deflecting the current of my thoughts; these were still running over the
      scene in the directors' room. I had listened to him passively while he had
      held my buttonhole, and he had detained me but an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached the street I was wondering whether Gorse and Dickinson and
      the others, Grierson especially, could possibly have entertained the
      belief that I would turn traitor? I told myself that I had no intention of
      this. How could I turn traitor? and what would be the object? revenge? The
      nauseated feeling grew more acute.... Reaching my office, I shut the door,
      sat down at my desk, summoned my will, and began to jot down random notes
      for the part of my speech I was to give the newspapers, notes that were
      mere silly fragments of arguments I had once thought effective. I could no
      more concentrate on them than I could have written a poem. Gradually, like
      the smoke that settled down on our city until we lived in darkness at
      midday, the horror of what Bitter had told me began to pervade my mind,
      until I was in a state of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had I, Hugh Paret, fallen to this, that I could stand by consenting to an
      act which was worse than assassination? Was any cause worth it? Could any
      cause survive it? But my attempts at reasoning might be likened to the
      strainings of a wayfarer lost on a mountain side to pick his way in the
      gathering dusk. I had just that desperate feeling of being lost, and with
      it went an acute sense of an imminent danger; the ground, no longer firm
      under my feet, had become a sliding shale sloping toward an unseen
      precipice. Perhaps, like the wayfarer, my fears were the sharper for the
      memory of the beauty of the morning on that same mountain, when, filled
      with vigour, I had gazed on it from the plain below and beheld the sun
      breaking through the mists....
    </p>
    <p>
      The necessity of taking some action to avert what I now realized as an
      infamy pressed upon me, yet in conflict with the pressure of this
      necessity there persisted that old rebellion, that bitterness which had
      been growing all these years against the man who, above all others, seemed
      to me to represent the forces setting at nought my achievements, bringing
      me to this pass....
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought of appealing to Leonard Dickinson, who surely, if he knew of it,
      would not permit this thing to be done; and he was the only man with the
      possible exception of Miller Gorse who might be able to restrain Judd
      Jason. But I delayed until after the luncheon hour, when I called up the
      bank on the telephone, to discover that it was closed. I had forgotten
      that the day was Saturday. I was prepared to say that I would withdraw
      from the campaign, warn Krebs myself if this kind of tactics were not
      suppressed. But I could not get the banker. Then I began to have doubts of
      Dickinson's power in the matter. Judd Jason had never been tractable, by
      any means; he had always maintained a considerable independence of the
      financial powers, and to-day not only financial control, but the dominance
      of Jason himself was at stake. He would fight for it to the last ditch,
      and make use of any means. No, it was of no use to appeal to him. What
      then? Well, there was a reaction, or an attempt at one. Krebs had not been
      born yesterday, he had avoided the wiles of the politicians heretofore, he
      wouldn't be fool enough to be taken in now. I told myself that if I were
      not in a state bordering on a nervous breakdown, I should laugh at such
      morbid fears, I steadied myself sufficiently to dictate the extract from
      my speech that was to be published. I was to make addresses at two halls,
      alternating with Parks, the mayoralty candidate. At four o'clock I went
      back to my room in the Club to try to get some rest....
    </p>
    <p>
      Seddon's Hall, the place of my first meeting, was jammed that Saturday
      night. I went through my speech automatically, as in a dream, the habit of
      long years asserting itself. And yet&mdash;so I was told afterwards&mdash;my
      delivery was not mechanical, and I actually achieved more emphasis, gave a
      greater impression of conviction than at any time since the night I had
      lost my control and violently denounced the reformers. By some astonishing
      subconscious process I had regained my manner, but the applause came to me
      as from a distance. Not only was my mind not there; it did not seem to be
      anywhere. I was dazed, nor did I feel&mdash;save once&mdash;a fleeting
      surge of contempt for the mob below me with their silly faces upturned to
      mine. There may have been intelligent expressions among them, but they
      failed to catch my eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember being stopped by Grierson as I was going out of the side
      entrance. He took my hand and squeezed it, and there was on his face an
      odd, surprised look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the best yet, Hugh,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on past him. Looking back on that evening now, it would almost seem
      as though the volition of another possessed me, not my own: seemingly, I
      had every intention of going on to the National Theatre, in which Parks
      had just spoken, and as I descended the narrow stairway and emerged on the
      side street I caught sight of my chauffeur awaiting me by the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to that other meeting,&rdquo; I found myself saying. &ldquo;I'm pretty
      tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I drive you back to the Club, sir?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I'll walk back. Wait a moment.&rdquo; I entered the ear, turned on the
      light and scribbled a hasty note to Andrews, the chairman of the meeting
      at the National, telling him that I was too tired to speak again that
      night, and to ask one of the younger men there to take my place. Then I
      got out of the car and gave the note to the chauffeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're all right, sir?&rdquo; he asked, with a note of anxiety in his voice. He
      had been with me a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reassured him. He started the car, and I watched it absently as it
      gathered speed and turned the corner. I began to walk, slowly at first,
      then more and more rapidly until I had gained a breathless pace; in ten
      minutes I was in West Street, standing in front of the Templar's Hall
      where the meeting of the Citizens Union west in progress. Now that I had
      arrived there, doubt and uncertainty assailed me. I had come as it were in
      spite of myself, thrust onward by an impulse I did not understand, which
      did not seem to be mine. What was I going to do? The proceeding suddenly
      appeared to me as ridiculous, tinged with the weirdness of somnambulism. I
      revolted, walked away, got as far as the corner and stood beside a lamp
      post, pretending to be waiting for a car. The street lights were reflected
      in perpendicular, wavy-yellow ribbons on the wet asphalt, and I stood
      staring with foolish intentness at this phenomenon, wondering how a
      painter would get the effect in oils. Again I was walking back towards the
      hall, combating the acknowledgment to myself that I had a plan, a plan
      that I did not for a moment believe I would carry out. I was shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I climbed the steps. The wide vestibule was empty except for two men who
      stopped a low-toned conversation to look at me. I wondered whether they
      recognized me; that I might be recognized was an alarming possibility
      which had not occurred to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is speaking?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Krebs,&rdquo; answered the taller man of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hum of applause came from behind the swinging doors. I pushed them
      open cautiously, passing suddenly out of the cold into the reeking, heated
      atmosphere of a building packed with human beings. The space behind the
      rear seats was filled with men standing, and those nearest glanced around
      with annoyance at the interruption of my entrance. I made my way along the
      wall, finally reaching a side aisle, whence I could get sight of the
      platform and the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard his words distinctly, but at first lacked the faculty of stringing
      them together, or rather of extracting their collective sense. The phrases
      indeed were set ringing through my mind, I found myself repeating them
      without any reference to their meaning; I had reached the peculiar pitch
      of excitement that counterfeits abnormal calm, and all sense of
      strangeness at being there in that meeting had passed away. I began to
      wonder how I might warn Krebs, and presently decided to send him a note
      when he should have finished speaking&mdash;but I couldn't make up my mind
      whether to put my name to the note or not. Of course I needn't have
      entered the hall at all: I might have sent in my note at the side door.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must have wished to see Krebs, to hear him speak; to observe, perhaps,
      the effect on the audience. In spite of my inability to take in what he
      was saying, I was able to regard him objectively,&mdash;objectively, in a
      restricted sense. I noticed that he had grown even thinner; the flesh had
      fallen away from under his cheek-bones, and there were sharp, deep, almost
      perpendicular lines on either side of his mouth. He was emaciated, that
      was the word. Once in a while he thrust his hand through his dry, ashy
      hair which was of a tone with the paleness of his face. Such was his only
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke quietly, leaning with one elbow against the side of his reading
      stand. The occasional pulsations of applause were almost immediately
      hushed, as though the people feared to lose even a word that should fall
      from his dry lips. What was it he was talking about? I tried to
      concentrate my attention, with only partial success. He was explaining the
      new theory of city government that did not attempt to evade, but dealt
      frankly with the human needs of to-day, and sought to meet those needs in
      a positive way... What had happened to me, though I did not realize it,
      was that I had gradually come under the influence of a tragic spell not
      attributable to the words I heard, existing independently of them,
      pervading the spacious hall, weaving into unity dissentient minds. And
      then, with what seemed a retarded rather than sudden awareness, I knew
      that he had stopped speaking. Once more he ran his hand through his hair,
      he was seemingly groping for words that would not come. I was pierced by a
      strange agony&mdash;the amazing source of which, seemed to be a smile on
      the face of Hermann Krebs, an ineffable smile illuminating the place like
      a flash of light, in which suffering and tragedy, comradeship and loving
      kindness&mdash;all were mingled. He stood for a moment with that smile on
      his face&mdash;swayed, and would have fallen had it not been for the
      quickness of a man on the platform behind him, and into whose arms he
      sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant people had risen in their seats, men were hurrying down the
      aisles, while a peculiar human murmur or wail persisted like an undertone
      beneath the confusion of noises, striking the very note of my own
      feelings. Above the heads of those about me I saw Krebs being carried off
      the platform.... The chairman motioned for silence and inquired if there
      were a physician in the audience, and then all began to talk at once. The
      man who stood beside me clutched my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he isn't dead! Say, did you see that smile? My God, I'll never
      forget it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The exclamation poignantly voiced the esteem in which Krebs was held. As I
      was thrust along out of the hall by the ebb of the crowd still other
      expressions of this esteem came to me in fragments, expressions of sorrow
      and dismay, of a loyalty I had not imagined. Mingled with these were
      occasional remarks of skeptics shaken, in human fashion, by the suggestion
      of the inevitable end that never fails to sober and terrify humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he was a bigger man than we thought. There was a lot of sense in
      what he had to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There sure was,&rdquo; the companion of this speaker answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke of him in the past tense. I was seized and obsessed by the fear
      that I should never see him again, and at the same moment I realized
      sharply that this was the one thing I wanted&mdash;to see him. I pushed
      through the people, gained the street, and fairly ran down the alley that
      led to the side entrance of the hall, where a small group was gathered
      under the light that hung above the doorway. There stood on the step, a
      little above the others, a young man in a grey flannel shirt, evidently a
      mechanic. I addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the doctor say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before replying he surveyed me with surprise and, I think, with
      instinctive suspicion of my clothes and bearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can he say?&rdquo; he retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;?&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean Mr. Krebs oughtn't never to have gone into this campaign,&rdquo; he
      answered, relenting a trifle, perhaps at the tone of my voice. &ldquo;He knew
      it, too, and some of us fellows tried to stop him. But we couldn't do
      nothing with him,&rdquo; he added dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is&mdash;the trouble?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They tell me it's his heart. He wouldn't talk about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I think of what he done for our union!&rdquo; exclaimed a thick-set man,
      plainly a steel worker. &ldquo;He's just wore himself out, fighting that crooked
      gang.&rdquo; He stared with sudden aggressiveness at me. &ldquo;Haven't I seen you
      some-wheres?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A denial was on my lips when the sharp, sinister strokes of a bell were
      heard coming nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the ambulance,&rdquo; said the man on the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glancing up the alley beyond the figures of two policemen who had arrived
      and were holding the people back, I saw the hood of the conveyance as it
      came to a halt, and immediately a hospital doctor and two assistants
      carrying a stretcher hurried towards us, and we made way for them to
      enter. After a brief interval, they were heard coming slowly down the
      steps inside. By the white, cruel light of the arc I saw Krebs lying
      motionless.... I laid hold of one of the men who had been on the platform.
      He did not resent the act, he seemed to anticipate my question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's conscious. The doctors expect him to rally when he gets to the
      hospital.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I walked back to the Club to discover that several inquiries had been made
      about me. Reporters had been there, Republican Headquarters had telephoned
      to know if I were ill. Leaving word that I was not to be disturbed under
      any circumstances, I went to my room, and spent most of the night in
      distracted thought. When at last morning came I breakfasted early,
      searching the newspapers for accounts of the occurrence at Templar's Hall;
      and the fact that these were neither conspicuous nor circumstantial was in
      the nature of a triumph of self-control on the part of editors and
      reporters. News, however sensational, had severely to be condensed in the
      interest of a cause, and at this critical stage of the campaign to make a
      tragic hero of Hermann Krebs would have been the height of folly. There
      were a couple of paragraphs giving the gist of his speech, and a statement
      at the end that he had been taken ill and conveyed to the Presbyterian
      Hospital....
    </p>
    <p>
      The hospital itself loomed up before me that Sunday morning as I
      approached it along Ballantyne Street, a diluted sunshine washing the
      extended, businesslike facade of grimy, yellow brick. We were proud of
      that hospital in the city, and many of our foremost citizens had
      contributed large sums of money to the building, scarcely ten years old.
      It had been one of Maude's interests. I was ushered into the reception
      room, where presently came the physician in charge, a Dr. Castle, one of
      those quiet-mannered, modern young medical men who bear on their persons
      the very stamp of efficiency, of the dignity of a scientific profession.
      His greeting implied that he knew all about me, his presence seemed to
      increase the agitation I tried not to betray, and must have betrayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I do anything for you, Mr. Paret?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to inquire about Mr. Krebs, who was brought here last night,
      I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was aware for an instant of his penetrating, professional glance, the
      only indication of the surprise he must have felt that Hermann Krebs, of
      all men, should be the object of my solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, we sent him home this morning. Nineteen twenty six Fowler Street. He
      wanted to go, and there was no use in his staying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will recover?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician shook his head, gazing at me through his glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may live a month, Mr. Paret, he may die to-morrow. He ought never to
      have gone into this campaign, he knew he had this trouble. Hepburn warned
      him three months ago, and there's no man who knows more about the heart
      than Hepburn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there's no hope?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely none. It's a great pity.&rdquo; He added, after a moment, &ldquo;Mr. Krebs
      was a remarkable man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen twenty-six Fowler Street?&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I held out my hand mechanically, and he pressed it, and went with me to
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nineteen twenty-six Fowler Street,&rdquo; he repeated...
    </p>
    <p>
      The mean and sordid aspect of Fowler Street emphasized and seemed to
      typify my despair, the pungent coal smoke stifled my lungs even as it
      stifled my spirit. Ugly factories, which were little more than sweatshops,
      wore an empty, menacing, &ldquo;Sunday&rdquo; look, and the faint November sunlight
      glistened on dirty pavements where children were making a semblance of
      play. Monotonous rows of red houses succeeded one another, some pushed
      forward, others thrust back behind little plots of stamped earth. Into one
      of these I turned. It seemed a little cleaner, better kept, less sordid
      than the others. I pulled the bell, and presently the door was opened by a
      woman whose arms were bare to the elbow. She wore a blue-checked calico
      apron that came to her throat, but the apron was clean, and her firm
      though furrowed face gave evidences of recent housewifely exertions. Her
      eyes had the strange look of the cheerfulness that is intimately
      acquainted with sorrow. She did not seem surprised at seeing me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to ask about Mr. Krebs,&rdquo; I told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there's been so many here this morning already. It's
      wonderful how people love him, all kinds of people. No, sir, he don't seem
      to be in any pain. Two gentlemen are up there now in his room, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wiped her arms, which still bore traces of soap-suds, and then, with a
      gesture natural and unashamed, lifted the corner of her apron to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I could see him&mdash;for a moment?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I've known
      him for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I guess so. The doctor said he could see
      some, and he wants to see his friends. That's not strange&mdash;he always
      did. I'll ask. Will you tell me your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took out a card. She held it without glancing at it, and invited me in.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited, unnerved and feverish, pulsing, in the dark and narrow hall
      beside the flimsy rack where several coats and hats were hung. Once before
      I had visited Krebs in that lodging-house in Cambridge long ago with
      something of the same feelings. But now they were greatly intensified. Now
      he was dying....
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman was descending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says he wants to see you, sir,&rdquo; she said rather breathlessly, and I
      followed her. In the semi-darkness of the stairs I passed the three men
      who had been with Krebs, and when I reached the open door of his room he
      was alone. I hesitated just a second, swept by the heat wave that follows
      sudden shyness, embarrassment, a sense of folly it is too late to avert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Krebs was propped up with pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is good of you,&rdquo; he said, and reached out his hand across the
      spread. I took it, and sat down beside the shiny oak bedstead, in a chair
      covered with tobacco-colored plush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You feel better?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I feel all right,&rdquo; he answered, with a smile. &ldquo;It's queer, but I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My eye fell upon the long line of sectional book-cases that lined one side
      of the room. &ldquo;Why, you've got quite a library here,&rdquo; I observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've managed to get together some good books. But there is so much
      to read nowadays, so much that is really good and new, a man has the
      hopeless feeling he can never catch up with it all. A thousand writers and
      students are making contributions today where fifty years ago there was
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been following your speeches, after a fashion,&mdash;I wish I might
      have been able to read more of them. Your argument interested me. It's
      new, unlike the ordinary propaganda of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of agitators,&rdquo; he supplied, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of agitators,&rdquo; I agreed, and tried to return his smile. &ldquo;An agitator who
      appears to suggest the foundations of a constructive programme and who
      isn't afraid to criticise the man with a vote as well as the capitalist is
      an unusual phenomenon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, when we realize that we've only got a little time left in which to
      tell what we think to be the truth, it doesn't require a great deal of
      courage, Paret. I didn't begin to see this thing until a little while ago.
      I was only a crude, hot-headed revolutionist. God knows I'm crude enough
      still. But I began to have a glimmering of what all these new fellows in
      the universities are driving at.&rdquo; He waved his hand towards the
      book-cases. &ldquo;Driving at collectively, I mean. And there are attempts,
      worthy attempts, to coordinate and synthesize the sciences. What I have
      been saying is not strictly original. I took it on the stump, that's all.
      I didn't expect it to have much effect in this campaign, but it was an
      opportunity to sow a few seeds, to start a sense of personal
      dissatisfaction in the minds of a few voters. What is it Browning says?
      It's in Bishop Blougram, I believe. 'When the fight begins within himself,
      a man's worth something.' It's an intellectual fight, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words were spoken quietly, but I realized suddenly that the mysterious
      force which had drawn me to him now, against my will, was an intellectual
      rather than apparently sentimental one, an intellectual force seeming to
      comprise within it all other human attractions. And yet I felt a sudden
      contrition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Krebs,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I didn't come here to bother you about these
      matters, to tire you. I mustn't stay. I'll call in again to see how you
      are&mdash;from time to time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're not tiring me,&rdquo; he protested, stretching forth a thin,
      detaining hand. &ldquo;I don't want to rot, I want to live and think as long as
      I can. To tell you the truth, Paret, I've been wishing to talk to you&mdash;I'm
      glad you came in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been wishing to talk to me?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I didn't expect you'd come in. I hope you won't mind my saying
      so, under the circumstances, but I've always rather liked you, admired
      you, even back in the Cambridge days. After that I used to blame you for
      going out and taking what you wanted, and I had to live a good many years
      before I began to see that it's better for a man to take what he wants
      than to take nothing at all. I took what I wanted, every man worth his
      salt does. There's your great banker friend in New York whom I used to
      think was the arch-fiend. He took what he wanted, and he took a good deal,
      but it happened to be good for him. And by piling up his corporations,
      Ossa on Pelion, he is paving the way for a logical economic evolution. How
      can a man in our time find out what he does want unless he takes something
      and gives it a trial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until he begins to feel that it disagrees with him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But then,&rdquo;
       I added involuntarily, &ldquo;then it may be too late to try something else, and
      he may not know what to try.&rdquo; This remark of mine might have surprised me
      had it not been for the feeling&mdash;now grown definite&mdash;that Krebs
      had something to give me, something to pass on to me, of all men. Indeed,
      he had hinted as much, when he acknowledged a wish to talk to me. &ldquo;What
      seems so strange,&rdquo; I said, as I looked at him lying back on his pillows,
      &ldquo;is your faith that we shall be able to bring order out of all this chaos&mdash;your
      belief in Democracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Democracy's an adventure,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the great adventure of mankind. I
      think the trouble in many minds lies in the fact that they persist in
      regarding it as something to be made safe. All that can be done is to try
      to make it as safe as possible. But no adventure is safe&mdash;life itself
      is an adventure, and neither is that safe. It's a hazard, as you and I
      have found out. The moment we try to make life safe we lose all there is
      in it worth while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I thought a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's so,&rdquo; I agreed. On the table beside the bed in company with
      two or three other volumes, lay a Bible. He seemed to notice that my eye
      fell upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the story of the Prodigal Son?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Well, that's
      the parable of democracy, of self-government in the individual and in
      society. In order to arrive at salvation, Paret, most of us have to take
      our journey into a far country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A far country!&rdquo; I exclaimed. The words struck a reminiscent chord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have to leave what seem the safe things, we have to wander and suffer
      in order to realize that the only true safety lies in development. We have
      first to cast off the leading strings of authority. It's a delusion that
      we can insure ourselves by remaining within its walls&mdash;we have to
      risk our lives and our souls. It is discouraging when we look around us
      to-day, and in a way the pessimists are right when they say we don't see
      democracy. We see only what may be called the first stage of it; for
      democracy is still in a far country eating the husks of individualism,
      materialism. What we see is not true freedom, but freedom run to riot, men
      struggling for themselves, spending on themselves the fruits of their
      inheritance; we see a government intent on one object alone&mdash;exploitation
      of this inheritance in order to achieve what it calls prosperity. And God
      is far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;we shall turn?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall turn or perish. I believe that we shall turn.&rdquo; He fixed his eyes
      on my face. &ldquo;What is it,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that brought you here to me, to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The motive, Paret&mdash;the motive that sends us all wandering into is
      divine, is inherited from God himself. And the same motive, after our eyes
      shall have been opened, after we shall have seen and known the tragedy and
      misery of life, after we shall have made the mistakes and committed the
      sins and experienced the emptiness&mdash;the same motive will lead us back
      again. That, too, is an adventure, the greatest adventure of all. Because,
      when we go back we shall not find the same God&mdash;or rather we shall
      recognize him in ourselves. Autonomy is godliness, knowledge is godliness.
      We went away cringing, superstitious, we saw everywhere omens and
      evidences of his wrath in the earth and sea and sky, we burned candles and
      sacrificed animals in the vain hope of averting scourges and other
      calamities. But when we come back it will be with a knowledge of his ways,
      gained at a price,&mdash;the price he, too, must have paid&mdash;and we
      shall be able to stand up and look him in the face, and all our childish
      superstitions and optimisms shall have been burned away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some faith indeed had given him strength to renounce those things in life
      I had held dear, driven him on to fight until his exhausted body failed
      him, and even now that he was physically helpless sustained him. I did not
      ask myself, then, the nature of this faith. In its presence it could no
      more be questioned than the light. It was light; I felt bathed in it. Now
      it was soft, suffused: but I remembered how the night before in the hall,
      just before he had fallen, it had flashed forth in a smile and illumined
      my soul with an ecstasy that yet was anguish....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall get back,&rdquo; I said at length. My remark was not a question&mdash;it
      had escaped from me almost unawares.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The joy is in the journey,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The secret is in the search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for me?&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've all been lost, Paret. It would seem as though we have to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you are&mdash;saved,&rdquo; I said, hesitating over the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that I am content, even happy,&rdquo; he asserted, &ldquo;in spite of my
      wish to live. If there is any secret, it lies, I think, in the struggle
      for an open mind, in the keeping alive of a desire to know more and more.
      That desire, strangely enough, hasn't lost its strength. We don't know
      whether there is a future life, but if there is, I think it must be a
      continuation of this.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;I told you I was glad you came in&mdash;I've
      been thinking of you, and I saw you in the hall last night. You ask what
      there is for you&mdash;I'll tell you,&mdash;the new generation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The new generation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the task of every man and woman who wakes up. I've come to see how
      little can be done for the great majority of those who have reached our
      age. It's hard&mdash;but it's true. Superstition, sentiment, the habit of
      wrong thinking or of not thinking at all have struck in too deep, the
      habit of unreasoning acceptance of authority is too paralyzing. Some may
      be stung back into life, spurred on to find out what the world really is,
      but not many. The hope lies in those who are coming after us&mdash;we must
      do for them what wasn't done for us. We really didn't have much of a
      chance, Paret. What did our instructors at Harvard know about the age that
      was dawning? what did anybody know? You can educate yourself&mdash;or
      rather reeducate yourself. All this&rdquo;&mdash;and he waved his hand towards
      his bookshelves&mdash;&ldquo;all this has sprung up since you and I were at
      Cambridge; if we don't try to become familiar with it, if we fail to grasp
      the point of view from which it's written, there's little hope for us. Go
      away from all this and get straightened out, make yourself acquainted with
      the modern trend in literature and criticism, with modern history, find
      out what's being done in the field of education, read the modern sciences,
      especially biology, and psychology and sociology, and try to get a glimpse
      of the fundamental human needs underlying such phenomena as the labour and
      woman's movements. God knows I've just begun to get my glimpse, and I've
      floundered around ever since I left college.... I don't mean to say we can
      ever see the whole, but we can get a clew, an idea, and pass it on to our
      children. You have children, haven't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said....
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing&mdash;he seemed to be looking out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the scientific point of view in your opinion hasn't done away with
      religion?&rdquo; I asked presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The scientific point of view is the religious point of view,&rdquo; he said
      earnestly, &ldquo;because it's the only self-respecting point of view. I can't
      believe that God intended to make a creature who would not ultimately
      weigh his beliefs with his reason instead of accepting them blindly.
      That's immoral, if you like&mdash;especially in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are there, then, no 'over-beliefs'?&rdquo; I said, remembering the
      expression in something I had read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems to me a relic of the method of ancient science, which was
      upside down,&mdash;a mere confusion with faith. Faith and belief are two
      different things; faith is the emotion, the steam, if you like, that
      drives us on in our search for truth. Theories, at a stretch, might be
      identified with 'over-beliefs' but when it comes to confusing our theories
      with facts, instead of recognizing them as theories, when it comes to
      living by 'over-beliefs' that have no basis in reason and observed facts,&mdash;that
      is fatal. It's just the trouble with so much of our electorate to-day&mdash;unreasoning
      acceptance without thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you admit of no other faculty than reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess that I don't. A great many insights that we seem to get from
      what we call intuition I think are due to the reason, which is
      unconsciously at work. If there were another faculty that equalled or
      transcended reason, it seems to me it would be a very dangerous thing for
      the world's progress. We'd come to rely on it rather than on ourselves the
      trouble with the world is that it has been relying on it. Reason is the
      mind&mdash;it leaps to the stars without realizing always how it gets
      there. It is through reason we get the self-reliance that redeems us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;You rely on something else besides reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is true,&rdquo; he explained gently, &ldquo;but that Thing
      Other-than-Ourselves we feel stirring in us is power, and that power, or
      the Source of it, seems to have given us our reason for guidance&mdash;if
      it were not so we shouldn't have a semblance of freedom. For there is
      neither virtue nor development in finding the path if we are guided. We do
      rely on that power for movement&mdash;and in the moments when it is
      withdrawn we are helpless. Both the power and the reason are God's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Church,&rdquo; I was moved by some untraced thought to ask, &ldquo;you
      believe there is a future for the Church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A church of all those who disseminate truth, foster open-mindedness,
      serve humanity and radiate faith,&rdquo; he replied&mdash;but as though he were
      speaking to himself, not to me....
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later there was a knock at the door, and the woman of the
      house entered to say that Dr. Hepburn had arrived. I rose and shook
      Krebs's hand: sheer inability to express my emotion drove me to
      commonplaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll come in soon again, if I may,&rdquo; I told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, Paret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it's done me good to talk to you&mdash;more good
      than you imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was unable to answer him, but I glanced back from the doorway to see him
      smiling after me. On my way down the stairs I bumped into the doctor as he
      ascended. The dingy brown parlour was filled with men, standing in groups
      and talking in subdued voices. I hurried into the street, and on the
      sidewalk stopped face to face with Perry Blackwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to inquire for Krebs,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I've seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you've been talking to him?&rdquo; Perry demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded. He stared at me for a moment with an astonishment to which I was
      wholly indifferent. He did not seem to know just how to act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was decent of you, Hugh, I must say. How does he seem?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all like&mdash;like what you'd expect, in his manner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Perry agitatedly, &ldquo;no, he wouldn't. My God, we've lost a big
      man in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we have,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at me again, gave me his hand awkwardly, and went into the
      house. It was not until I had walked the length of the block that I began
      to realize what a shock my presence there must have been to him, with his
      head full of the contrast between this visit and my former attitude. Could
      it be that it was only the night before I had made a speech against him
      and his associates? It is interesting that my mind rejected all sense of
      anomaly and inconsistency. Krebs possessed me; I must have been in reality
      extremely agitated, but this sense of being possessed seemed a quiet one.
      An amazing thing had happened&mdash;and yet I was not amazed. The Krebs I
      had seen was the man I had known for many years, the man I had ridiculed,
      despised and oppressed, but it seemed to me then that he had been my
      friend and intimate all my life: more than that, I had an odd feeling he
      had always been a part of me, and that now had begun to take place a
      merging of personality. Nor could I feel that he was a dying man. He would
      live on....
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not as yet sort and appraise, reduce to order the possessions he
      had wished to turn over to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was noon, and people were walking past me in the watery, diluted
      sunlight, men in black coats and top hats and women in bizarre,
      complicated costumes bright with colour. I had reached the more
      respectable portion of the city, where the churches were emptying. These
      very people, whom not long ago I would have acknowledged as my own kind,
      now seemed mildly animated automatons, wax figures. The day was like
      hundreds of Sundays I had known, the city familiar, yet passing strange. I
      walked like a ghost through it....

    <h2>
      XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Accompanied by young Dr. Strafford, I went to California. My physical
      illness had been brief. Dr. Brooke had taken matters in his own hands and
      ordered an absolute rest, after dwelling at some length on the vicious
      pace set by modern business and the lack of consideration and knowledge
      shown by men of affairs for their bodies. There was a limit to the wrack
      and strain which the human organism could stand. He must of course have
      suspected the presence of disturbing and disintegrating factors, but he
      confined himself to telling me that only an exceptional constitution had
      saved me from a serious illness; he must in a way have comprehended why I
      did not wish to go abroad, and have my family join me on the Riviera, as
      Tom Peters proposed. California had been my choice, and Dr. Brooke
      recommended the climate of Santa Barbara.

      High up on the Montecito hills I found a villa beside the gateway of one
      of the deep canons that furrow the mountain side, and day after day I lay
      in a chair on the sunny terrace, with a continually recurring amazement at
      the brilliancy of my surroundings. In the early morning I looked down on a
      feathery mist hiding the world, a mist presently to be shot with silver
      and sapphire-blue, dissolved by slow enchantment until there lay revealed
      the plain and the shimmering ocean with its distant islands trembling in
      the haze. At sunset my eyes sought the mountains, mountains unreal, like
      glorified scenery of grand opera, with violet shadows in the wooded canon
      clefts, and crags of pink tourmaline and ruby against the skies. All day
      long in the tempered heat flowers blazed around me, insects hummed,
      lizards darted in and out of the terrace wall, birds flashed among the
      checkered shadows of the live oaks. That grove of gnarled oaks summoned up
      before me visions of some classic villa poised above Grecian seas, shining
      amidst dark foliage, the refuge of forgotten kings. Below me, on the
      slope, the spaced orange trees were heavy with golden fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, as I grew stronger, I was driven down and allowed to walk
      on the wide beach that stretched in front of the gay houses facing the
      sea. Cormorants dived under the long rollers that came crashing in from
      the Pacific; gulls wheeled and screamed in the soft wind; alert little
      birds darted here and there with incredible swiftness, leaving tiny
      footprints across the ribs and furrows of the wet sand. Far to the
      southward a dark barrier of mountains rose out of the sea. Sometimes I sat
      with my back against the dunes watching the drag of the outgoing water
      rolling the pebbles after it, making a gleaming floor for the light to
      dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first I could not bear to recall the events that had preceded and
      followed my visit to Krebs that Sunday morning. My illness had begun that
      night; on the Monday Tom Peters had come to the Club and insisted upon my
      being taken to his house.... When I had recovered sufficiently there had
      been rather a pathetic renewal of our friendship. Perry came to see me.
      Their attitude was one of apprehension not unmixed with wonder; and though
      they, knew of the existence of a mental crisis, suspected, in all
      probability, some of the causes of it, they refrained carefully from all
      comments, contenting themselves with telling me when I was well enough
      that Krebs had died quite suddenly that Sunday afternoon; that his death&mdash;occurring
      at such a crucial moment&mdash;had been sufficient to turn the tide of the
      election and make Edgar Greenhalge mayor. Thousands who had failed to
      understand Hermann Krebs, but whom he had nevertheless stirred and
      troubled, suddenly awoke to the fact that he had had elements of
      greatness....
    </p>
    <p>
      My feelings in those first days at Santa Barbara may be likened, indeed,
      to those of a man who has passed through a terrible accident that has
      deprived him of sight or hearing, and which he wishes to forget. What I
      was most conscious of then was an aching sense of loss&mdash;an ache that
      by degrees became a throbbing pain as life flowed back into me,
      re-inflaming once more my being with protest and passion, arousing me to
      revolt against the fate that had overtaken me. I even began at moments to
      feel a fierce desire to go back and take up again the fight from which I
      had been so strangely removed&mdash;removed by the agency of things still
      obscure. I might get Nancy yet, beat down her resistance, overcome her, if
      only I could be near her and see her. But even in the midst of these
      surges of passion I was conscious of the birth of a new force I did not
      understand, and which I resented, that had arisen to give battle to my
      passions and desires. This struggle was not mentally reflected as a debate
      between right and wrong, as to whether I should or should not be justified
      in taking Nancy if I could get her: it seemed as though some new and small
      yet dogged intruder had forced an entrance into me, an insignificant pigmy
      who did not hesitate to bar the pathway of the reviving giant of my
      desires. These contests sapped my strength. It seemed as though in my
      isolation I loved Nancy, I missed her more than ever, and the flavour she
      gave to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hermann Krebs began to press himself on me. I use the word as
      expressive of those early resentful feelings,&mdash;I rather pictured him
      then as the personification of an hostile element in the universe that had
      brought about my miseries and accomplished my downfall; I attributed the
      disagreeable thwarting of my impulses to his agency; I did not wish to
      think of him, for he stood somehow for a vague future I feared to
      contemplate. Yet the illusion of his presence, once begun, continued to
      grow upon me, and I find myself utterly unable to describe that struggle
      in which he seemed to be fighting as against myself for my confidence;
      that process whereby he gradually grew as real to me as though he still
      lived&mdash;until I could almost hear his voice and see his smile. At
      moments I resisted wildly, as though my survival depended on it; at other
      moments he seemed to bring me peace. One day I recalled as vividly as
      though it were taking place again that last time I had been with him; I
      seemed once more to be listening to the calm yet earnest talk ranging over
      so many topics, politics and government, economics and science and
      religion. I did not yet grasp the synthesis he had made of them all, but I
      saw them now all focussed in him elements he had drawn from human lives
      and human experiences. I think it was then I first felt the quickenings of
      a new life to be born in travail and pain.... Wearied, yet exalted, I sank
      down on a stone bench and gazed out at the little island of Santa Cruz
      afloat on the shimmering sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have mentioned my inability to depict the terrible struggle that went on
      in my soul. It seems strange that Nietzsche&mdash;that most ruthless of
      philosophers to the romantic mind!&mdash;should express it for me. &ldquo;The
      genius of the heart, from contact with which every man goes away richer,
      not 'blessed' and overcome,... but richer himself, fresher to himself than
      before, opened up, breathed upon and sounded by a thawing wind; more
      uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more bruised; but full of hopes which
      as yet lack names, full of a new will and striving, full of a new
      unwillingness and counterstriving.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was my experience with Hermann Krebs. How keenly I remember that new
      unwillingness and counter-striving! In spite of the years it has not
      wholly died down, even to-day....
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost coincident with these quickenings of which I have spoken was the
      consciousness of a hunger stronger than the craving for bread and meat,
      and I began to meditate on my ignorance, on the utter inadequacy and
      insufficiency of my early education, on my neglect of the new learning
      during the years that had passed since I left Harvard. And I remembered
      Krebs's words&mdash;that we must &ldquo;reeducate ourselves.&rdquo; What did I know? A
      system of law, inherited from another social order, that was utterly
      unable to cope with the complexities and miseries and injustices of a
      modern industrial world. I had spent my days in mastering an inadequate
      and archaic code&mdash;why? in order that I might learn how to evade it?
      This in itself condemned it. What did I know of life? of the shining
      universe that surrounded me? What did I know of the insect and the flower,
      of the laws that moved the planets and made incandescent the suns? of the
      human body, of the human soul and its instincts? Was this knowledge
      acquired at such cost of labour and life and love by my fellow-men of so
      little worth to me that I could ignore it? declare that it had no
      significance for me? no bearing on my life and conduct? If I were to rise
      and go forward&mdash;and I now felt something like a continued impulse, in
      spite of relaxations and revolts&mdash;I must master this knowledge, it
      must be my guide, form the basis of my creed. I&mdash;who never had had a
      creed, never felt the need of one! For lack of one I had been rudely
      jolted out of the frail shell I had thought so secure, and stood, as it
      were, naked and shivering to the storms, staring at a world that was no
      function of me, after all. My problem, indeed, was how to become a
      function of it....
    </p>
    <p>
      I resolved upon a course of reading, but it was a question what books to
      get. Krebs could have told me, if he had lived. I even thought once of
      writing Perry Blackwood to ask him to make a list of the volumes in
      Krebs's little library; but I was ashamed to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Strafford still remained with me. Not many years out of the medical
      school, he had inspired me with a liking for him and a respect for his
      profession, and when he informed me one day that he could no longer
      conscientiously accept the sum I was paying him, I begged him to stay on.
      He was a big and wholesome young man, companionable, yet quiet and
      unobtrusive, watchful without appearing to be so, with the innate as well
      as the cultivated knowledge of psychology characteristic of the best
      modern physicians. When I grew better I came to feel that he had given his
      whole mind to the study of my case, though he never betrayed it in his
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strafford,&rdquo; I said to him one morning with such an air of unconcern as I
      could muster, &ldquo;I've an idea I'd like to read a little science. Could you
      recommend a work on biology?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I chose biology because I thought he would know something about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Popular biology, Mr. Paret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not too popular,&rdquo; I smiled. &ldquo;I think it would do me good to use my
      mind, to chew on something. Besides, you can help me over the tough
      places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned that afternoon with two books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been rather fortunate in getting these,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One is fairly
      elementary. They had it at the library. And the other&mdash;&rdquo; he paused
      delicately, &ldquo;I didn't know whether you might be interested in the latest
      speculations on the subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speculations?&rdquo; I repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the philosophy of it.&rdquo; He almost achieved a blush under his tan. He
      held out the second book on the philosophy of the organism. &ldquo;It's the work
      of a German scientist who stands rather high. I read it last winter, and
      it interested me. I got it from a clergyman I know who is spending the
      winter in Santa Barbara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A clergyman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Strafford laughed. &ldquo;An 'advanced' clergyman,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Oh, a lot of
      them are reading science now. I think it's pretty decent of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at Strafford, who towered six feet three, and it suddenly struck
      me that he might be one of the forerunners of a type our universities were
      about to turn out. I wondered what he believed. Of one thing I was sure,
      that he was not in the medical profession to make money. That was a faith
      in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began with the elementary work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better borrow a Century Dictionary,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's easy,&rdquo; he said, and actually achieved it, with the clergyman's
      aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The absorption in which I fought my way through those books may prove
      interesting to future generations, who, at Sunday-school age, when the
      fable of Adam and Eve was painfully being drummed into me (without any
      mention of its application), will be learning to think straight, acquiring
      easily in early youth what I failed to learn until after forty. And think
      of all the trouble and tragedy that will have been averted. It is true
      that I had read some biology at Cambridge, which I had promptly forgotten;
      it had not been especially emphasized by my instructors as related to life&mdash;certainly
      not as related to religion: such incidents as that of Adam and Eve
      occupied the religious field exclusively. I had been compelled to commit
      to memory, temporarily, the matter in those books; but what I now began to
      perceive was that the matter was secondary compared to the view point of
      science&mdash;and this had been utterly neglected. As I read, I
      experienced all the excitement of an old-fashioned romance, but of a
      romance of such significance as to touch the very springs of existence;
      and above all I was impressed with the integrity of the scientific method&mdash;an
      integrity commensurate with the dignity of man&mdash;that scorned to
      quibble to make out a case, to affirm something that could not be proved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little by little I became familiar with the principles of embryonic
      evolution, ontogeny, and of biological evolution, phylogeny; realized, for
      the first time, my own history and that of the ancestors from whom I had
      developed and descended. I, this marvellously complicated being, torn by
      desires and despairs, was the result of the union of two microscopic
      cells. &ldquo;All living things come from the egg,&rdquo; such had been Harvey's
      dictum. The result was like the tonic of a cold douche. I began to feel
      cleansed and purified, as though something sticky-sweet which all my life
      had clung to me had been washed away. Yet a question arose, an insistent
      question that forever presses itself on the mind of man; how could these
      apparently chemical and mechanical processes, which the author of the book
      contented himself with recording, account for me? The spermia darts for
      the egg, and pierces it; personal history begins. But what mysterious
      shaping force is it that repeats in the individual the history of the
      race, supervises the orderly division of the cells, by degrees directs the
      symmetry, sets aside the skeleton and digestive tract and supervises the
      structure?
    </p>
    <p>
      I took up the second book, that on the philosophy of the organism, to read
      in its preface that a much-to-be-honoured British nobleman had established
      a foundation of lectures in a Scotch University for forwarding the study
      of a Natural Theology. The term possessed me. Unlike the old theology
      woven of myths and a fanciful philosophy of the decadent period of Greece,
      natural theology was founded on science itself, and scientists were among
      those who sought to develop it. Here was a synthesis that made a powerful
      appeal, one of the many signs and portents of a new era of which I was
      dimly becoming cognizant; and now that I looked for signs, I found them
      everywhere, in my young Doctor, in Krebs, in references in the texts;
      indications of a new order beginning to make itself felt in a muddled,
      chaotic human world, which might&mdash;which must have a parallel with the
      order that revealed itself in the egg! Might not both, physical and
      social, be due to the influence of the same invisible, experimenting,
      creating Hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      My thoughts lingered lovingly on this theology so well named &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; on
      its conscientiousness, its refusal to affirm what it did not prove, on its
      lack of dogmatic dictums and infallible revelations; yet it gave me the
      vision of a new sanction whereby man might order his life, a sanction from
      which was eliminated fear and superstition and romantic hope, a sanction
      whose doctrines&mdash;unlike those of the sentimental theology&mdash;did
      not fly in the face of human instincts and needs. Nor was it a theology
      devoid of inspiration and poetry, though poetry might be called its
      complement. With all that was beautiful and true in the myths dear to
      mankind it did not conflict, annulling only the vicious dogmatism of
      literal interpretation. In this connection I remembered something that
      Krebs had said&mdash;in our talk about poetry and art,&mdash;that these
      were emotion, religion expressed by the tools reason had evolved. Music,
      he had declared, came nearest to the cry of the human soul....
    </p>
    <p>
      That theology cleared for faith an open road, made of faith a reasonable
      thing, yet did not rob it of a sense of high adventure; cleansed it of the
      taints of thrift and selfish concern. In this reaffirmation of vitalism
      there might be a future, yes, an individual future, yet it was far from
      the smug conception of salvation. Here was a faith conferred by the
      freedom of truth; a faith that lost and regained itself in life; it was
      dynamic in its operation; for, as Lessing said, the searching after truth,
      and not its possession, gives happiness to man. In the words of an
      American scientist, taken from his book on Heredity, &ldquo;The evolutionary
      idea has forced man to consider the probable future of his own race on
      earth and to take measures to control that future, a matter he had
      previously left largely to fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here indeed was another sign of the times, to find in a strictly
      scientific work a sentence truly religious! As I continued to read these
      works, I found them suffused with religion, religion of a kind and quality
      I had not imagined. The birthright of the spirit of man was freedom,
      freedom to experiment, to determine, to create&mdash;to create himself, to
      create society in the image of God! Spiritual creation the function of
      cooperative man through the coming ages, the task that was to make him
      divine. Here indeed was the germ of a new sanction, of a new motive, of a
      new religion that strangely harmonized with the concepts of the old&mdash;once
      the dynamic power of these was revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had been thinking of my family&mdash;of my family in terms of Matthew&mdash;and
      yet with a growing yearning that embraced them all. I had not informed
      Maude of my illness, and I had managed to warn Tom Peters not to do so. I
      had simply written her that after the campaign I had gone for a rest to
      California; yet in her letters to me, after this information had reached
      her, I detected a restrained anxiety and affection that troubled me.
      Sequences of words curiously convey meanings and implications that
      transcend their literal sense, true thoughts and feelings are difficult to
      disguise even in written speech. Could it be possible after all that had
      happened that Maude still loved me? I continually put the thought away
      from me, but continually it returned to haunt me. Suppose Maude could not
      help loving me, in spite of my weaknesses and faults, even as I loved
      Nancy in spite of hers? Love is no logical thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Matthew I wanted, Matthew of whom I thought, and trivial,
      long-forgotten incidents of the past kept recurring to me constantly. I
      still received his weekly letters; but he did not ask why, since I had
      taken a vacation, I had not come over to them. He represented the medium,
      the link between Maude and me that no estrangement, no separation could
      break.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this new vision of mine was for him, for the coming generation, the
      soil in which it must be sown, the Americans of the future. And who so
      well as Matthew, sensitive yet brave, would respond to it? I wished not
      only to give him what I had begun to grasp, to study with him, to be his
      companion and friend, but to spare him, if possible, some of my own
      mistakes and sufferings and punishments. But could I go back? Happy
      coincidences of desires and convictions had been so characteristic of that
      other self I had been struggling to cast off: I had so easily been
      persuaded, when I had had a chance of getting Nancy, that it was the right
      thing to do! And now, in my loneliness, was I not growing just as eager to
      be convinced that it was my duty to go back to the family which in the
      hour of self-sufficiency I had cast off? I had believed in divorce then&mdash;why
      not now? Well, I still believed in it. I had thought of a union with Nancy
      as something that would bring about the &ldquo;self-realization that springs
      from the gratification of a great passion,&rdquo;&mdash;an appealing phrase I
      had read somewhere. But, it was at least a favourable symptom that I was
      willing now to confess that the &ldquo;self-realization&rdquo; had been a secondary
      and sentimental consideration, a rosy, self-created halo to give a moral
      and religious sanction to my desire. Was I not trying to do that very
      thing now? It tortured me to think so; I strove to achieve a detached
      consideration of the problem,&mdash;to arrive at length at a thought that
      seemed illuminating: that the it &ldquo;wrongness&rdquo; or &ldquo;rightness,&rdquo; utility and
      happiness of all such unions depend upon whether or not they become a part
      of the woof and warp of the social fabric; in other words, whether the
      gratification of any particular love by divorce and remarriage does or
      does not tend to destroy a portion of that fabric. Nancy certainly would
      have been justified in divorce. It did not seem in the retrospect that I
      would have been: surely not if, after I had married Nancy, I had developed
      this view of life that seemed to me to be the true view. I should have
      been powerless to act upon it. But the chances were I should not have
      developed it, since it would seem that any salvation for me at least must
      come precisely through suffering, through not getting what I wanted. Was
      this equivocating?
    </p>
    <p>
      My mistake had been in marrying Maude instead of Nancy&mdash;a mistake
      largely due to my saturation with a false idea of life. Would not the
      attempt to cut loose from the consequences of that mistake in my
      individual case have been futile? But there was a remedy for it&mdash;the
      remedy Krebs had suggested: I might still prevent my children from making
      such a mistake, I might help to create in them what I might have been, and
      thus find a solution for myself. My errors would then assume a value.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the question tortured me: would Maude wish it? Would it be fair to her
      if she did not? By my long neglect I had forfeited the right to go. And
      would she agree with my point of view if she did permit me to stay? I had
      less concern on this score, a feeling that that development of hers, which
      once had irritated me, was in the same direction as my own....
    </p>
    <p>
      I have still strangely to record moments when, in spite of the aspirations
      I had achieved, of the redeeming vision I had gained, at the thought of
      returning to her I revolted. At such times recollections came into my mind
      of those characteristics in her that had seemed most responsible for my
      alienation.... That demon I had fed so mightily still lived. By what right&mdash;he
      seemed to ask&mdash;had I nourished him all these years if now I meant to
      starve him? Thus sometimes he defied me, took on Protean guises,
      blustered, insinuated, cajoled, managed to make me believe that to starve
      him would be to starve myself, to sap all there was of power in me. Let me
      try and see if I could do it! Again he whispered, to what purpose had I
      gained my liberty, if now I renounced it? I could not live in fetters,
      even though the fetters should be self-imposed. I was lonely now, but I
      would get over that, and life lay before me still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fierce and tenacious, steel in the cruelty of his desires, fearful in the
      havoc he had wrought, could he be subdued? Foiled, he tore and rent me....
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning I rode up through the shady canon, fragrant with bay, to the
      open slopes stained smoky-blue by the wild lilac, where the twisted
      madrona grows. As I sat gazing down on tiny headlands jutting out into a
      vast ocean my paralyzing indecision came to an end. I turned my horse down
      the trail again. I had seen at last that life was bigger than I, bigger
      than Maude, bigger than our individual wishes and desires. I felt as
      though heavy shackles had been struck from me. As I neared the house I
      spied my young doctor in the garden path, his hands in his pockets
      watching a humming-bird poised over the poppies. He greeted me with a look
      that was not wholly surprise at my early return, that seemed to have in it
      something of gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strafford,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I've made up my mind to go to Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking for some time, Mr. Paret,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that a
      sea-voyage is just what you need to set you on your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started eastward the next morning, arriving in New York in time to catch
      one of the big liners sailing for Havre. On my way across the continent I
      decided to send a cable to Maude at Paris, since it were only fair to give
      her an opportunity to reflect upon the manner in which she would meet the
      situation. Save for an impatience which at moments I restrained with
      difficulty, the moods that succeeded one another as I journeyed did not
      differ greatly from those I had experienced in the past month. I was
      alternately exalted and depressed; I hoped and doubted and feared; my
      courage, my confidence rose and fell. And yet I was aware of the nascence
      within me of an element that gave me a stability I had hitherto lacked: I
      had made my decision, and I felt the stronger for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early in March. The annual rush of my countrymen and women for
      foreign shores had not as yet begun, the huge steamer was far from
      crowded. The faint throbbing of her engines as she glided out on the North
      River tide found its echo within me as I leaned on the heavy rail and
      watched the towers of the city receding in the mist; they became blurred
      and ghostlike, fantastic in the grey distance, sad, appealing with a
      strange beauty and power. Once the sight of them, sunlit, standing forth
      sharply against the high blue of American skies, had stirred in me that
      passion for wealth and power of which they were so marvellously and
      uniquely the embodiment. I recalled the bright day of my home-coming with
      Maude, when she too had felt that passion drawing me away from her, after
      the briefest of possessions.... Well, I had had it, the power. I had
      stormed and gained entrance to the citadel itself. I might have lived here
      in New York, secure, defiant of a veering public opinion that envied while
      it strove to sting. Why was I flinging it all away? Was this a sudden
      resolution of mine, forced by events, precipitated by a failure to achieve
      what of all things on earth I had most desired? or was it the inevitable
      result of the development of the Hugh Paret of earlier days, who was not
      meant for that kind of power?
    </p>
    <p>
      The vibration of the monster ship increased to a strong, electric
      pulsation, the water hummed along her sides, she felt the swell of the
      open sea. A fine rain began to fall that hid the land&mdash;yes, and the
      life I was leaving. I made my way across the glistening deck to the saloon
      where, my newspapers and periodicals neglected, I sat all the morning
      beside a window gazing out at the limited, vignetted zone of waters around
      the ship. We were headed for the Old World. The wind rose, the rain became
      pelting, mingling with the spume of the whitecaps racing madly past:
      within were warmth and luxury, electric lights, open fires, easy chairs,
      and men and women reading, conversing as unconcernedly as though the
      perils of the deep had ceased to be. In all this I found an impelling
      interest; the naive capacity in me for wonder, so long dormant, had been
      marvellously opened up once more. I no longer thought of myself as the
      important man of affairs; and when in the progress of the voyage I was
      accosted by two or three men I had met and by others who had heard of me
      it was only to feel amazement at the remoteness I now felt from a world
      whose realities were stocks and bonds, railroads and corporations and the
      detested new politics so inimical to the smooth conduct of &ldquo;business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It all sounded like a language I had forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until near the end of the passage that we ran out of the storm.
      A morning came when I went on deck to survey spaces of a blue and white
      sea swept by the white March sunlight; to discern at length against the
      horizon toward which we sped a cloud of the filmiest and most delicate
      texture and design. Suddenly I divined that the cloud was France! Little
      by little, as I watched, it took on substance. I made out headlands and
      cliffs, and then we were coasting beside them. That night I should be in
      Paris with Maude. My bag was packed, my steamer trunk closed. I strayed
      about the decks, in and out of the saloons, wondering at the indifference
      of other passengers who sat reading in steamer-chairs or wrote last
      letters to be posted at Havre. I was filled with impatience, anticipation,
      yes, with anxiety concerning the adventure that was now so imminent; with
      wavering doubts. Had I done the wisest thing after all? I had the familiar
      experience that often comes just before reunion after absence of recalling
      intimate and forgotten impressions of those whom I was about to see again
      the tones of their voices, little gestures....
    </p>
    <p>
      How would they receive me?
    </p>
    <p>
      The great ship had slowed down and was entering the harbour, carefully
      threading her way amongst smaller craft, the passengers lining the rails
      and gazing at the animated scene, at the quaint and cheerful French city
      bathed in sunlight.... I had reached the dock and was making my way
      through the hurrying and shifting groups toward the steamer train when I
      saw Maude. She was standing a little aside, scanning the faces that passed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember how she looked at me, expectantly, yet timidly, almost
      fearfully. I kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've come to meet me!&rdquo; I exclaimed stupidly. &ldquo;How are the children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're very well, Hugh. They wanted to come, too, but I thought it
      better not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her restraint struck me as extraordinary; and while I was thankful for the
      relief it brought to a situation which might have been awkward, I was
      conscious of resenting it a little. I was impressed and puzzled. As I
      walked along the platform beside her she seemed almost a stranger: I had
      difficulty in realizing that she was my wife, the mother of my children.
      Her eyes were clear, more serious than I recalled them, and her physical
      as well as her moral tone seemed to have improved. Her cheeks glowed with
      health, and she wore a becoming suit of dark blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have a good trip, Hugh?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; I said, forgetting the storm. We took our seats in an empty
      compartment. Was she glad to see me? She had come all the way from Paris
      to meet me! All the embarrassment seemed to be on my side. Was this
      composure a controlled one or had she indeed attained to the
      self-sufficiency her manner and presence implied? Such were the questions
      running through my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've really liked Paris?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Hugh, and it's been very good for us all. Of course the boys like
      America better, but they've learned many things they wouldn't have learned
      at home; they both speak French, and Biddy too. Even I have improved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure of it,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what else have you been doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, going to galleries. Matthew often goes with me. I think he quite
      appreciates the pictures. Sometimes I take him to the theatre, too, the
      Francais. Both boys ride in the Bois with a riding master. It's been
      rather a restricted life for them, but it won't have hurt them. It's good
      discipline. We have little excursions in an automobile on fine days to
      Versailles and other places of interest around Paris, and Matthew and I
      have learned a lot of history. I have a professor of literature from the
      Sorbonne come in three times a week to give me lessons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know you cared for literature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know it either.&rdquo; She smiled. &ldquo;Matthew loves it. Monsieur Despard
      declares he has quite a gift for language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maude had already begun Matthew's education!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see a few people?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few. And they have been very kind to us. The Buffons, whom I met at
      Etretat, and some of their friends, mostly educated French people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little railway carriage in which we sat rocked with speed as we flew
      through the French landscape. I caught glimpses of solid, Norman farm
      buildings, of towers and keeps and delicate steeples, and quaint towns; of
      bare poplars swaying before the March gusts, of green fields ablaze in the
      afternoon sun. I took it all in distractedly. Here was Maude beside me,
      but a Maude I had difficulty in recognizing, whom I did not understand:
      who talked of a life she had built up for herself and that seemed to
      satisfy her; one with which I had nothing to do. I could not tell how she
      regarded my re-intrusion. As she continued to talk, a feeling that was
      almost desperation grew upon me. I had things to say to her, things that
      every moment of this sort of intercourse was making more difficult. And I
      felt, if I did not say them now, that perhaps I never should: that now or
      never was the appropriate time, and to delay would be to drift into an
      impossible situation wherein the chance of an understanding would be
      remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. How little I had anticipated the courage it would take
      to do this thing! My blood was hammering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maude,&rdquo; I said abruptly, &ldquo;I suppose you're wondering why I came over
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat gazing at me, very still, but there came into her eyes a
      frightened look that almost unnerved me. She seemed to wish to speak, to
      be unable to. Passively, she let my hand rest on hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been thinking a great deal during the last few months,&rdquo; I went on
      unsteadily. &ldquo;And I've changed a good many of my ideas&mdash;that is, I've
      got new ones, about things I never thought of before. I want to say,
      first, that I do not put forth any claim to come back into your life. I
      know I have forfeited any claim. I've neglected you, and I've neglected
      the children. Our marriage has been on a false basis from the start, and
      I've been to blame for it. There is more to be said about the chances for
      a successful marriage in these days, but I'm not going to dwell on that
      now, or attempt to shoulder off my shortcomings on my bringing up, on the
      civilization in which we have lived. You've tried to do your share, and
      the failure hasn't been your fault. I want to tell you first of all that I
      recognize your right to live your life from now on, independently of me,
      if you so desire. You ought to have the children&mdash;&rdquo; I hesitated a
      moment. It was the hardest thing I had to say. &ldquo;I've never troubled myself
      about them, I've never taken on any responsibility in regard to their
      bringing up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hugh!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&mdash;I've got more to tell you, that you ought to know. I shouldn't
      be here to-day if Nancy Durrett had consented to&mdash;to get a divorce
      and marry me. We had agreed to that when this accident happened to Ham,
      and she went back to him. I have to tell you that I still love her&mdash;I
      can't say how much, or define my feelings toward her now. I've given up
      all idea of her. I don't think I'd marry her now, even if I had the
      chance, and you should decide to live away from me. I don't know. I'm not
      so sure of myself as I once was. The fact is, Maude, circumstances have
      been too much for me. I've been beaten. And I'm not at all certain that it
      wasn't a cowardly thing for me to come back to you at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt her hand trembling under mine, but I had not the courage to look at
      her. I heard her call my name again a little cry, the very poignancy of
      pity and distress. It almost unnerved me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that you loved her, Hugh,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was only&mdash;only a
      little while after you married me that I found it out. I guessed it&mdash;women
      do guess such things&mdash;long before you realized it yourself. You ought
      to have married her instead of me. You would have been happier with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too, have thought a great deal,&rdquo; she went on, after a moment. &ldquo;I began
      earlier than you, I had to.&rdquo; I looked up suddenly and saw her smiling at
      me, faintly, through her tears. &ldquo;But I've been thinking more, and learning
      more since I've been over here. I've come to see that that our failure
      hasn't been as much your fault as I once thought, as much as you yourself
      declare. You have done me a wrong, and you've done the children a wrong.
      Oh, it is frightful to think how little I knew when I married you, but
      even then I felt instinctively that you didn't love me as I deserved to be
      loved. And when we came back from Europe I knew that I couldn't satisfy
      you, I couldn't look upon life as you saw it, no matter how hard I tried.
      I did try, but it wasn't any use. You'll never know how much I've suffered
      all these years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been happier here, away from you, with the children; I've had a
      chance to be myself. It isn't that I'm&mdash;much. It isn't that I don't
      need guidance and counsel and&mdash;sympathy. I've missed those, but
      you've never given them to me, and I've been learning more and more to do
      without them. I don't know why marriage should suddenly have become such a
      mockery and failure in our time, but I know that it is, that ours hasn't
      been such an exception as I once thought. I've come to believe that
      divorce is often justified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is justified so far as you are concerned, Maude,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;It is
      not justified for me. I have forfeited, as I say, any rights over you. I
      have been the aggressor and transgressor from the start. You have been a
      good wife and a good mother, you have been faithful, I have had absolutely
      nothing to complain of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I think I might have tried harder,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At least I might
      have understood better. I was stupid. But everything went wrong. And I saw
      you growing away from me all the time, Hugh, growing away from the friends
      who were fond of you, as though you were fading in the distance. It wasn't
      wholly because&mdash;because of Nancy that I left you. That gave me an
      excuse&mdash;an excuse for myself. Long before that I realized my
      helplessness, I knew that whatever I might have done was past doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; I assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sat in silence for a while. The train was skirting an ancient town set
      on a hill, crowned with a castle and a Gothic church whose windows were
      afire in the setting sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maude,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I have not come to plead, to appeal to your pity as
      against your judgment and reason. I can say this much, that if I do not
      love you, as the word is generally understood, I have a new respect for
      you, and a new affection, and I think that these will grow. I have no
      doubt that there are some fortunate people who achieve the kind of mutual
      love for which it is human to yearn, whose passion is naturally transmuted
      into a feeling that may be even finer, but I am inclined to think, even in
      such a case, that some effort and unselfishness are necessary. At any
      rate, that has been denied to us, and we can never know it from our own
      experience. We can only hope that there is such a thing,&mdash;yes, and
      believe in it and work for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work for it, Hugh?&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For others&mdash;for our children. I have been thinking about the
      children a great deal in the last few months especially about Matthew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always loved him best,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;I don't know why it should be so. And in spite of it,
      I have neglected him, neglected them, failed to appreciate them all. I did
      not deserve them. I have reproached myself, I have suffered for it, not as
      much as I deserved. I came to realize that the children were a bond
      between us, that their existence meant something greater than either of
      us. But at the same time I recognized that I had lost my right over them,
      that it was you who had proved yourself worthy.... It was through the
      children that I came to think differently, to feel differently toward you.
      I have come to you to ask your forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; I said.... &ldquo;I have come to you, through them. I want to say again
      that I should not be here if I had obtained my desires. Yet there is more
      to it than that. I think I have reached a stage where I am able to say
      that I am glad I didn't obtain them. I see now that this coming to you was
      something I have wanted to do all along, but it was the cowardly thing to
      do, after I had failed, for it was not as though I had conquered the
      desires, the desires conquered me. At any rate, I couldn't come to you to
      encumber you, to be a drag upon you. I felt that I must have something to
      offer you. I've got a plan, Maude, for my life, for our lives. I don't
      know whether I can make a success of it, and you are entitled to decline
      to take the risk. I don't fool myself that it will be all plain sailing,
      that there won't be difficulties and discouragements. But I'll promise to
      try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked, in a low voice. &ldquo;I&mdash;I think I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have guessed it. I am willing to try to devote what is left
      of my life to you and to them. And I need your help. I acknowledge it. Let
      us try to make more possible for them the life we have missed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The life we have missed!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. My mistakes, my failures, have brought us to the edge of a
      precipice. We must prevent, if we can, those mistakes and failures for
      them. The remedy for unhappy marriages, for all mistaken, selfish and
      artificial relationships in life is a preventive one. My plan is that we
      try to educate ourselves together, take advantage of the accruing
      knowledge that is helping men and women to cope with the problems, to
      think straight. We can then teach our children to think straight, to avoid
      the pitfalls into which we have fallen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I paused. Maude did not reply. Her face was turned away from me, towards
      the red glow of the setting sun above the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been doing this all along, you have had the vision, the true
      vision, while I lacked it, Maude. I offer to help you. But if you think it
      is impossible for us to live together, if you believe my feeling toward
      you is not enough, if you don't think I can do what I propose, or if you
      have ceased to care for me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to me with a swift movement, her eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hugh, don't say any more. I can't stand it. How little you know, for
      all your thinking. I love you, I always have loved you. I grew to be
      ashamed of it, but I'm not any longer. I haven't any pride any more, and I
      never want to have it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're willing to take me as I am,&mdash;to try?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I'm willing to try.&rdquo; She smiled at me. &ldquo;And I have
      more faith than you, Hugh. I think we'll succeed.&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o'clock that night, when we came out through the gates of the big,
      noisy station, the children were awaiting us. They had changed, they had
      grown. Biddy kissed me shyly, and stood staring up at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll take you out to-morrow and show you how we can ride,&rdquo; said Moreton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew smiled. He stood very close to me, with his hand through my arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going to stay, father?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to stay, Matthew,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;until we all go back to
      America.&rdquo;....

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
