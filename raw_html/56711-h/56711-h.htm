<p class="drop-cap">
In endeavouring to introduce Carducci to English readers
through the following essays and translations, I would
not be understood as being moved to do so alone
by my high estimate of the literary merit of his poems, nor
by a desire to advocate any peculiar religious or social principles
which they may embody. It is rather because these
poems seem to me to afford an unusually interesting example
of the survival of ancient religious motives beneath the literature
of a people old enough to have passed through a succession
of religions; and also because they present a form of
realistic literary art which, at this time, when realism is
being so perverted and abused, is eminently refreshing, and
sure to impart a healthy impetus to the literature of any
people. For these reasons I have thought that, even under
the garb of very inadequate translations, they would constitute
a not unwelcome contribution to contemporary literary
study.
</p>

<p>
I am indebted to the courtesy of Harper &amp; Brothers for the
privilege of including here, in an amplified form, the essay
on <i>Giosuè Carducci and the Hellenic Reaction in Italy</i>, which
appeared first in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> for July, 1890.

<p class="drop-cap">
The passing of a religion is at once the most interesting
and the most tragic theme that can engage the historian.
Such a record lays bare what lies inmostly
at the heart of a people, and has, consciously or unconsciously,
shaped their outward life.
</p>

<p>
The literature of a time reveals, but rarely describes or
analyses, the changes that go on in the popular religious
beliefs. It is only in a later age, when the religion itself has
become desiccated, its creeds and its forms dried and parcelled
for better preservation, that this analysis is made of its passing
modes, and these again made the subject of literary treatment.
</p>

<p>
Few among the existing nations that possess a literature
have a history which dates back far enough to embrace these
great fundamental changes, such as that from paganism to
Christianity, and also a literature that is coeval with those
changes. The Hebrew race possess indeed their ancient
Scriptures, and with them retain their ancient religious ideas.
The Russians and Scandinavians deposed their pagan deities
to give place to the White Christ within comparatively recent
times, but they can hardly be said to have possessed a literature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
in the pre-Christian period. Our own saga of Beowulf
is indeed a religious war-chant uttering the savage emotions
of our Teutonic ancestors, but not a work of literary art
calmly reflecting the universal life of the people.
</p>

<p>
It is only to the Latin nations of Europe, sprung from
Hellenic stock and having a continuous literary history covering
a period of from two to three thousand years, that we
may look for the example of a people undergoing these
radical religious changes and preserving meanwhile a living
record of them in a contemporaneous literature. Such a
nation we find in Italy.
</p>

<p>
So thorough is the reaction exhibited during the last half
of the present century in that country against the dogma and
the authority of the Church of Rome that we are led to inquire
whether, not the church alone, as Mr. Symonds says,<a class="tag" id="tag1" href="#note1">[1]</a>
but Christianity itself has ever “imposed on the Italian character”
to such an extent as to obliterate wholly the underlying
Latin or Hellenic elements, or prevent these from springing
again into a predominating influence when the foreign yoke
is once removed.
</p>

<p>
To speak of Christianity coming and going as a mere passing
episode in the life of a nation, and taking no deep hold
on the national character, is somewhat shocking to the religious
ideas which prevail among Christians, but not more
so than would have been to a Roman of the time of the
Cæsars the suggestion that the Roman Empire might itself
one day pass away, a transient phase only in the life of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
people whose history was to extend in unbroken line over a
period of twenty-five hundred years.
</p>

<p>
In the work just referred to Mr. Symonds also briefly hints
at another idea of profound significance,—namely, whether
there is not an underlying basis of primitive race character
still extant in the various sections of the Italian people to
which may be attributed the variety in the development of
art and literature which these exhibit. In his <i>Studii Letterari</i>
(Bologna, 1880), Carducci has made this idea a fundamental one
in his definition of the three elements of Italian literature.
These are, he says, the church, chivalry, and the national
character. The first or ecclesiastical element is superimposed
by the Roman hierarchy, but is not and never was native to
the Italian people. It has existed in two forms. The first is
Oriental, mystic, and violently opposed to nature and to
human instincts and appetites, and hence is designated the
ascetic type of Christianity. The other is politic and accommodating,
looking to a peaceful meeting-ground between the
desires of the body and the demands of the soul, and so between
the pagan and the Christian forms of worship. Its
aim is to bring into serviceable subjection to the church those
elements of human nature or of natural character which could
not be crushed out altogether. This element is represented
by the church or the ecclesiastical polity. It becomes distinctly
Roman, following the eclectic traditions of the ancient empire,
which gave the gods of all the conquered provinces a niche
in the Pantheon. It transformed the sensual paganism of the
Latin races and the natural paganism of the Germanic into a
religion which, if not Christianity, could be made to serve
the Christian church.
</p>

<p>
In the same way that the church brought in the Christian
element, both in its ascetic and its Roman or semi-pagan
form, so did feudalism and the German Empire bring in that
of chivalry. This, again, was no native development of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
Italian character. It came with the French and German invaders;
it played no part in the actions of the Italians on
their own soil. “There never was in Italy,” says Carducci,
“a true chivalry, and therefore there never was a chivalrous
poetry.” With the departure of a central imperial power the
chivalrous tendency disappeared. There remained the third
element, that of nationality, the race instinct, resting on the
old Roman, and even older Latin, Italic, Etruscan, Hellenic
attachments in the heart of the people. Witness during all
the Middle Ages, even when the power of the church and the
influence of the empire were strongest, the reverence everywhere
shown by the Italian people for classical names and
traditions. Arnold of Brescia, Nicola di Rienzi, spoke to a
sentiment deeper and stronger in the hearts of their hearers
than any that either pope or emperor could inspire. The
story is told of a schoolmaster of the eleventh century, Vilgardo
of Ravenna, who saw visions of Virgil, Horace, and
Juvenal, and rejoiced in their commendation of his efforts to
preserve the ancient literature of the people. The national
principle also exists in two forms, the Roman and the Italian—the
aulic or learned, and the popular. Besides the traditions
of the great days of the republic and of the Cæsars,
besides the inheritance of the Greek and Latin classics, there
are also the native instincts of the people themselves, which,
especially in religion and in art, must play an important part.
Arnold of Brescia cried out, “Neither pope nor emperor!”
It was then the people, as the third estate, made their voices
heard—“<i>Ci sono anch'io!</i>” (Here am I too!).
</p>

<p>
After the elapse of three hundred years from the downfall
of the free Italian municipalities and the enslavement of the
peninsula under Austrio-Spanish rule, we have witnessed
again the achievement by Italians of national independence
and national unity. The effect of this political change on
the free manifestations of the Italian character would seem to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
offer another corroboration of Carducci's assertion that “Italy
is born and dies with the setting and the rising of the stars
of the pope and the emperor.” (<i>Studii Letterari</i>, p. 44.)
Not only with the withdrawal of the Austrian and French
interference has the pope's temporal power come to an end,
but in a large measure the religious emancipation of Italy
from the foreign influences of Christianity in every way has
been accomplished. The expulsion of the Jesuits and the
secularisation of the schools and of the monastic properties
were the means of a more real emancipation of opinion, of
belief, and of native impulse, which, free from restraint either
ecclesiastical or political, could now resume its ancient habit,
lift from the overgrowth of centuries the ancient shrines of
popular worship, and invoke again the ancient gods.
</p>

<p>
The pope remains, indeed, and the Church of Rome fills a
large space in the surface life of the people of Italy; and so
far as in its gorgeous processions and spectacles, its joyous
festivals and picturesque rites, and especially in its sacrificial
and vicarious theory of worship, the church has assimilated
to itself the most important feature of the ancient pagan religion,
it may still be regarded as a thing of the people. But
the real underlying antagonism between the ancient national
instinct, both religious and civil, and that habit of Christianity
which has been imposed upon it, finds its true expression
in the strong lines of a sonnet of Carducci's, published
in 1871, in the collection entitled <i>Decennali</i>. Even
through the burdensome guise of a metrical translation, something
of the splendid fire of the original can hardly fail to
make itself felt. <a href="#poem1">[I]</a>
</p>

<p>
The movement for the revival of Italian literature may be
said to have begun with Alfieri, at the close of the last and
the beginning of the present century. It was contemporary
with the breaking up of the political institutions of the past
in Europe, the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
brief existence of the Italian Republic, the revival for a short
joyous moment of the hope of a restored Italian independence.
Again a thrill of patriotic ardour stirs the measures
of the languid Italian verse. Alfieri writes odes on <i>America
Liberata</i>, celebrating as the heroes of the new age of liberty
Franklin, Lafayette, and Washington. Still more significant
of the new life imparted to literature at this time is the sober
dignity and strength of Alfieri's sonnets, and the manly passion
that speaks in his dramas and marks him as the founder
of Italian tragedy.
</p>

<p>
But the promise of those days was illusory. With the
downfall of Napoleon and the return of the Austrian rule,
the hope of the Italian nationality again died out. Alfieri
was succeeded by Vincenzo Monti and his fellow-classicists,
who sought to console a people deprived of future hope with
the contemplation of the remote past. This school restored
rather than revived the ancient classics. They gave Italians
admirable translations of Homer and Virgil, and turned their
own poetic writing into the classical form. But they failed
to make these dead forms live. These remained in all their
beauty like speechless marble exhumed and set up in the
light and stared at. If they spoke at all, as they did in the
verses of Ugo Foscolo and Leopardi, it was not to utter the
joyous emotions, the godlike freedom and delight of living
which belonged to the world's youthful time; it was rather
to give voice to an all-pervading despair and brooding melancholy,
born, it is true, of repeated disappointments and of a
very real sense of the vanity of life and the emptiness of
great aspirations, whether of the individual or of society.
This melancholy, itself repugnant to the primitive Italian
nature, opened the way for the still more foreign influence
of the romanticists, which tended to the study and love of
nature from the subjective or emotional side, and to a more
or less morbid dwelling upon the passions and the interior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
life. With a religion whose life-sap of a genuine faith had
been drained away for ages, and a patriotism enervated and
poisoned by subserviency to foreign rule and fawning for
foreign favour, naught seemed to remain for Italian writers
who wished to do something else than moan, but to compose
dictionaries and cyclopædias, to prepare editions of the thirteenth-century
classics, with elaborate critical annotations,
and so to keep the people mindful of the fact that there was
once an Italian literature, even if they were to despair of
having another. The decay of religious faith made the external
forms of papal Christianity seem all the more a cruel
mockery to the minds that began now to turn their gaze
inward, and to feel what Taine so truly describes as the
Puritan melancholy, the subjective sadness which belongs
peculiarly to the Teutonic race. The whole literature of the
romantic school, whether in Italy or throughout Europe, betrayed
a certain morbidness of feeling which, says Carducci,
belongs to all periods of transition, and appears alike in Torquato
Tasso, under the Catholic reaction of the sixteenth
century, and in Châteaubriand, Byron, and Leopardi, in the
monarchical restoration of the nineteenth. The despair which
furnishes a perpetual undertone to the writing of this school
is that which is born of the effort to keep a semblance of
life in dead forms of the past, while yet the really living
motives of the present have found neither the courage nor
the fitting forms for their expression.
</p>

<p>
In many respects the present revival of Italian literature is
a reawakening of the same spirit that constituted the Renaissance
of the fourteenth and fifteen centuries, and disappeared
under the subsequent influences of the Catholic reaction.
Three hundred years of papal supremacy and foreign civic
rule have, however, tempered the national spirit, weakened
the manhood of the people, and developed a habit of childlike
subserviency and effeminate dependence. While restraining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the sensuous tendency of pagan religion and pagan
art within the channels of the church ritual, Rome has not
meanwhile rendered the Italian people more, but, if anything,
less spiritual and less susceptible of spiritual teaching than
they were in the days of Dante or even of Savonarola. The
new Italian renaissance, if we may so name the movement
witnessed by the present century for the re-establishment of
national unity and the building up of a new Italian literature,
lacks the youthful zeal, the fiery ardour which characterised
the age of the Medici. The glow is rather that of an Indian
summer than that of May. The purpose, the zeal, whatever
shall be its final aim, will be the result of reflection and not
of youthful impulse. The creature to be awakened and
stirred to new life is more than a mere animal; it is a man,
whose thinking powers are to be addressed, as well as his
sensuous instincts and amatory passion. Such a revival is
slow to be set in motion. When once fairly begun, provided
it have any really vital principle at bottom, it has
much greater promise of permanence than any in the past
history of the Italian people. A true renascence of a nation
will imply a reform or renewal of not one phase alone of the
nation's life, but of all; not only a new political life and a
new poetry, but a new art, a new science, and, above all, a
new religious faith. The steps to this renewal are necessarily
at the beginning oftener of the nature of negation of the old
than of assertion of the new. The destroyer and the clearer-away
of the débris go before the builder. It will not be
strange, therefore, if the present aspect of the new national
life of Italy should offer us a number of conspicuous negations
rather than any positive new conceptions; that the people's
favorite scientist, Mantegazza,—the ultra-materialist,—should
be the nation's chosen spokesman to utter in the face of the
Vatican its denial of the supernatural; and that Carducci, the
nation's foremost and favourite poet, should sing the return of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
the ancient worship of nature, of beauty, and of sensuous love,
and seek to drown the solemn notes of the Christian ritual in
a universal jubilant hymn to Bacchus. These are the contradictions
exhibited in all great transitions. They will not mislead
if the destroyer be not confounded with the builder who
is to follow, and the temporary ebullition of pent-up passion
be not mistaken for the after-thought of a reflecting, sobered
mind. No one has recognized this more truly than Carducci:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Or destruggiam. Dei secoli</p>
<p class="i01">Lo strato è sul pensiero:</p>
<p class="i01">O pochi e forti, all'opera,</p>
<p class="i01">Chè nei profundi è il vero.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Now we destroy. Of the ages</p>

<p class="i01">O few and strong, to the work!</p>
<p class="i01">For truth 's at the bottom.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
It was in the year 1859, when once more the cry for
Italian independence and Italian unity was raised, that the
newly awakened nation found its laureate poet in the youthful
writer of a battle hymn entitled “Alla Croce Bianca di
Savoia”—The White Cross of Savoy. Set to music, it
became very popular with the army of the revolutionists, and
the title is said to have led to the adoption of the present
national emblem for the Italian flag. As a poem it is not
remarkable, unless it be for the very conventional commingling
of devout, loyal, and valorous expressions, like the following,
in the closing stanza:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Dio ti salvi, o cara insegna,</p>
<p class="i02">  Nostro amore e nostra gioja,</p>
<p class="i02">  Bianca Croce di Savoja,</p>
<p class="i01">Dio ti salvi, e salvi il Re!</p>
</div></div>

<p>
But six years later, in 1865, there appeared at Pistoja a poem
over the signature Enotrio Romano, and dated the “year
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
MMDCXVIII from the Foundation of Rome,” which revealed
in a far more significant manner in what sense its author,
Giosuè Carducci, then in his thirtieth year, was to become
truly the nation's poet, in giving utterance again to those
deeply hidden and long-hushed ideas and emotions which
belonged anciently to the people, and which no exotic influence
had been able entirely to quench. This poem was
called a “Hymn to Satan.” The shock it gave to the popular
sense of propriety is evident not only from the violence and
indignation with which it was handled in the clerical and
the conservative journals, one of which called it an “intellectual
orgy,” but from the number of explanations, more or
less apologetic, which the poet and his friends found it
necessary to publish. One of these, which appeared over the
signature Enotriofilo in the <i>Italian Athenæum</i> of January,
1886, has been approvingly quoted by Carducci in his notes
to the <i>Decennali</i>. We may therefore regard it as embodying
ideas which are, at least, not contrary to what the author of
the poem intended. From this commentary it appears that
we are to look here “not for the poetry of the saints but of
the sinners,—of those sinners, that is, who do not steal away
into the deserts to hide their own virtues, so that others
shall not enjoy them, who are not ashamed of human delights
and human comforts, and who refuse none of the paths
that lead to these. Not <i>laudes</i> or spiritual hymns, but a
material hymn is what we shall here find. “Enotrio sings,”
says his admiring apologist, “and I forget all the curses
which the catechism dispenses to the world, the flesh, and
the devil. Asceticism here finds no defender and no victim.
Man no longer goes fancying among the vague aspirations of
the mystics. He respects laws, and wills well, but to him
the sensual delights of love and the cup are not sinful, and
in these, to him, innocent pleasures Satan dwells. It was to
the joys of earth that the rites of the Aryans looked; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
same joys were by the Semitic religion either mocked or
quenched. But the people did not forget them. As a secretly
treasured national inheritance, despite both Christian church
and Gothic empire, this ancient worship of nature and of the
joys of the earth remains with the people. It is this spirit
of nature and of natural sensuous delights, and lastly of
natural science, that the poet here addresses as Satan. As
Satan it appears in nature's secret powers of healing and
magic, in the arts of the sorcerer and of the alchemist. The
anchorites, who, drunk with paradise, deprived themselves
of the joys of earth, gradually began to listen to these songs
from beyond the gratings of their cells—songs of brave
deeds, of fair women, and of the triumph of arms. It is
Satan who sings, but as they listen they become men again,
enamoured of civil glory. New theories arise, new masters,
new ideals of life. Genius awakes, and the cowl of the
Dominican falls to earth. Now, liberty itself becomes the
tempter. It is the development of human activity, of labour
and struggle, that causes the increase of both bread and
laughter, riches and honour, and the author of all this new
activity is Satan; not Satan bowing his head before hypocritical
worshippers, but standing glorious in the sight of
those who acknowledge him. This hymn is the result of
two streams of inspiration, which soon are united in one,
and continue to flow in a peaceful current: the goods of life
and genius rebelling against slavery.”
</p>

<p>
With this explanation of its inner meaning we may now
refer the reader to the hymn itself. <a href="#poem2">[II]</a>
</p>

<p>
This poem, while excelled by many others in beauty or in
interest, has nowhere, even in the poet's later verses, a rival
in daring and novelty of conception, and none serves so well
to typify the prominent traits of Carducci as a national poet.
We see here the fetters of classic, romantic, and religious
tradition thrown off, and the old national, which is in substance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
a pagan, soul pouring forth in all freedom the sentiments
of its nature. It is no longer here the question of
either Guelph or Ghibelline; Christianity, whether of the
subjective Northern type, brought in by the emperors, or of
the extinct formalities of Rome, is bidden to give way to the
old Aryan love of nature and the worship of outward beauty
and sensuous pleasure. The reaction here witnessed is essentially
Hellenic in its delight in objective beauty, its bold assertion
of the rightful claims of nature's instincts, its abhorrence
of mysticism and of all that religion of introspection and of
conscience which the poet includes under the term “Semitic.”
It will exchange dim cathedrals for the sky filled
with joyous sunshine; it will go to nature's processes and
laws for its oracles, rather than to the droning priests. While
the worship of matter and its known laws, in the form of a
kind of apotheosis of science, with which the poem opens
and closes, may seem at first glance rather a modern than an
ancient idea, it is nevertheless in substance the same conception
as that which anciently took form in the myth of
Prometheus, in the various Epicurean philosophies, and in
the poem of Lucretius. Where, however, Carducci differs
from his contemporaries and from the classicists so called is
in the utter frankness of his renunciation of Christianity, and
the bold bringing to the front of the old underlying Hellenic
instincts of the people. That which others wrote about he
feels intensely, and sings aloud as the very life of himself and
of his nation. That which the foreigner has tried for centuries
to crush out, it is the mission of the nation's true poet
and prophet to restore.
</p>

<p>
The sentiments underlying Carducci's writings we find
to be chiefly three: a fervent and joyous veneration of the
great poets of Greece and Rome; an intense love of nature,
amounting to a kind of worship of sunshine and of bodily
beauty and sensuous delights; and finally an abhorrence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
the supernatural and spiritual elements of religion. Intermingled
with the utterances of these sentiments will be found
patriotic effusions mostly in the usual vein of aspirants after
republican reforms, which, while of a national interest, are
not peculiar to the author, and do not serve particularly to
illustrate the Hellenistic motive of his writing. The same
may be said of his extensive critical labours in prose, his university
lectures, his scholarly annotations of the early Italian
poets. How far Carducci conforms to the traditional character
of the Italian poets—always with the majestic exception
of the exiled Dante—in that the soft winds of court favour are
a powerful source of their inspiration on national themes, may
be judged from the fact that while at the beginning of his
public career he was a violent republican, now that he is
known to stand high in the esteem and favour of Queen
Margherita his democratic utterances have become very greatly
moderated, and his praises of the Queen and of the bounties
and blessings of her reign are most glowing and fulsome.
Without a formal coronation, Carducci occupies the position
of poet-laureate of Italy. A little over fifty years of age, an
active student and a hard-working professor at the University
of Bologna, where his popularity with his students in the
lecture-room is equal to that which his public writings have
won throughout the land, called from time to time to sojourn
in the country with the court, or to lecture before the Queen
and her ladies at Rome, withal a man of great simplicity,
even to roughness of manners, and of a cordial, genial nature—such
is the writer whom the Italians with one voice call
their greatest poet, and whom not a few are fain to consider
the foremost living poet of Europe.<a class="tag" id="tag2" href="#note2">[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
</p>

<p>
It would be interesting to trace the development of the
Hellenic spirit in the successive productions of Carducci's
muse, to note his emancipation from the lingering influences
of romanticism, and his casting off the fetters of conventional
metre in the <i>Odi Barbare</i>. But as all this has been done for
us far better in an autobiographical sketch, which the author
gives us in the preface of the <i>Poesie</i> (1871), we will here only
glance briefly at some of the more characteristic points thus
presented.
</p>

<p>
After alluding to the bitterness and violence for which the
Tuscans are famous in their abuse, he informs us that from
the first he was charged with an idolatry of antiquity and of
form, and with an aristocracy of style. The theatre critics
offered to teach him grammar, and the schoolmasters said
he was aping the Greeks. One distinguished critic said that
his verse revealed “the author's absolute want of all poetic
faculty.” The first published series of poems was in reality
a protest against the religious and intellectual bitterness which
prevailed in the decade preceding 1860, “against the nothingness
and vanity under whose burden the country was languishing;
against the weak coquetries of liberalism which spoiled
then as it still spoils our art and our thoughts, ever unsatisfactory
to the spirit which will not do things by halves, and
which refuses to pay tribute to cowardice.” Naturally, even in
literary matters inclined to take the opposite side, Carducci
felt himself in the majority like a fish out of water. In the
revolutionary years 1858 and 1859 he wrote poems on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
<i>Plébiscite</i> and Unity, counselling the king to throw his crown
into the Po, enter Rome as its armed tribune, and there order
a national vote. “These,” says the poet, “were my worst
things, and fortunately were kept unpublished, and so I escaped
becoming the poet-laureate of public opinion. In a
republic it would have been otherwise. I would have composed
the battle pieces with the usual grand words—the
ranks in order, arms outstretched in command, brilliant uniforms,
and finely curled moustaches. To escape all temptation
of this sort I resorted to the cold bath of philosophy, the
death-shrouds of learning—<i>lenzuolo funerario dell'erudizione</i>.
It was pleasant amid all that grand talk of the new life to
hide myself in among the cowled shadows of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries. I journeyed along the Dead Sea of
the Middle Ages, studied the movements of revolution in
history and in letters; then gradually dawned upon me a
fact which at once surprised and comforted me. I found
that my own repugnance to the literary and philosophical
reaction of 1815 was really in harmony with the experience
of many illustrious thinkers and authors. My own sins
of paganism had already been committed, and in manifold
splendid guises, by many of the noblest minds and geniuses
of Europe. This paganism, this cult of form, was naught
else but the love of that noble nature from which the solitary
Semitic estrangements had alienated hitherto the spirit of
man in such bitter opposition. My at first feebly defined
sentiment of opposition thus became confirmed conceit, reason,
affirmation; the hymn to Phœbus Apollo became the hymn
to Satan. Oh, beautiful years from 1861 to 1865, passed in
peaceful solitude and quiet study, in the midst of a home
where the venerated mother, instead of fostering superstition,
taught us to read Alfieri! But as I read the codices of the
fourteenth century the ideas of the Renaissance began to appear
to me in the gilded initial letters like the eyes of nymphs in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
the midst of flowers, and between the lines of the spiritual
<i>laude</i> I detected the Satanic strophe. Meanwhile the image
of Dante looked down reproachfully upon me; but I might
have answered: ‘Father and master, why didst thou bring
learning from the cloister into the piazza, from the Latin to
the vulgar tongue? Why wast thou willing that the hot
breath of thine anger should sweep the heights of papal
and imperial power? Thou first, O great public accuser of
the Middle Ages, gavest the signal for the rebound of thought:
that the alarm was sounded from the bells of a Gothic campanile
mattered but little!’ So my mind matured in understanding
and sentiment to the <i>Levia Gravia</i>, and thence more
rapidly, in questions of social interest, to the <i>Decennali</i>.
There are those who complain that I am not what I was
twenty-four years ago:—good people, for whom to live and
develop is only to feed, like the calf <i>qui largis invenescit
herbis</i>. In the <i>Juvenilia</i> I was the armour-bearer of the classics.
In the <i>Levia Gravia</i> I held my armed watch. In the <i>Decennali</i>,
after a few uncertain preliminary strokes of the lance,
I venture abroad prepared for every risk and danger. I have
read that the poet must give pleasure either to all or to the
few; to cater to many is a bad sign. Poetry to-day is useless
from not having learned that it has nothing to do with
the exigencies of the moment. The lyre of the soul should
respond to the echoes of the past, the breathings of the future,
the solemn rumours of ages and generations gone by. If, on
the contrary, it allows itself to be swayed by the breeze of
society's fans or the waving of soldiers' cockades and professors'
togas, then woe to the poet! Let the poet express himself
and his artistic and moral convictions with the utmost
possible candour, sincerity, and courage; as for the rest, it is
not his concern. And so it happens that I dare to put forth
a book of verses in these days, when one group of our literati
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
are declaring that Italy has never had a language, and another
are saying that for some time past we have had no literature;
that the fathers do not count for much, and that we are really
only in the beginnings. There let them remain; or, as the
wind changes, shift from one foreign servitude to another!”
</p>

<p>
In my selection of poems for translation, regard has been
had not so much to the chronological order of their production
as to their fitness for illustrating the three important
characteristics of Carducci as a national poet which were
enumerated above.
</p>

<p>
The first of these was his strong predilection for the classics,
as evinced not only by his veneration for the Greek and Latin
poets, but by his frequent attempts at the restoration of the
ancient metres in his own verse. Of his fervent admiration
for Homer and Virgil let the two sonnets III and IV testify,
both taken from the fourth book of the <i>Levia Gravia</i>. Already
in the <i>Juvenilia</i>, during his “classical knighthood,” he had
produced a poem of some length on Homer, and in the volume
which contains the one I have given there are no less
than three sonnets addressed to the venerated master, entitled
in succession, “Homer,” “Homer Again,” and “Still
Homer.” I have chosen the second in order. <a href="#poem3">[III]</a>
</p>

<p>
In the tribute to Virgil <a href="#poem4">[IV]</a> the beauty of form is only
equalled by the tenderness of feeling. It shows to what
extent the classic sentiment truly lived again in the writer's
soul, and was not a thing of mere intellectual contemplation.
In reading it we are bathed in the very air of Campania; we
catch a distant glimpse of the sea glistening under the summer
moon, and hear the wind sighing through the dark cypresses.
</p>

<p>
Here it will be proper to notice the efforts made by Carducci
not only to restore as to their native soil the long-disused
metres of the classic poets, but to break loose from all
formal restrictions in giving utterance to the poetic impulse.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
This intense longing for greater freedom of verse he expresses
in the following lines from the <i>Odi Barbare</i>:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i03">    I hate the accustomed verse.</p>
<p class="i01">Lazily it falls in with the taste of the crowd,</p>
<p class="i01">And pulseless in its feeble embraces</p>
<p class="i03">    Lies down and sleeps.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i03">    For me that vigilant strophe</p>
<p class="i01">Which leaps with the plaudits and rhythmic stamp of the chorus,</p>
<p class="i01">Like a bird caught in its flight, which</p>
<p class="i03">    Turns and gives battle.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
In the preface of the same volume (1877) he pleads in behalf
of his new metres that “it may be pardoned in him that
he has endeavoured to adapt to new sentiments new metres
instead of conforming to the old ones, and that he has thus
done for Italian letters what Klopstock did for the Germans,
and what Catullus and Horace did in bringing into Latin use
the forms of the Eolian lyric.”
</p>

<p>
In the <i>Nuove Rime</i> (1887) are three Hellenic Odes, under
the titles “Primavere Elleniche,” written in three of the
ancient metres, the beauty of which would be lost by translation
into any language less melodious and sympathetic than
the Italian. We give a few lines from each:

<p>
The second of these examples demands translation as exhibiting
perhaps more forcibly than any others we could select
the boldness with which Carducci asserts the survival of the
Hellenic spirit in the love of nature as well as in art and literature,
despite the contrary influences of ascetic Christianity:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">The other gods may die, but those of Greece</p>

</div></div>

<p>
The reader is also here referred to the “Invocation.” <a href="#poem5">[V]</a>
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
From this glance at the classic form which is so distinct
a feature in Carducci's poems, we proceed to examine the
feeling and conceptions which constitute their substance, and
which will be found to be no less Hellenic than the metres
which clothe them. Nothing could stand in stronger contrast
with the melancholy of the romantic school of poets, or
with the subjective thoughtfulness and austere introspection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
of the Christian, than the unfettered outbursts of song in
praise of the joy of living, of the delights of love and bodily
pleasure, and of the sensuous worship of beautiful form,
which we find in the poems “Sun and Love” <a href="#poem6">[VI]</a> and the
hymn “To Aurora.” <a href="#poem7">[VII]</a>
</p>

<p>
The latter has in it the freshness and splendour of morning
mists rising among the mountains and catching the rosy
kisses of the sun. Equally beautiful but full of the tranquillity
of evening is the <i>Ruit Hora</i> from the <i>Odi Barbare</i> of
1877. <a href="#poem8">[VIII]</a>
</p>

<p>
No one will fail to be struck with the beauty of the figure
in the last stanza of this poem, nor with the picturesque
force of the “green and silent solitudes” of the first, a near
approach to the celebrated and boldly original conception of
a <i>silenzio verde</i>, a “green silence,” which forms one of the
many rare and beautiful gems of the sonnet “To the Ox.”
<a href="#poem9">[IX]</a>
</p>

<p>
As an example of a purely Homeresque power of description
and colouring, and at the same time of an intense sympathy
with nature and exquisite responsiveness to every thrill
of its life, this sonnet stands at the summit of all that Carducci
has written, if indeed it has its rival anywhere in the
poetry of our century. The desire to produce in English a
suggestion at least of the broad and restful tone given by the
metre and rhythm of the original has induced me to attempt
a metrical and rhymed translation, even at the inevitable cost
of a strict fidelity to the author's every word, and in such
a poem to lose a word is to lose much. Nothing but the
original can present the sweet, ever-fresh, and sense-reviving
picture painted in this truly marvellous sonnet. The unusual
and almost grotesque epithet of the opening phrase will be
pardoned in view of the singular harmony and fitness of the
original.
</p>

<p>
We know not where else to look for such vivid examples
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
as Carducci affords us of a purely objective and sensuous
sympathy with nature, as distinguished from the romantic,
reflective mood which nature awakens in the more sentimental
school of poets. We feel that this strong and brilliant
objectivity is something purely Greek and pagan, as
contrasted with the analysis of emotions and thoughts which
occupies so large a place in Christian writing. No one is
better aware of the existence of this contrast than Carducci
himself. For the dear love of nature—that boon of youth
before the shadows of anxious care began to darken the
mind, or the queryings of philosophy, the conflicts of doubt,
and the stings of conscience to torment it—for this happy
revelling of mere animal life in the world where the sun
shines, the soul of the poet never ceases to yearn and cry
out. The consciousness of the opposite, of a world of thought,
of care, and of conscience ever frowning in sheer stern contrast
from the strongholds of the present life and the opinions
of men—this is what introduces a kind of tragic motive
into many of these poems, and adds greatly to their moral,
that is, their human interest. For the poetry of mere animal
life, if such were poetry, however blissful the life it describes,
would still not be interesting.
</p>

<p>
Something of this pathos appears in the poem “To Phœbus
Apollo,” <a href="#poem10">[X]</a> where the struggle of the ancient with the
present sentiments of the human soul is depicted. It will
interest the reader to know that at the time this poem was
written (it appeared in Book II. of the <i>Juvenilia</i>) the author
had not broken so entirely with the conventional thought of
his time and people but that he could consent to write a
<i>lauda spirituale</i> <a href="#poem11">[XI]</a> for a procession of the <i>Corpus Domini</i>,
and a hymn for the Feast of the Blessed Diana Guintini, protectress
of Santa Maria a Monti in the lower Valdarno.
When called by the <i>Unità Cattolica</i> to account for this sudden
transformation of the hymn-writer into the odist of Phœbus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Apollo, Carducci replied by reminding his clerical critics that
even in his nineteenth year he was given to writing parodies
of sacred hymns, and he further offers by way of very doubtful
apology the explanation that, being invited by certain
priests who knew of his rhyming ability to compose verses
for their feasts, the thought came into his head, “being in
those days deeply interested in Horace and the thirteenth-century
writers, to show that faith does not affect the <i>form</i>
of poetry, and that therefore without any faith at all one
might reproduce entirely the forms of the blessed laudists of
the thirteenth century. I undertook the task as if it were a
wager.”
</p>

<p>
In the lines of the poem <i>To Phœbus Apollo</i> there is traceable
a romantic melancholy, the faint remnant of the impression left
by those writers through whom, says Carducci, “I mounted
to the ancients, and dwelt with Dante and Petrarch,” viz.,
Alfieri, Parini, Monti, Foscolo, and Leopardi. He has not yet
broken entirely with subjective reflection and its gloom, and
entrusted himself to the life which the senses realize at the
present moment as the whole of human well-being. This sentiment
becomes more strongly pronounced in the later poems,
where not even a regret for the past is allowed to enter to distract
the worship of the present, radiant with its divine splendour
and bounty. The one thought that can cast a shadow
is the thought of death; but this is not at all to be identified
with Christian seriousness in reflecting on the world to
come. The poet's fear of death is not that of a judgment, or
a punishment for sins here committed, and hence it is not
associated with any idea of the responsibility of the present
hour, or of the amending of life and character in the present
conduct. The only fear of death here depicted is a horror
of the absence of life, and hence of the absence of the delights
of life. It is the fear of a vast dreary vacuum, of cold, of
darkness, of nothingness. The moral effect of such a fear is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
only that of enhancing the value of the sensual joys of the
present life, the use of the body for the utmost of pleasure
that can be got by means of it. This more than pagan
materialism finds its bold expression in the lines from the
<i>Nuove Odi Barbare</i> entitled “Outside the Certosa.” <a href="#poem12">[XII]</a>
</p>

<p>
In studying the religious or theological tendency of Carducci's
muse, it is necessary to bear in mind constantly the
inherent national blindness of the Hellenic and, in equal if
not greater degree, the Latin mind to what we may call a
spiritual conception of life, its duties, and its destiny. But
in addition to this blindness towards the spiritual elements or
substance of Christianity there is felt in every renascent Hellenic
instinct a violent and unrelenting hostility towards that
ascetic form and practice which, although in no true sense
Christian, the greater religious orders and the general discipline
of the Roman Church have succeeded in compelling
Christianity to wear. The mortification of nature, the condemnation
of all worldly and corporeal delights, not in their
abuse, but in their essential and orderly use, the dishonouring
of the body in regarding its beauty as only an incentive
to sin, and in making a virtue of ugliness, squalor, and
physical weakness—these things have the offensiveness of
deadly sins to the sensuous consciousness of minds of the
Hellenic type. To spiritual Christianity Carducci is not adverse
because it is spiritual—as such it is still comparatively
an unknown element to Italian minds—but because
it is foreign to the national instinct; because it came in
with the emperors, and so it is indissolubly associated with
foreign rule and oppression. It is the Gothic or Teutonic
infusion in the Italian people that has kept alive whatever
there is of spiritual life in the Christianity that has been imposed
on them by the Roman Church. The other elements of
Romanism are only a sensuous cult of beautiful and imposing
forms in ritual, music, and architecture on the one hand;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
and on the other a stern, uncompromising asceticism, which
in spirit is the direct contradiction of the former. While the
principle of asceticism was maintained in theory, the sincerity
of its votaries gradually came to be believed in by no one;
the only phase of the church that seized hold of the sympathies
and affections of the people was the pagan element
in its worship and its festivals; and seeing these, the popes
were wise enough to foster this spirit and cater in the most
liberal measure to its indulgence, as the surest means of
maintaining their hold on the popular devotion. In the
ever-widening antagonism between the spirit and the flesh,
between the subjective conception of Christianity on the one
hand, as represented by the Teutonic race and the empire,
and the sensuous and objective on the other, as represented
by the Italic race and the pope, may we not discern the reason
why the Italian people, in the lowest depths of their sensual
corruption, were largely and powerfully Guelph in their
sympathies, and why the exiled and lonely writer of the
<i>Divina Commedia</i> was a Ghibelline? It is at least in the antagonism
of principles as essentially native <i>versus</i> foreign that
we must find the explanation of the cooling of Carducci's
ardour towards the revered master of his early muse, even
while the old spell of the latter is still felt to be as irresistible
as ever. This double attitude of reverence and aversion we
have already seen neatly portrayed in the reference Carducci
makes in the autobiographical notes given above to Dante as
the great “accuser of the Middle Ages who first sounded the
signal for the reaction of modern thought,” with the added
remark that the signal being sounded from a “Gothic campanile”
detracted but little from the grandeur of its import.
The same contrast of sentiment finds more distinct expression
in the sonnet on Dante in Book IV. of the <i>Levia Gravia</i>. <a href="#poem13">[XIII]</a>
</p>

<p>
But nowhere is the contrast between the Christian sense of
awe in the presence of the invisible and supernatural and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Hellenic worship of immediate beauty and sensuous pleasure
displayed in such bold and majestic imagery as in the poem entitled
“In a Gothic Church.” <a href="#poem14">[XIV]</a> Here, in the most
abrupt and irreverent but entirely frank transition from the
impression of the dim and lofty cathedral nave to the passion
kindled by the step of the approaching loved one, and in the
epithets of strong aversion applied to the holiest of all objects
of Christian reverence, the very shock given to Christian feeling
and the suddenness of the awful descent from heavenly
to satyric vision tell, with the prophetic veracity and power
of true poetry, what a vast chasm still unbridged exists between
the ancient inherent Hellenism of the Italian people
and that foreign influence, named indifferently by Carducci
Semitic or Gothic, which for eighteen centuries has been imposed
without itself imposing on them.
</p>

<p>
The true poet of the people lays bare the people's heart.
If Carducci be, indeed, the national poet of Italy we have in
this poem not only the heart but the religious sense—we had
almost said the conscience—of the Italian people revealed to
view. Nor is this all Bacchantic; the infusion of the Teutonic
blood in the old Etruscan and Italic stock has brought the
dim shadows of the cathedral and its awful, ever-present
image of the penalty of sin to interrupt the free play of Italian
sunshine. But just as on the canvas of the religious
painters of the Renaissance angels as amorous Cupids hover
about between Madonna and saints, and as in the ordinary
music of an Italian church the organist plays tripping dance
melodies or languishing serenades between the intoned
prayers of the priests or the <i>canto firmo</i> psalms of the choir,
so here we behold the sacred aisles of the cathedral suddenly
invaded by the dancing satyr, who, escaping from his native
woods, has wandered innocently enough into this his ancient
but strangely disguised shrine.
</p>

<p>
The stanzas that follow describe Dante's vision of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
“Tuscan Virgin” rising transfigured amid the hymns of
angels. The poet, on the contrary, sees neither angels nor
demons, but is conscious only of feeling
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i12">                      the cold twilight</p>
<p class="i01">To be tedious to the soul,</p>

<p>
and then exclaims:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Farewell, Semitic God: the mistress Death</p>
<p class="i01">May still continue in thy solemn rites,</p>

</div></div>

<p>
Notwithstanding the bold assertion of the Hellenic spirit
in this and in the greater part of his poems, that, nevertheless,
Carducci has not been able to restore his fair god of light
and beauty, the Phœbus Apollo, to the undisputed sway he
held in the ancient mind is evident from the shadows of
doubt, of fear, and anxious questioning which still darken
here and there the poet's lines, as in the sonnet <i>Innanzi,
Innanzi!</i> <a href="#poem15">[XV]</a> It is here that the stern element of tragedy,
the real tragedy of humanity, makes itself felt in this rhapsodist
of joy and of love. It comes to tell us that to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Italian as he is to-day life has ceased to be a carnival, and
that other sounds than that of the Bacchante's hymn have
gained an entrance, with all their grating discord, to his ear:
and to silence this intruder will the praises of Lidia and
of Apollo suffice, be they sung on a lyre never so harmonious
and sweet? In this sonnet is depicted in wonderful imagery
the ancient and awful struggle which the sensuous present
life sustains with the question of an eternity lying beyond.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
While our interest in Carducci is largely owing to the
character he bears as the poet of the Italian people, it would
be quite erroneous to consider him a popular poet. For popularity,
whether with the court, the school, or the masses, he
never aimed, as is evident from his satisfaction at narrowly
escaping being made a political poet-laureate. Instead of
writing down to the level of popular apprehension and taste,
he rather places himself hopelessly aloof from the contact of
the masses by his style of writing, which, simple and pure as
it seems to the cultured reader, is nevertheless branded by the
average Italian as learned and obscure, and not suited to the
ordinary intelligence. As an innovator both in the form and
in the content of his verse, he has still a tedious warfare to
wage with a people so conservative as the Italians of old
habits and old tastes, confirmed as these have been by the
combined influence of centuries of political and ecclesiastical
bondage. But Carducci's writing, springing nevertheless
from a strong instinct, looks only to the people for a final
recognition, even though that has to be obtained through the
medium of the learned classes at first. How far he has
succeeded in getting this vantage-ground of a general recognition
and acquiescence on the part of the learned, the following
testimony from Enrico Panzacchi, himself a critic and a
poet of high reputation, may help us to conclude:
</p>

<p>
“I believe that I do not exaggerate the importance of Carducci
when I affirm that to him and to his perseverance and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
steadfast courageous work we owe in great part the poetic
revival in Italy.
</p>

<p>
“I have great faith, I confess, in the initiative power of
men of strong genius and will, and, to tell the truth, while
it is the fashion of the day to explain always the individual
by the age he lived in, I think it is often necessary to invert
the rule, and explain the age by the individual.”
</p>

<p>
He goes on to show that, indifferent alike to conventional
laws and public opinion, Carducci always persisted in the
constant endeavour to <i>far l'arte</i>, to “do his art.” He defied
the critics, and tried to be himself.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Symonds says of the Renaissance that “it was a return
in all sincerity and faith to the glory and gladness of nature,
whether in the world without or in the soul of man.” Carducci
reflects the spirit of the Renaissance in so far as by
setting free the national instincts he has made way for the
Hellenic reaction in favour of the “glory and the gladness
of the world without.” He has shown, moreover, how foreign
to these instincts is Christianity, considered apart from
the Roman Church, whether in its ascetic or in its spiritual
aspects. But it cannot be said of him, whatever may have
been true of the poets of the Renaissance, that he has reawakened
or rediscovered “the glory and gladness of nature in
the soul of man,” and without this the gladness of the world
without is but a film of sunshine hiding the darkness of the
abyss. Indeed, if the soul and not the senses be addressed,
we question whether beneath all the Dionysian splendours and
jollity of Carducci's verses there be not discernible a gloom
more real than that of Leopardi. Even for Italy the day is
past when Hellenism can fill the place of Christianity; the
soul craves a substance for which mere beauty of form,
whether in intellect, art, or nature, is a poor and hollow substitute;
and to revive not the poetry alone, but the humanity
of the nation, a force is needed greater and higher than that
to be got by the restoration of either dead Pan or Apollo.

<span class="smaller">CARDUCCI
AND THE CLASSIC REALISM</span></h2>
</div>

<div>
<img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop-s.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">
Sojourning one autumn in a quiet <i>pension</i> at Lugano,
I came in contact with a fellow-boarder, who, notwithstanding
he bore the title of a Sicilian count of
very high-sounding name, proved on acquaintance to be a
man of serious literary taste and not above accepting pecuniary
compensation for the products of his pen.
</p>

<p>
He was engaged at that time in translating into the Italian
a well-known English classic, and was in the habit of appealing
to me occasionally for my judgment as to the accuracy
of his interpretation of an English word or phrase.
</p>

<p>
This led to pleasant interviews on the literary art in
general.
</p>

<p>
It was one day when the conversation turned on the extreme
materialism of certain scientific writers of the day, and
especially on Mantegazza of Florence, whose grossness in
treating of the human passions has called forth expressions of
disgust from Italians, as well as others, that my Sicilian friend
quietly remarked, “We Italians can never allow the holy
Trine to be destroyed—the True, the Good, the Beautiful.
It is not enough that a writer tell the facts as they are;
nor that his purpose be a useful one; there must be the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
element of beauty also in his work, or the Italians will not
accept it; and the ugly, the monstrous, and deformed the
Italians will not endure.”
</p>

<p>
I thought herein he proved his lineage from a stock older
than even his family title—that old race of the land where
Theocritus sang as if for beauty alone, and whose Ætna
cherishes still her deep-down fires uncooled and untamed by
modern as by ancient contrivances of man.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
It is this presence of the love of the beautiful that everywhere
accompanies the Greek race and their descendants, and
imparts what we may call the Hellenic instinct of form.
And in this sense of form born of the love of beauty lies the
secret of the immortal art of the Greeks, whether as presented
in sculpture, architecture, painting, or letters.
</p>

<p>
The survival of a certain Hellenic religious feeling in the
Italian people after centuries of a superimposed Christianity
has already been treated of in the previous essay. I desire
here to speak of Carducci as affording an example—perhaps
one among many, but I know none better—of the restoration
of the Greek love of form to modern letters, and so as illustrating
what we may designate as the classic realism.
</p>

<p>
No term has been more abused of late years than this word—realism.
Become the watchword of schools of “realists” in
every branch of art and literature, it has been reduced at last
to a service as empty of meaning as was ever the vaguest
idealism empty of reality.
</p>

<p>
The tendency of the age has been unquestionably one of
ultimation; everything presses into the plane of outermost
effect. We have seemed to be no more satisfied with the
contemplation of intangible ideals: we rest content only with
what hand can touch and eye rest upon. The “power in
ultimates” is the display of force characteristic of this age
of the world. The forces physical and mental have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
always there: it has taken a time like the present, an age
of inventive frenzy filled with a yearning for the doing and
trying of things long dreamt of, to give vent to these hidden
forces.
</p>

<p>
This tendency to ultimation, the seeking expression of inmost
emotions and conceptions in material embodiments, has
characterized of late years every form of mental activity.
</p>

<p>
Religion exemplifies it in the impatience the people exhibit
at fine analyses of doctrines and laborious attempts
at creed-patching, at the same time that they are ready to
engage in schemes of benevolence and social reform unparalleled
in the history of the past. They would fain substitute
a religion of doing for a religion of believing; and so impatient
are they of the restrictions of dogma that they resent
inquiry into the quality or inward motive of the doing, or
even into its moral effect in the long run, so only some
“good work” be done and done quickly.
</p>

<p>
We see the same tendency in music and the drama wonderfully
illustrated in the whole conception and effort of the
Wagnerian school. Expression is everything. The question
is not—Is the thing in itself noble, but is the expression
of it complete, unhindered by previous conventionalities?
Is nothing kept back, or left to the imagination, but everything,
rather, brought out into the actuality of sound, of
color, of living performers, and material accessories?
</p>

<p>
The Ibsen drama, the Tourguenief and Tolstoi school of
novelists, not to speak of Zola and his followers in France,
writers like Capuana and Verga in Italy, and, although in a
quite different vein, Howells among novelists and Whitman
among poets in America, have aimed chiefly to give a faithful
account of life as it is seen. Some have come dangerously
near the assertion that by some mysterious law the bold doing
ennobles even a commonplace motive, and that a regard for
truth is enough whether there be any beauty behind it or not.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
</p>

<p>
The power realised in full and free expression is one of the
most exquisite delights known to man. We of a northern
race who, according to the saying of our French neighbor,
“take our pleasures sadly,” do so because of a hereditary
conviction of the sanctity of the unexpressed. We have
therefore been slowest in arriving at these efforts towards
realism, or the untrammelled giving forth of the inward self
into outward embodiment. That pure externalism of the
southern or Greek nature which sought its highest satisfaction
in a visible embodiment of the divine in art, and which distinguishes
still the Roman from the Saxon religious nature,
has been regarded as verging on the sinful. It is not strange
that a tendency so long suppressed when once set free should
rush even into lawless extremes, and that an age or school of
writers tasting the delights of this liberty for the first time
should be loth to resign it and be ready rather to sacrifice
all to its further extension. It is quite in accordance with
this theory that puritan America should have given birth to
Walt Whitman, who, with all his lawlessness, is in many
respects the most of a Greek that modern literature can show.
</p>

<p>
To what extremes this delight has sought indulgence is
shown not more plainly in Zola and his school above mentioned
than in the whole contemporary school of French pictorial
art. We see here how form, as expression, indulged
in for its own sake, apart from a due consideration of the
substance within the form, becomes itself monstrous and
vicious. This is the essentially <i>immoral</i> element in art—the
licentious worship of form, or of external shape, regardless
of an internal soul or motive.
</p>

<p>
When the realist says: “With the motive of nature, of
society, of man, I have nothing to do; it is enough if I
portray faithfully his conduct,” he thereby advertises the
fact that he is not an artist, but a kind of moral photographer.
He falls short of being an artist in just the degree in which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
he sees the details of form apart from their soul or spiritual
essence; and as this spiritual element is that wherein the unity
of the world as idea exists, therefore, failing to apprehend
this, he fails to lay hold of the universal aspects which alone
can assign true relation and true meaning to any of the details
treated of. It is the apprehension of the universal element
underlying the particulars that constitutes the peculiar gift of
the artist. It is indeed true that nature, or humanity, is its
own interpreter and its own preacher; and the most faithful
servant of either will be he who most exactly presents his
subject as he finds it. But the subject is never found by
the true artist detached from its community-life, or severed
from the endless woof of combinations, of causes and effects,
of law and recompense, which go to make up any present
moment of its existence; these constitute its “story.” So far
as these inner conditions are recognized and felt in giving the
ultimate expression, so far alone is the portrayal a real one
in the true sense.
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly the inmost motive that can give form to the
literature of any age or race is the religious one, by which
I mean the recognition of a life within and above nature, not
our own, but to which we entertain a personal relation. This
is in the truest sense that “soul” which “is form, and doth
the body make,” and its presence or absence is what sufficiently
distinguishes the true from a false realism.
</p>

<p>
An age without a religion can produce only a soulless, and
so an unreal, art. What it calls art may abound in shape,
but will possess no form in the true sense of the word. For
form is the combination of particulars with a view to a single
purpose, for which every particular exists and to which it is
subordinate; it is therefore never a many, but always a one
out of many. This inward controlling motive that constitutes
out of many the one, is the living substance within every
true or real form. That which does not possess this motive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
of unity is not form, but shape, or an artificial cast made to
resemble the living thing, but having no life within it. Art
is thus the form that grows from within, while shape is but
the impression mechanically imposed on passive and lifeless
material from without. The modern French school of realists
in art are the fittest examples of this substitution of shape for
form, and so of pseudo-realism. They have given us corpses,
whether physical or moral, and called them human beings.
They have preferred the charnel-house, the dissecting-room,
or the field of carnage, as the subjects in which to display
most effectively their realism. The more revolting
the subject, the more hideously exact the representation, the
more credit was claimed for the artist. In literature the
case was parallel. Nothing so vile but it was to be admired
for its faithfulness in representation. The inner motive, the
moral purpose of the writing or the painting, was not only
not there, but the producer scorned the judgment that would
look for it. Never was religion, or the sentiment of reverence
for the spiritual as the world's idea, so manifestly wanting as
in these recent French materialists. The abjuring of the
romantic and the ideal has gone so far as to extinguish the
human element, and so we find in these schools skilfully
painted bodies and an almost matchless power of expression;
but, after all, how little is expressed!
</p>

<p>
Compare a Greek statue of Phidias's time with the latest
production of a Parisian studio. Both are alike of hard, colourless,
senseless marble; but can we not see in one the
breathing of a god, while in the other we, at the most,
study with a critical vision the outlines of a human animal?
</p>

<p>
Reality is not reached by the negative process of taking
away conventional guises and concealments; and yet modern
artists and writers have alike thought to get at truth in this
way. But the nude is not the more real for being nude.
The reality of an object depends on what is within it, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
not on anything that men put on or take away from it.
How many writers of late years have been deluding themselves
with the idea that if one can only succeed in avoiding
everything like a moral purpose, or even interesting situations,
and reveal what they call the bare facts of experience,
one may thereby attain to the real? As if ever art existed
except in the discovering of unity, the interpretation of purpose,
and in the suggesting of that which is interesting to
the human heart!
</p>

<p>
The emptiness of this kind of realism, which is as naked
of soul within as of garments without, is proved by the
reaction that is already setting in in France, where materialism
has made its boldest claims in the domain of art. Not
only in art is there a strong movement for restoring the lost
elements of romance and piety, leading to a religious severity
almost like that of the pre-Raphaelites, but in literature
there is a similar protest against the degradation of the real
to the plane of mere soulless matter. M. Paul Bourget, who
has been through all phases of French expression and knows
its extremes, gives voice to this reaction in the following
passage from his “Sensations d'Italie”:
</p>

<p>
“Sans doute, les grands peintres ont vu d'abord et avant
tout l'être vivant; mais dans cet être, ils ont dégagé la <i>race</i>
et ils ne pouvaient pas la sentir, cette race, sans démêler
l'obscur idéal qui s'agite en elle, qui végète dans les créatures
inférieures, ignoré d'elles-mêmes et cependant consubstantiel
à leur sang. La langueur et la robustesse à la fois de ce pays
de montagnes dont le pied baigne dans la fièvre, le mysticisme
des compatriotes de Saint François d'Assise et leur sauvagerie,
la mélancolie songeuse prise devant l'immobile sommeil des
lacs, tous ces traits élaborés par le travail séculaire de l'hérédité,
le Pérugin les a dégagés plus nettement qu'un autre,
mais it n'a eu qu'à les dégager. Sa divination instinctive les
a reconnus, sans peut-être qu'il s'en rendît compte, dans des
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
coupes de joues, des nuances de prunelles, des airs de tête.
C'est là, dans cette interprétation à la fois soumise et géniale,
que réside la véritable copie de la nature où tout est âme,
même et surtout la forme,—âme qui se cherche, qui se méconnaît
parfois, qui s'avilit, mais une âme tout de même et
qui ne se révèle qu'à l'âme.”<a class="tag" id="tag4" href="#note4">[4]</a>
</p>

<p>
A Frenchman of to-day become an admirer of Perugino!
</p>

<p>
A tendency to realism, unlike that of French art in subject,
but not unlike in method, is that which is exhibited in England
in the recent religious novelists of the class headed by
the authoress of “Robert Elsmere.” Here, again, the effort
has been to get at the real by stripping off conventional religious
admissions, pretensions, and errors, and depicting a
moral basis of conduct which can exist independently of creed
and church. The result has been disappointing, because a
creed incapable of perversion or corruption becomes as lifeless
and as powerless a factor in human character-building as
is the multiplication table; and without a miraculous incarnation
of Deity as its basis and its imperative authority, the
whole system of Christian ethics, when thus reduced to a
scientific conclusion or to an invention of man's individual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
moral sense, loses not only its power to influence morally,
but even to interest other minds. The “real” basis of religion
thus arrived at is found to be no religion at all, but only the
private opinion of this authoress as to what is good and
right, with every divine and therefore every universal and
obligatory element in it left out.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
I have spoken indiscriminately, above, of the realists in
our modern literature as all subject to the temptation to rest
satisfied with photographic imitations of nature rather than
with a reality created from their apprehension of its ideal
form. The end sought for is faithfulness in expression, and
the danger is that of making subordinate to this the substance
of what is expressed. But among these writers there are all
degrees of approach to the genuine realism which undoubtedly,
like the art of the Greeks, is a thing that can never
die, and which, even if for a long interval set aside, is sure
to return again to its rightful place as the only true form of
expression.
</p>

<p>
Among the various aspirants to the title of realist, we
have no more interesting examples than in our own Howells
and Whitman, both being avowed prophets of this school of
writing. In Whitman we see a generous nature run away
with by the passion of expression. His words are heaped
like sand-dunes. There is a sound of roaring waves, but
the landscape is, too often, on the whole, shapeless and
wearisome. One feels that there is meaning in the poet's
mind, but the expression is excessive, and so without form.
The delight of ultimation has become a frenzy of word-piling
or word-inventing. The disappointment is like that experienced
on seeing a piece of sculpture which reveals a bold
and vigorous design with magnificent anatomy and muscular
strength, but which has a weak line in the face. It just
falls short of being art.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
</p>

<p>
With Howells the charm of his realism lies in the subtlety
of his concealment of it. The deep moral purpose which,
like a strong, irresistible current, underlies his recent and more
serious writing, is all the more potent because it is not
“pointed”; and the reader is allowed to indulge, as if with
the author himself, in the little delusion that this is only the
ordinary superficial aspect of an every-day world which is
being described, and that things do thus merely happen as
they happen, without design or reason. So perfect is the
form and so true to nature that, with the author, we keep up,
too, the little deception, that it is with the form itself that
we are pleased, and that this constitutes the realism of which
the author is so ardent an advocate. Meanwhile we learn,
when the story is ended, that this realism was all informed
with a soul of moral and divine purpose, and that this is all
that is real in it as in anything else.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
To distinguish from the pseudo-realism of matter the
genuine realism that is soul-informed, I do not know a better
name for the latter than the Classic Realism. I mean by
this something as far remote as possible from the classic
formalism of the age of Pope and Dryden, as remote indeed
as form is from formalism. For in that period it was neither
truth to nature nor truth to the imagination that was aimed
at in expression, but rather a cold and rigid conformity to
the rules of correct writing as found in the recognized standards.
“Classic” hence got to mean merely according to
the standards. But by a Classic Realism we will certainly
understand that effort to obtain a form of expression which
recognizes both the internal and the external reality of things,
and is able to combine both in one ultimation like the soul
and body that make the one man.
</p>

<p>
The subjectivity of the Saxon mind and a large inheritance
of both the classic formalism and the romanticism of former
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
periods of English literature have prevented our English
writers from attaining that spontaneous realism which was
native to the Hellenic mind; and yet they have the gift to
recognise and interpret it when found. This did Tennyson
when he chose for translation the following lines closing the
Eighth Book of the “Iliad”:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">As when in heaven the stars about the moon</p>
<p class="i01">Look beautiful, when all the winds are laid,</p>
<p class="i01">And every height comes out, and jutting peak,</p>
<p class="i01">And valley, and the immeasurable heavens</p>
<p class="i01">Break open to their highest; and all the stars</p>
<p class="i01">Shine, and the shepherd gladdens in his heart:</p>
<p class="i01">So, many a fire between the ships and stream</p>
<p class="i01">Of Xanthus blazed before the towers of Troy,</p>
<p class="i01">A thousand on the plain: and close by each</p>
<p class="i01">Sat fifty in the blaze of burning fire;</p>
<p class="i01">And, champing golden grain, the horses stood,</p>
<p class="i01">Hard by their chariots, waiting for the dawn.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The same vision into the charmed world of the classic realism
had Keats when he wrote his sonnet “On First Looking
into Chapman's Homer,” and put a whole age of ecstatic delight
into these matchless lines:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Oft of one wide expanse had I been told</p>
<p class="i02">  That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne:</p>
<p class="i02">  Yet did I never breathe its pure serene</p>
<p class="i01">Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:</p>
<p class="i01">Then felt I like some watcher of the skies</p>
<p class="i02">  When a new planet swims into his ken;</p>
<p class="i01">Or like stout Cortez when, with eagle eyes,</p>
<p class="i02">  He stared at the Pacific—and all his men</p>
<p class="i01">Look'd at each other with a wild surmise—</p>
<p class="i02">  Silent, upon a peak in Darien.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Listen to Theocritus describing in most realistic language
the Joys of Peace. Notice how he does not so much as mention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
any emotion, but awakens it by his faithful description
of the objective world:
</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>
And oh! that they might till rich fields, and that unnumbered
sheep and fat might bleat cheerily through the plains, and that
oxen, coming in herds to the stalls, should urge on the traveller by
twilight. And oh! that the fallow lands might be broken up for
sowing, when the cicada, sitting on his tree, watches the shepherd
in the open day and chirps on the topmost spray; that spiders may
draw their fine webs over martial arms, and not even the name of
the battle-cry be heard. [Idyl XVI.]
</p>
</div>

<p>
Keats has felt the same appeal of nature to human sympathy
in all the humblest forms of life, and has expressed it
in his sonnet on the “Grasshopper and the Cricket”:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">The poetry of earth is never dead.</p>
<p class="i01">When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,</p>
<p class="i01">And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run</p>
<p class="i01">From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead:</p>
<p class="i01">That is the grasshopper's—he takes the lead</p>
<p class="i01">In summer luxury—he has never done</p>
<p class="i01">With his delights, for, when tired out with fun,</p>
<p class="i01">He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.</p>
<p class="i01">The poetry of earth is ceasing never:</p>
<p class="i01">On a lone winter evening, when the frost</p>
<p class="i01">Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills</p>
<p class="i01">The cricket's song, in warmth increasing ever,</p>
<p class="i01">And seems to one in drowsiness half lost,</p>
<p class="i01">The grasshopper's among some grassy hills.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
This is realism, but a truly classic realism; it is earth, but
the “poetry of earth.”
</p>

<p>
Probably Whitman has here and there approached as
nearly as any English writer to this pure realism, and, when
he has not allowed his delight in words to outrun his inward
conception, he has given us pictures possessing much
of the vivid objectivity of the Greek realists. Compare with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the above passage from Theocritus the Farm Picture drawn
by Whitman in these two lines:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Through the ample open door of the peaceful country barn</p>
<p class="i01">A sun-lit pasture field, with cattle and horses feeding.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Or this:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Lo, 'tis autumn.</p>
<p class="i01">Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,</p>
<p class="i01">Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages, with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind,</p>
<p class="i01">Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd vines,</p>
<p class="i01">(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?</p>
<p class="i01">Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)</p>
<p class="i01">Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with wondrous clouds,</p>
<p class="i01">Below, too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Perhaps it is because Whitman is not the literary heir of
the past, but the beginner of his line, that he enjoys this
freedom and completeness of ultimation. He could dare what
Keats, born to the purple, would fain have dared, but, in his
sonnet to Haydon, confesses his fear of attempting:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Haydon! forgive me that I cannot speak</p>
<p class="i01">Definitively of these mighty things;</p>
<p class="i01">Forgive me that I have not eagles' wings,</p>
<p class="i01">That what I want I know not where to seek.</p>
<p class="i01">And think that I would not be over meek</p>
<p class="i01">In rolling out up-followed thunderings</p>
<p class="i01">Even to the steep of Heliconian springs,</p>
<p class="i01">Were I of ample strength for such a freak.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Undoubtedly true it is that a spring-like freshness and
vigour in Whitman's poems give voice to the life of a strong
and youthful nationality; and in grateful appreciation of this
we will not stop to inquire to what extent he owes his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
present popularity to the charm of novelty. But, novel as
his style may seem, it is but the re-discovered secret of all
true art, the realism that is the ultimation of the soul.
</p>

<p>
That Goethe was a realist in this sense is shown by the
fact that where the emotion was deepest and the moral substance
of his writing the most intense and unmistakable, the
form was purely objective and classic—dealing with the
simplest and commonest of the world's every-day material,
and indulging in little or no reflection or introspection.
Such is he in the <i>Hermann und Dorothea</i>, at once the most
Teutonic and the most Hellenic of modern poems. Of this
Professor Dowden says in a recent essay:<a class="tag" id="tag5" href="#note5">[5]</a>
</p>

<p>
“Goethe never attempted to transform himself into a
Greek; on the contrary, it seemed to him essential for the
object which he had in view that he should remain a German,
since it was from the alliance of the Teutonic genius
with the genius of Greece that he hoped for the birth of the
ardent child Euphorion. And in the representative poem of
this period, <i>Hermann und Dorothea</i>, if Goethe is more than
elsewhere a Greek in the bright purity of his art and its fine
simplicity of outline, here also more than elsewhere in the
body of thought and feeling he is a German of the Germans.”
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Coming now to study Carducci as a poet who more perfectly
than any other living, perhaps, reflects the classic realism
of his Hellenic literary ancestry, I desire to emphasise
as a point of peculiar interest the fact that the religious
element which I have spoken of above as the most essential
one in all art is here not Christian, but avowedly pagan;
but that, as such, it supplies that inward essence to Carducci's
poems that gives them reality. There is all the difference
imaginable between the description of landscape in his poem
on the peninsula of Sermione <a href="#poem16">[XVI]</a> and that of our modern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
writers who think to have outgrown Christianity and see no
suggestion of supernatural presence or influence in the world
around them. Were Carducci himself a believer in the present
existence of the Gods of Greece, he could hardly have infused
a more intense life into his writing than he has done by the
continually suggested presence of the happy gods, sirens, and
nymphs of the classic mythology. Our modern poets can
use the same mythologic personages in figurative embellishment
or in allegoric allusion. In Carducci they are real presences
such as Wordsworth sighed for in his sonnet, “The
World is too much with us”:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i07">            Great God! I'd rather be</p>
<p class="i01">A pagan suckled in a creed outworn,—</p>
<p class="i01">So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,</p>
<p class="i01">Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;</p>
<p class="i01">Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;</p>
<p class="i01">Or hear old Triton blow his wreathéd horn!</p>
</div></div>

<p>
and as Keats felt when writing in his “Ode on a Grecian
Urn” these lines:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard</p>
<p class="i02">  Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on:</p>
<p class="i01">Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,</p>
<p class="i02">  Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:</p>
<p class="i02 dotted">  ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·  · · · · · · ·</p>
<p class="i01 dotted">·   ·   ·   ·   ·   ·   · · · · · · · ·</p>
<p class="i01">O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede</p>
<p class="i02">  Of marble men and maidens overwrought,</p>
<p class="i01">With forest branches and the trodden weed;</p>
<p class="i02">  Thou silent form! dost tease us out of thought</p>
<p class="i01">As doth eternity.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The same vivid realisation of the presence of the supernatural
in nature under truly pagan forms is seen in Carducci's
poem “To Aurora” <a href="#poem7">[VII]</a>:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Thou risest and kissest, O Goddess, with rosy breath the clouds,</p>
<p class="i01">Kissest the dusky pinnacles of marble temples.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
</p>

<p>
In this poem is contrasted in most realistic manner the
Greek sense of the sunlight as a divine presence, imparting
only joy to men and leading them to seek their delights
under the open sky, with the exhausting nightly dissipations
of modern life and the hatred of daylight which
recalls men to their labour:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i14">                          Ours is a wearied race:</p>
<p class="i01">Sad is thy face, O Aurora, when thou risest over our towers.</p>
<p class="i01">The dim street-lamps go out, and, not even glancing at thee,</p>
<p class="i01">A pale-faced troop go home imagining they have been happy.</p>
<p class="i01">Angrily at his door is pounding the ill-tempered labourer,</p>
<p class="i01">Cursing the dawn that only calls him back to his bondage.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Next to the emotion of the supernatural, we are struck with
the intense sympathy with nature both animate and inanimate,
which gives so lively a glow to Carducci's description. The
sonnet on “The Ox” <a href="#poem9">[IX]</a> I have referred to in the previous
essay; here I would call attention to that addressed “To a
Horse” <a href="#poem17">[XVII]</a>, which, if the former can be called Homeric,
can equally claim to be Phidian in the pure outline of the
drawing and the Olympic spirit that seems to quiver in the
poet's words:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">O that for thee might blaze the sands Elean,</p>
<p class="i01">For thee great hymns the godlike Pindar sing,</p>
<p class="i01">Following thee there upon the waves Alphaean!</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Keats proves how deeply he has imbibed the Greek poetic
spirit in his sonnet on the “Grasshopper and the Cricket”;
for here he expresses the same intense joy of communion with
a certain soul in nature which caused Theocritus to never
tire of singing, or having his Sicilian goatherds sing, of the
bees that fed the imprisoned Comatas all through the springtime,
of the Oaks that sung the dirges of the shepherd
Daphnis, of the “shegoats feeding on the hill,” of “the young
lambs pasturing on the upland fields when the spring is on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the wane,” of “the white calves browsing on the arbutus,”
of the “cicada to cicada dear,” “the prattling locusts,” and
“lizards that sleep at midday by the dry stone wall.”
</p>

<p>
With the same zest Carducci delights to sing of the
“forests awaking with a cool shiver” at the rising of Aurora,
of “the garrulous nests that mutter amid the wet leaves” in
the early dawn, of the “grey gull far off that screams over
the purple sea,” “the sorrel colt breaking away with high
lifted mane and neighing in the wind,” and “the pack of
hounds, wakeful, answering from their kennels.” What Mr.
Lang says of Theocritus may be as truly said of Carducci:
“There is nothing in Wordsworth more real, more full of
the incommunicable sense of nature.... It is as true to
nature as the statue of the native fisherman in the Vatican.”
[Introduction to <i>Theocritus</i>.] Especially are we aware of
the almost oppressive feeling of nature's languor and sweet
melancholy on reading Carducci's poems on “A Dream in
Summer” <a href="#poem18">[XVIII]</a> and “On a Saint Peter's Eve” <a href="#poem19">[XIX]</a>.
Here, indeed, the feeling is more modern than ancient, but
the mode of expressing it is the same. How like Homer is
the picture of
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">The sun across the red vapours descending,</p>
<p class="i01">And falling into the sea like a shield of brass</p>
<p class="i01">Which shines wavering over the bloody field of war,</p>
<p class="i01">Then drops and is seen no more.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
It seems like the reverse of the figure in the “Iliad,” where
the armed Diomed is described:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i03">    Forth from his helm and shield a fire-light</p>
<p class="i01">Then flashed, like autumn star that brightest shines</p>
<p class="i01">When newly risen from his ocean bath.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
And further, when we read of the swallows that
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Wove and rewove their crooked flight around the gutters,</p>
<p class="i01">While in shadows malarious the brown sparrows were chattering;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
</p>

<p>
and how there comes
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i18">                                  through the humid air</p>
<p class="i01">The song of the reapers, long, distant, mournful and wearied—</p>
</div></div>

<p>
a line which can only tell its full tale of tender sadness in the
original:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i16">                              il canto</p>
<p class="i01">de mietitori, longo, lontano, piangevole, stanco—</p>
</div></div>

<p>
how the sun looks down
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">like a cyclops heavy with wine—</p>
</div></div>

<p>
and we are then as suddenly awakened out of our delicious
reverie by the screaming of a peacock and a bat's wing grazing
our head, we know that the poetry is real not by its mere
accuracy of description, but by the feeling that it awakens as
only nature itself could awaken it.
</p>

<p>
The “Summer Dream” recalls, in the vividness and delicacy
of its landscape and tenderness of feeling, perhaps more
of Dante than of the ancient poets. There is a vision of
the mother walking with the poet's little brother by the
river bank,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">the happy mother walking in the sunlight,</p>
</div></div>

<p>
which suggests Dante's glimpse of the Countess Matilda in
the daisy-sprinkled meadow, described in the twenty-eighth
canto of the “Purgatory.” The bells of Easter-eve are telling
from a high tower that
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">on the morrow Christ would rise again.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
From the sea far below comes up the odorous breeze, while
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">on its waters four white sails rock slowly to and fro in the sun.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The poet's thoughts wander to where, in the solemn shades
of Certosa and on the flowering banks of the Arno, lie at rest
the beloved ones. But quickly, with the sudden waking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
from the nap, is dispelled the vision of the poet and with
it the modern introspective gloom; these give place to the
realism and the day-light contentment of the old time:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Lauretta's joyous song was ringing through all the chambers</p>
<p class="i01">While Bice,<a class="tag" id="tag6" href="#note6">[6]</a> bending over her frame, followed silent the work of the needle.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
There is something majestic in the moral portraiture of the
poem on “The Mother.” <a href="#poem20">[XX]</a> We seem to be looking on a
colossal bronze figure, in which are blended pure natural joy
and an instinct of the divine holiness of motherhood. The
reproach contained in the last verse belongs to the present
time of social unrest; it is hard to convey in English the full
intent of the subtle phrase:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">la giustizia pia del lavoro—.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Paul Bourget speaks, in his <i>Sensations d'Italie</i>, of the simplicity
“peculiar to the lofty style of Italian poetry introduced by
Dante, under which one feels the glorious origin of the language”;
and he quotes, as illustrating this simplicity, Carducci's
“divine sonnet” commencing:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Passa la nave mia, sola, tra il pianto.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
<a href="#poem21">[XXI]</a> On this he remarks:
</p>

<p>
“The quality of the words in which Roman vigour still
palpitates, the direct force of the image, the construction, at
once flowing and concise, of the sentence, give this poetry
the charm of precision which is the distinctive characteristic
of the genius of the Romans. It is at once sober and grand.”
Surely no better example of such writing could anywhere
be found than in the poem on “The Mother.”
</p>

<p>
With what awful severity such a style lends itself to the
exposure of the corruption and inhumanity of society, like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
a veritable Juvenal returned to hurl his satire at these modern
times, is shown in the poem on “The Carnival.” <a href="#poem22">[XXII]</a>
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Another phase of Carducci's genuine realism is the subtle
art of blending with nature, not his own personality, but that
of great souls of the past who have lived amid the scenes
described. Of this a fine example is the poem “Sermione”
mentioned above. <a href="#poem16">[XVI]</a> The peninsula so named, which
juts boldly out into the southern bay of the Lago di Garda,
the <i>Lacus Benacus</i> of the Romans, is about equidistant from
Mantua on the south, the birthplace of Virgil, and from
Verona on the east, the birthplace of Catullus. Near by is
situated one of the castles of the Scaligers, where Dante may
have had his abode when taking refuge with that family on
his banishment from Florence in 1316. At the extremity of
the promontory are still seen the relics of the villa of Catullus,
in which he is supposed to have written many of his poems,
especially the one beginning
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Peninsularum, Sirmio, insularumque</p>
<p class="i01">Ocelle.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
How endeared was the lake to the tender-hearted poet, and
how its cool and placid shores brought solace to his bosom,
rent with the passions of Rome's giddy life, Carducci tells in
the song of the Sirens—
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Come to us, Quintus Valerius!</p>
<p class="i01">Here to our grottos descend still the sunrays, but silvery, and mild as those of Cynthia.</p>
<p class="i01">Here the assiduous tumults that burden thy life but resemble the distant humming of bees.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
We feel ourselves to be listening for the poet, and would
fain with him enjoy the fresh air, the soothing calm,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">While Hesperus over the waters broadens his rosy face.</p>
<p class="i01">And the waves are lapping the shore.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
</p>

<p>
In the glimpses afforded, in this poem, of Garda lifting
her dusky shoulders over the liquid mirror,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Singing the while a saga of cities ancient and buried,</p>
<p class="i01">And their barbaric kings;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
of Catullus,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Mooring all day long to the wet rocks his pitched canoe</p>
<p class="i01">And watching in the phosphorescent waves the eyes of his Lesbia;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
of the
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">white swans swimming down through the silvery Mincio;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
and,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">from the green pastures where sleeps Bianore, the sound of Virgilius' voice;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
and of the
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">face stern and grand looking out from the tower of the Scaligers,</p>
</div></div>

<p>
centuries of literary history seem to pass before our eyes in
living procession.
</p>

<p>
Most tender of all these tributes of the poet, interweaving
the memory of his revered predecessors and masters with the
nature loved by them, and by himself for them, is the sonnet
addressed to Petrarch <a href="#poem23">[XXIII]</a>:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">If far from turbid thoughts and gloomy mood.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
It is as delicate as the odour of jessamine
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">in the green blackness of the tangled wood,</p>
</div></div>

<p>
and breathes a rich melancholy, as if,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i12">                      when day is done,</p>
<p class="i01">A nightingale from bough to bough were singing.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The sonnets addressed to the more recent poets, his fellow-countrymen,
seem mainly to have served as vents for Carducci's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
own indignation at the literary and political degeneracy
of the present time. Many of them are from among
the poet's earlier productions, and the changes which have occurred
since their writing make them seem to belong already
to a past period when perhaps more than at present his
severe reflections on his country and countrymen were
deserved. A foreigner can hardly enter into the bitterness
of vituperation which finds utterance in such poems as those
“In Santa Croce” <a href="#poem28">[XXVIII]</a>, or “The Voice of the Priests”
<a href="#poem29">[XXIX]</a>, the sonnet addressed to Vittorio Alfieri <a href="#poem25">[XXV]</a>,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">O de l'italo agon supremo atleta,</p>
</div></div>

<p>
and that to Goldoni, the “Terence of the Adria”; but all of
these, which we may call the literary sonnets, have a certain
universal value in that they reflect more than individual
feeling. Each poet addressed is identified in some way with
the nation's weal or woe; and the soul of the patriot, and
no mere dilettante admiration, is what pours forth those fervid
utterances which, in another tongue and to the ear of
strangers, will naturally often seem overwrought.
</p>

<p>
No less truly does the soul of the father speak in the beautiful
verses “On my Daughter's Marriage,” and the soul of
manly friendship in that little song “At the Table of a
Friend,” which seems as if it had dropped from the pages of
Horace like a purple grape from the cluster all odorous with
its bloom.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
Over all others in stern and majestic portraiture rise those
verses, both of the earlier and later period, in which Carducci
treats of Dante and his influence. Nowhere are we more
impressed than here with the strange fascination of that man
who
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">made things good and evil to tell their tale through him the fatal prophet;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
</p>

<p>
against whose Gothic sphere Carducci's Hellenic spirit continually
fretted and rebelled. Yet his soul is ever thrilled
(see the Sonnet on the Sixth Centenary of Dante <a href="#poem34">[XXXIV]</a>)
with awe at the reappearing of that “mighty Form,”
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">when shook the Adrian shore and all the land Italia trembled,</p>
</div></div>

<p>
which,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">                  like a morning mist</p>
<p class="i01">Did march along the Apenninian strand,</p>
<p class="i01">Glancing adown the vales on either hand,</p>
<p class="i03">    Then vanished like the dawn;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
while “in earthly hearts a fear arose, discovering the awful
presence of a God,” and there,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">where, beyond the gates, the sun is burning,</p>
<p class="i02">  The races dead, of war-like men and wise,</p>
<p class="i01">With joy saluted the great soul's returning.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The antagonism between the pagan and the Christian religious
instincts comes to light in all that Carducci writes of
his revered master. Half in anger he chides the awful singer
who
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Comes down from heaven bringing the Hymn Supreme,</p>
</div></div>

<p>
while upon his brow shines
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i12">                    a radiance divine</p>
<p class="i01">Like his who spake with God in Sinai,—</p>
</div></div>

<p>
because he cared not for
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">His poor country and the endless strife that rent its cities.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
With the splendours of the holy kingdom, amid which Dante
stood, Carducci contrasts the mortal fields of civil war and the
wastes deserted and malignant,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">whence comes the sound, dreary and dull, of dying warriors' sighs;</p>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
</p>

<p>
and yet no commentator seems to become so transformed as
Carducci into Dante's own being and manner when contemplating
and describing him. The poem on Dante, beginning
with the words <a href="#poem33">[XXXIII]</a>:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Forte sembianze di novella vita,</p>
</div></div>

<p>
recalls, in its statuesque strength and supple beauty, Michael
Angelo's “Sleeping Slave.” It breathes all through with the
spirit of the Italian Renaissance. In the narrative of Dante's
secret heart-life and soul-life it seems as if we were turning
new leaves of <i>La Vita Nova</i> rather than those of a nineteenth-century
critic. No voice but Dante's seems to speak in lines
like these, describing the first awaking of the passion of love
in the youthful poet's heart:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Sighing and pensive, yet with locks aglow</p>
<p class="i01">With rosy splendour from another air,</p>
<p class="i04">      Love made long stay:</p>
<p class="i01">And such the gentle things</p>
<p class="i01">He talked to thee with bashful lips: so sweetly</p>
<p class="i01">He entered all the chambers of thy heart</p>
<p class="i01">That no one ever knew to love like thee.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
This surely is the “intelletto d'amore” of Dante himself.
</p>

<p>
Hardly less like Dante is the picture of Beatrice in that
half-playful, half-worshipful poem on that mysterious personage
<a href="#poem35">[XXXV]</a>:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i04">      Like our Lady from heaven</p>
<p class="i04">      She passes before me,</p>
<p class="i01">An angel in seeming, and yet all so ardent</p>
<p class="i04">      My mind stopped thinking</p>
<p class="i04">      But to look at her,</p>
<p class="i01">And the soul was at rest,—but for sighing!</p>
</div></div>

<p>
How sweet and true an echo from Sonnet XXV in <i>La Vita
Nova</i>:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Tanto gentile e tanto onesta pare!</p>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
</p>

<p>
Here Carducci treats Beatrice under the favourite character of
the Idea which is to elevate mankind from its rude savagery.
As in Goethe,
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Das ewig weibliche zieht uns hinan.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Not a woman, but the Idea,</p>
<p class="i01">Am I, which heaven did offer</p>
<p class="i01">For man to study when seeking things on high.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Nevertheless, we cannot forget the satirical tone in which, in
another poem, he contrasts the ideal love of Dante with the
passion of a lower kind that found its home in the Greek
nature, and sings rather of Lalage and Lesbia than of this
“Angel in seeming.”
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
It is in his poetic power of interpretation that here, as in
the poems on nature, Carducci proves himself the true realist.
Whatever form he chooses, is for the time filled with its own
life, and speaks from that and no other. I have introduced
the “Hymn to the Redeemer” <a href="#poem11">[XI]</a>, that <i>Lauda Spirituale</i>,
which the poet describes in the passage from his autobiography
quoted in the previous essay as a youthful literary experiment,
in which he attempted to clothe the spiritual idea
of the Christ with the form of the pagan triumphal ode.
The heroic picture of the Redeemer of the world returning
from Battle as a Victor and receiving triumphal honour and
applause, is novel, and not without a high order of beauty. It
seems, indeed, to minds trained to modern religious thought,
more pagan than Christian; but one may question whether
this aspect of Christ as the Hero is not one which the Church
has erroneously overlooked in her tendency to lay stress on
the vicarious sacrifice of Christ, rather than on the actual
deliverance wrought for man by Him in His warfare against
the infernal hosts, setting the race thereby spiritually free
from bondage. Do we not see here the same attempt to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
present the Christian Redemption in ancient heroic form, as
the Pisan sculptors made when they copied from pagan sarcophagi
the figures of their apostles and saints? It was not
the conventional way; but we feel that they might have
done worse.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
A few poems from Carducci's youthful period, in which
he indulges in the meaningless melancholy, the passion and
despair, incident to that stage of the poet's growth, I have introduced,
as showing that he too had his sentimental side.
In these he describes his emotions. They are the sonnets
from the <i>Juvenilia</i>, beginning respectively with the following
lines:
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i02">  O questi di prima io la vidi. Uscia. <a href="#poem36">[XXXVI]</a></p>
<p class="i02 dotted">· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·</p>
<p class="i01">Non son quell'io che già d'amiche cene. <a href="#poem37">[XXXVII]</a></p>
<p class="i02 dotted">· · · · · · · · · · · · · · · ·</p>
<p class="i02">  Passa la nave mia, sola, tra il pianto. <a href="#poem21">[XXI]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>
As such they are beautiful, but they lack that objectivity and
realistic power which is felt in those poems where, as in life,
the emotion tells itself, and does not need to be described.
</p>

<hr class="tbs" />

<p>
In the <i>Odi Barbare</i>, for which title I am unable to find a
better rendering than “Barbaric Odes,” foreign as it may
seem to the character of these exquisitely finished verses,
I have followed the poet's choice in omitting to capitalize
the initial words of the lines. Many of these poems are
without rhyme, and, for the sake of greater faithfulness in
translating them, I have sometimes discarded both the rhyme
and the strict rhythmical form.

<p class="i01">In the midst of thy song, O Homer, with battles ever resounding,</p>
<p class="i01">the midsummer heat overcame me; my head fell asleep</p>
<p class="i01">there on Scamander's bank; but my heart fled at once,</p>
<p class="i01">as soon as set free, back again to the shore of Tyrrhenia.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">I dreamed—dreamed pleasant things of the new years coming to me,</p>
<p class="i01">of books no more! My chamber, stifled with the heat of the July sun,</p>
<p class="i01">and noisy with the endless rolling of carriages in the streets,</p>
<p class="i01">opened wide. I dreamed myself among my hills,—</p>
<p class="i01">the dear forest hills which an April-time youth was reflowering.</p>
<p class="i01">A stream gushed down the hillside, widening into a brook</p>
<p class="i01">with murmuring cool, and along the brook wandered my mother,</p>
<p class="i01">still in the flower of her youth, and leading a child by the hand.</p>
<p class="i01"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span></p>
<p class="i01">On his bare white shoulder lay shining his golden curls.</p>
<p class="i01">He walked with a childish step, but stately, too,</p>
<p class="i01">proud of the mother's love, and thrilled to the heart</p>
<p class="i01">with the great gladness of that Festival</p>
<p class="i01">which everywhere sweet Nature was intoning.</p>
<p class="i01">For high up in yon tower the bells were telling</p>
<p class="i01">that on the morrow Christ would rise again!</p>
<p class="i01">And over the hills and vales, through air and boughs and streams,</p>
<p class="i01">flowed everywhere the great Hymn of the Spring.</p>
<p class="i01">The apple-trees and the peach-trees were blossoming white and red,</p>
<p class="i01">underneath laughed the meadow with yellow flowers and blue;</p>
<p class="i01">the red trefoil was clambering up to cover the sloping fields,</p>
<p class="i01">and beyond the hills lay veiled in the glow of the golden broom.</p>
<p class="i01">From the sea below came up an odorous breeze;</p>
<p class="i01">on its waters four white sails rocked slowly to and fro in the sun,</p>
<p class="i01">whose dazzling rays were quivering over sea and land and sky.</p>
<p class="i01">I watched the happy mother walking in the sunlight;</p>
<p class="i01">I watched the mother: thoughtful I watched my brother,</p>
<p class="i01">him who now lies at rest on the flowering banks of the Arno,</p>
<p class="i01">while she is sleeping alone in the solemn shade of Certosa.</p>
<p class="i01"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span></p>
<p class="i01">Thoughtful I gazed, and wondered if still they live,</p>
<p class="i01">and, mindful of my grief, come back from where</p>
<p class="i01">their happy years glide on 'mid forms well known.</p>
<p class="i01">So passed the vision blessed; quick with my nap it went—</p>

<p class="i01">Lauretta's joyous song was ringing through all the chambers,</p>

<p class="i01">the song of the reapers, long, distant, mournful, and wearied?</p>

<p class="i01">Strong forms were those of the New Life, that stood</p>

<p class="i01">O Master of the song that looks above!</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">A brave young giantess,</p>
<p class="i01">Unknown before to Greek or Latin shores,</p>
<p class="i01">Daring in love and hate, and fair withal,</p>
<p class="i02">  Came Tuscan Libertade, and the child</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">And all a-glowing with her spheral rays,</p>
<p class="i02">  Mild and austere in one,</p>
<p class="i01">Came Faith: and she, across a shore</p>
<p class="i01">Obscure with crowds of visions and of shades,</p>
<p class="i01">Opened for thee the Gate of the Infinite.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Sighing and pensive, yet with locks aglow</p>
<p class="i01">With rosy splendour from another air,</p>

<p class="i02">  And such the gentle things</p>
<p class="i01"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>
<p class="i01">He talked to thee with bashful lips, so sweetly</p>
<p class="i01">He entered all the chambers of thy heart,</p>
<p class="i01">That no one ever knew to love like thee.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">But soon away from lonely meditating,</p>
<p class="i02">  O youthful recluse,</p>
<p class="i01">Wild clamour and fierce tumult tore thee, and</p>
<p class="i01">The fury of brothers seeking brothers' blood.</p>
<p class="i01">Thou heard'st the hissing flames of civil war</p>
<p class="i01">On neighbour's walls; thou heardest women shriek</p>
<p class="i01">To heaven that altars and the marriage bed,</p>
<p class="i01">The dear hearth-stone and the infant's cradle,—</p>
<p class="i01">All that made fair the marital abode,</p>
<p class="i01">Were swept away in one great gulf of flame.</p>
<p class="i01">Their men had rushed from their embrace to arms;</p>
<p class="i01">The youth breathed only anger and destruction.</p>
<p class="i01">Thou sawest the raging of swords</p>
<p class="i01">Seeking the breast-plunge;</p>
<p class="i01">Thou heardest the dying warrior</p>
<p class="i01">Blaspheme and curse:</p>
<p class="i01">Before thee, streaming with gore,</p>
<p class="i01">Gold locks and grey;</p>
<p class="i01">And the Furies offering</p>
<p class="i01">To Liberty the execrated host</p>
<p class="i01">Of human victims;</p>
<p class="i01">And Death, the cruel arbiter of fates,</p>

<p class="i01">The long-barred gates.</p>
<p class="i01"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>
<p class="i01">Amid wild scenes</p>
<p class="i01">So grew thy Italian soul,</p>
<p class="i01">And prayed that the long civil hate might end.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Meanwhile he saw</p>
<p class="i01">Of love such pure revealings and so strange,</p>
<p class="i01">The which depicted in the shade</p>
<p class="i01">Of a young myrtle-tree,</p>
<p class="i01">Each one who saw must bow the head in reverence.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">But o'er this gentle dream</p>
<p class="i01">There came the voice of weeping,</p>
<p class="i01">Bitterly sounding from the maternal source.</p>
<p class="i01">Alas! broken by the whirlwind,</p>
<p class="i01">Lies the fair myrtle,</p>
<p class="i01">And with wide-spread wings</p>
<p class="i01">The dove of sweet affection is flown forth</p>
<p class="i01">To seek a purer aura for its flight.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">He, driven here and there</p>
<p class="i01">In the thick darkness of the turbulent age,</p>
<p class="i01">Sought refuge with the famous shades of old;</p>
<p class="i01">So learned to hate himself and present things.</p>
<p class="i01">And in the twilight came he forth a giant,</p>
<p class="i01">Seeming a shade himself—an angry shade</p>
<p class="i01">Who through the desert went from tomb to tomb,</p>
<p class="i01">Now questioning and now embracing them:</p>
<p class="i01">Until before him rose across the ruin</p>
<p class="i01">And dust of these barbaric ages gone,</p>
<p class="i01"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span></p>
<p class="i01">Like a cloudy pillar, the ancient Latin valour.</p>
<p class="i01">Then all that such a ruin tells did burst</p>
<p class="i01">Upon the silent air in one great cry.</p>
<p class="i01">In the exalted vision</p>
<p class="i01">Arose the poet divine; and now, disdaining</p>
<p class="i01">His stricken land and time that only wasted</p>
<p class="i01">In petty aimless strife the ancient strength,</p>
<p class="i01">He, in the seeing of his heart's desire,</p>
<p class="i01">Saluted thee, O modern Italy,—</p>
<p class="i01">One, in thy valiant arms, thy laws, thy speech.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">And then, to truly tell</p>
<p class="i01">What such a vision meant, he sought to know</p>
<p class="i01">The life that rolls through all the sea of being.</p>
<p class="i01">From beneath the dust of buried centuries</p>
<p class="i01">He made things good and ill to tell their tale</p>
<p class="i01">Through him the fatal prophet: till his voice</p>
<p class="i01">Resounded through the world, and made the ages</p>
<p class="i01">Turn and behold themselves. Judge and lord,</p>
<p class="i01">He placed them where they could themselves behold,</p>
<p class="i01">Admired and wept, disdained and laughed at them;</p>
<p class="i01">Then shut them up in his eternal song,</p>
<p class="i01">Well pleased that he had power to do this much.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">And meanwhile this poor tangle</p>
<p class="i01">Where the weeping and the wailing still goes on,</p>
<p class="i01">This endless fraud and shadow</p>
<p class="i01">Which has the name of life and is so base,—</p>
<p class="i01">All this didst thou despise! Thy sacred muse</p>
<p class="i01"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>
<p class="i01">Explored the depths of all the universe.</p>
<p class="i01">Following the good gentile Philosopher</p>
<p class="i01">Who placed thee in the midst of secret things,</p>
<p class="i01">Thou didst desire to see as angels see</p>
<p class="i01">There where there is no intervening veil;</p>
<p class="i01">And thou wouldst love as they do love in heaven.</p>
<p class="i01">Up through the ways of love</p>
<p class="i01">The humble creature</p>
<p class="i01">Pushing his way to the Creator's presence,</p>
<p class="i01">Wished to find rest in that eternal Truth</p>
<p class="i01">Which taught thee the great love and the great thought.</p>
<p class="i01">Here Virgil failed thee,</p>
<p class="i01">And thou, deserted,</p>
<p class="i01">A lonely human spirit as if drowned</p>
<p class="i01">Within the abyss of thy immense desire,</p>
<p class="i01">Didst vanish overwhelmed in doubt,—</p>
<p class="i12">                    When as on wings</p>
<p class="i01">Angelical there came unto thy grief</p>
<p class="i01">She who is love and light and vision</p>
<p class="i01">Between the understanding and the True.</p>
<p class="i01">No mortal tongue like mine may give her name,</p>
<p class="i01">But thou who lovedst didst call her Beatrice.</p>
<p class="i01">And so from sphere to sphere</p>
<p class="i01">'T was naught but melody that thou didst hear,</p>
<p class="i01">'T was naught but one great light that thou didst see,</p>
<p class="i01">And every single sense thou hadst was love,</p>
<p class="i01">And verse and spirit made one harmony</p>
<p class="i01">Like unto her who there revealed herself.</p>
<p class="i01"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span></p>
<p class="i01">Alas! what caredst thou then</p>
<p class="i01">For thy poor country and the endless strife</p>
<p class="i01">That rent its cities like, alas! even those</p>
<p class="i01">That make forever dark the vales of hell!</p>
<p class="i01">From heaven descending thou didst thrice bring down</p>
<p class="i01">The Hymn Supreme, and all the while there shone</p>
<p class="i01">Upon thy brow a radiance divine</p>
<p class="i01">Like his who spake with God in Sinai.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i01">Before thee shining</p>

she had nowhere less devoted subjects than in Italy. Proud as the Italians

The poems of Carducci have been published for the most part in the following

2, <i>Levia Gravia</i>, written between the years 1857 and 1870, and 3, <i>Decennali</i>,

without disengaging the vague ideal which struggles in it, which exists even in
inferior creatures, unknown to themselves and yet consubstantial with their
blood. The languor and, at the same time, the strength of this land of mountains,
whose feet are bathed by the waters of fever-breeding marshes, the
mysticism and the wildness of the compatriots of St. Francis of Assisi, the
dreamy melancholy inspired by the contemplation of sleeping lakes—all those
traits, elaborated by the working of heredity through centuries, Perugino saw
more clearly than any one else, but he had only to detect them. He divined
them instinctively in the outline of the cheek, the colour of the eye, the turn
of the head. It is in this interpretation, at once humble and sympathetic,
that the veritable imitation of nature consists, in which all is soul, even, and
above all the form—a soul which seeks itself, disguises itself at times and
even debases itself, but a soul nevertheless and one that reveals itself only to
the soul.”</p>

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
