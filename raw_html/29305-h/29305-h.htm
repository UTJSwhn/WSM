	<h2>SIELANKA.<br />
		<em class="subtitle">An Idyll.</em></h2>

	<p>In the woods, in the deep woods, was
	an open glade in which stood the house of
	the forester Stephan. The house was
	built of logs packed with moss, and the
	roof was thatched with straw; hard by
	the house stood two outbuildings; in
	front of it was a piece of fenced-in ground,
	and an old well with a long, crooked sweep;
	the water in the well was covered with a
	green vegetation at the edges.</p>

	<p>Opposite the windows grew sunflowers
	and wild hollyhocks, high, stately, and
	covered with blossoms as if with a swarm
	of gorgeous butterflies; between the sunflowers
	there peeped the red heads of the
	poppy; around the hollyhocks entwined
	<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>sweet peas with pink blossoms and morning-glories;
	close to the ground grew
	nasturtiums, marigolds, primroses, and
	asters, pale because they were shaded from
	the sunlight by the leaves of the hollyhocks
	and sunflowers.</p>

	<p>The fenced ground on either side of the
	pathway leading to the house was planted
	with vegetables—carrots, beets, and cabbage;
	further off in a separate fenced-in
	lot there waved with each breath of wind
	the tender blue flower of the flax; still beyond
	could be seen the dark green of the
	potato patch; the rest of the clearing was
	checkered with the variegated shades of
	the different cereals that ran to the edge
	of the lake which touched the glade on
	one side.</p>

	<p>Near to the house a few trees were
	growing. Some were cherry trees, and
	one was a birch, with long, slender
	branches which swayed in the wind, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>with every breeze its leaves touched the
	dilapidated moss-covered straw thatch of
	the roof; when the stronger gusts of wind
	bent its boughs to the wall, and pressed
	its twigs and the waves of leaves against
	the roof, it would seem as if the tree loved
	the house and embraced it.</p>

	<p>In this tree the sparrows made their
	home; the rustling of the leaves and twigs
	commingled with the chirp and joyous
	noise of the birds; in the eaves of the
	house the doves had built their nests, and
	the place was filled with their speech,
	cooing and calling to each other, entreating
	and discussing as is customary between
	doves, these noisy and talkative people.</p>

	<p>At times it happened that they were
	startled by some unknown cause; then
	around the house was heard a loud flapping,
	the air was filled with the whirl of
	wings and a multitude of white-feathered
	breasts; you could hear tumult, noise and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>excited cries—the whole flock flew out
	suddenly, circled round the house, now
	near, now far off. Sometimes they melted
	in the blue, sometimes their white feathers
	reflected the sunlight, again they hung
	over the house, undulating in the air, and
	alighting at last like a downfall of snowflakes
	on the gray straw of the roof.</p>

	<p>If this occurred in the rosy morning or
	in the splendor of the red setting sun,
	then in the glory of the air these doves
	were not white, but tinted pink, and
	settled on the roof and birch tree as flames
	or scattered rose leaves.</p>

	<p>At twilight, when the sun had hidden
	itself beyond the woods, this cooing under
	the roof and chirping in the birch tree
	became gradually quiet. The sparrows
	and the doves shook the dew from their
	wings and prepared to sleep; sometimes
	one of them gave voice once more, but
	more rarely, more softly, more drowsily,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>and then all was silent—the dusk was falling
	from the heavens upon the earth.
	The house, cherry trees, and birch were
	losing their form, mingling together,
	melting, and veiled in a mist which rose
	from the lake.</p>

	<p>Around the glade, as far as the eye
	could reach, there stretched the wall of
	dark pine trees and thick undergrowth.
	This wall was broken in one place by a
	wide dividing line, which reached to the
	edge of the lake. The lake was a very
	large one, the opposite side was nearly
	lost to view, and in the mist could be
	hardly discerned the red roof and steeple
	of a church, and the black line of the
	woods closing the horizon beyond the
	church.</p>

	<p>The pines were looking from the high
	sandy banks upon their reflection in the
	lake as if in a mirror, and it seemed as if
	there was another forest in the water; and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>when the trees were swaying on the earth
	they were also swaying in the water, and
	when they quivered on the earth they
	seemed to quiver in the water; as they
	stood in the still air motionless, then
	every needle of the pines was painted distinctly
	on the smooth, unruffled surface,
	and the straight trunks of the trees standing
	like rows of pillars reaching afar off
	into infinity. In the middle of the lake
	the water in the daytime reflected the
	sun, and in the morning and the evening
	the glories of its rising and its setting; at
	night the moon and stars; and it seemed
	to be as deep as the dome of the sky
	above us is high, beyond the sun, moon,
	and stars.</p>

	<p>In the house dwelt the forester, named
	Stephan, and his daughter, Kasya, a
	maiden of sixteen. Kasya was the light
	of the household, as bright and fresh as
	the morning. She was brought up in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>great innocence and in the fear of God.
	Her uncle, who was now dead, and who was
	a poor but devout man, the organist of the
	neighboring church, had taught her to
	read her prayer book, and her education
	was perfected by her communing with
	nature. The bees taught her to work,
	the doves taught her purity, the happy
	sparrows to speak joyfully to her father,
	the quiet water taught her peace, the
	serenity of the sky taught her contemplation,
	the matin-bell of the distant church
	called her to devotion, and the universal
	good in all nature, which reflected the
	love of God, sank deep into her soul.</p>

	<p>Therefore the father and Kasya led a
	peaceful and happy life, surrounded by
	the silence and solitude of the woods.</p>

	<p>One noon, before Ascension Day,
	Stephan came home to his dinner. He
	had visited a large tract of the forest, so
	he arrived weary, having returned through
	<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>the thickets of the swamp. Kasya placed
	the dinner on the table, and after they
	had finished and she had fed the dog and
	washed the dishes, she said:</p>

	<p>“Papa.”</p>

	<p>“What is it?”</p>

	<p>“I shall go into the woods.”</p>

	<p>“Go, go,” adding jestingly, “and let
	some wolf or wild beast devour you.”</p>

	<p>“I shall go and gather herbs. To-morrow
	is Ascension Day and they will be
	needed in the church.”</p>

	<p>“If so, you can go.”</p>

	<p>She covered her head with a yellow
	kerchief embroidered with blue flowers,
	and looking for her basket she began
	singing:</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <p>“The falcon came flying, the falcon came grey.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The old man began to grumble: “If
	you were as fond of working as you are of
	singing.”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>Kasya, who was standing on her tiptoes
	to look on a shelf, turned her head to
	her father, laughed merrily, and showing
	her white teeth, sang again as if to tease
	him:</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <p>“He hoots in the woods and the cuckoo’s his prey.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>“You would be glad yourself to be a
	cuckoo until a falcon came,” said the old
	man. “Perhaps ’tis falcon who is at the
	turpentine works? but this is folly. You
	can’t earn a piece of bread by singing.”</p>

	<p>Kasya again sang:</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <p>“Hoot not thou, my falcon, unhappy thy quest, <br />
	    In the depths of the lake thy cuckoo doth rest.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Then she said:</p>

	<p>“Wilt thou decorate the room with the
	evergreens for to-morrow? I shall return
	in time to milk the cows, but they should
	be brought from the pasture.”</p>

	<p>She found her basket, kissed her father,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>and went out. Old Stephan got his unfinished
	fishing-net, and seated himself
	on a bench outside the door. He gathered
	his twine, and half-closing one eye
	he tried to thread his netting needle; after
	several attempts he succeeded and began
	to work.</p>

	<p>From time to time he watched Kasya.
	She was walking on the left side of the
	lake; against the background of the sandy
	banks she stood out in relief as if in a
	picture. Her white waist and red striped
	skirt and yellow kerchief glistened in the
	sunlight like a variegated flower. Though
	it was spring the heat was unbearable.
	After she had gone about half a mile she
	turned aside and disappeared into the
	woods. The afternoon hours were hot in
	the sun, but in the shade of the trees it
	was quite cool. Kasya pressed forward,
	suddenly stopped, smiled, and blushed like
	a rose.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>In front of her in the pathway stood a
	youth about eighteen years of age.</p>

	<p>This youth was the turpentine worker,
	from the edge of the woods, who was now
	on his way to visit Stephan.</p>

	<p>“The Lord be praised!” said he.</p>

	<p>“Forever and ever,” answered she, and
	in her confusion she covered her face with
	her apron, peeping shyly out of a corner
	of it and smiling at her companion.</p>

	<p>“Kasya,” said he.</p>

	<p>“What is it, John?”</p>

	<p>“Is your father at home?”</p>

	<p>“He is.”</p>

	<p>The turpentine worker, poor fellow,
	perhaps desired to speak of something
	else beside the father, but somehow he
	was frightened and unconsciously inquired
	for him; then he became silent and waited
	for Kasya to speak to him first. She
	stood confused, twisting the corners of
	her apron.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>At last she spoke.</p>

	<p>“John?”</p>

	<p>“What is it, Kasya?”</p>

	<p>“Does the turpentine works smoke to-day?”
	She also wished to speak of something
	else.</p>

	<p>“Why should it not? The turpentine
	works never stop. I left lame Frank
	there; but dost thou wish to go there?”</p>

	<p>“No, I go to gather plants.”</p>

	<p>“I will go with thee, and on our return,
	if thou dost not chase me away, I
	will come to thy house.”</p>

	<p>“Why should I chase thee away?”</p>

	<p>“If thou dost like me thou wilt not
	chase me away, and if thou dost not, then
	thou wilt. Tell me, Kasya, dost thou like
	me?”</p>

	<p>“Fate, my fate,” and Kasya covered her
	face with her hands. “What can I say
	to thee? I like thee, John, very much I
	like thee,” she whispered faintly.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>Then before he could reply she uncovered
	her blushing face and cried out,
	“Let us go and gather plants; let us
	hurry.”</p>

	<p>And so went they, John and Kasya.
	The radiance of love surrounded them,
	but these simple children of nature dared
	not speak of it. They felt it, although
	they knew not what they felt; they were
	embarrassed but happy. Never before
	had the forest sung so wonderfully over
	their heads, never was the wind so sweet
	and caressing, never at any time had the
	noises of the forest, the rustling of the
	breeze in the trees, the voices of the birds,
	the echoes of the woods, seemed to merge
	into such an angelic choir, so sweet and
	grand, as at this moment, full of unconscious
	happiness.</p>

	<p>Oh, holy power of love! how good an
	angel of light thou art, how rosy an
	<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>aureole in the dusk, how bright a rainbow
	on the cloud of human tears!</p>

	<p>Meanwhile, in the woods resounded
	echoes from pine to pine, the barking of
	the dog, Burek, who had escaped from
	the house and ran on the pathway after
	Kasya. He came panting heavily, and
	with great joy he jumped with his big
	paws on Kasya and John, and looked from
	one to the other with his wise and mild
	eyes, as if wishing to say:</p>

	<p>“I see that you love one another; this
	is good.”</p>

	<p>He wagged his tail and ran quickly
	ahead of them, then circled round to them,
	then stopped, barked once more with joy,
	and rushed into the woods, looking back
	from time to time on the boy and girl.</p>

	<p>Kasya put her hand to her forehead,
	and looking upward upon the bright sun
	between the leaves she said:</p>

	<p>“Just think, the sun is two hours beyond
	<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>noontime and we have not yet gathered
	any plants. Go thou, John, to the
	left side and I shall go the right, and let
	us begin. We should hasten, for the dear
	Lord’s sake.”</p>

	<p>They separated and went into the woods,
	but not far from one another and in a
	parallel direction, so that they could see
	each other. Among the ferns between
	the pine trees could be seen fluttering the
	vari-colored skirt and yellow kerchief of
	Kasya. The slender, supple maiden
	seemed to float amid the berry-laden
	bushes, mosses and ferns. You would
	say it was some fairy <em>wila</em> or <em>rusalka</em> of
	the woods; every moment she stooped and
	stood erect again, and so, further and
	further, passing the pine trees, she entered
	deeper into the forest as some
	spritely nymph.</p>

	<p>Sometimes the thick growth of young
	hemlocks and cedars would conceal her
	<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>from view, then John stopped, and putting
	his hand to his mouth would shout,
	“Halloo! Halloo!”</p>

	<p>Kasya heard it; she stopped with a
	smile, and pretending that she did not
	see him, answered in a high, silvery
	voice:</p>

	<p>“John!”</p>

	<p>The echo answers:</p>

	<p>“John! John!”</p>

	<p>Meanwhile Burek had espied a squirrel
	up a tree, and, standing before it looking
	upward, barked. The squirrel sitting on
	a branch covered herself with her tail in a
	mocking manner, lifted her forepaws to
	her mouth and rubbed her nose, seemed
	to play with her forefingers, make grimaces,
	and laugh at the anger of Burek.
	Kasya, seeing it, laughed with a resounding,
	silvery tone, and so did John, and so
	the woods were filled with the sound of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>human voices, echoes, laughter and sunny
	joy.</p>

	<p>Sometimes there was a deep silence, and
	then the woods seemed to speak; the
	breeze struck the fronds of the ferns,
	which emitted a sharp sound; the trunks
	of the pines swayed and creaked, and
	there was silence again.</p>

	<p>Then could be heard the measured
	strokes of the woodpecker. It seemed as
	if some one kept knock—knocking at a
	door, and you could even expect that
	some mysterious voice would ask:</p>

	<p>“Who is there?”</p>

	<p>Again, the wood thrush was whistling
	with a sweet voice; the golden-crowned
	hammer plumed his feathers. In the
	thicket the pheasants clucked and the
	bright green humming birds flitted between
	the leaves; sometimes on the top of
	the pine tree a crow, hiding itself from
	<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>the heat of the sun, lazily flapped its
	wings.</p>

	<p>On this afternoon the weather was most
	clear, the sky was cloudless, and above the
	green canopy of the leaves there spread
	out the blue dome of the heavens—immense,
	limitless, transparently gray-tinted
	on the sides and deep blue above. In the
	sky stood the great golden sun; the space
	was flooded with light; the air was bright
	and serene, and far-off objects stood out
	distinctly, their forms clearly defined.
	From the height of heaven the eye of the
	great Creator embraced the whole earth;
	in the fields the grain bowed to Him with
	a golden wave, rustled the heavy heads of
	the wheat, and the delicate tasseled oats
	trembled like a cluster of tiny bells. In
	the air, filled with brightness here and
	there, floated the spring thread of the
	spider’s web, blue from the azure of the
	sky and golden from the sun, as if a veritable
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>thread from the loom of the Mother
	of God.</p>

	<p>In the vales between the fields of the
	waving grain stood dark-green meadows;
	here and there were crystal springs, around
	whose edges the grass was greener still;
	the whole meadows were sprinkled with
	yellow buttercups and dandelions which
	struck the eye with a profusion of golden
	brightness. In the wet places there thrived
	cypress trees, which had an air of coldness
	and moisture.</p>

	<p>In the woods among the pine trees there
	were now both heat and silence. It seemed
	as if a dreamy stillness enveloped the
	whole world. Not a breath of wind stirred;
	the trees, grain, and grass were motionless.
	The leaves hung on the trees as if
	rocked to sleep; the birds had ceased their
	noises, and the moment of rest had come.
	But this rest seemed to come from an ineffable
	sweetness, and all nature seemed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"> </a>to meditate. Only the great expanse of
	heaven seemed to smile, and somewhere,
	high in the unknowable depths of its blue,
	the great and beneficent God was glad
	with the gladness of the fields, the woods,
	the meadows, and the waters.</p>

	<p>Kasya and John were still busy in the
	woods collecting herbs, laughing gleefully
	and speaking to each other joyfully. Man
	is as artless as a bird; he will sing when
	he can, for this is his nature. John now
	began to sing a simple and touching song.</p>

	<p>As Kasya and John sang in unison the
	last refrain of the song ended mournfully,
	and as if in accompaniment the echo repeated
	it in the dark depths of the woods;
	the pines gave resonance as the words
	ran between their trunks and died away in
	the far distance like a sigh, less distinct,
	light, ethereal; then silence.</p>

	<p>Later Kasya sang a more cheerful song,
	beginning with the words:</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <p><a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>“I shall become a ring of gold now.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>This is a good song. A willful young
	girl quarrels with her lover and enumerates
	the means she intends to use to escape
	from him. But it is useless. When she
	says that she will be a golden ring and
	will roll away on the road, he says that he
	will quickly see and recover her. When
	she wants to be a golden fish in the water
	he sings to her of the silken net; when
	she wants to be a wild fowl on the lake he
	appears before her as a hunter. At last
	the poor maiden, seeing she is unable to
	hide herself from him on the earth,
	sings:</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <p>“I shall become a star in heaven, <br />
	    Light to earth by will be given. <br />
	    My love to thee I shall not render, <br />
	    Nor my sweet will to thee surrender.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>But the undaunted youth answers:</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <p><a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>“Then shall I pray to the saint’s grace <br />
	    That the star may fall from its heavenly place. <br />
	    Thy love to me thou then wilt render, <br />
	    And thy sweet will to me surrender.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The maiden, seeing there is no refuge
	either in heaven or on earth for her,
	accepts the view of Providence and sings:</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <p>“I see, I see, fate’s decree doth bind me; <br />
	    Where’er I hide, thou sure wilt find me. <br />
	    My love to thee I must now render, <br />
	    And my sweet will to thee surrender.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>John, turning to Kasya, said:</p>

	<p>“Do you understand?”</p>

	<p>“What, John?”</p>

	<p>He began to sing:</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <p>“Thy love to me thou must now render, <br />
	    And thy sweet will to me surrender.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Kasya was troubled, and laughed loudly
	to cover her confusion; and wishing to
	speak, she said:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>“I have gathered a large lot of plants;
	it would be well to dip them in water, for
	in this heat they will wither.”</p>

	<p>Verily the heat was great; the wind had
	entirely ceased. In the woods, though in
	the shade, the air vibrated with moist
	heat, the pines exuding a strong, resinous
	odor. The delicate, golden-tinted
	face of Kasya was touched with perspiration,
	and her blue eyes showed traces of
	weariness. She removed the kerchief
	from her head, and began to fan herself.
	John, taking the basket from her, said:</p>

	<p>“Here, Kasya, stand two aspen trees,
	and between them a spring. Come, let us
	drink.”</p>

	<p>Both went. After a short interval they
	noticed that the ground of the forest
	began to slope here. Among the trees,
	instead of bushes, ferns and dry mosses,
	there was a green, damp turf, then one
	aspen tree, then another, and after them
	<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>whole rows. They entered into this dark,
	humid retreat, where the rays of the sun,
	passing through the leaves, took on their
	color and reflected on the human face a
	pale green light. John and Kasya descended
	lower and lower into the shadows
	and dampness; a chilliness breathed upon
	them, refreshing after the heat of the
	woods; and in a moment, between the
	rows of the aspen trees, they espied in
	the black turf a deep stream of water
	winding its way under and through canes
	and bushy thickets, and interspersed
	with the large, round leaves of the water-lilies,
	which we call “<em>nenufars</em>,” and by
	the peasants are called “white flowers.”</p>

	<p>Beautiful was this spot, quiet, secluded,
	shady, even somewhat sombre and solemn.
	The transparent stream of water wound
	its way between the trees. The <em>nenufars</em>,
	touched by the light movement of the
	water, swayed gently backward and forward,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>leaning toward each other as if kissing.
	Above their broad leaves, lying like
	shields on the surface of the water,
	swarmed indigo-colored insects with wide,
	translucent, sibilant wings, so delicate and
	fragile that they are justly called water-sprites.
	Black butterflies, with white-edged,
	mournful wings, rested on the
	sharp, slender tops of the tamarack. On
	the dark turf blossomed blue forget-me-nots.
	On the edge of the stream grew
	some alder trees, and under the bushes
	peeped out heads of the lily-of-the-valley,
	bluebells and honeysuckles. The
	white heads of the <em>biedrzenica</em> hung over
	the waters; the silvery threads of the
	<em>strojka</em> spread out upon the current of
	the stream and weaved themselves into
	thin and long strands; besides—seclusion—a
	wild spot, forgotten by men, peaceful,
	peopled only with the world of birds,
	flowers and insects.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>In such places generally dwell nymphs,
	<em>rusalki</em>, and other bad or good forest
	sprites. Kasya, who was in advance,
	stood first on the banks of the stream and
	looked upon the water in which was reflected
	her graceful form. She verily appeared
	as one of those beautiful forest
	spirits as they are seen sometimes by the
	woodsmen or lumber men who float on
	their rafts down the rivers through the
	woods. She had no covering upon her
	head, and the wind gently played with
	her locks and ruffled her ray-like hair.
	Sunburned she was, blond-haired, and
	her eyes, as blue as turquoise, were as
	laughing as her lips. Besides, she was
	a divinely tall, slender, and fairy-like
	maiden. No one could swear, if she was
	suddenly startled, that she would not jump
	into the water—would not dissolve into
	mist—into rainbow rays—would not turn
	quickly into a water-lily or <em>kalina</em> tree,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>which, when robbed of its flowers, remonstrates
	with a voice so human, yet recalling
	the sigh of the forest:</p>

	<p>“Don’t touch me.”</p>

	<p>Kasya, bending over the water so that
	her tresses fell on her shoulders, turned
	toward John and said:</p>

	<p>“How shall we drink?”</p>

	<p>“As birds,” answered John, pointing
	to some silver pheasants on the opposite
	side of the stream.</p>

	<p>John, who knew how to help himself
	better than the birds, plucked a large leaf
	from a tree, and, making a funnel out of
	it, filled it with water and gave it to
	Kasya.</p>

	<p>They both drank, then Kasya gathered
	some forget-me-nots, and John with his
	knife made a flute from the willow bark,
	on which, when he had finished, he began
	to play the air which the shepherds play
	in the eventide on the meadows. The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>soft notes floated away with ineffable tenderness
	in this secluded spot. Shortly
	he removed the flute and listened intently
	as if to catch an echo returning from the
	aspen trees, and it seemed that the clear
	stream, the dark aspen trees, and the birds
	hidden in the canes listened to these notes
	with him.</p>

	<p>All became silent, but shortly, as if in
	answer—as if a challenge—came the first
	faint note of the nightingale, followed by
	a stronger trill. The nightingale wanted
	to sing—it challenged the flute.</p>

	<p>Now he began to sing. All nature was
	listening to this divine singer. The lilies
	lifted their heads above the water; the
	forget-me-nots pressed closer together; the
	canes ceased to rustle; no bird dared to
	peep except an unwise and absent-minded
	cuckoo, who with her silent wing alighted
	near by on a dry bough, lifted her head,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>widely opened her beak, and foolishly
	called aloud:</p>

	<p>“Cuckoo! cuckoo!”</p>

	<p>Afterward it seemed as if she was
	ashamed of her outbreak, and she quietly
	subsided.</p>

	<p>Vainly Kasya, who stood on the edge of
	the stream with the forget-me-nots in her
	hand, turned to the side from whence
	came the voice of the cuckoo and queried:</p>

	<p>“Cuckoo, blue-gray cuckoo, how long
	shall I live?”</p>

	<p>The cuckoo answered not.</p>

	<p>“Cuckoo, shall I be rich?”</p>

	<p>The cuckoo was silent.</p>

	<p>Then John: “Cuckoo, gray cuckoo,
	how soon will I wed?”</p>

	<p>The cuckoo replied not.</p>

	<p>“She cares not to answer us,” said
	John; “let us return to the forest.”</p>

	<p>On returning they found the large stone
	by which they had placed the basket and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>bunches of herbs. Kasya, seating herself
	beside it, began to weave garlands, and
	John helped her. Burek lay near them,
	stretched his hairy forepaws, lolled out his
	tongue and breathed heavily from fatigue,
	looking carefully around to see if he could
	not spy some living thing to chase and
	enjoy his own noise. But everything in
	the woods was quiet. The sun was traveling
	toward the west, and through the
	leaves and the needles of the pines shot
	his rays, becoming more and more red,
	covering the ground of the woods in places
	with great golden circles. The air was
	dry; in the west were spreading great
	shafts of golden light, which flooded all
	like an ocean of molten gold and amber.
	The wondrous beauties of the peaceful,
	warm spring evening were glowing in the
	sky. In the woods the daily work was
	gradually ceasing. The noise of the woodpecker
	had stopped; black and bronzed
	<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>ants returned in rows to their hills, which
	were red in the rays of the setting sun.
	Some carried in their mouths pine needles
	and some insects. Among the herbs here
	and there circled small forest bees, humming
	joyfully as they completed their last
	load of the sweet flower-dust. From the
	fissures in the bark of the trees came
	gloomy and blind millers; in the streams
	of the golden light circled swarms of midgets
	and gnats scarcely visible to the eye;
	mosquitoes began their mournful song.
	On the trees the birds were choosing their
	places for the night; a yellow bird was
	softly whistling; the crows flapped their
	wings, crowding all on one tree and
	quarreling about the best places. But
	these voices were more and more rare, and
	became fainter; gradually all ceased, and
	the silence was interrupted by the evening
	breeze playing among the trees. The
	poplar tree tried to lift her bluish-green
	<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"> </a>leaves upward; the king-oak murmured
	softly; the leaves of the birch tree slightly
	moved—silence.</p>

	<p>Now the sky became more red; in the
	east the horizon became dark blue, and all
	the voices of the woods merged into a
	chorus, solemn, deep and immense.
	Thus the forest sings its evening song of
	praise, and says its prayers before it sleeps;
	tree speaks to tree of the glory of God,
	and you would say that it spoke with a
	human voice.</p>

	<p>Only very innocent souls understand
	this great and blessed speech. Only very
	innocent hearts hear and understand
	when the first chorus of the parent oaks
	begins its strain:</p>

	<p>“Rejoice, O sister pines, and be glad.
	The Lord hath given a warm and peaceful
	day, and now above the earth He makes
	the starry night. Great is the Lord, and
	mighty, powerful and good is He, so let
	<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"> </a>there be glory to Him upon the heights,
	upon the waters, upon the lands, and upon
	the air.”</p>

	<p>And the pines pondered a moment upon
	the words of the oaks, and then they
	raised their voices together, saying:</p>

	<p>“Now, O Lord, to thy great glory, we,
	as censers, offer to Thee the incense of
	our sweet-smelling balsam, strong, resinous
	and fragrant. ‘Our Father, who art in
	heaven, hallowed be Thy Name.’”</p>

	<p>Then the birches said:</p>

	<p>“Thy evening brightness illumines the
	heavens, O Lord! and in Thy splendors
	our small leaves golden are and burning.
	Now with our golden leaves we sing to
	Thee, O Lord, and our delicate twigs play
	as the strings of the harp, O good Father
	of ours!”</p>

	<p>Again the sorrowing cypress said:</p>

	<p>“Upon our sad foreheads, exhausted
	with the heat, softly falls the evening dew.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"> </a>Praise be to Thee, O Lord; brothers and
	sisters rejoice, because there falls the cooling
	dew.”</p>

	<p>Amid this chorus of trees the aspen
	alone trembles and is afraid; for it gave
	the wood for the Cross of the Saviour of
	the world; at times it faintly groans:</p>

	<p>“O Lord, have mercy upon me.
	Have mercy upon me, O Lord.”</p>

	<p>Again, sometimes, when the oaks and
	pines cease for a moment, there rises from
	under their feet a faint, modest voice, low
	as the murmur of insects, silent as silence
	itself, which says:</p>

	<p>“A small berry am I, O Lord, and
	hidden in the moss. But Thou wilt hear,
	discern and love me; though small, devout
	am I, and sing Thy glory.”</p>

	<p>Thus every evening prays the forest,
	and these orchestral sounds rise at every
	sunset from earth to heaven—and float
	high, high, reaching where there is no
	<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"> </a>creature, where there is nothing only the
	silvery dust and the milky way of the
	stars, and above the stars—God.</p>

	<p>At this moment the sun hides his
	radiant head in the far-distant seas; the
	farmer turns upward his plowshares and
	hastens to his cottage. From the pastures
	return the bellowing herds; the sheep
	raise clouds of the golden dust. The twilight
	falls; in the village creek the well
	sweeps; later the windows shine, and
	from the distance comes the barking of
	the dogs.</p>

	<p>The sun had not gone beyond the woods
	when Kasya had seated herself under the
	mossy stone to weave her garlands. Its rays
	were thrown upon her face, broken by the
	shadows of the leaves and twigs. The
	work did not proceed rapidly, for Kasya
	was tired from heat and running in the
	woods. Her sunburnt hands moved slowly
	at her work. The warm breeze kissed her
	<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"> </a>temples and face, and the voices of the
	forest lulled her to sleep. Her large eyes
	became heavy and drowsy; her eyelashes
	began to close slowly; she leaned her head
	against the stone, opened her eyes once
	more as a child looking upon the divine
	beauty of the world; then the noise of the
	trees, the rows of the stumps, the ground
	full of pine needles, and the skies that
	could be seen between the branches all
	became indistinct, darkened, dissolved,
	disappeared—and she smiled and slept.
	Her head was hidden in a soft shade, but
	the covering of her breast shone all rosy
	and purple. Her soft breathing lifted
	her bosom gently; so wonderful and
	beautiful she looked in this quiet sleep in
	the evening rays that John looked upon
	her as if upon the image of a saint, glorious
	with gold, and colored as the rainbow.</p>

	<p>Kasya’s hands were clinging yet to the
	unfinished garland of herbs. She slept
	<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"> </a>with a sleep light and sweet, for she smiled
	through her dreams as a child who speaks
	with the angels. Perhaps she verily conversed
	with angels, for pure she was as a
	child, and had dedicated her whole day to
	the service of God by gathering and weaving
	the garlands for His temple.</p>

	<p>John was sitting by her side, but he did
	not sleep. His simple breast could not
	contain the feelings that arose there; he
	felt as if his soul had got wings and was
	preparing to fly away to the realms of
	heaven. He knew not what was happening
	to him, and he only raised his eyes to
	the skies and was motionless; you would
	say that love had transfigured him.</p>

	<p>Kasya slumbered on, and for a long
	time they both remained there. Meanwhile
	the dusk came. The remnants of
	the purple light fought with the darkness.
	The interior of the woods deepened—became
	dumb. From the canes of the lake
	<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"> </a>near the glade with its cottage came the
	buzzing of a night beetle.</p>

	<p>Suddenly on the other side of the lake
	from the church rang out the Angelus
	bell. Its tones floated on the wings of the
	evening breeze over the face of the quiet
	waters, clear, resonant, and distinct. It
	called the faithful to prayer, and also proclaimed:
	“Rest! Enough of work and
	the heat of the day,” spoke the bell.
	“Wrap yourself to sleep in the wing of
	God. Come, come ye weary to Him—in
	Him is joy! Here is peace! here gladness!
	here sleep! here sleep! here sleep!”</p>

	<p>John took off his hat at the sound of
	the bell, Kasya shook the sleep from her
	eyes, and said:</p>

	<p>“The bell rings.”</p>

	<p>“For the Angel of the Lord.”</p>

	<p>Both kneeled near by the mossy stone
	as if before an altar. Kasya began to
	pray with a low, soft voice:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41"> </a>“The Angel of the Lord declared unto
	Mary,”</p>

	<p>“And she conceived by the Holy
	Ghost,” answered John.</p>

	<p>“Behold the handmaiden of the Lord;
	may it be done to me according to Thy
	word.”</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />


	<p>Thus kneeling, prayed these children of
	God. The silent summer lightning shone
	from the east to the west, and upon its
	light flew down from heaven a radiant
	host of winged angels, and hovered above
	their heads. Then they blended with the
	angels and were themselves as if angels,
	for upon earth there were no two souls
	more bright, more pure, more innocent.</p>

	<h2>ORSO.</h2>

	<p>The last days of autumn in Anaheim, a
	town situated in Southern California, are
	days of joy and celebration. The grape
	gathering is finished and the town is
	crowded with the vineyard hands. There
	is nothing more picturesque than the
	sight of these people, composed partly of
	a sprinkling of Mexicans, but mainly of
	Cahuilla Indians, who come from the
	wild mountains of San Bernardino to earn
	some money by gathering grapes. They
	scatter through the streets and market
	places, called lolas, where they sleep in
	tents or under the roof of the sky, which
	is always clear at this time of the year.
	This beautiful city, surrounded with its
	growths of eucalyptus, olive, castor, and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"> </a>pepper trees, is filled with the noisy
	confusion of a fair, which strangely contrasts
	with the deep and solemn silence
	of the plains, covered with cacti, just beyond
	the vineyards. In the evening, when
	the sun hides his radiant head in the
	depths of the ocean, and upon the rosy
	sky are seen in its light the equally rosy-tinted
	wings of the wild geese, ducks,
	pelicans and cranes, descending by the
	thousands from the mountains to the
	ocean, then in the town the lights are lit
	and the evening amusements begin. The
	negro minstrels play on bones, and by the
	campfires can be heard the picking of
	the banjo; the Mexicans dance on an out-spread
	poncha their favorite bolero; Indians
	join in the dance, holding in their
	teeth long white sticks of kiotte, or beating
	time with their hands, and exclaiming,
	“E viva;” the fires, fed with redwood,
	crackle as they blaze, sending up clouds
	<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"> </a>of bright sparks, and by its reflection
	can be seen the dancing figures, and
	around them the local settlers with their
	comely wives and sisters watching the
	scene.</p>

	<p>The day on which the juice from the
	last bunch of grapes is trampled out by
	the feet of the Indians is generally celebrated
	by the advent of Hirsch’s Circus,
	from Los Angeles. The proprietor of the
	circus is a German, and besides owns a
	menagerie composed of monkeys, jaguars,
	pumas, African lions, one elephant, and
	several parrots, childish with age—“<em>The
	greatest attraction of the world.</em>” The
	Cahuilla will give his last peso, if he has
	not spent it on drink, to see not only wild
	animals—for these abound in the San
	Bernardino Mountains—but to see the
	circus girls, athletes, clowns, and all its
	wonders, which seem to him as “a great
	medicine”—that is, magical feats, impossible
	<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"> </a>of accomplishment except by the aid
	of supernatural powers.</p>

	<p>Mr. Hirsch, the proprietor of the circus,
	would be very angry with any one who
	would dare to say that his circus only attracted
	Mexicans, Indians, and Chinese.
	Certainly not; the arrival of the circus
	brings hither not only the people of the
	town and vicinity, but even those of the
	neighboring towns of Westminster, Orange,
	and Los Nietos. Orange Street is
	crowded with buggies and wagons of divers
	shapes, so that it is difficult to get through.
	The whole world of settlers come as one
	man. Young, bright girls, with their
	hair prettily banged over their eyes, sitting
	on the front seats, drive some of these
	vehicles, and gracefully upset passing pedestrians,
	chatter and show their white
	teeth; the Spanish senoritas from Los
	Nietos cover you with their warm, ardent
	glances from under their lace mantillas;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"> </a>the married women from the country,
	dressed in their latest and best fashions,
	lean with pride on the arms of the sunburned
	farmers, who are dressed in old
	hats, jean pants, and flannel shirts, fastened
	with hook and eye, and without
	neckties.</p>

	<p>All these people meet and greet each
	other, gossip, and the women inspect with
	critical eye the dresses of their neighbors,
	to see if they are “very fashionable.”</p>

	<p>Among the buggies are some covered
	with flowers, which look like huge bouquets;
	the young men, mounted on mustangs,
	bend from their high Mexican
	saddles and peer under the hats of the
	young girls; the half-wild horses, frightened
	by the noise and confusion, look here
	and there with their bloodshot eyes, curvet,
	rear, and try to unseat their riders, but
	the cool riders seem to pay no attention to
	them.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"> </a>They all speak of “the greatest attraction,”
	which was about to excel everything
	that had been seen before. Truly
	the flaming posters announced genuine
	wonders. The proprietor, Hirsch, that
	renowned “artist of the whip,” will in the
	arena give a contest with a fierce, untamed
	African lion. The lion, according to the
	programme, springs upon the proprietor,
	whose only defense is his whip. This
	simple weapon in his hands (according to
	the programme) will change itself into a
	fiery sword and shield. The end of this
	whip will sting as a rattlesnake, flash as
	lightning, shoot as a thunderbolt, and
	keep at a proper distance the enraged
	monster, who vainly roars and tries to
	jump on the artist. This is not the end
	yet: sixteen-year-old Orso, an “American
	Hercules,” born of a white father and Indian
	mother, will carry around six people,
	three on each shoulder; besides this, the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"> </a>management offers one hundred dollars
	to any man, regardless of color, who
	can throw Orso in a wrestling match. A
	rumor arose in Anaheim that from the
	mountains of San Bernardino comes for
	this purpose the “Grizzly Killer,” a
	hunter who was celebrated for his bravery
	and strength, and who, since California
	was settled, was the first man who attacked
	these great bears single-handed and armed
	only with a knife. It is the probable victory
	of the “Grizzly Killer” over the sixteen-year-old
	athlete of the circus that
	highly excites the minds of the males of
	Anaheim, because if Orso, who until now,
	from the Atlantic to the Pacific, had overthrown
	the strongest Americans, will be
	defeated, great glory will cover all California.
	The feminine minds are not
	less excited by the following number of
	the programme: Orso will carry, on a pole
	thirty feet high, a small fairy, the “Wonder
	<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"> </a>of the World,” of which the poster
	says that she is the most beautiful girl
	that ever lived on this earth since the beginning
	of the “Christian Era.” Though
	she is only thirteen years of age, the management
	also offers one hundred dollars
	to every maiden, “without regard to
	color of skin,” who will dare to compete
	and wrest the palm of beauty from this
	“Aerial Angel.” The maidens of Anaheim,
	both great and small, make grimaces
	on reading this, and say that it would
	not be ladylike to enter such a contest.
	Nevertheless they gladly surrender the
	comfort of their rocking chairs rather than
	miss the show and the chance of seeing
	their childish rival, in whose beauty, in
	comparison with the sisters Bimpa, for instance,
	none of them believed. The two
	sisters Bimpa, the elder Refugio, and the
	younger Mercedes, sitting gracefully in a
	handsome buggy, are now reading the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"> </a>posters; their faces show no trace of emotion,
	though they feel that the eyes of
	Anaheim are on them, as if supplicating
	them to save the honor of the whole
	county, and with a patriotic pride, founded
	upon the conviction that there is none
	more beautiful than these two California
	flowers in all the mountains and cañons
	of the whole world. Oh, beautiful indeed
	are the sisters Refugio and Mercedes!
	Not in vain does the pure Castilian blood
	flow in their veins, to which their mother
	constantly refers, showing her disdain
	for all colored races, as well as for the
	Americans.</p>

	<p>The figures of the sisters are slender,
	subtle, and full of mysterious grace, quiet,
	and so luxurious that they greatly impress
	all young men who come near
	them. From Donnas Refugio and Mercedes
	exhales a charm as the fragrance
	from the magnolia and the lily. Their
	<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"> </a>faces are delicate, complexions transparent
	with a slight rosy tint, as if illumed with
	the dawn; the eyes dark and dreamy,
	sweet, innocent, and tender in their
	glances. Wrapped in muslin rebosos, they
	sit in their buggy adorned with flowers,
	pure and innocent, unconscious of their
	own beauty. Anaheim looked upon them,
	devoured them with its eyes, was proud of
	them, and loved them. Who then is this
	“Jenny,” that can win victory over these?
	“Truly,” the <cite>Saturday Review</cite> wrote,
	“when little Jenny had climbed to the top
	of the mast, resting on the powerful shoulders
	of Orso, and from this eminence,
	suspended above the earth, in danger of
	death, she outstretched her arms and
	poised like a butterfly, the circus became
	silent and all eyes and hearts followed with
	trembling the movements of this wonderful
	child. That he who saw her on the
	mast or on a horse,” concluded the <cite>Saturday
	<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"> </a>Review</cite>, “will never forget her, because
	the greatest painter in the world,
	even Mr. Harvey, of San Francisco, who
	decorated the Palace Hotel, could paint
	nothing equal to it.”</p>

	<p>The youths of Anaheim who were enamored
	by the Misses Bimpa were skeptical
	of this, and affirmed that it was a
	“humbug,” but this question will be settled
	in the evening. Meanwhile, the
	commotion around the circus is increasing
	each moment. From among the
	long, low wooden buildings surrounding
	the canvas circus there comes the roar of
	the lions and elephant; the parrots, fastened
	to rings hanging to the huts, fill the
	air with their cries and whistles; the monkeys
	swing suspended by their tails or
	mock the public, who are kept at a distance
	by a rope fence. At last, from the
	main inclosure the procession emerges for
	the purpose of whetting and astonishing
	<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"> </a>the curiosity of the public to a greater
	extent. The procession is headed by a
	gaudy band-wagon, drawn by six prancing
	horses with fine harness, and feathers on
	their heads. The riders on the saddles
	are in the costume of French postilions.
	On the other wagons come cages of lions,
	and in every cage is seated a lady with an
	olive branch in her hand. Then follows
	an elephant, covered with a carpet, and a
	tower on its back, which contains several
	men arrayed as East Indian hunters. The
	band is playing, the drums are beating, the
	lions are roaring, the whips are cracking;
	in a word, this cavalcade moves forward
	with great noise and uproar. But this is
	not all: behind the elephant there follows
	a machine on wheels, with a locomotive
	pipe, somewhat resembling an organ,
	which, blown by steam, emits the most
	discordant yells and whistles intended for
	the national “Yankee Doodle.” The
	<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"> </a>Americans cry “Hurrah!” the Germans,
	“Hoch!” the Mexicans, “E viva!” and
	the Cahuillas howl for joy.</p>

	<p>The crowds follow the procession, the
	place around the circus becomes deserted,
	the parrots cease their chatter, and the
	monkeys their gymnastics. But “the
	greatest attractions” do not take part in
	the procession. The “incomparable
	artist of the whip,” the manager, the
	“unconquerable Orso,” and the “Aërial
	Angel, Jenny,” are all absent. All this is
	preserved for the evening so as to attract
	the crowds.</p>

	<p>The manager is somewhere in one of
	the wooden buildings, or looks into the
	ticket seller’s van, where he pretends to
	be angry. Orso and Jenny are in the ring
	practicing some of their feats. Under its
	canvas roof reigns dust and silence. In
	the distance, where the seats are arranged,
	it is totally dark; the greatest part of the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"> </a>light falls through the roof on the ring,
	with its sand and sawdust covering. With
	the help of the gray light which filters
	through the canvas can be seen a horse
	standing near the parapet. The big horse
	feels very lonely, whisks the flies with his
	tail, and often sways his head. Gradually
	the eye, becoming accustomed to the dim
	light, discerns other objects—for instance:
	the mast upon which Orso carries Jenny,
	the hoops pasted with paper for her to
	jump through. All these lie on the
	ground without order, and the half-lighted
	arena and nearly dark benches give an
	impression of a deserted building with
	battened windows. The terrace of seats,
	only here and there broken with a stray
	glimmer of light, look like ruins. The
	horse, standing with drooping head, does
	not enliven the picture.</p>

	<p>Where are Orso and Jenny? One of the
	rays of light that stream through an
	<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"> </a>aperture of the canvas, in which floats
	the golden dust, falls on a row of distant
	seats. This body of light, undulating
	with the swaying canvas, at last falls upon
	a group composed of Orso and Jenny.</p>

	<p>Orso sits on top of the bench, and near
	to him is Jenny. Her beautiful childish
	face leans against the arm of the athlete
	and her hand rests on his neck. The
	eyes of the girl are lifted upward, as if
	listening intently to the words of her companion,
	who bends over her, moving his
	head at times, apparently explaining something.</p>

	<p>Leaning as they are against each other,
	you might take them for a pair of lovers,
	but for the fact that the girl’s uplifted
	eyes express strong attention and intense
	thought, rather than any romantic feeling,
	and that her legs, which are covered
	with pink fleshings, and her feet in
	slippers, sway to and fro with a childish
	<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"> </a>abandon. Her figure has just begun to
	blossom into maidenhood. In everything
	Jenny is still a child, but so charming and
	beautiful that, without reflecting upon
	the ability of Mr. Harvey, who decorated
	the Palace Hotel, of San Francisco, it
	would be difficult even for him to imagine
	anything to equal her. Her delicate face
	is simply angelic; her large, sad blue eyes
	have a deep, sweet and confiding expression;
	her dark eyebrows are penciled with
	unequaled purity on her forehead, white
	and reposeful as if in deep thought, and the
	bright, silky hair, somewhat tossed, throws
	a shadow on it, of which, not only Master
	Harvey, but a certain other painter, named
	Rembrandt, would not have been ashamed.
	The girl at once reminds you of Cinderella
	and Gretchen, and the leaning posture
	which she now maintains suggests timidity
	and the need of protection.</p>

	<p>Her posture, which strongly reminds
	<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"> </a>you of those of Greuz, contrasts strangely
	with her circus attire, composed of a short,
	white muslin skirt, embroidered with
	small silver stars, and pink tights. Sitting
	in a golden beam of light with the
	dark, deep background, she looks like
	some sunny and transparent vision, and
	her slender form contrasts with the square
	and sturdy figure of the youth.</p>

	<p>Orso, who is dressed in pink tights,
	appears from afar as if he were naked,
	and the same ray of light distinctly reveals
	his immense shoulders, rounded
	chest, small waist, and legs too short in
	proportion to the trunk.</p>

	<p>His powerful form seems as if it were
	hewn out with an ax. He has all the features
	of a circus athlete, but so magnified
	that they make him noticeable; besides,
	his face is not handsome. Sometimes,
	when he raises his head, you can see his
	face, the lines of which are regular, perhaps
	<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"> </a>too regular, and somewhat rigid, as
	if carved from marble. The low forehead,
	with the hair falling on it, like the
	mane of a horse, straight and black, inherited
	from his squaw mother, gives to
	his face a gloomy and threatening expression.
	He has a similarity to both the
	bull and the bear, and he personifies a
	terrible and somewhat evil force. He is
	not of a good disposition.</p>

	<p>When Jenny passes by the horses, those
	gentle creatures turn their heads and look
	at her with intelligent eyes, and neigh and
	whinny, as if wishing to say: “How do
	you do, darling?” while at the sight of
	Orso they shudder with fear. He is a
	reticent and gloomy youth. Mr. Hirsch’s
	negroes, who are his hostlers, clowns, minstrels,
	and rope-walkers, do not like Orso
	and tease him as much as they dare, and
	because he is half-Indian they think nothing
	of him, and plague and mock him.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"> </a>Truly, the manager, who offers the hundred
	dollars to any one who can defeat
	him, does not risk much; he dislikes and
	fears him, as the tamer of the wild animals
	fears a lion, and whips him on the
	slightest provocation.</p>

	<p>Mr. Hirsch feels that, if he does not
	keep the youth in subjection by constantly
	beating him, he will be beaten himself,
	and he follows the principle of the Creole
	woman, who considered beating a punishment,
	and no beating a reward.</p>

	<p>Such was Orso. Recently he began to
	be less sullen, because little Jenny had a
	good influence over him. It happened
	about a year ago that when Orso, who
	was then the attendant of the wild animals,
	was cleaning the cage of the puma,
	the beast put its paws through the bars of
	the cage and wounded his head severely.
	Then he entered the cage, and after a terrible
	fight between them, he alone remained
	<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"> </a>alive. But he was so badly hurt
	that he fainted from loss of blood. He was
	ill a long time, which was greatly aggravated
	by a severe whipping which the
	manager gave him for breaking the spine
	of the puma.</p>

	<p>When he was ill Jenny took great care
	of him, and dressed his wounds, and when
	she had leisure, read the Bible to him.
	That is a “good book” which speaks of
	love, of forgiveness, of mercy—in a word,
	of things that are never mentioned in Mr.
	Hirsch’s circus. Orso, listening to this
	book, pondered long in his Indian head
	and at last came to the conclusion that if
	it would be as good in the circus as in this
	book, perhaps he would not be so bad. He
	thought also that then he would not be
	beaten so often, and some one would be
	found who would love him. But who?
	Not negroes and not Mr. Hirsch; little
	Jenny, whose voice sounded as sweetly in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"> </a>his ears as the voice of the mavis, might
	be the one.</p>

	<p>One evening, under the influence of
	this thought, he began to weep and kiss
	the small hands of Jenny, and from this
	time on he loved her very much. During
	the performance in the evening, when
	Jenny was riding a horse, he was always in
	the ring and carefully watching over her
	to prevent any accident. When he held
	the paper hoops for her to jump through
	he smiled on her; when to the sound of
	the music be balanced her on the top of
	the high mast, and the audience was
	hushed with fright, he felt uneasy himself.
	He knew very well if she should
	fall that no one from the “good book”
	would be left in the circus; he never removed
	his eyes from her, and the evident
	caution and anxiety expressed in his
	movements added to the terror of the
	people. Then, when recalled into the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"> </a>ring by the storm of applause, they would
	run in together, he would push her forward,
	as if deserving of all the praise, and
	murmur from joy. This reticent youth
	spoke only to Jenny, and to her alone he
	opened his mind. He hated the circus
	and Mr. Hirsch, who was entirely different
	from the people in the “good book.”
	Something always attracted him to the edge
	of the horizon, to the woods and plains.
	When the circus troupe in their constant
	wanderings chanced to pass through wild,
	lonely spots, he heard voices awakening
	the instincts of a captive wolf, who sees
	the woods and plains for the first time.
	This propensity he inherited not only
	from his mother, but also from his father,
	who had been a frontiersman. He shared
	all his hopes with Jenny, and often narrated
	to her how fully and untrammeled
	live the people of the plains. Most of this
	he guessed or gleaned from the hunters of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65"> </a>the prairies, who came to the circus with
	wild animals which they had captured for
	the menagerie, or to try their prowess for
	the hundred-dollar prize.</p>

	<p>Little Jenny listened to these Indian
	visions, opening widely her blue eyes and
	falling into deep reveries. For Orso
	never spoke of going alone to the desert;
	she was always with him, and it was very
	good for them there. Every day they
	saw something new; they possessed all they
	needed, and it seemed right to make all
	their plans carefully.</p>

	<p>So now they sit in this beam of light,
	talking to each other, instead of practicing
	and attempting new feats. The horse
	stands in the ring and feels lonely. Jenny
	leans on Orso’s arm, thoughtfully contemplating
	and looking with wistful, wondering
	eyes into the dim space, swinging
	her feet like a child and musing—how it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66"> </a>will be on the plains, and asking questions
	from Orso.</p>

	<p>“How do they live there?” says she,
	raising her eyes to the face of her friend.</p>

	<p>“There is plenty of oaks. They take
	an ax and build a house.”</p>

	<p>“Well,” says Jenny, “but until the
	house is built?”</p>

	<p>“It is always warm there. The
	‘Grizzly Killer’ says it is very warm.”</p>

	<p>Jenny begins to swing her feet more
	lively, as if the warmth there has settled
	the question in her mind; but shortly she
	remembers that she has in the circus a
	dog and a cat, and that she would like to
	take them with her. She calls her dog
	Mister Dog and her cat Mister Cat.</p>

	<p>“And will Mr. Dog and Mr. Cat go
	with us?”</p>

	<p>“They will,” answers Orso, looking
	pleased.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page67" title="67"> </a>“Will we take with us the ‘good
	book’?”</p>

	<p>“We will,” says Orso, still more pleased.</p>

	<p>“Well,” says the girl in her innocence,
	“Mr. Cat will catch birds for us; Mr.
	Dog will drive away bad people with his
	bark; you will be my husband and I will
	be your wife, and they will be our
	children.”</p>

	<p>Orso feels so happy that he cannot
	speak, and Jenny continues:</p>

	<p>“There, there will be no Mr. Hirsch,
	no circus, we will not work, and basta!
	But no!” she adds a moment later, “the
	‘good book’ says that we should work, and
	I sometimes will jump through one—through
	the two hoops, the three, the four
	hoops.”</p>

	<p>Jenny evidently does not imagine work
	under any other form than jumping
	through hoops.</p>

	<p>Shortly she says again:</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"> </a>“Orso, will I indeed be always with
	you?”</p>

	<p>“Yes, Jen, for I love you very much.”</p>

	<p>His face brightens as he says so, and
	becomes almost beautiful.</p>

	<p>And yet he does not know himself how
	dear to him has become this small bright
	head.</p>

	<p>He has nothing else in this world but
	her, and he watches her as the faithful
	dog guards his mistress. By her fragile
	side he looks like Hercules, but he is
	unconscious of this.</p>

	<p>“Jen,” says he after a moment, “listen
	to what I tell you.”</p>

	<p>Jenny, who shortly before had got up
	to look at the horse, now turns and,
	kneeling down before Orso, puts her two
	elbows on his knees, crosses her arms and,
	resting her chin on her wrists, uplifts
	her face and is all attention.</p>

	<p>At this moment, to the consternation of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69"> </a>the children, the “artist of the whip”
	enters the ring in a very bad humor, because
	his trial with a lion had entirely
	failed.</p>

	<p>This lion, who was bald from old age,
	desired only to be let alone, had no inclination
	to attack the “artist,” and hid
	himself from the lash of the whip in a far
	corner of the cage. The manager thought
	with despair that if this loyal disposition remained
	with the lion until the evening the
	contest with the whip would be a failure;
	for to fight a lion who slinks away needs
	no more art than to eat a lobster from his
	tail. The bad temper of the proprietor
	became still worse when he learned from
	the ticket seller that he was disposing of
	no seats in the “gods;” that the Cahuillas
	evidently had spent all their money that
	they had earned in the vineyards for drinks,
	and that they came to his window and
	offered their blankets, marked “U. S.,”
	<a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70"> </a>or their wives, especially the old ones, in
	exchange for tickets of admission. The
	lack of money among the Cahuillas was no
	small loss for the “artist of the whip;”
	for he counted on a “crowded house,” and
	if the seats in the “gods” were not sold no
	“crowded house” was obtainable; therefore
	the manager wished at this moment
	that all the Indians had but one back, and
	that he might give an exhibition of his
	skill with the whip on that one back, in the
	presence of all Anaheim. Thus he felt as
	he entered the ring, and seeing the horse
	standing idle under the parapet, he felt
	like jumping with anger. Where are Orso
	and Jenny? Shading his eyes with his
	hand he looked all around the circus, and
	observed in a bright beam, Orso, and Jenny
	kneeling before him with her elbows resting
	on his knees. At this sight he let
	the lash of his whip trail on the ground.</p>

	<p>“Orso!”</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71"> </a>If lightning had struck in the midst of
	the children they could not have been
	more startled. Orso jumped to his feet and
	descended in the passageway between the
	benches with the hasty movement of an
	animal who comes to his master at his
	call; behind him followed Jenny with eyes
	wide open from fright, and clutching the
	benches as she passed them.</p>

	<p>Orso, on entering the ring, stopped by
	the parapet, gloomy and silent, the gray
	light from above bringing into relief his
	Herculean trunk upon its short legs.</p>

	<p>“Nearer,” cried out the manager in a
	hoarse voice; meanwhile the lash of his
	long whip moved upon the sand with a
	threatening motion, like the tail of a
	tiger watching his approaching prey.</p>

	<p>Orso advanced several steps, and for a
	few minutes they looked into each other’s
	eyes. The manager’s face resembled that
	of the tamer who enters the cage, intending
	<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"> </a>to subdue a dangerous animal, and at
	the same time watches it.</p>

	<p>His rage overcame his caution. His
	legs, incased in elk riding breeches and
	high boots, pranced under him with anger.
	Perhaps it was not the idleness alone of
	the children which increased his rage.
	Jenny, from above, looked at both of them
	like a frightened hare watching two
	lynxes.</p>

	<p>“Hoodlum! dog catcher, thou cur!”
	hissed the manager.</p>

	<p>The whip with the velocity of lightning
	whistled through the air in a circle,
	hissed and struck. Orso winced and
	howled a little, and stepped toward the
	manager, but the second stroke stopped
	him at once, then the third, fourth—tenth.
	The contest had begun, although
	there was no audience. The uplifted
	hand of the “great artist” scarcely moved,
	but his wrist revolved, as if a part of some
	<a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"> </a>machinery, and, with each revolution, the
	sharp point of the lash stung the skin of
	Orso. It seemed as if the whip, or rather
	its poisonous fang, filled the whole space
	between the athlete and the manager, who
	in his increasing excitement reached the
	genuine enthusiasm of the artist. The
	“master” simply improvised. The cracking
	end flashing in the air twice had
	written down its bloody trace on the bare
	neck of the athlete. Orso was silent in
	this dance. At every cut he stepped one
	step forward and the manager one step
	backward. In this way they circled the
	arena, and at last the manager backed out
	of the ring as a conqueror from the cage,
	and disappeared through the entrance to
	the stables, still as the conqueror. As he
	left his eye fell on Jenny.</p>

	<p>“Get on your horse,” he cried; “I will
	settle with you later.”</p>

	<p>His voice had scarcely ceased before her
	<a class="pagenum" id="page74" title="74"> </a>white skirt flashed in the air, and in a
	moment she was on the back of the horse.
	The manager had disappeared, and the
	horse began to gallop around the ring, occasionally
	striking the side with its hoofs.</p>

	<p>“Hep! Hep!” agitatedly said Jenny to
	the horse with her childish voice: “Hep!
	hep!” but this “hep, hep,” was at the
	same time a sob. The horse increased his
	speed, clattering with his hoofs as he
	leaned more and more to the center. The
	girl, standing on the pad with her feet
	close together, seemed scarcely to touch it
	with the ends of her toes; her bare rosy
	arms rose and fell as she maintained her
	balance; her hair and light muslin dress
	floated behind her supple figure, which
	looked like a bird circling in the air.</p>

	<p>“Hep! hep!” she kept exclaiming.
	Meanwhile her eyes were filled with tears,
	and to see she had to raise her head; the
	movement of the horse made her dizzy;
	<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"> </a>the terrace of seats and the ring seemed to
	revolve around her; she wavered once,
	twice, and then fell down into the arms of
	Orso.</p>

	<p>“Oh! Orso, poor Orso!” cried the child.</p>

	<p>“What’s the matter, Jen? why do you
	cry? I don’t feel the pain, I don’t feel
	it.”</p>

	<p>Jenny threw both her arms around his
	neck and began to kiss his cheeks. Her
	whole body trembled, and she sobbed
	convulsively.</p>

	<p>“Orso, oh, Orso,” she sobbed, for she
	could not speak, and her arms clung closer
	to his neck. She could not have cried more
	if she had been beaten herself. So, in the
	end, he began to pet and console her.
	Forgetting his own pain he took her in his
	arms and pressed her to his heart, and his
	nerves being excited by the beating, he
	now felt for the first time that he loved
	her more than the dog loved his mistress.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"> </a>He breathed heavily, and his lips panted
	out the words:</p>

	<p>“I feel no pain. When you are with
	me, I am happy, Jenny, Jenny!”</p>

	<p>When this was transpiring the manager
	was walking in the stables, foaming with
	rage. His heart was filled with jealousy.
	He saw the girl on her knees before Orso;
	recently this beautiful child had awakened
	the lower instincts in him, but as yet undeveloped,
	and now he fancied that she
	and Orso loved each other, and he felt revengeful,
	and had a wild desire to punish
	her—to whip her soundly. This desire
	he could not resist. Shortly he called to
	her.</p>

	<p>She at once left Orso, and in a moment
	had disappeared in the dark entrance to
	the stables. Orso stood stupefied, and
	instead of following her he walked with
	unsteady steps to a bench, and, seating
	himself, began to breathe heavily.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77"> </a>When the girl entered the stables she
	could see nothing, as it was much darker
	there than in the ring. Yet, fearing that
	she would be suspected of having delayed
	her coming, she cried out in a faint voice:</p>

	<p>“I am here, master, I am here.”</p>

	<p>At the same moment the hand of the
	manager caught hers, and he hoarsely
	said:</p>

	<p>“Come!”</p>

	<p>If he had shown anger or badly scolded
	her she would have felt less frightened
	than at this silence with which he led her
	to the circus wardrobe. She hung back,
	resisting him, and repeating quickly:</p>

	<p>“Oh, dear Mr. Hirsch, forgive me! forgive
	me!”</p>

	<p>But forcibly he dragged her to the long
	room where they stored their costumes,
	and turned the key in the door.</p>

	<p>Jenny fell down on her knees. With
	uplifted eyes and folded hands, trembling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78"> </a>as a leaf, the tears streaming down her
	cheeks, she tried to arouse his mercy; in
	answer to her supplications, he took from
	the wall a wire whip, and said:</p>

	<p>“Lie down.”</p>

	<p>With despair she flung herself at his
	feet, nearly dying from fright. Every
	nerve of her body quivered; but vainly she
	pressed her pallid lips to his polished
	boots. Her alarm and pleading seemed to
	arouse the demon in him more than ever.
	Grasping her roughly, he threw her
	violently on a heap of dresses, and in an
	instant, after trying to stop the kicking
	of her feet, he began beating her cruelly.</p>

	<p>“Orso! Orso!” she shouted.</p>

	<p>About this moment the door shook on
	its hinges, rattled, creaked and gave way,
	and half of it, pushed in with a tremendous
	force, fell with a crash upon the
	ground.</p>

	<p>In this opening stood Orso.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79"> </a>The wire whip fell from the hand of the
	manager, and his face became deadly pale,
	because Orso looked ferocious. His eyes
	were bloodshot, his lips covered with
	foam, his head inclined to one side like a
	bull’s, and his whole body was crouched
	and gathered, as if ready to spring.</p>

	<p>“Get out!” cried the manager, trying to
	hide his fear behind a show of authority.</p>

	<p>The pent-up dam was already broken.
	Orso, who was usually as obedient to every
	motion as a dog, this time did not move,
	but leaning his head still more to one side,
	he moved slowly and threateningly toward
	the “artist of the whip,” his iron muscles
	taut as whipcords.</p>

	<p>“Help! help!” cried the manager.</p>

	<p>They heard him.</p>

	<p>Four brawny negroes from the stables
	ran in through the broken door and fell
	upon Orso. A terrible fight ensued, upon
	which the manager looked with chattering
	<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80"> </a>teeth. For a long time you could see
	nothing but a tangled mass of dark bodies
	wrestling with convulsive movements,
	rolling on the ground in a writhing heap;
	in the silence which followed sometimes
	was heard a groan, a snort, loud short
	breathing, the gritting of teeth.</p>

	<p>In a moment one of the negroes, as if
	by a superhuman force, was sent from
	this formless mass, whirling headlong
	through the air, and fell at the feet of the
	manager, striking his skull with great
	force on the ground; soon a second flew
	out; then from the center of this turbulent
	group Orso’s body alone arose, covered
	with blood and looking more terrible than
	before. His knees were still pressing
	heavily on the breasts of the two fainting
	negroes. He arose to his feet and moved
	toward the manager.</p>

	<p>Hirsch closed his eyes.</p>

	<p>The next moment he felt that his feet
	<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"> </a>had left the ground, that he was flying
	through the air—then he felt nothing;
	his whole body was dashed with monstrous
	force into the remaining half of the door,
	and he fell to the earth unconscious.</p>

	<p>Orso wiped his face, and, coming over
	to Jenny, said:</p>

	<p>“Let us go.”</p>

	<p>He took her by the hand and they
	went.</p>

	<p>The whole town was following the circus
	procession and the steam calliope, playing
	“Yankee Doodle,” and the place around
	the circus was deserted. The parrots
	only, swinging in their hoops, filled the
	air with their cries. Hand in hand, Orso
	and Jenny went forward; from the end of
	the street could be seen the immense plains,
	covered with cacti. Silently they passed
	by the houses, shaded by the eucalyptus
	trees; then they passed the slaughter-houses,
	around which had gathered thousands
	<a class="pagenum" id="page82" title="82"> </a>of small black birds with red-tipped
	wings. They jumped over the large irrigation
	ditches, entered into an orange
	grove, and on emerging from it found
	themselves among the cacti.</p>

	<p>This was the desert.</p>

	<p>As far as the eye could reach these
	prickly plants rose higher and higher;
	thick leaves growing from other leaves
	obstructed the path, sometimes catching
	on Jenny’s dress. In places they grew to
	such a great height that the children
	seemed to be as much lost here as if they
	were in the woods, and no one could find
	them there. So they kept threading
	their way through them, now to the right
	and then to the left, but careful always to
	go from the town. Sometimes between the
	cacti they could see on the horizon the
	blue mountains of Santa Ana. They
	went to the mountains. The heat was
	great. Gray-colored locusts chirped in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83"> </a>the cacti; the sun’s rays poured down
	upon the earth in streams; the dried-up
	earth was covered with a network of
	cracks; the stiff leaves of the cacti seemed
	to soften from the heat, and the flowers
	were languid and half-wilted. The children
	proceeded, silent and thoughtful.
	But all that surrounded them was so new
	that they surrendered themselves to their
	impressions, and for the moment forgot
	even their weariness. Jenny’s eyes ran
	from one bunch of cacti to another; again
	she looked to the farther clusters, saying
	to her friend:</p>

	<p>“Is this the wilderness, Orso?”</p>

	<p>But the desert did not appear to be
	deserted. From the farther clumps came
	the calling of the male quail, and around
	sounded the different murmurs of clucking,
	of twittering, of the ruffling of
	feathers: in a word, the divers voices of
	the small inhabitants of the plains. Sometimes
	<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84"> </a>there flew up a whole covey of
	quail; the gaudy-topped pheasants scattered
	on their approach; the black squirrels
	dived into their holes; the rabbits disappeared
	in all directions; the gophers were
	sitting on their hind legs beside their
	holes, looking like fat German farmers
	standing in their doorway.</p>

	<p>After resting an hour the children proceeded
	on their journey. Jenny soon felt
	thirsty. Orso, in whom had awakened
	his Indian inventive faculties, began to
	pluck cactus fruits. They were in abundance,
	and grew together with the flowers
	on the same leaves. In plucking them
	they pricked their fingers with the
	sharp points, but the fruit was luscious.
	Their sweet and acid flavor quenched at
	once their thirst and appeased their
	hunger. The prairies fed the children
	as a mother; thus strengthened they could
	proceed further. The cacti arose higher,
	<a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85"> </a>and you could say that they grew on the
	head of one another. The ground on
	which they walked ascended gradually and
	continuously. Looking backward once
	more they saw Anaheim, dissolving in the
	distance and looking like a grove of trees
	upon the low plains. Not a trace of the
	circus could be distinguished. They still
	pressed steadily onward to the mountains,
	which now became more distinct in the
	distance. The surroundings assumed
	another phase. Between the cacti appeared
	different bushes and even trees;
	the wooded portion of the foothills of
	Santa Ana had commenced. Orso broke
	one of the saplings, and, clearing off its
	branches, made a cudgel of it, which, in
	his hands, would prove a terrible weapon.
	His Indian instincts whispered to him
	that in the mountains it was better to be
	provided, even with a stick, than to go
	unarmed, especially now that the sun had
	<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"> </a>lowered itself into the west. Its great
	fiery shield had rolled down far beyond
	Anaheim, into the blue ocean. After a
	while it disappeared, and in the west there
	gleamed red, golden, and orange lights,
	similar to ribbons and gauzy veils, stretched
	over the whole sky. The mountains uplifted
	themselves in this glow; the cacti
	assumed different fantastical shapes, resembling
	people and animals. Jenny felt
	tired and sleepy, but they still hastened to
	the mountains, although they knew not
	why. Soon they saw rocks, and on reaching
	them they discovered a stream; they
	drank some water and continued along its
	course. The rocks, which were at first
	broken and scattered, then changed into
	a solid wall, which became higher and
	higher, and soon they entered into a
	cañon.</p>

	<p>The rosy lights died away; deeper and
	deeper dusk enveloped the earth.  In
	<a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87"> </a>places immense vines reached from one
	side of the cañon to the other, covering
	it like a roof, and making it dark and uncanny.
	On the mountain side, above
	them, could be heard the voices of the
	swaying and creaking forest trees. Orso
	implied that now they were in the depths of
	the wilderness, where certainly there were
	many wild animals. From time to time
	his ear detected suspicious sounds, and
	when night fell he distinctly heard the
	hoarse mewing of the lynxes, the roar of
	the pumas, and the melancholy howling of
	the coyotes.</p>

	<p>“Are you afraid, Jen?” asked Orso.</p>

	<p>“No,” replied the girl.</p>

	<p>But she was already very tired, and
	could proceed no farther, so Orso took her
	in his arms and carried her. He went
	forward with the hope that he would reach
	the house of some squatter, or should meet
	some Mexican campers. Once or twice it
	<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88"> </a>seemed to him that he saw the gleam of
	some wild animal’s eyes. Then with one
	hand he pressed Jenny, who had now
	fallen asleep, to his breast, and with the
	other he grasped his stick. He was very
	tired himself; notwithstanding his great
	strength Jenny began to prove heavy to
	him, especially as he carried her on his
	left arm; the right one he wished to have
	free for defense. Occasionally he stopped
	to regain his breath and then continued
	on. Suddenly he paused and listened
	intently. It seemed to him as if he heard
	the echoes of the small bells which the
	settlers tie for the night to the neck of
	their cows and goats. Rushing forward,
	he soon reached a bend in the stream.
	The sound of the bells became more distinct,
	and joined with them in the distance
	was heard the barking of a dog.
	Then Orso was sure that he was nearing
	some settlement. It was high time that
	<a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"> </a>he did, for he was exhausted by the events
	of the day, and his strength had begun to
	fail him. On turning another bend he
	saw a light; as he moved forward his
	quick eyes discerned a campfire, a dog,
	evidently tied to a stump, tearing and
	barking, and at last the figure of a man
	seated by the fire.</p>

	<p>“God send that this may be a man
	from the ‘good book’!” thought he.</p>

	<p>Then he resolved to awaken Jenny.</p>

	<p>“Jen!” called he, “awake, we shall
	eat.”</p>

	<p>“What is it?” asked the girl; “where
	are we?”</p>

	<p>“In the wilderness.”</p>

	<p>She was now wide awake.</p>

	<p>“What light is that?”</p>

	<p>“A man lives there; we shall eat.”</p>

	<p>Poor Orso was very hungry.</p>

	<p>Meanwhile they were nearing the fire.
	The dog barked more violently, and the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"> </a>old man, sitting by the fire, shaded his
	eyes and peered into the gloom. Shortly
	he said:</p>

	<p>“Who is there?”</p>

	<p>“It is us,” answered Jenny in her
	delicate voice, “and we are very hungry.”</p>

	<p>“Come nearer,” said the old man.</p>

	<p>Emerging from behind a great rock,
	which had partly concealed them, they
	both stood in the light of the fire, holding
	each other’s hands. The old man looked
	at them with astonishment, and involuntarily
	exclaimed:</p>

	<p>“What is that?”</p>

	<p>For he saw a sight which, in the
	sparsely populated mountains of Santa
	Ana, would astonish any one. Orso and
	Jenny were dressed in their circus attire.
	The beautiful girl, clothed in pink tights
	and short white skirt, appearing so suddenly
	before him, looked in the firelight
	like some fairy sylph. Behind her stood
	<a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91"> </a>the youth with his powerful figure, covered
	also with pink fleshings, through which
	you could see his muscles standing out
	like knots on the oak.</p>

	<p>The old squatter gazed at them with
	wide-open eyes.</p>

	<p>“Who are you?” he inquired.</p>

	<p>The girl, relying more on her own eloquence
	than on that of Orso, began to
	speak.</p>

	<p>“We are from the circus, kind sir!
	Mr. Hirsch beat Orso very much and then
	wanted to beat me, but Orso did not let
	him, and fought Mr. Hirsch and four
	negroes, and then we ran off on the plains,
	and went a long distance through the
	cacti, and Orso carried me; then we came
	here and are very hungry.”</p>

	<p>The face of the old man softened and
	brightened as he listened to her story, and
	he looked with a fatherly interest on this
	charming child, who spoke with great
	<a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"> </a>haste, as if she wished to tell all in one
	breath.</p>

	<p>“What is your name, little one?” he
	asked.</p>

	<p>“Jenny.”</p>

	<p>“Welcome, Jenny! and you, Orso!
	people rarely come here. Come to me,
	Jenny.”</p>

	<p>Without hesitation the little girl put
	her arms around the neck of the old man
	and kissed him warmly. He appeared
	to her to be some one from the “good
	book.”</p>

	<p>“Will Mr. Hirsch find us here?” she
	said, as she took her lips from his face.</p>

	<p>“If he comes he will find a bullet here,”
	replied the old man; then added, “you
	said that you wanted to eat?”</p>

	<p>“Oh, yes, very much.”</p>

	<p>The squatter, raking in the ashes of the
	fire, took out a fine leg of venison, the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93"> </a>pleasant odor of which filled the air.
	Then they sat down to eat.</p>

	<p>The night was gorgeous; the moon came
	out high in the heavens above the cañon;
	in the thicket the mavis began to sing
	sweetly; the fire burned brightly, and
	Orso was so filled with joy that he chanted
	with gladness. Both he and the girl ate
	heartily. The old man had no appetite; he
	looked upon little Jenny, and, for some
	unknown cause, his eyes were filled with
	tears.</p>

	<p>Perhaps he had been once a father, or,
	perhaps, he so rarely saw people in these
	deserted mountains.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

	<p>Since then these three lived together.</p>

because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
