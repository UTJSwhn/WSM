    <h2>
      KNUT HAMSUN: FROM HUNGER TO HARVEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      Between &ldquo;Hunger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Growth of the Soil&rdquo; lies the time generally allotted
      to a generation, but at first glance the two books seem much farther
      apart. One expresses the passionate revolt of a homeless wanderer against
      the conventional routine of modern life. The other celebrates a root-fast
      existence bounded in every direction by monotonous chores. The issuance of
      two such books from the same pen suggests to the superficial view a
      complete reversal of position. The truth, however, is that Hamsun stands
      today where he has always stood. His objective is the same. If he has
      changed, it is only in the intensity of his feeling and the mode of his
      attack. What, above all, he hates and combats is the artificial
      uselessness of existence which to him has become embodied in the life of
      the city as opposed to that of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Problems do not enter into the novels of Hamsun in the same manner as they
      did into the plays of Ibsen. Hamsun would seem to take life as it is, not
      with any pretense at its complete acceptability, but without hope or
      avowed intention of making it over. If his tolerance be never free from
      satire, his satire is on the other hand always easily tolerant. One might
      almost suspect him of viewing life as something static against which all
      fight would be futile. Even life's worst brutalities are related with an
      offhandedness of manner that makes you look for the joke that must be at
      the bottom of them. The word <i>reform</i> would seem to be strangely
      eliminated from his dictionary, or, if present, it might be found defined
      as a humorous conception of something intrinsically unachievable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamsun would not be the artist he is if he were less deceptive. He has his
      problems no less than Ibsen had, and he is much preoccupied with them even
      when he appears lost in ribald laughter. They are different from Ibsen's,
      however, and in that difference lies one of the chief explanations of
      Hamsun's position as an artist. All of Ibsen's problems became in the last
      instance reducible to a single relationship&mdash;that between the
      individual and his own self. To be himself was his cry and his task. With
      this consummation in view, he plumbed every depth of human nature. This
      one thing achieved, all else became insignificant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamsun begins where Ibsen ended, one might say. The one problem never
      consciously raised by him as a problem is that of man's duty or ability to
      express his own nature. That is taken for granted. The figures populating
      the works of Hamsun, whether centrally placed or moving shadowlike in the
      periphery, are first of all themselves&mdash;agressively, inevitably,
      unconsciously so, In other words, they are like their creator. They may
      perish tragically or ridiculously as a result of their common inability to
      lay violent hand on their own natures. They may go through life warped and
      dwarfed for lack of an adjustment that to most of us might seem both easy
      and natural. Their own selves may become more clearly revealed to them by
      harsh or happy contacts with life, and they may change their surfaces
      accordingly. The one thing never occurring to them is that they might, for
      the sake of something or some one outside of themselves, be anything but
      what they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are interferences, however, and it is from these that Hamsun's
      problems spring. A man may prosper or suffer by being himself, and in
      neither case is the fault his own. There are factors that more or less
      fatally influence and circumscribe the supremely important factor that is
      his own self. Roughly these fall into three groups suggestive of three
      classes of relationships: (1) between man and his general environment; (2)
      between man and that ever-present force of life which we call love; and
      (3) between man and life in its entirety, as an omnipotence that some of
      us call God and others leave unnamed. Hamsun's deceptive preference for
      indirectness is shown by the fact that, while he tries to make us believe
      that his work is chiefly preoccupied with problems of the second class,
      his mind is really busy with those of the first class. The explanation is
      simple. Nothing helps like love to bring out the unique qualities of a
      man's nature. On the other hand, there is nothing that does more to
      prevent a man from being himself than the ruts of habit into which his
      environment always tends to drive him. There are two kinds of environment,
      natural and human. Hamsun appears to think that the less you have of one
      and the more of the other, the better for yourself and for humanity as a
      whole. The city to him is primarily concentrated human environment, and as
      such bad. This phase of his attitude toward life almost amounts to a
      phobia. It must be connected with personal experiences of unusual depth
      and intensity. Perhaps it offers a key that may be well worth searching
      for. Hamsun was born in the country, of and among peasants. In such
      surroundings he grew up. The removal of his parents from the central
      inland part of Norway to the rocky northern coast meant a change of
      natural setting, but not a human contact. The sea must have come into his
      life as a revelation, and yet it plays an astonishingly small part in his
      work. It is always present, but always in the distance. You hear of it,
      but you are never taken to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about fifteen, Hamsun had an experience which is rarely mentioned as
      part of the scant biographical material made available by his reserve
      concerning his own personality. He returned to the old home of his parents
      in the Gudbrand Valley and worked for a few months as clerk in a country
      store&mdash;a store just like any one of those that figure so
      conspicuously in almost every one of his novels. The place and the work
      must have made a revolutionary impression on him. It apparently aroused
      longings, and it probably laid the basis for resistances and resentments
      that later blossomed into weedlike abundance as he came in contact with
      real city life. There runs through his work a strange sense of sympathy
      for the little store on the border of the wilderness, but it is also
      stamped as the forerunner and panderer of the lures of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a boy of eighteen, when working in a tiny coast town as a cobbler's
      apprentice, he ventured upon his first literary endeavors and actually
      managed to get two volumes printed at his own cost. The art of writing was
      in his blood, exercising a call and a command that must have been felt as
      a pain at times, and as a consecration at other times. Books and writing
      were connected with the city. Perhaps the hatred that later days
      developed, had its roots in a thwarted passion. Even in the little
      community where his first scribblings reached print he must have felt
      himself in urban surroundings, and perhaps those first crude volumes drew
      upon him laughter and scorn that his sensitive soul never forgot. If
      something of the kind happened, the seed thus sown was nourished
      plentifully afterwards, when, as a young man, Hamsun pitted his ambitions
      against the indifference first of Christiania and then of Chicago. The
      result was a defeat that seemed the more bitter because it looked like
      punishment incurred by straying after false gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others have suffered in the same way, although, being less rigidly
      themselves, they may not, like Hamsun, have taken a perverse pleasure in
      driving home the point of the agony. Others have thought and said harsh
      things of the cities. But no one that I can recall has equalled Hamsun in
      his merciless denunciation of the very principle of urbanity. The truth of
      it seems to be that Hamsun's pilgrimage to the bee hives where modern
      humanity clusters typically, was an essential violation of something
      within himself that mattered even more than his literary ambition to his
      soul's integrity. Perhaps, if I am right, he is the first genuine peasant
      who has risen to such artistic mastery, reaching its ultimate heights
      through a belated recognition of his own proper settings. Hamsun was sixty
      when he wrote &ldquo;Growth of the Soil.&rdquo; It is the first work in which he
      celebrates the life of the open country for its own sake, and not merely
      as a contrast to the artificiality and selfishness of the cities. It was
      written, too, after he had definitely withdrawn himself from the gathering
      places of the writers and the artists to give an equal share of his time
      and attention to the tilling of the soil that was at last his own. It is
      the harvest of his ultimate self-discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various phases of his campaign against city life are also interesting
      and illuminating. Early in his career as a writer he tried an open attack
      in full force by a couple of novels, &ldquo;Shallow Soil&rdquo; and &ldquo;Editor Lynge&rdquo;,
      dealing sarcastically with the literary Bohemia of the Norwegian capital.
      They were, on the whole, failures&mdash;artistically rather than
      commercially. They are among his poorest books. The attack was never
      repeated in that form. He retired to the country, so to speak, and tried
      from there to strike at what he could reach of the ever expanding, ever
      devouring city. After that the city, like the sea, is always found in the
      distance. One feels it without ever seeing it. There is fear as well as
      hatred in his treatment of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the country it is represented not so much by the store, which, after
      all, fills an unmistakable need on the part of the rural population, as by
      the representatives of the various professions. For these Hamsun
      entertains a hostile feeling hardly less marked than that bestowed on
      their place of origin, whither, to his openly declared disgust, they are
      always longing. It does not matter whether they are ministers or actors,
      lawyers or doctors&mdash;they are all tarred with the same brush. Their
      common characteristic is their rootlessness. They have no real home,
      because to Hamsun a home is unthinkable apart from a space of soil
      possessed in continuity by successive generations. They are always
      despising the surroundings in which they find themselves temporarily, and
      their chief claim to distinction is a genuine or pretended knowledge of
      life on a large scale. Greatness is to them inseparably connected with
      crowdedness, and what they call sophistication is at bottom nothing but a
      wallowing in that herd instinct which takes the place of mankind's ancient
      antagonist in Hamsun's books. Above all, their standards of judgment are
      not their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what has just been said one might conclude that the spirit of Hamsun
      is fundamentally unsocial. So it is, in a way, but only in so far as we
      have come to think of social and urban as more or less interchangeable
      terms. He has a social consciousness and a social passion of his own, but
      it is decentralized, one might say. He knows of no greater man than his
      own Isak of &ldquo;Growth of the Soil&rdquo;&mdash;a simple pioneer in whose wake new
      homes spring up, an inarticulate and uncouth personification of man's
      mastery of nature. When Hamsun speaks of Isak passing across the yearning,
      spring-stirred fields, &ldquo;with the grain flung in fructifying waves from his
      reverent hands,&rdquo; he pictures it deliberately in the light of a religious
      rite&mdash;the oldest and most significant known to man. It is as if the
      man who starved in Christiania and the western cities of the United States&mdash;not
      figuratively, but literally&mdash;had once for all conceived a respect for
      man's principal food that has colored all subsequent life for him and
      determined his own attitude toward everything by a reference to its
      connection or lack of connection with that substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking it all in all, one may well call Hamsun old-fashioned. The virtues
      winning his praise and the conditions that stir his longings are not of
      the present day. There is in him something primitive that forms a sharp
      contrast to the modernity of his own style. Even in his most romantic
      exaggerations, as in &ldquo;Hunger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mysteries,&rdquo; he is a realist, dealing
      unrelentingly with life as it appears to us. It would hardly be too much
      to call his method scientific. But he uses it to aim tremendous explosive
      charges at those human concentrations that made possible the forging of
      the weapons he wields so skilfully. Nor does he stop at a wish to see
      those concentrations scattered. The very ambitions and Utopias bred within
      them are anathema to his soul, that places simplicity above cleanliness in
      divine proximity. Characteristically we find that the one art treated with
      constant sympathy in his writings is that of music, which probably is the
      earliest and certainly the one least dependent on the herding of men in
      barracks. In place of what he wishes to take away he offers nothing but
      peace and the sense of genuine creation that comes to the man who has just
      garnered the harvests of his own fields into his bulging barns. He is a
      prophet of plenty, but he has no answer ready when we ask him what we are
      going to do with it after we have got it. Like a true son of the brooding
      North, he wishes to set us thinking, but he has no final solutions to
      offer.

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      These last few days I have been thinking and thinking of the Nordland
      summer, with its endless day. Sitting here thinking of that, and of a hut
      I lived in, and of the woods behind the hut. And writing things down, by
      way of passing the time; to amuse myself, no more. The time goes very
      slowly; I cannot get it to pass as quickly as I would, though I have
      nothing to sorrow for, and live as pleasantly as could be. I am well
      content withal, and my thirty years are no age to speak of.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days back someone sent me two feathers. Two bird's feathers in a
      sheet of note-paper with a coronet, and fastened with a seal. Sent from a
      place a long way off; from one who need not have sent them back at all.
      That amused me too, those devilish green feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the rest I have no troubles, unless for a touch of gout now and
      again in my left foot, from an old bullet-wound, healed long since.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years ago, I remember, the time passed quickly&mdash;beyond all
      comparison more quickly than time now. A summer was gone before I knew.
      Two years ago it was, in 1855. I will write of it just to amuse myself&mdash;of
      something that happened to me, or something I dreamed. Now, I have
      forgotten many things belonging to that time, by having scarcely thought
      of them since. But I remember that the nights were very light. And many
      things seemed curious and unnatural. Twelve months to the year&mdash;but
      night was like day, and never a star to be seen in the sky. And the people
      I met were strange, and of a different nature from those I had known
      before; sometimes a single night was enough to make them blossom out from
      childhood into the full of their glory, ripe and fully grown. No witchery
      in this; only I had never seen the like before. No.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a white, roomy home down by the sea I met with one who busied my
      thoughts for a little time. I do not always think of her now; not any
      more. No; I have forgotten her. But I think of all the other things: the
      cry of the sea-birds, my hunting in the woods, my nights, and all the warm
      hours of that summer. After all, it was only by the merest accident I
      happened to meet her; save for that, she would never have been in my
      thoughts for a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the hut where I lived, I could see a confusion of rocks and reefs and
      islets, and a little of the sea, and a bluish mountain peak or so; behind
      the hut was the forest. A huge forest it was; and I was glad and grateful
      beyond measure for the scent of roots and leaves, the thick smell of the
      fir-sap, that is like the smell of marrow. Only the forest could bring all
      things to calm within me; my mind was strong and at ease. Day after day I
      tramped over the wooded hills with Æsop at my side, and asked no more than
      leave to keep on going there day after day, though most of the ground was
      covered still with snow and soft slush. I had no company but Æsop; now it
      is Cora, but at that time it was Æsop, my dog that I afterwards shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often in the evening, when I came back to the hut after being out shooting
      all day, I could feel that kindly, homely feeling trickling through me
      from head to foot&mdash;a pleasant little inward shivering. And I would
      talk to Æsop about it, saying how comfortable we were. &ldquo;There, now we'll
      get a fire going, and roast a bird on the hearth,&rdquo; I would say; &ldquo;what do
      you say to that?&rdquo; And when it was done, and we had both fed, Æsop would
      slip away to his place behind the hearth, while I lit a pipe and lay down
      on the bench for a while, listening to the dead soughing of the trees.
      There was a slight breeze bearing down towards the hut, and I could hear
      quite clearly the clutter of a grouse far away on the ridge behind. Save
      for that, all was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      And many a time I fell asleep there as I lay, just as I was, fully dressed
      and all, and did not wake till the seabirds began calling. And then,
      looking out of the window, I could see the big white buildings of the
      trading station, the landing stage at Girilund, the store where I used to
      get my bread. And I would lie there a while, wondering how I came to be
      there, in a hut on the fringe of a forest, away up in Nordland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Æsop over by the hearth would shake out his long, slender body,
      rattling his collar, and yawning and wagging his tail, and I would jump
      up, after those three or four hours of sleep, fully rested and full of joy
      in everything ... everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a night passed just that way.

      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rain and storm&mdash;'tis not such things that count. Many a time some
      little joy can come along on a rainy day, and make a man turn off
      somewhere to be alone with his happiness&mdash;stand up somewhere and look
      out straight ahead, laughing quietly now and again, and looking round.
      What is there to think of? One clear pane in a window, a ray of sunlight
      in the pane, the sight of a little brook, or maybe a blue strip of sky
      between the clouds. It needs no more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      At other times, even quite unusual happenings cannot avail to lift a man
      from dulness and poverty of mind; one can sit in the middle of a ballroom
      and be cool, indifferent, unaffected by anything. Sorrow and joy are from
      within oneself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I remember now. I had gone down to the coast. The rain came on
      suddenly, and I slipped into an open boathouse to sit down for a while. I
      was humming a little, but not for any joy or pleasure, only to pass the
      time. Æsop was with me; he sat up listening, and I stopped humming and
      listened as well. Voices outside; people coming nearer. A mere chance&mdash;nothing
      more natural. A little party, two men and a girl, came tumbling in
      suddenly to where I sat, calling to one another and laughing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick! Get in here till it stops!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men had a white shirt front, soft, and now soaked with rain
      into the bargain, and all bagging down; and in that wet shirt front a
      diamond clasp. Long, pointed shoes he wore, too, that looked somewhat
      affected. I gave him good-day. It was Mack, the trader; I knew him because
      he was from the store where I used to get my bread. He had asked me to
      look in at the house any time, but I had not been there yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha, it's you, is it?&rdquo; said Mack at sight of me. &ldquo;We were going up to the
      mill, but had to turn back. Ever see such weather&mdash;what? And when are
      you coming up to see us at Sirilund, Lieutenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He introduced the little black-bearded man who was with him; a doctor,
      staying down near the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl lifted her veil the least little bit, to her nose, and started
      talking to Æsop in a whisper. I noticed her jacket; I could see from the
      lining and the buttonholes that it had been dyed. Mack introduced me to
      her as well; his daughter, Edwarda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda gave me one glance through her veil, and went on whispering to the
      dog, and reading on its collar:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're called Æsop, are you? Doctor, who was Æsop? All I can remember
      is that he wrote fables. Wasn't he a Phrygian? I can't remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A child, a schoolgirl. I looked at her&mdash;she was tall, but with no
      figure to speak of, about fifteen or sixteen, with long, dark hands and no
      gloves. Like as not she had looked up Æsop in the dictionary that
      afternoon, to have it ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mack asked me what sport I was having. What did I shoot mostly? I could
      have one of his boats at any time if I wanted&mdash;only let him know. The
      Doctor said nothing at all. When they went off again, I noticed that the
      Doctor limped a little, and walked with a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked home as empty in mind as before, humming all indifferently. That
      meeting in the boathouse had made no difference either way to me; the one
      thing I remembered best of all was Mack's wet shirt front, with a diamond
      clasp&mdash;the diamond all wet, too, and no great brilliance about it,
      either.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a stone outside my hut, a tall grey stone. It looked as if it
      had a sort of friendly feeling towards me; as if it noticed me when I came
      by, and knew me again. I liked to go round that way past the stone, when I
      went out in the morning; it was like leaving a good friend there, who I
      knew would be still waiting for me when I came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then up in the woods hunting, sometimes finding game, sometimes none...
    </p>
    <p>
      Out beyond the islands, the sea lay heavily calm. Many a time I have stood
      and looked at it from the hills, far up above. On a calm day, the ships
      seemed hardly to move at all; I could see the same sail for three days,
      small and white, like a gull on the water. Then, perhaps, if the wind
      veered round, the peaks in the distance would almost disappear, and there
      came a storm, the south-westerly gale; a play for me to stand and watch.
      All things in a seething mist. Earth and sky mingled together, the sea
      flung up into fantastic dancing figures of men and horses and fluttering
      banners on the air. I stood in the shelter of an overhanging rock,
      thinking many things; my soul was tense. Heaven knows, I thought to
      myself, what it is I am watching here, and why the sea should open before
      my eyes. Maybe I am seeing now the inner brain of earth, how things are at
      work there, boiling and foaming. Æsop was restless; now and again he would
      thrust up his muzzle and sniff, in a troubled way, with legs quivering
      uneasily; when I took no notice, he lay down between my feet and stared
      out to sea as I was doing. And never a cry, never a word of human voice to
      be heard anywhere; nothing; only the heavy rush of the wind about my head.
      There was a reef of rocks far out, lying all apart; when the sea raged up
      over it the water towered like a crazy screw; nay, like a sea-god rising
      wet in the air, and snorting, till hair and beard stood out like a wheel
      about his head. Then he plunged down into the breakers once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the midst of the storm, a little coal-black steamer fighting its
      way in...
    </p>
    <p>
      When I went down to the quay in the afternoon, the little coal-black
      steamer had come in; it was the mail-packet. Many people had gathered on
      the quayside to see the rare visitor; I noticed that all without exception
      had blue eyes, however different they might be in other ways. A young girl
      with a white woolen kerchief over her head stood a little apart; she had
      very dark hair, and the white kerchief showed up strangely against it. She
      looked at me curiously, at my leather suit, my gun; when I spoke to her,
      she was embarrassed, and turned her head away. I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should always wear a white kerchief like that; it suits you well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a burly man in an Iceland jersey came up and joined her; he
      called her Eva. Evidently she was his daughter. I knew the burly man; he
      was the local smith, the blacksmith. Only a few days back he had mended
      the nipple of one of my guns...
    </p>
    <p>
      And rain and wind did their work, and thawed away the snow. For some days
      a cheerless cold hovered over the earth; rotten branches snapped, and the
      crows gathered in flocks, complaining. But it was not for long; the sun
      was near, and one day it rose up behind the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sends a strip of sweetness through me from head to foot when the sun
      comes up; I shoulder my gun with quiet delight.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      I was never short of game those days, but shot all I cared to&mdash;a
      hare, a grouse, a ptarmigan&mdash;and when I happened to be down near the
      shore and came within range of some seabird or other, I shot it too. It
      was a pleasant time; the days grew longer and the air clearer; I packed up
      things for a couple of days and set off up into the hills, up to the
      mountain peaks. I met reindeer Lapps, and they gave me cheese&mdash;rich
      little cheeses tasting of herbs. I went up that way more than once. Then,
      going home again, I always shot some bird or other to put in my bag. I sat
      down and put Æsop on the lead. Miles below me was the sea; the
      mountainsides were wet and black with the water running down them,
      dripping and trickling always with the same little sound. That little
      sound of the water far up on the hills has shortened many an hour for me
      when I sat looking about. Here, I thought to myself, is a little endless
      song trickling away all to itself, and no one ever hears it, and no one
      ever thinks of it, and still it trickles on nevertheless, to itself, all
      the time, all the time! And I felt that the mountains were no longer quite
      deserted, as long as I could hear that little trickling song. Now and
      again something would happen: a clap of thunder shaking the earth, a mass
      of rock slipping loose and rushing down towards the sea, leaving a trail
      of smoking dust behind. Æsop turned his nose to the wind at once, sniffing
      in surprise at the smell of burning that he could not understand. When the
      melting of the snow had made rifts in the hillside, a shot, or even a
      sharp cry, was enough to loosen a great block and send it tumbling down...
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour might pass, or perhaps more&mdash;the time went so quickly. I let
      Æsop loose, slung my bag over the other shoulder, and set off towards
      home. It was getting late. Lower down in the forest, I came unfailingly
      upon my old, well-known path, a narrow ribbon of a path, with the
      strangest bends and turns. I followed each one of them, taking my time&mdash;there
      was no hurry. No one waiting for me at home. Free as a lord, a ruler, I
      could ramble about there in the peaceful woods, just as idly as I pleased.
      All the birds were silent; only the grouse was calling far away&mdash;it
      was always calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      I came out of the wood and saw two figures ahead, two persons moving. I
      came up with them. One was Edwarda, and I recognized her, and gave a
      greeting; the Doctor was with her. I had to show them my gun; they looked
      at my compass, my bag; I invited them to my hut, and they promised to come
      some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening now. I went home and lit a fire, roasted a bird, and had a
      meal. To-morrow there would be another day...
    </p>
    <p>
      All things quiet and still. I lay that evening looking out the window.
      There was a fairy glimmer at that hour over wood and field; the sun had
      gone down, and dyed the horizon with a rich red light that stood there
      still as oil. The sky all open and clean; I stared into that clear sea,
      and it seemed as if I were lying face to face with the uttermost depth of
      the world; my heart beating tensely against it, and at home there. God
      knows, I thought to myself, God knows why the sky is dressed in gold and
      mauve to-night, if there is not some festival going on up there in the
      world, some great feast with music from the stars, and boats gliding along
      river ways. It looks so!&mdash;And I closed my eyes, and followed the
      boats, and thoughts and thoughts floated through my mind...
    </p>
    <p>
      So more than one day passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wandered about, noting how the snow turned to water, how the ice loosed
      its hold. Many a day I did not even fire a shot, when I had food enough in
      the hut&mdash;only wandered about in my freedom, and let the time pass.
      Whichever way I turned, there was always just as much to see and hear&mdash;all
      things changing a little every day. Even the osier thickets and the
      juniper stood waiting for the spring. One day I went out to the mill; it
      was still icebound, but the earth around it had been trampled through many
      and many a year, showing how men and more men had come that way with sacks
      of corn on their shoulders, to be ground. It was like walking among human
      beings to go there; and there were many dates and letters cut in the
      walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well...

    </h2>
    <p>
      Shall I write more? No, no. Only a little for my own amusement's sake, and
      because it passes the time for me to tell of how the spring came two years
      back, and how everything looked then. Earth and sea began to smell a
      little; there was a sweetish, rotting smell from the dead leaves in the
      wood, and the magpies flew with twigs in their beaks, building their
      nests. A couple of days more, and the brooks began to swell and foam; here
      and there a butterfly was to be seen, and the fishermen came home from
      their stations. The trader's two boats came in laden deep with fish, and
      anchored off the drying grounds; there was life and commotion all of a
      sudden out on the biggest of the islands, where the fish were to be spread
      on the rocks to dry. I could see it all from my window.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no noise reached the hut; I was alone, and remained so. Now and again
      someone would pass. I saw Eva, the blacksmith's girl; she had got a couple
      of freckles on her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out for firewood,&rdquo; she answered quietly. She had a rope in her hand to
      carry the wood, and her white kerchief on her head. I stood watching her,
      but she did not turn round.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that I saw no one for days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring was urging, and the forest listened; it was a great delight to
      watch the thrushes sitting in the tree-tops staring at the sun and crying;
      sometimes I would get up as early as two in the morning, just for a share
      of the joy that went out from bird and beast at sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spring had reached me too, maybe, and my blood beat at times as if it
      were footsteps. I sat in the hut, and thought of overhauling my fishing
      rods and lines and gear, but moved never a finger to any work at all, for
      a glad, mysterious restlessness that was in and out of my heart all the
      while. Then suddenly Æsop sprang up, stood and stiffened, and gave a short
      bark. Someone coming to the hut! I pulled off my cap quickly, and heard
      Edwarda's voice already at the door. Kindly and without ceremony she and
      the Doctor had come to pay me a visit, as they had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I heard her say, &ldquo;he is at home.&rdquo; And she stepped forward, and gave
      me her hand in her simple girlish way. &ldquo;We were here yesterday, but you
      were out,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the rug over my wooden bedstead and looked round the hut;
      the Doctor sat down beside me on the long bench. We talked, chatted away
      at ease; I told them things, such as what kinds of animals there were in
      the woods, and what game I could not shoot because of the closed season.
      It was the closed season for grouse just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor did not say much this time either, but catching sight of my
      powder-horn, with a figure of Pan carved on it, he started to explain the
      myth of Pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Edwarda suddenly, &ldquo;what do you live on when it's closed season
      for all game?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Fish mostly. But there's always something to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you might come up to us for your meals,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There was an
      Englishman here last year&mdash;he had taken the hut&mdash;and he often
      came to us for meals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda looked at me and I at her. I felt at the moment something touching
      my heart like a little fleeting welcome. It must have been the spring, and
      the bright day; I have thought it over since. Also, I admired the curve of
      her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said something about my place; how I had arranged things in the hut. I
      had hung up skins of several sorts on the walls, and birds' wings; it
      looked like a shaggy den on the inside. She liked it. &ldquo;Yes, a den,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had nothing to offer my visitors that they would care about; I thought
      of it, and would have roasted a bird for them, just for amusement&mdash;let
      them eat it hunter's fashion, with their fingers. It might amuse them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I cooked the bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda told about the Englishman. An old man, an eccentric, who talked
      aloud to himself. He was a Roman Catholic, and always carried a little
      prayer-book, with red and black letters, about with him wherever he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he an Irishman then?&rdquo; asked the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Irishman...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;since he was a Roman Catholic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda blushed, and stammered and looked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, perhaps he was an Irishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that she lost her liveliness. I felt sorry for her, and tried to put
      matters straight again. I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, of course you are right: he was an Englishman. Irishmen don't go
      travelling about in Norway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We agreed to row over one day and see the fish-drying grounds...
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had seen my visitors a few steps on their way, I walked home again
      and sat down to work at my fishing gear. My hand-net had been hung from a
      nail by the door, and several of the meshes were damaged by rust; I
      sharpened up some hooks, knotted them to lengths of line, and looked to
      the other nets. How hard it seemed to do any work at all to-day! Thoughts
      that had nothing to do with the business in hand kept coming and going; it
      occurred to me that I had done wrong in letting Edwarda sit on the bed all
      the time, instead of offering her a seat on the bench. I saw before me
      suddenly her brown face and neck; she had fastened her apron a little low
      down in front, to be long-waisted, as was the fashion; the girlish contour
      of her thumb affected me tenderly, and the little wrinkles above the
      knuckle were full of kindliness. Her mouth was large and rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rose up and opened the door and looked out. I could hear nothing, and
      indeed there was nothing to listen for. I closed the door again; Æsop came
      up from his resting-place and noticed that I was restless about something.
      Then it struck me that I might run after Edwarda and ask her for a little
      silk thread to mend my net with. It would not be any pretence&mdash;I
      could take down the net and show her where the meshes were spoiled by
      rust. I was already outside the door when I remembered that I had silk
      thread myself in my fly-book; more indeed than I wanted. And I went back
      slowly, discouraged&mdash;to think that I had silk thread myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A breath of something strange met me as I entered the hut again; it seemed
      as if I were no longer alone there.

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      A man asked me if I had given up shooting; he had not heard me fire a shot
      up in the hills, though he had been out fishing for two days. No, I had
      shot nothing; I had stayed at home in the hut until I had no more food in
      the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day I went out with my gun. The woods were getting green;
      there was a smell of earth and trees. The young grass was already
      springing up from the frozen moss. I was in a thoughtful mood, and sat
      down several times. For three days I had not seen a soul except the one
      fisherman I had met the day before. I thought to myself, &ldquo;Perhaps I may
      meet someone this evening on the way home, at the edge of the wood, where
      I met the Doctor and Edwarda before. Perhaps they may be going for a walk
      that way again&mdash;perhaps, perhaps not.&rdquo; But why should I think of
      those two in particular? I shot a couple of ptarmigan, and cooked one of
      them at once; then I tied up the dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay down on the dry ground to eat. The earth was quiet&mdash;only a
      little breath of wind and the sound of a bird here and there. I lay and
      watched the branches waving gently in the breeze; the little wind was at
      its work, carrying pollen from branch to branch and filling every innocent
      bloom; all the forest seemed filled with delight. A green worm thing, a
      caterpillar, dragged itself end by end along a branch, dragging along
      unceasingly, as if it could not rest. It saw hardly anything, for all it
      had eyes; often it stood straight up in the air, feeling about for
      something to take hold of; it looked like a stump of green thread sewing a
      seam with long stitches along the branch. By evening, perhaps, it would
      have reached its goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quiet as ever. I get up and move on, sit down and get up again. It is
      about four o'clock; about six I can start for home, and see if I happen to
      meet anyone. Two hours to wait; a little restless already, I brush the
      dust and heather from my clothes. I know the places I pass by, trees and
      stones stand there as before in their solitude; the leaves rustle
      underfoot as I walk. The monotonous breathing and the familiar trees and
      stones mean much to me; I am filled with a strange thankfulness;
      everything seems well disposed towards me, mingles with my being; I love
      it all. I pick up a little dry twig and hold it in my hand and sit looking
      at it, and think my own thoughts; the twig is almost rotten, its poor bark
      touches me, pity fills my heart. And when I get up again, I do not throw
      the twig far away, but lay it down, and stand liking it; at last I look at
      it once more with wet eyes before I go away and leave it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five o'clock. The sun tells me false time today; I have been walking
      westward the whole day, and come perhaps half an hour ahead of my sun
      marks at the hut. I am quite aware of all this, but none the less there is
      an hour yet before six o'clock, so I get up again and go on a little. And
      the leaves rustle under foot. An hour goes that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look down at the little stream and the little mill that has been
      icebound all the winter, and I stop. The mill is working; the noise of it
      wakes me, and I stop suddenly, there and then. &ldquo;I have stayed out too
      long,&rdquo; I say aloud. A pang goes through me; I turn at once and begin
      walking homewards, but all the time I know I have stayed out too long. I
      walk faster, then run; Æsop understands there is something the matter, and
      pulls at the leash, drags me along, sniffs at the ground, and is all
      haste. The dry leaves crackle about us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when we come to the edge of the wood there was no one there. No, all
      was quiet; there was no one there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one here,&rdquo; I said to myself. And yet it was no worse than I
      had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not stay long, but walked on, drawn by all my thoughts, passed by my
      hut, and went down to Sirilund with Æsop and my bag and gun&mdash;with all
      my belongings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack received me with the greatest friendliness, and asked me to stay
      to supper.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      I fancy I can read a little in the souls of those about me&mdash;but
      perhaps it is not so. Oh, when my good days come, I feel as if I could see
      far into others' souls, though I am no great or clever head. We sit in a
      room, some men, some women, and I, and I seem to see what is passing
      within them, and what they think of me. I find something in every swift
      little change of light in their eyes; sometimes the blood rises to their
      cheeks and reddens them; at other times they pretend to be looking another
      way, and yet they watch me covertly from the side. There I sit, marking
      all this, and no one dreams that I see through every soul. For years past
      I have felt that I could read the souls of all I met. But perhaps it is
      not so...
    </p>
    <p>
      I stayed at Herr Mack's house all that evening. I might have gone off
      again at once&mdash;it did not interest me to stay sitting there&mdash;but
      had I not come because all my thoughts were drawing me that way? And how
      could I go again at once? We played whist and drank toddy after supper; I
      sat with my back turned to the rest of the room, and my head bent down;
      behind me Edwarda went in and out. The Doctor had gone home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack showed me the design of his new lamps&mdash;the first paraffin
      lamps to be seen so far north. They were splendid things, with a heavy
      leaden base, and he lit them himself every evening&mdash;to prevent any
      accident. He spoke once or twice of his grandfather, the Consul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This brooch was given to my grandfather, Consul Mack, by Carl Johan with
      his own hands,&rdquo; he said, pointing one finger at the diamond in his shirt.
      His wife was dead; he showed me a painted portrait of her in one of the
      other rooms&mdash;a distinguished looking woman with a lace cap and a
      winsome smile. In the same room, also, there was a bookcase, and some old
      French books, no less, that might have been an heirloom. The bindings were
      rich and gilded, and many owners had marked their names in them. Among the
      books were several educational works; Herr Mack was a man of some
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      His two assistants from the store were called in to make up the party at
      whist. They played slowly and doubtfully, counted carefully, and made
      mistakes all the same. Edwarda helped one of them with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I upset my glass, and felt ashamed, and stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;I have upset my glass,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda burst out laughing, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everyone assured me laughingly that it did not matter. They gave me a
      towel to wipe myself with, and we went on with the game. Soon it was
      eleven o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt a vague displeasure at Edwarda's laugh. I looked at her, and found
      that her face had become insignificant, hardly even pretty. At last Herr
      Mack broke off the game, saying that his assistants must go to bed; then
      he leaned back on the sofa and began talking about putting up a sign in
      front of his place. He asked my advice about it. What colour did I think
      would be best? I was not interested, and answered &ldquo;black,&rdquo; without
      thinking at all. And Herr Mack at once agreed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black, yes&mdash;exactly what I had been thinking myself. 'Salt and
      barrels' in heavy black letters&mdash;that ought to look as nice as
      anything... Edwarda, isn't it time you were going to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda rose, shook hands with us both, said good-night, and left the
      room. We sat on. We talked of the railway that had been finished last
      year, and of the first telegraph line. &ldquo;Wonder when we shall have the
      telegraph up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's like this,&rdquo; said Herr Mack. &ldquo;Time goes on, and here am I,
      six-and-forty, and hair and beard gone grey. You might see me in the
      daytime and say I was a young man, but when the evening comes along, and
      I'm all alone, I feel it a good deal. I sit here mostly playing patience.
      It works out all right as a rule, if you fudge a little. Haha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you fudge a little?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I felt as if I could read in his eyes...
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up from his seat, walked over to the window, and looked out; he
      stooped a little, and the back of his neck was hairy. I rose in my turn.
      He looked round and walked towards me in his long, pointed shoes, stuck
      both thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, waved his arms a little, as if they
      were wings, and smiled. Then he offered me his boat again if ever I wanted
      one, and held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute&mdash;I'll go with you,&rdquo; he said, and blew out the lamps.
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I feel like a little walk. It's not so late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed up the road towards the blacksmith's and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way&mdash;it's the shortest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Round by the quay is the shortest way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We argued the point a little, and did not agree. I was convinced that I
      was right, and could not understand why he insisted. At last he suggested
      that we should each go his own way; the one who got there first could wait
      at the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set off, and he was soon lost to sight in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      I walked at my usual pace, and reckoned to be there a good five minutes
      ahead. But when I got to the hut he was there already. He called out as I
      came up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I say? I always go this way&mdash;it <i>is</i> the shortest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him in surprise; he was not heated, and did not appear to have
      been running. He did not stay now, but said good-night in a friendly way,
      and went back the way he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood there and thought to myself: This is strange! I ought to be some
      judge of distance, and I've walked both those ways several times. My good
      man, you've been fudging again. Was the whole thing a pretence?
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw his back as he disappeared into the wood again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment I started off in track of him, going quickly and cautiously; I
      could see him wiping his face all the way, and I was not so sure now that
      he had not been running before. I walked very slowly now, and watched him
      carefully; he stopped at the blacksmith's. I stepped into hiding, and saw
      the door open, and Herr Mack enter the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one o'clock; I could tell by the look of the sea and the grass.

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few days passed as best they could; my only friend was the forest and
      the great loneliness. Dear God! I had never before known what it was to be
      so alone as on the first of those days. It was full spring now; I had
      found wintergreen and milfoil already, and the chaffinches had come (I
      knew all the birds). Now and again I took a couple of coins from my pocket
      and rattled them, to break the loneliness. I thought to myself: &ldquo;What if
      Diderik and Iselin were to appear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Night was coming on again; the sun just dipped into the sea and rose
      again, red, refreshed, as if it had been down to drink. I could feel more
      strangely on those nights than anyone would believe. Was Pan himself
      there, sitting in a tree, watching me to see what I might do? Was his
      belly open, and he sitting there bent over as if drinking from his own
      belly? But all that he did only that he might look up under his brows and
      watch me; and the whole tree shook with his silent laughter when he saw
      how all my thoughts were running away with me. There was a rustling
      everywhere in the woods, beasts sniffing, birds calling one to another;
      their signals filled the air. And it was flying year for the Maybug; its
      humming mingled with the buzz of the night moths, sounded like a
      whispering here and a whispering there, all about in the woods. So much
      there was to hear! For three nights I did not sleep; I thought of Diderik
      and Iselin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See now,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;they might come.&rdquo; And Iselin would lead Diderik
      away to a tree and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand here, Diderik, and keep guard; keep watch; I will let this huntsman
      tie my shoestring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the huntsman is myself, and she will give me a glance of her eyes that
      I may understand. And when she comes, my heart knows all, and no longer
      beats like a heart, but rings as a bell. I lay my hand on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tie my shoe-string,&rdquo; she says, with flushed cheeks. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun dips down into the sea and rises again, red and refreshed, as if
      it had been to drink. And the air is full of whisperings.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after, she speaks, close to my mouth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I must leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she turns and waves her hand to me as she goes, and her face is
      flushed still; her face is tender and full of delight. And again she turns
      and waves to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Diderik steps out from under the tree and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iselin, what have you done? I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answers:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diderik, what did you see? I have done nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iselin, I saw what you did,&rdquo; he says again; &ldquo;I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then her rich, glad laughter rings through the wood, and she goes off
      with him, full of rejoicing from top to toe. And whither does she go? To
      the next mortal man; to a huntsman in the woods.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was midnight. Æsop had broken loose and been out hunting by himself; I
      heard him baying up in the hills, and when at last I got him back it was
      one o'clock. A girl came from herding goats; she fastened her stocking and
      hummed a tune and looked around. But where was her flock? And what was she
      doing in the woods at midnight? Ah, nothing, nothing. Walking there for
      restlessness, perhaps, for joy; 'twas her affair. I thought to myself, she
      had heard Æsop in the woods, and knew that I was out.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she came up I rose and stood and looked at her, and I saw how slight
      and young she was. Æsop, too, stood looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the mill,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what could she have been doing at the mill so late at night?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you venture into the woods so late?&rdquo; I said&mdash;&ldquo;you so slight
      and young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so young&mdash;I am nineteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she could not be nineteen; I am certain she was lying by at least two
      years, and was only seventeen. But why should she lie to seem older?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and tell me your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she sat down, blushing, by my side, and told me her name was
      Henriette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I asked her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a lover, Henriette, and has he ever taken you in his arms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, smiling shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many times?&rdquo; I asked her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice,&rdquo; she answered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew her to me and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he do it? Was it like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      I had some talk with Edwarda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall have rain before long,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at the sun and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell so nearly by the sun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when you can't see the sun, how do you tell the time then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can tell by other things. There's high tide and low tide, and the
      grass that lies over at certain hours, and the song of the birds that
      changes; some birds begin to sing when others leave off. Then, I can tell
      the time by flowers that close in the afternoon, and leaves that are
      bright green at some times and dull green at others&mdash;and then,
      besides, I can feel it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now I was expecting rain, and for Edwarda's sake I would not keep her
      there any longer on the road; I raised my cap. But she stopped me suddenly
      with a new question, and I stayed. She blushed, and asked me why I had
      come to the place at all? Why I went out shooting, and why this and why
      that? For I never shot more than I needed for food, and left my dog
      idle...
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked flushed and humble. I understood that someone had been talking
      about me, and she had heard it; she was not speaking for herself. And
      something about her called up a feeling of tenderness in me; she looked so
      helpless, I remembered that she had no mother; her thin arms gave her an
      ill-cared-for appearance. I could not help feeling it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I did not go out shooting just to murder things, but to live. I had
      need of one grouse to-day, and so I did not shoot two, but would shoot the
      other to-morrow. Why kill more? I lived in the woods, as a son of the
      woods. And from the first of June it was closed time for hare and
      ptarmigan; there was but little left for me to shoot at all now. Well and
      good: then I could go fishing, and live on fish. I would borrow her
      father's boat and row out in that. No, indeed, I did no go out shooting
      for the lust of killing things, but only to live in the woods. It was a
      good place for me; I could lie down on the ground at meals, instead of
      sitting upright on a chair; I did not upset my glass there. In the woods I
      could do as I pleased; I could lie down flat on my back and close my eyes
      if I pleased, and I could say whatever I liked to say. Often one might
      feel a wish to say something, to speak aloud, and in the woods it sounded
      like speech from the very heart...
    </p>
    <p>
      When I asked her if she understood all this, she said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I went on, and told her more, because her eyes were on me. &ldquo;If you
      only knew all that I see out in the wilds!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;In winter, I come
      walking along, and see, perhaps, the tracks of ptarmigan in the snow.
      Suddenly the track disappears; the bird has taken wing. But from the marks
      of the wings I can see which way the game has flown, and before long I
      have tracked it down again. There is always a touch of newness in that for
      me. In autumn, many a time there are shooting stars to watch. Then I think
      to myself, being all alone, What was that? A world seized with convulsions
      all of a sudden? A world going all to pieces before my eyes? To think that
      I&mdash;that <i>I</i> should be granted the sight of shooting stars in my
      life! And when summer comes, then perhaps there may be a little living
      creature on every leaf; I can see that some of them have no wings; they
      can make no great way in the world, but must live and die on that one
      little leaf where they came into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then sometimes I see the blue flies. But it all seems such a little thing
      to talk about&mdash;I don't know if you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Well, then sometimes I look at the grass, and perhaps the grass is
      looking at me again&mdash;who can say? I look at a single blade of grass;
      it quivers a little, maybe, and thinks me something. And I think to
      myself: Here is a little blade of grass all a-quivering. Or if it happens
      to be a fir tree I look at, then maybe the tree has one branch that makes
      me think of it a little, too. And sometimes I meet people up on the moors;
      it happens at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her; she stood bending forward, listening. I hardly knew her.
      So lost in attention she was that she took no heed of herself, but was
      ugly, foolish looking; her underlip hung far down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she said, and drew herself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first drops of rain began to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is raining,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Yes, it is raining,&rdquo; she said, and went away on the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not see her home; she went on her way alone; I hurried up to the
      hut. A few minutes passed. It began to rain heavily. Suddenly I heard
      someone running after me. I stopped short, and there was Edwarda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; she said breathlessly. &ldquo;We were going over to the islands&mdash;the
      drying grounds, you know. The Doctor is coming to-morrow; will you have
      time then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow? Yes, indeed. I shall have time enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot it,&rdquo; she said again, and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she went, I noticed her thin, pretty calves; they were wet far above
      the ankle. Her shoes were worn through.

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
      There was another day which I remember well. It was the day my summer
      came. The sun began shining while it was still night, and dried up the wet
      ground for the morning. The air was soft and fine after the last rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon I went down to the quay. The water was perfectly still;
      we could hear talking and laughter away over at the island, where men and
      girls were at work on the fish. It was a happy afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, was it not a happy afternoon? We took hampers of food and wine with
      us; a big party we were, in two boats, with young women in light dresses.
      I was so happy that I hummed a tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when we were in the boat, I fell to thinking where all these young
      people came from. There were the daughters of the Lensmand and the
      district surgeon, a governess or so, and the ladies from the vicarage. I
      had not seen them before; they were strangers to me; and yet, for all
      that, they were as friendly as if we had known each other for years. I
      made some mistakes! I had grown unaccustomed to being in society, and
      often said &ldquo;Du&rdquo; [Footnote: &ldquo;Du"=thou, the familiar form of address
      (tutoyer), instead of &ldquo;De"=you.] to the young ladies, but they did not
      seem offended. And once I said &ldquo;dear,&rdquo; or &ldquo;my dear,&rdquo; but they forgave me
      that as well, and took no notice of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack had his unstarched shirt front on as usual, with the diamond
      stud. He seemed in excellent spirits, and called across to the other boat:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, look after the hamper with the bottles, you madcaps there. Doctor, I
      shall hold you responsible for the wine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right!&rdquo; cried the Doctor. And just those few words from one boat to
      another seemed to me pleasant and merry to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda was wearing the same dress she had, worn the day before, as if she
      had no other or did not care to put on another. Her shoes, too, were the
      same. I fancied her hands were not quite clean; but she wore a brand new
      hat, with feathers. She had taken her dyed jacket with her, and used it to
      sit on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Herr Mack's request I fired a shot just as we were about to land, in
      fact, two shots, both barrels&mdash;and they cheered. We rambled up over
      the island, the workers greeted us all, and Herr Mack stopped to speak to
      his folk. We found daisies and corn marigolds and put them in our
      button-holes; some found harebells.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was a host of seabirds chattering and screaming, in the air and
      on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      We camped out on a patch of grass where there were a few stunted birches
      with white stems. The hampers were opened, and Herr Mack saw to the
      bottles. Light dresses, blue eyes, the ring of glasses, the sea, the white
      sails. And we sang a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      And cheeks were flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, my whole being was joy; even little things affected me. A
      veil fluttering from a hat, a girl's hair coming down, a pair of eyes
      closing in a laugh&mdash;and it touched me. That day, that day!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard you've such a queer little hut up there, Lieutenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a nest. And the very thing for me. Come and see me there one day;
      there's no such hut anywhere else. And the great forest behind it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another came up and said kindly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not been up here in the north before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But I know all about it already, ladies. At night I am
      face to face with the mountains, the earth, and the sun. But I will not
      try to use fine words. What a summer you have here! It bursts forth one
      night when everyone is asleep, and in the morning there it is. I looked
      out of my window and saw it myself. I have two little windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A third came up. She was charming by reason of her voice and her small
      hands. How charming they all were! This one said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we change flowers? It brings luck, they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, holding out my hand, &ldquo;let us change flowers, and I
      thank you for it. How pretty you are! You have a lovely voice; I have been
      listening to it all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she drew back her harebells and said curtly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking about? It was not you I meant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not me she meant! It hurt me to feel that I had been mistaken; I
      wished myself at home again, far away in my hut, where only the wind could
      speak to me. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;forgive me.&rdquo; The other ladies
      looked at one another and moved away, so as not to humiliate me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment someone came quickly over towards us. All could see
      her&mdash;it was Edwarda. She came straight to me. She said something, and
      threw her arms round my neck; clasped her arms round my neck and kissed me
      again and again on the lips. Each time she said something, but I did not
      hear what it was. I could not understand it all; my heart stood still; I
      had only a feeling of her burning look. Then she slipped away from me; her
      little breast beat up and down. She stood there still, with her brown face
      and brown neck, tall and slender, with flashing eyes, altogether heedless.
      They were all looking at her. For the second time I was fascinated by her
      dark eyebrows, that curved high up into her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, Heavens&mdash;the girl had kissed me openly in sight of them all!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Edwarda?&rdquo; I asked, and I could hear my blood beating; hear it
      as it were from down in my throat, so that I could not speak distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Only&mdash;that I wanted to. It doesn't matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took off my cap and brushed back my hair mechanically as I stood looking
      at her. &ldquo;Doesn't matter...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack was saying something, a good way off; we could not hear his
      words from where we were. But I was glad to think that Herr Mack had seen
      nothing, that he knew nothing of this. It was well indeed that he had been
      away from the party just then. I felt relieved at that, and I stepped over
      to the others and said with a laugh, and seeming quite indifferent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would ask you all to forgive my unseemly behavior a moment ago; I am
      myself extremely sorry about it. Edwarda kindly offered to change flowers
      with me, and I forgot myself. I beg her pardon and yours. Put yourself in
      my place; I live all alone, and am not accustomed to the society of
      ladies; besides which, I have been drinking wine, and am not used to that
      either. You must make allowances for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I laughed, and showed great indifference to such a trifle, that it
      might be forgotten; but, inwardly, I was serious. Moreover, what I had
      said made no impression on Edwarda. She did not try to hide anything, to
      smooth over the effect of her hasty action: on the contrary, she sat down
      close to me and kept looking at me fixedly. Now and again she spoke to me.
      And afterwards, when we were playing &ldquo;<i>Enke</i>,&rdquo; she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have Lieutenant Glahn. I don't care to run after anyone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Saa for Satan</i>, [Footnote: Expletive, equivalent to &ldquo;The Devil!&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo;] girl, be quiet!&rdquo; I whispered, stamping my foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave me a look of surprise, made a wry face as if it hurt, and then
      smiled bashfully. I was deeply moved at that; the helpless look in her
      eyes and her little thin figure were more than I could resist; I was drawn
      to her in that moment, and I took her long, slight hand in mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;No more now. We can meet again to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>

      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the night I heard Æsop get up from his corner and growl; I heard it
      through my sleep, but I was dreaming just then of shooting, the growl of
      the dog fitted into the dream, and it did not wake me, quite. When I
      stepped out of the hut next morning there were tracks in the grass of a
      pair of human feet; someone had been there&mdash;had gone first to one of
      my windows, then to the other. The tracks were lost again down on the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came towards me with hot cheeks, with a face all beaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been waiting?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was afraid you would have to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not been waiting; she was on the way before me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you slept well?&rdquo; I asked. I hardly knew what to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't. I have been awake,&rdquo; she answered. And she told me she had
      not slept that night, but had sat in a chair with her eyes closed. And she
      had been out of the house for a little walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone was outside my hut last night,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I saw tracks in the
      grass this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her face colored; she took my hand there, on the road, and made no
      answer. I looked at her, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it you, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, pressing close to me. &ldquo;It was I. I hope I didn't wake
      you&mdash;I stepped as quietly as I could. Yes, it was I. I was near you
      again. I am fond of you!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every day, every day I met her. I will tell the truth: I was glad to meet
      her; aye, my heart flew. It is two years ago this year; now, I think of it
      only when I please, the whole story just amuses and distracts me. And as
      for the two green feathers, I will tell about them in good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several places where we could meet&mdash;at the mill, on the
      road, even in my hut. She came wherever I would. <i>&ldquo;Goddag!&rdquo;</i> she
      cried, always first, and I answered <i>&ldquo;Goddag!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are happy to-day,&rdquo; she says, and her eyes sparkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am happy,&rdquo; I answer. &ldquo;There is a speck there on your shoulder; it
      is dust, perhaps, a speck of mud from the road; I must kiss that little
      spot. No&mdash;let me&mdash;I will. Everything about you stirs me so! I am
      half out of my senses. I did not sleep last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was true. Many a night I lay and could not sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walk side by side along the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think&mdash;am I as you like me to be?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;Perhaps I
      talk too much. No? Oh, but you must say what you really think. Sometimes I
      think to myself this can never come to any good...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can never come to any good?&rdquo; I ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This between us. That it cannot come to any good. You may believe it or
      not, but I am shivering now with cold; I feel icy cold the moment I come
      to you. Just out of happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same with me,&rdquo; I answer. &ldquo;I feel a shiver, too, when I see you.
      But it will come to some good all the same. And, anyhow, let me pat you on
      the back, to warm you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she lets me, half unwillingly, and then I hit a little harder, for a
      jest, and laugh, and ask if that doesn't make her feel better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please, don't when I ask you; <i>please</i>,&rdquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those few words! There was something so helpless about her saying it so,
      the wrong way round: &ldquo;Please don't when I ask you.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we went on along the road again. Was she displeased with me for my
      jest, I wondered? And thought to myself: Well, let us see. And I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just happened to think of something. Once when I was out on a sledge
      party, there was a young lady who took a silk kerchief from her neck and
      fastened it round mine. In the evening, I said to her: 'You shall have
      your kerchief again to-morrow; I will have it washed.' 'No,' she said,
      'give it to me now; I will keep it just as it is, after you have worn it.'
      And I gave it to her. Three years after, I met the same young lady again.
      'The kerchief,' I said. And she brought it out. It lay in a paper, just as
      before; I saw it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda glanced up at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? And what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;There was nothing more. But I thought it was nice
      of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that lady now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We spoke no more of that. But when it was time for her to go home, she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-night. But you won't go thinking of that lady any more, will
      you? I don't think of anyone but you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I believed her. I saw that she meant what she said, and it was more than
      enough for me that she thought of no one else. I walked after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Edwarda,&rdquo; I said. And then I added with all my heart: &ldquo;You are
      all too good for me, but I am thankful that you will have me; God will
      reward you for that. I'm not so fine as many you could have, no doubt, but
      I am all yours&mdash;so endlessly yours, by my eternal soul.&mdash;&mdash;What
      are you thinking of now, to bring tears to your eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nothing,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It sounded so strange&mdash;that God
      would reward me for that. You say things that I ... Oh, I love you so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And all at once she threw her arms round my neck, there in the middle of
      the road, and kissed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone, I stepped aside into the woods to hide, to be alone
      with my happiness. And then I hurried eagerly back to the road to see if
      anyone had noticed that I had gone in there. But I saw no one.

    <h2>
      XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Summer nights and still water, and the woods endlessly still. No cry, no
      footsteps from the road. My heart seemed full as with dark wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moths and night-flies came flying noiselessly in through my window, lured
      by the glow from the hearth and the smell of the bird I had just cooked.
      They dashed against the roof with a dull sound, fluttered past my ears,
      sending a cold shiver through me, and settled on my white powder-horn on
      the wall. I watched them; they sat trembling and looked at me&mdash;moths
      and spinners and burrowing things. Some of them looked like pansies on the
      wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped outside the hut and listened. Nothing, no noise; all was asleep.
      The air was alight with flying insects, myriads of buzzing wings. Out at
      the edge of the wood were ferns and aconite, the trailing arbutus was in
      bloom, and I loved its tiny flowers... Thanks, my God, for every heather
      bloom I have ever seen; they have been like small roses on my way, and I
      weep for love of them... Somewhere near were wild carnations; I could not
      see them, but I could mark their scent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, in the night hours, great white flowers have opened suddenly;
      their chalices are spread wide; they are breathing. And furry twilight
      moths slip down into their petals, making the whole plant quiver. I go
      from one flower to another. They are drunken flowers. I mark the stages of
      their intoxication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light footsteps, a human breathing, a happy &ldquo;<i>Godaften</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I answer, and throw myself down on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Godaften</i>, Edwarda,&rdquo; I say again, worn out with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you should care for me so!&rdquo; she whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I answered her: &ldquo;If you knew how grateful I can be! You are mine, and
      my heart lies still within me all the day, thinking of you. You are the
      loveliest girl on earth, and I have kissed you. Often I go red with joy,
      only to think that I have kissed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so fond of me this evening?&rdquo; she asks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was that for endless reasons; I needed only to think of her to feel so.
      That look of hers, from under the high-arched brows, and her rich, dark
      skin!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should I not be fond of you?&rdquo; I say again. &ldquo;I thank every tree in my path
      because you are well and strong. Once at a dance there was a young lady
      who sat out dance after dance, and they let her sit there alone. I didn't
      know her, but her face touched me, and I bowed to her. Well? But no, she
      shook her head. Would she not dance, I asked her? 'Can you imagine it?'
      she said. 'My father was a handsome man, and my mother a perfect beauty,
      and my father won her by storm. But I was born lame.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us sit down,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we sat down in the heather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what my friend says about you?&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;Your eyes are
      like an animal's, she says, and when you look at her, it makes her mad. It
      is just as if you touched her, she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A strange joy thrilled me when I heard that, not for my own sake, but for
      Edwarda's, and I thought to myself: There is only one whom I care for:
      what does that one say of the look in my eyes? And I asked her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that, your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not tell you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it was one of those that were out on
      the island that day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then we spoke of other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is going to Russia in a few days,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I am going to
      have a party. Have you been out to Korholmerne? We must have two hampers
      of wine; the ladies from the vicarage are coming again, and father has
      already given me the wine. And you won't look at her again, will you? My
      friend, I mean. Please, you won't, <i>will</i> you? Or I shall not ask her
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with no more words she threw herself passionately about my neck, and
      looked at me, gazing into my face and breathing heavily. Her glance was
      sheer blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up abruptly, and, in my confusion, could only say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So your father is going to Russia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you get up like that for, so quickly?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is late, Edwarda,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Now the white flowers are closing
      again. The sun is getting up; it will soon be day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went with her through the woodland and stood watching her as long as I
      could; far down, she turned round and softly called good-night. Then she
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same moment the door of the blacksmith's house opened. A man with a
      white shirt front came out, looked round, pulled his hat down farther over
      his forehead, and took the road down to Sirilund.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda's good-night was still in my ears.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      A man can be drunk with joy. I fire off my gun, and an unforgettable echo
      answers from hill to hill, floats out over the sea and rings in some
      sleepy helmsman's ears. And what have I to be joyful about? A thought that
      came to me, a memory; a sound in the woods, a human being. I think of her,
      I close my eyes and stand still there on the road, and think of her; I
      count the minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I am thirsty, and drink from the stream; now I walk a hundred paces
      forward and a hundred paces back; it must be late by now, I say to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can there be anything wrong? A month has passed, and a month is no long
      time; there is nothing wrong. Heaven knows this month has been short. But
      the nights are often long, and I am driven to wet my cap in the stream and
      let it dry, only to pass the time, while I am waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reckoned my time by nights. Sometimes there would be an evening when
      Edwarda did not come&mdash;once she stayed away two evenings. Nothing
      wrong, no. But I felt then that perhaps my happiness had reached and
      passed its height.
    </p>
    <p>
      And had it not?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you hear, Edwarda, how restless it is in the woods to-night? Rustling
      incessantly in the undergrowth, and the big leaves trembling. Something
      brewing, maybe&mdash;but it was not that I had in mind to say. I hear a
      bird away up on the hill&mdash;only a tomtit, but it has sat there calling
      in the same place two nights now. Can you hear&mdash;the same, same note
      again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hear it. Why do you ask me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, for no reason at all. It has been there two nights now. That was
      all... Thanks, thanks for coming this evening, love. I sat here, expecting
      you this evening, or the next, looking forward to it, when you came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have been waiting too. I think of you, and I have picked up the
      pieces of the glass you upset once, and kept them&mdash;do you remember?
      Father went away last night. I could not come, there was so much to do
      with the packing, and reminding him of things. I knew you were waiting
      here in the woods, and I cried, and went on packing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it is two evenings, I thought to myself. What was she doing the first
      evening? And why is there less joy in her eyes now than before?
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour passed. The bird up in the hills was silent, the woods lay dead.
      No, no, nothing wrong; all as before; she gave me her hand to say
      good-night, and looked at me with love in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not to-morrow,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not ask her why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow is our party,&rdquo; she said with a laugh. &ldquo;I was only going to
      surprise you, but you looked so miserable, I had to tell you at once. I
      was going to send you an invitation all on paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And my heart was lightened unspeakably.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went off, nodding farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing more,&rdquo; said I, standing where I was. &ldquo;How long is it since you
      gathered up the pieces of that glass and put them away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;a week ago, perhaps, or a fortnight. Yes, perhaps a fortnight.
      But why do you ask? Well, I will tell you the truth&mdash;it was
      yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yesterday! No longer ago than yesterday she had thought of me. All was
      well again now.

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two boats lay ready, and we stepped on board. Talking and singing. The
      place, Korholmerne, lay out beyond the islands; it took a good while to
      row across, and on the way we talked, one party with another, from boat to
      boat. The Doctor wore light things, as the ladies did; I had never seen
      him so pleased before; he talked with the rest, instead of listening in
      silence. I had an idea he had been drinking a little, and so was in good
      humor to-day. When we landed, he craved the attention of the party for a
      moment, and bade us welcome. I thought to myself: This means that Edwarda
      has asked him to act as host.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell to entertaining the ladies in the most amiable manner. To Edwarda
      he was polite and kind, often fatherly, and pedantically instructive, as
      he had been so many times before. She spoke of some date or other, saying:
      &ldquo;I was born in '38,&rdquo; and he asked, &ldquo;Eighteen hundred and thirty-eight, I
      suppose you mean?&rdquo; And if she had answered, &ldquo;No, in nineteen hundred and
      thirty-eight,&rdquo; he would have shown no embarrassment, but only corrected
      her again, and said, &ldquo;I think you must be mistaken.&rdquo; When I said anything
      myself, he listened politely and attentively, and did not ignore me.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young girl came up to me with a greeting. I did not recognize her; I
      could not remember her at all, and I said a few words in surprise, and she
      laughed. It was one of the Dean's daughters. I had met her the day we went
      to the island before, and had invited her to my hut. We talked together a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or so passed by. I was feeling dull, and drank from the wine
      poured out for me, and mixed with the others, chatting with them all.
      Again I made a mistake here and there: I was on doubtful ground, and could
      not tell at the moment how to answer any little civility; now and then I
      talked incoherently, or even found nothing at all to say, and this
      troubled me. Over by the big rock which we were using as a table sat the
      Doctor, gesticulating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soul&mdash;what is the soul?&rdquo; he was saying. The Dean's daughter had
      accused him of being a free-thinker&mdash;well, and should not a man think
      freely? People imagined hell as a sort of house down under the ground,
      with the devil as host&mdash;or rather as sovereign lord. Then he spoke of
      the altar picture in the chapel, a figure of the Christ, with a few Jews
      and Jewesses; water into wine&mdash;well and good. But Christ had a halo
      round His head. And what was a halo? Simply a yellow hoop fixed on three
      hairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of the ladies clasped their hands aghast, but the Doctor extricated
      himself, and said jestingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds horrible, doesn't it? I admit it. But if you repeat it and repeat
      it again to yourself seven or eight times, and then think it over a
      little, it soon sounds easier... Ladies, your very good health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he knelt on the grass before the two ladies, and instead of taking his
      hat off and laying it before him he held it straight up in the air with
      one hand, and emptied his glass with his head bent back. I was altogether
      carried away by his wonderful ease of manner, and would have drunk with
      him myself but that his glass was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda was following him with her eyes. I placed myself near her, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we play '<i>Enke</i>' to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started slightly, and got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful not to say '<i>Du</i>' to each other now,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I had not said &ldquo;<i>Du</i>&rdquo; at all. I walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another hour passed. The day was getting long; I would have rowed home
      alone long before if there had been a third boat; Æsop lay tied up in the
      hut, and perhaps he was thinking of me. Edwarda's thoughts must surely be
      far away from me; she talked of how lovely it would be to travel, and see
      strange places; her cheeks flushed at the thought, and she even stumbled
      in her speech:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one could be more happier than I the day ...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'More happier'...?&rdquo; said the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'More happier.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said 'more happier,' I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? I'm sorry. No one could be happier than I the day I stood on board
      the ship. Sometimes I long for places I do not know myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She longed to be away; she did not think of me. I stood there, and read in
      her face that she had forgotten me. Well, there was nothing to be said&mdash;but
      I stood there myself and saw it in her face. And the minutes dragged so
      miserably slowly by! I asked several of the others if we ought not to row
      back now; it was getting late, I said, and Æsop was tied up in the hut.
      But none of them wanted to go back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went over again to the Dean's daughter, for the third time; I thought
      she must be the one that had said I had eyes like an animal's. We drank
      together; she had quivering eyes, they were never still; she kept looking
      at me and then looking away, all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fröken,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do you not think people here in these parts are like
      the short summer itself? In their feeling, I mean? Beautiful, but lasting
      only a little while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I spoke loudly, very loudly, and I did so on purpose. And I went on
      speaking loudly, and asked that young lady once more if she would not like
      to come up one day and see my hut. &ldquo;Heaven bless you for it,&rdquo; I said in my
      distress, and I was already thinking to myself how, perhaps, I might find
      something to give her as a present if she came. Perhaps I had nothing to
      give her but my powder-horn, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she promised to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda sat with her face turned away and let me talk as much as I
      pleased. She listened to what the others said, putting in a word herself
      now and again. The Doctor told the young ladies' fortunes by their hands,
      and talked a lot; he himself had small, delicate hands, with a ring on one
      finger. I felt myself unwanted, and sat down by myself awhile on a stone.
      It was getting late in the afternoon. Here I am, I said to myself, sitting
      all alone on a stone, and the only creature that could make me move, she
      lets me sit. Well, then, I care no more than she.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great feeling of forsakenness came over me. I could hear them talking
      behind me, and I heard how Edwarda laughed; and at that I got up suddenly
      and went over to the party. My excitement ran away with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It occurred to me while I was sitting there that
      perhaps you might like to see my fly-book.&rdquo; And I took it out. &ldquo;I am sorry
      I did not think of it before. Just look through it, if you please; I
      should be only too delighted. You must all see it; there are both red and
      yellow flies in it.&rdquo; And I held my cap in my hand as I spoke. I was myself
      aware that I had taken off my cap, and I knew that this was wrong, so I
      put it on again at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was deep silence for a moment, and no one offered to take the book.
      At last the Doctor reached out his hand for it and said politely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks very much; let us look at the things. It's always been a marvel to
      me how those flies were put together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make them myself,&rdquo; I said, full of gratitude. And I went on at once to
      explain how it was done. It was simple enough: I bought the feathers and
      the hooks. They were not well made, but they were only for my own use. One
      could get ready-made flies in the shops, and they were beautiful things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda cast one careless glance at me and my book, and went on talking
      with her girl friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here are some of the feathers,&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;Look, these are
      really fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The green ones are pretty,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;let me look, Doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep them,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Yes, do, I beg you, now. Two green feathers. Do, as
      a kindness, let them be a keepsake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at them and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are green and gold, as you turn them in the sun. Thank you, if you
      will give me them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be glad to,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she took the feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later the Doctor handed me the book and thanked me. Then he got
      up and asked if it were not nearly time to be getting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;Yes, for Heaven's sake. I have a dog tied up at home; look you, I
      have a dog, and he is my friend; he lies there thinking of me, and when I
      come home he stands with his forepaws at the window to greet me. It has
      been a lovely day, and now it is nearly over; let us go back. I am
      grateful to you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I waited on the shore to see which boat Edwarda chose, and made up my mind
      to go in the other one myself. Suddenly she called me. I looked at her in
      surprise; her face was flushed. Then she came up to me, held out her hand,
      and said tenderly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for the feathers. You will come in the boat with me, won't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We got into the boat, and she sat down beside me on the same seat, her
      knee touching mine. I looked at her, and she glanced at me for a moment in
      return. I began to feel myself repaid for that bitter day, and was growing
      happy again, when she suddenly changed her position, turned her back to
      me, and began talking to the Doctor, who was sitting at the rudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a full quarter of an hour I did not exist for her. Then I did
      something I repent of, and have not yet forgotten. Her shoe fell off: I
      snatched it up and flung it far out into the water, for pure joy that she
      was near, or from some impulse to make myself remarked, to remind her of
      my existence&mdash;I do not know. It all happened so suddenly I did not
      think, only felt that impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies set up a cry. I myself was as if paralyzed by what I had done,
      but what was the good of that? It was done. The Doctor came to my help; he
      cried &ldquo;Row,&rdquo; and steered towards the shoe. And the next moment the boatman
      had caught hold of the shoe just as it had filled with water and was
      sinking; the man's arm was wet up to the elbow. Then there was a shout of
      &ldquo;Hurra&rdquo; from many in the boats, because the shoe was saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was deeply ashamed, and felt that my face changed color and winced, as I
      wiped the shoe with my handkerchief. Edwarda took it without a word. Not
      till a little while after did she say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw such a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, did you ever?&rdquo; I said. And I smiled and pulled myself together,
      making as if I had played that trick for some particular reason&mdash;as
      if there were something behind it. But what could there be? The Doctor
      looked at me, for the first time, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little time passed; the boats glided homeward; the feeling of
      awkwardness among the party disappeared; we sang; we were nearing the
      land. Edwarda said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we haven't finished the wine: there is ever so much left. We must
      have another party, a new party later on; we must have a dance, a ball in
      the big room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When we went ashore I made an apology to Edwarda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew how I wished myself back in my hut!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;This has been a
      long and painful day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has it been a painful day for you, Lieutenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said I, trying to pass it off, &ldquo;I mean, I have caused
      unpleasantness both to myself and others. I threw your shoe into the
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;an extraordinary thing to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      What worse things might still happen? I resolved to keep calm, whatever
      might come; Heaven is my witness. Was it I who had forced myself on her
      from the first? No, no; never! I was but standing in her way one week-day
      as she passed. What a summer it was here in the north! Already the
      cockchafers had ceased to fly, and people were grown more and more
      difficult to understand, for all that the sun shone on them day and night.
      What were their blue eyes looking for, and what were they thinking behind
      their mysterious lashes? Well, after all, they were all equally
      indifferent to me. I took out my lines and went fishing for two days, four
      days; but at night I lay with open eyes in the hut...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edwarda, I have not seen you for four days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four days, yes&mdash;so it is. Oh, but I have been so busy. Come and
      look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led me into the big room. The tables had been moved out, the chairs
      set round the walls, everything shifted; the chandelier, the stove, and
      the walls were fantastically decorated with heather and black stuff from
      the store. The piano stood in one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were her preparations for &ldquo;the ball.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonderful,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;Listen, Edwarda&mdash;have you quite forgotten me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand you,&rdquo; she answered in surprise. &ldquo;You saw all I had
      been doing&mdash;how could I come and see you at the same time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I agreed; &ldquo;perhaps you couldn't.&rdquo; I was sick and exhausted with want
      of sleep, my speech grew meaningless and uncontrolled; I had been
      miserable the whole day. &ldquo;No, of course you could not come. But I was
      going to say ... in a word, something has changed; there is something
      wrong. Yes. But I cannot read in your face what it is. There is something
      very strange about your brow, Edwarda. Yes, I can see it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have not forgotten you,&rdquo; she cried, blushing, and slipped her arm
      suddenly into mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? Well, perhaps you have not forgotten me. But if so, then I do not
      know what I am saying. One or the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have an invitation to-morrow. You must dance with me. Oh, how
      we will dance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go a little way with me?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now? No, I can't,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;The Doctor will be here presently. He's
      going to help me with something; there is a good deal still to be done.
      And you think the room will look all right as it is? But don't you
      think...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A carriage stops outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the Doctor driving to-day?&rdquo; I ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I sent a horse for him. I wanted to ...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare his bad foot, yes. Well, I must be off. <i>Goddag, Goddag</i>,
      Doctor. Pleased to see you again. Well and fit, I hope? Excuse my running
      off...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once down the steps outside, I turned round. Edwarda was standing at the
      window watching me; she stood holding the curtains aside with both hands,
      to see; and her look was thoughtful. A foolish joy thrilled me; I hurried
      away from the house light-footed, with a darkness shading my eyes; my gun
      was light as a walking-stick in my hand. If I could win her, I should
      become a good man, I thought. I reached the woods and thought again: If I
      might win her, I would serve her more untiringly than any other; and even
      if she proved unworthy, if she took a fancy to demand impossibilities, I
      would yet do all that I could, and be glad that she was mine... I stopped,
      fell on my knees, and in humility and hope licked a few blades of grass by
      the roadside, and then got up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last I began to feel almost sure. Her altered behavior of late&mdash;it
      was only her manner. She had stood looking after me when I went; stood at
      the window following with her eyes till I disappeared. What more could she
      do? My delight upset me altogether; I was hungry, and no longer felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Æsop ran on ahead; a moment afterward he began to bark. I looked up; a
      woman with a white kerchief on her head was standing by the corner of the
      hut. It was Eva, the blacksmith's daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Goddag</i>, Eva!&rdquo; I called to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood by the big grey stone, her face all red, sucking one finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it you, Eva? What is the matter?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Æsop has bitten me,&rdquo; she answered, with some awkwardness, and cast down
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her finger. She had bitten it herself. A thought flashed into
      my mind, and I asked her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been waiting here long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not very long,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And without a word more from either of us, I took her by the hand and let
      her into the hut.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      I came from my fishing as usual, and appeared at the &ldquo;ball&rdquo; with the gun
      and bag&mdash;only I had put on my best leather suit. It was late when I
      got to Sirilund; I heard them dancing inside. Someone called out: &ldquo;Here's
      the hunter, the Lieutenant.&rdquo; A few of the young people crowded round me
      and wanted to see my catch; I had shot a brace of seabirds and caught a
      few haddock. Edwarda bade me welcome with a smile; she had been dancing,
      and was flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first dance with me,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we danced. Nothing awkward happened; I turned giddy, but did not fall.
      My heavy boots made a certain amount of noise; I could hear it myself, the
      noise, and resolved not to dance any more; I had even scratched their
      painted floor. But how glad I was that I had done nothing worse!
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack's two assistants from the store were there, laboriously and with
      a solemn concentration. The Doctor took part eagerly in the set dances.
      Besides these gentlemen, there were four other youngish men, sons of
      families belonging to the parish, the Dean, and the district surgeons. A
      stranger, a commercial traveller, was there too; he made himself remarked
      by his fine voice, and tralala'ed to the music; now and again he relieved
      the ladies at the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot remember now what happened the first few hours, but I remember
      everything from the latter part of the night. The sun shone redly in
      through the windows all the time, and the seabirds slept. We had wine and
      cakes, we talked loud and sang, Edwarda's laugh sounded fresh and careless
      through the room. But why had she never a word for me now? I went towards
      where she was sitting, and would have said something polite to her, as
      best I could; she was wearing a black dress, her confirmation dress,
      perhaps, and it was grown too short for her, but it suited her when she
      danced, and I thought to tell her so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That black dress...&rdquo; I began.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she stood up, put her arm round one of her girl friends, and walked
      off with her. This happened two or three times. Well, I thought to myself,
      if it's like that... But then why should she stand looking sorrowfully
      after me from the window when I go? Well, 'tis her affair!
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady asked me to dance. Edwarda was sitting near, and I answered loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am going home directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda threw a questioning glance at me, and said: &ldquo;Going? Oh, no, you
      mustn't go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started, and felt that I was biting my lip. I got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you said then seemed very significant to me, Edwarda,&rdquo; I said
      darkly, and made a few steps towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor put himself in my way, and Edwarda herself came hurrying up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't misunderstand me,&rdquo; she said warmly. &ldquo;I meant to say I hoped you
      would be the last to go, the very last. And besides, it's only one
      o'clock... Listen,&rdquo; she went on with sparkling eyes, &ldquo;you gave our boatmen
      five <i>daler</i> for saving my shoe. It was too much.&rdquo; And she laughed
      heartily and turned round to the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood with open mouth, disarmed and confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pleased to be witty,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I never gave your boatman five <i>daler</i>
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, didn't you?&rdquo; She opened the door to the kitchen, and called the
      boatmen in. &ldquo;Jakob, you remember the day you rowed us out to Korholmerne,
      and you picked up my shoe when it fell into the water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jakob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were given five <i>daler</i> for saving it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you gave me...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, that will do, you can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now what did she mean by that trick? I thought she was trying to shame me.
      She should not succeed; I was not going to have that to blush for. And I
      said loudly and distinctly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must point out to all here that this is either a mistake or a lie. I
      have never so much as thought of giving the boatman five <i>daler</i> for
      your shoe. I ought to have done so, perhaps, but up to now it has not been
      done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereupon we shall continue the dance,&rdquo; she said, frowning. &ldquo;Why aren't
      we dancing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She owes me an explanation of this,&rdquo; I said to myself, and watched for an
      opportunity to speak with her. She went into a side room, and I followed
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Skaal</i>,&rdquo; I said, and lifted a glass to drink with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing in my glass,&rdquo; she answered shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her glass was standing in front of her, quite full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that was your glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not mine,&rdquo; she answered, and turned away, and was in deep
      conversation with someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon then,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of the guests had noticed this little scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart was hissing within me. I said offendedly: &ldquo;But at least you owe
      me an explanation...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, took both my hands, and said earnestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not to-day; not now. I am so miserable. Heavens, how you look at me.
      We were friends once...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Overwhelmed, I turned right about, and went in to the dancers again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after, Edwarda herself came in and took up her place by the
      piano, at which the travelling man was seated, playing a dance; her face
      at that moment was full of inward pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never learned to play,&rdquo; she said, looking at me with dark eyes.
      &ldquo;If I only could!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could make no answer to this. But my heart flew out towards her once
      more, and I asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so unhappy all at once, Edwarda? If you knew how it hurts me
      to see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what it is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everything, perhaps. I wish all
      these people would go away at once, all of them. No, not you&mdash;remember,
      you must stay till the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again her words revived me, and my eyes saw the light in the
      sun-filled room. The Dean's daughter came over, and began talking to me; I
      wished her ever so far away, and gave her short answers. And I purposely
      kept from looking at her, for she had said that about my eyes being like
      an animal's. She turned to Edwarda and told her that once, somewhere
      abroad&mdash;in Riga I think it was&mdash;a man had followed her along the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kept walking after me, street after street, and smiling across at me,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, was he blind, then?&rdquo; I broke in, thinking to please Edwarda. And I
      shrugged my shoulders as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady understood my coarseness at once, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must have been blind indeed, to run after any one so old and ugly as I
      am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I gained no thanks from Edwarda for that: she drew her friend away;
      they whispered together and shook their heads. After that, I was left
      altogether to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another hour passed. The seabirds began to wake out on the reefs; their
      cries sounded in through the open windows. A spasm of joy went through me
      at this first calling of the birds, and I longed to be out there on the
      islands myself...
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor, once more in good humor, drew the attention of all present.
      The ladies were never tired of his society. Is that thing there my rival?
      I thought, noting his lame leg and miserable figure. He had taken to a new
      and amusing oath: he said <i>Död og Pinsel</i>, [Footnote: A slight
      variation of the usual Död og Pine (death and torture).] and every time he
      used that comical expression I laughed aloud. In my misery I wished to
      give the fellow every advantage I could, since he was my rival. I let it
      be &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; here and &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; there, and called out myself: &ldquo;Listen to the
      Doctor!&rdquo; and laughed aloud at the things he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love this world,&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;I cling to life tooth and nail. And
      when I come to die, then I hope to find a corner somewhere straight up
      over London and Paris, where I can hear the rumble of the human cancan all
      the time, all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; I cried, and choked with laughter, though I was not in the
      least bit drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda too seemed delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the guests began to go, I slipped away into the little room at the
      side and sat down to wait. I heard one after another saying good-bye on
      the stairs; the Doctor also took his leave and went. Soon all the voices
      had died away. My heart beat violently as I waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda came in again. At sight of me she stood a moment in surprise; then
      she said with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, are you there? It was kind of you to wait till the last. I am tired
      out now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She remained standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up then, and said: &ldquo;You will be wanting rest now. I hope you are not
      displeased any more, Edwarda. You were so unhappy a while back, and it
      hurt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be all right when I have slept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had no more to add. I went towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, offering her hand. &ldquo;It was a pleasant evening.&rdquo; She
      would have seen me to the door, but I tried to prevent her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;do not trouble, I can find my way...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she went with me all the same. She stood in the passage waiting
      patiently while I found my cap, my gun, and my bag. There was a
      walking-stick in the corner; I saw it well enough; I stared at it, and
      recognized it&mdash;it was the Doctor's. When she marked what I was
      looking at, she blushed in confusion; it was plain to see from her face
      that she was innocent, that she knew nothing of the stick. A whole minute
      passed. At last she turned, furiously impatient, and said tremblingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your stick&mdash;do not forget your stick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there before my eyes she handed me the Doctor's stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at her. She was still holding out the stick; her hand trembled.
      To make an end of it, I took the thing, and set it back in the corner. I
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Doctor's stick. I cannot understand how a lame man could forget
      his stick.&rdquo; &ldquo;You and your lame man!&rdquo; she cried bitterly, and took a step
      forward towards me. &ldquo;You are not lame&mdash;no; but even if you were, you
      could not compare with him; no, you could never compare with him. There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sought for some answer, but my mind was suddenly empty; I was silent.
      With a deep bow, I stepped backwards out of the door, and down on to the
      steps. There I stood a moment looking straight before me; then I moved
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, he has forgotten his stick,&rdquo; I thought to myself. &ldquo;And he will come
      back this way to fetch it. He would not let <i>me</i> be the last man to
      leave the house...&rdquo; I walked up the road very slowly, keeping a lookout
      either way, and stopped at the edge of the wood. At last, after half an
      hour's waiting, the Doctor came walking towards me; he had seen me, and
      was walking quickly. Before he had time to speak I lifted my cap, to try
      him. He raised his hat in return. I went straight up to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave you no greeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came a step nearer and stared at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave me no greeting...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is all the same to me what you did,&rdquo; he said, turning pale. &ldquo;I
      was going to fetch my stick; I left it behind.&rdquo; I could say nothing in
      answer to this, but I took my revenge another way; I stretched out my gun
      before him, as if he were a dog, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I whistled, as if coaxing him to jump over.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he struggled with himself; his face took on the strangest
      play of expression as he pressed his lips together and held his eyes fixed
      on the ground. Suddenly he looked at me sharply; a half smile lit up his
      features, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you really mean by all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not answer, but his words affected me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he held out his hand to me, and said gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something wrong with you. If you will tell me what it is, then
      perhaps...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I was overwhelmed now with shame and despair; his calm words made me lose
      my balance. I wished to show him some kindness in return, and I put my arm
      round him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me this! No, what could be wrong with me? There is nothing wrong;
      I have no need of your help. You are looking for Edwarda, perhaps? You
      will find her at home. But make haste, or she will have gone to bed before
      you come; she was very tired, I could see it myself. I tell you the best
      news I can, now; it is true. You will find her at home&mdash;go, then!&rdquo;
       And I turned and hurried away from him, striking out with a long stride up
      through the woods and back to the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while I sat there on the bed just as I had come in, with my bag over
      my shoulder and my gun in my hand. Strange thoughts passed through my
      mind. Why ever had I given myself away so to that Doctor? The thought that
      I had put my arm round him and looked at him with wet eyes angered me; he
      would chuckle over it, I thought; perhaps at that very moment he might be
      sitting laughing over it, with Edwarda. He had set his stick aside in the
      hall. Yes, even if I were lame, I could not compare with the Doctor. I
      could never compare with him&mdash;those were her words...
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped out into the middle of the floor, cocked my gun, set the muzzle
      against my left instep, and pulled the trigger. The shot passed through
      the middle of the foot and pierced the floor. Æsop gave a short terrified
      bark.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after there came a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to disturb you,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;You went off so suddenly, I thought it
      might do no harm if we had a little talk together. Smell of powder, isn't
      there...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was perfectly sober. &ldquo;Did you see Edwarda? Did you get your stick?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found my stick. But Edwarda had gone to bed... What's that? Heavens,
      man, you're bleeding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing to speak of. I was just putting the gun away, and it went
      off; it's nothing. Devil take you, am I obliged to sit here and give you
      all sorts of information about that...? You found your stick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he did not heed my words; he was staring at my torn boot and the
      trickle of blood. With a quick movement he laid down his stick and took
      off his gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit still&mdash;I must get that boot off. I <i>thought</i> it was a shot
      I heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <h2>
      XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      How I repented of it afterward&mdash;that business with the gun. It was a
      mad thing to do. It was not worth while any way, and it served no purpose,
      only kept me tied down to the hut for weeks. I remember distinctly even
      now all the discomfort and annoyance it caused; my washerwoman had to come
      every day and stay there nearly all the time, making purchases of food,
      looking after my housekeeping, for several weeks. Well, and then...
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the Doctor began talking about Edwarda. I heard her name, heard
      what she had said and done, and it was no longer of any great importance
      to me; it was as if he spoke of some distant, irrelevant thing. So quickly
      one can forget, I thought to myself, and wondered at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what do you think of Edwarda yourself, since you ask? I have
      not thought of her for weeks, to tell the truth. Wait a bit&mdash;it seems
      to me there must have been something between you and her, you were so
      often together. You acted host one day at a picnic on the island, and she
      was hostess. Don't deny it, Doctor, there was something&mdash;a sort of
      understanding. No, for Heaven's sake don't answer me. You owe me no
      explanation, I am not asking to be told anything at all&mdash;let us talk
      of something else if you like. How long before I can get about again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sat there thinking of what I had said. Why was I inwardly afraid lest
      the Doctor should speak out? What was Edwarda to me? I had forgotten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And later the talk turned on her again, and I interrupted him once more&mdash;God
      knows what it was I dreaded to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you break off like that for?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Is it that you can't
      bear to hear me speak her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;what is your honest opinion of Edwarda? I should be
      interested to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at me suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My honest opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you may have something new to tell me to-day. Perhaps you have
      proposed, and been accepted. May I congratulate you? No? Ah, the devil
      trust you&mdash;haha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that was what you were afraid of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid of? My dear Doctor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have not proposed and been accepted. But you have,
      perhaps. There's no proposing to Edwarda&mdash;she will take whomever she
      has a fancy for. Did you take her for a peasant girl? You have met her,
      and seen for yourself. She is a child that's had too little whipping in
      her time, and a woman of many moods. Cold? No fear of that! Warm? Ice, I
      say. What is she, then? A slip of a girl, sixteen or seventeen&mdash;exactly.
      But try to make an impression on that slip of a girl, and she will laugh
      you to scorn for your trouble. Even her father can do nothing with her;
      she obeys him outwardly, but, in point of fact, 'tis she herself that
      rules. She says you have eyes like an animal...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're wrong there&mdash;it was someone else said I had eyes like an
      animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone else? Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. One of her girl friends. No, it was not Edwarda said that.
      Wait a bit though; perhaps, after all, it was Edwarda...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you look at her, it makes her feel so and so, she says. But do you
      think that brings you a hairbreadth nearer? Hardly. Look at her, use your
      eyes as much as you please&mdash;but as soon as she marks what you are
      doing, she will say to herself&mdash;'Ho, here's this man looking at me
      with his eyes, and thinks to win me that way.' And with a single glance,
      or a word, she'll have you ten leagues away. Do you think I don't know
      her? How old do you reckon her to be?&rdquo; &ldquo;She was born in '38, she said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lie. I looked it up, out of curiosity. She's twenty, though she might
      well pass for fifteen. She is not happy; there's a deal of conflict in
      that little head of hers. When she stands looking out at the hills and the
      sea, and her mouth gives that little twitch, that little spasm of pain,
      then she is suffering; but she is too proud, too obstinate for tears. She
      is more than a bit romantic; a powerful imagination; she is waiting for a
      prince. What was that about a certain five-<i>daler</i> note you were
      supposed to have given someone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A jest. It was nothing...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was something all the same. She did something of the same sort with me
      once. It's a year ago now. We were on board the mail-packet while it was
      lying here in the harbour. It was raining, and very cold. A woman with a
      child in her arms was sitting on deck, shivering. Edwarda asked her:
      'Don't you feel cold?' Yes, she did. 'And the little one too?' Yes, the
      little one was cold as well. 'Why don't you go into the cabin?' asks
      Edwarda. 'I've only a steerage ticket,' says the woman. Edwarda looks at
      me. 'The woman here has only a steerage ticket,' she says. 'Well, and what
      then?' I say to myself. But I understand her look. I'm not a rich man;
      what I have I've worked to earn, and I think twice before I spend it; so I
      move away. If Edwarda wants someone to pay for the woman, let her do it
      herself; she and her father can better afford it than I. And sure enough,
      Edwarda paid. She's splendid in that way&mdash;no one can say she hasn't a
      heart. But as true as I'm sitting here she expected me to pay for a saloon
      passage for the woman and child; I could see it in her eyes. And what
      then, do you think? The woman gets up and thanks her for her kindness.
      'Don't thank me&mdash;it was that gentleman there,' says Edwarda, pointing
      to me as calmly as could be. What do you think of that? The woman thanks
      me too; and what can I say? Simply had to leave it as it was. That's just
      one thing about her. But I could tell you many more. And as for the five
      <i>daler</i> to the boatman&mdash;she gave him the money herself. If you
      had done it, she would have flung her arms round you and kissed you on the
      spot. You should have been the lordly cavalier that paid an extravagant
      sum for a worn-out shoe&mdash;that would have suited her ideas; she
      expected it. And as you didn't&mdash;she did it herself in your name.
      That's her way&mdash;reckless and calculating at the same time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no one, then, that can win her?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Severity's what she wants,&rdquo; said the Doctor, evading the question.
      &ldquo;There's something wrong about it all; she has too free a hand; she can do
      as she pleases, and have her own way all the time. People take notice of
      her; no one ever disregards her; there is always something at hand for her
      to work on with effect. Have you noticed the way I treat her myself? Like
      a schoolgirl, a child; I order her about, criticise her way of speaking,
      watch her carefully, and show her up now and again. Do you think she
      doesn't understand it? Oh, she's stiff and proud, it hurts her every time;
      but then again she is too proud to show it. But that's the way she should
      be handled. When you came up here I had been at her for a year like that,
      and it was beginning to tell; she cried with pain and vexation; she was
      growing more reasonable. Then you came along and upset it all. That's the
      way it goes&mdash;one lets go of her and another takes her up again. After
      you, there'll be a third, I suppose&mdash;you never know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho,&rdquo; thought I to myself, &ldquo;the Doctor has something to revenge.&rdquo; And I
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, what made you trouble to tell me all that long story? What was it
      for? Am I to help you with her upbringing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then she's fiery as a volcano,&rdquo; he went on, never heeding my
      question. &ldquo;You asked if no one could ever win her? I don't see why not.
      She is waiting for her prince, and he hasn't come yet. Again and again she
      thinks she's found him, and finds out she's wrong; she thought you were
      the one, especially because you had eyes like an animal. Haha! I say,
      though, Herr Lieutenant, you ought at least to have brought your uniform
      with you. It would have been useful now. Why shouldn't she be won? I have
      seen her wringing her hands with longing for someone to come and take her,
      carry her away, rule over her, body and soul. Yes ... but he must come
      from somewhere&mdash;turn up suddenly one day, and be something out of the
      ordinary. I have an idea that Herr Mack is out on an expedition; there's
      something behind this journey of his. He went off like that once before,
      and brought a man back with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brought a man back with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but he was no good,&rdquo; said the Doctor, with a wry laugh. &ldquo;He was a man
      about my own age, and lame, too, like myself. He wouldn't do for the
      prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he went away again? Where did he go?&rdquo; I asked, looking fixedly at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? Went away? Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; he answered confusedly. &ldquo;Well, well,
      we've been talking too long about this already. That foot of yours&mdash;oh,
      you can begin to walk in a week's time. <i>Au revoir.</i>&rdquo;

    <p>
      A woman's voice outside the hut. The blood rushed to my head&mdash;it was
      Edwarda. &ldquo;Glahn&mdash;Glahn is ill, so I have heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And my washerwoman answered outside the door:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's nearly well again now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That &ldquo;Glahn&mdash;Glahn&rdquo; went through me to the marrow of my bones; she
      said my name twice, and it touched me; her voice was clear and ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened my door without knocking, stepped hastily in, and looked at me.
      And suddenly all seemed as in the old days. There she was in her dyed
      jacket and her apron tied low in front, to give a longer waist. I saw it
      all at once; and her look, her brown face with the eyebrows high-arched
      into the forehead, the strangely tender expression of her hands, all came
      on me so strongly that my brain was in a whirl. I have kissed <i>her</i>!
      I thought to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got up and remained standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you get up, you stand, when I come?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Oh, but sit down.
      Your foot is bad, you shot yourself. Heavens, how did it happen? I did not
      know of it till just now. And I was thinking all the time: What can have
      happened to Glahn? He never comes now. I knew nothing of it all. And you
      had shot yourself, and it was weeks ago, they tell me, and I knew never a
      word. How are you now? You are very pale: I should hardly recognize you.
      And your foot&mdash;will you be lame now? The Doctor says you will not be
      lame. Oh, I am so fond of you because you are not going to be lame! I
      thank God for that. I hope you will forgive me for coming up like this
      without letting you know; I ran nearly all the way...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent over me, she was close to me, I felt her breath on my face; I
      reached out my hands to hold her. Then she moved away a little. Her eyes
      were still dewy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened this way,&rdquo; I stammered out. &ldquo;I was putting the gun away in
      the corner, but I held it awkwardly&mdash;up and down, like that; then
      suddenly I heard the shot. It was an accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An accident,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully, nodding her head. &ldquo;Let me see&mdash;it
      is the left foot&mdash;but why the left more than the right? Yes, of
      course, an accident...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, an accident,&rdquo; I broke in. &ldquo;How should I know why it just happened to
      be the left foot? You can see for yourself&mdash;that's how I was holding
      the gun&mdash;it couldn't be the right foot that way. It was a nuisance,
      of course.&rdquo; She looked at me curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and so you are getting on nicely,&rdquo; she said, looking around the
      hut. &ldquo;Why didn't you send the woman down to us for food? What have you
      been living on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went on talking for a few minutes. I asked her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you came in, your face was moved, and your eyes sparkled; you gave
      me your hand. But now your eyes are cold again. Am I wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One cannot always be the same...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me this one thing,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What is it this time that I have said
      or done to displease you? Then, perhaps, I might manage better in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked out the window, towards the far horizon; stood looking out
      thoughtfully and answered me as I sat there behind her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Glahn. Just thoughts that come at times. Are you angry now?
      Remember, some give a little, but it is much for them to give; others can
      give much, and it costs them nothing&mdash;and which has given more? You
      have grown melancholy in your illness. How did we come to talk of all
      this?&rdquo; And suddenly she looked at me, her face flushed with joy. &ldquo;But you
      must get well soon, now. We shall meet again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she held out her hand. Then it came into my head not to take her hand.
      I stood up, put my hands behind my back, and bowed deeply; that was to
      thank her for her kindness in coming to pay me a visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me if I cannot see you home,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone, I sat down again to think it all over. I wrote a
      letter, and asked to have my uniform sent.

    <h2>
      XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first day in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was happy and weary; all the creatures came up close and looked at me;
      there were insects on the trees and oil-beetles crawling on the road. Well
      met! I said to myself. The feeling of the woods went through and through
      my senses; I cried for love of it all, and was utterly happy; I was
      dissolved in thanksgiving. Dear woods, my home, God's peace with you from
      my heart... I stopped and turned all ways, named the things with tears.
      Birds and trees and stones and grass and ants, I called them all by name,
      looked round and called them all in their order. I looked up to the hills
      and thought: Now, now I am coming, as if in answer to their calling. Far
      above, the dwarf falcon was hacking away&mdash;I knew where its nests
      were. But the sound of those falcons up in the hills sent my thoughts far
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon I rowed out and landed on a little island, an islet outside the
      harbour. There were mauve-coloured flowers with long stalks reaching to my
      knees; I waded in strange growths, raspberry and coarse grass; there were
      no animals, and perhaps there had never been any human being there. The
      sea foamed gently against the rocks and wrapped me in a veil of murmuring;
      far up on the egg-cliffs, all the birds of the coast were flying and
      screaming. But the sea wrapped me round on all sides as in an embrace.
      Blessed be life and earth and sky, blessed be my enemies; in this hour I
      will be gracious to my bitterest enemy, and bind the latchet of his
      shoe...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hiv ... ohoi...</i>&rdquo; Sounds from one of Herr Mack's craft. My heart
      was filled with sunshine at the well-known song. I rowed to the quay,
      walked up past the fishers' huts and home. The day was at an end. I had my
      meal, sharing it with Æsop, and set out into the woods once more. Soft
      winds breathed silently in my face. And I blessed the winds because they
      touched my face; I told them that I blessed them; my very blood sang in my
      veins for thankfulness. Æsop laid one paw on my knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weariness came over me; I fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lul! lul!</i> Bells ringing! Some leagues out at sea rose a mountain. I
      said two prayers, one for my dog and one for myself, and we entered into
      the mountain there. The gate closed behind us; I started at its clang, and
      woke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flaming red sky, the sun there stamping before my eyes; the night, the
      horizon, echoing with light. Æsop and I moved into the shade. All quiet
      around us. &ldquo;No, we will not sleep now,&rdquo; I said to the dog, &ldquo;we will go out
      hunting tomorrow; the red sun is shining on us, we will not go into the
      mountain.&rdquo; ... And strange thoughts woke to life in me, and the blood rose
      to my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excited, yet still weak, I felt someone kissing me, and the kiss lay on my
      lips. I looked round: there was nothing visible. &ldquo;Iselin!&rdquo; A sound in the
      grass&mdash;it might be a leaf falling to the ground, or it might be
      footsteps. A shiver through the woods&mdash;and I told myself it might be
      Iselin's breathing. Here in these woods she has moved, Iselin; here she
      has listened to the prayers of yellow-booted, green-cloaked huntsmen. She
      lived out on my farm, two miles away; four generations ago she sat at her
      window, and heard the echo of horns in the forest. There were reindeer and
      wolf and bear, and the hunters were many, and all of them had seen her
      grow up from a child, and each and all of them had waited for her. One had
      seen her eyes, another heard her voice. When she was twelve years old came
      Dundas. He was a Scotsman, and traded in fish, and had many ships. He had
      a son. When she was sixteen, she saw young Dundas for the first time. He
      was her first love...
    </p>
    <p>
      And such strange fancies flowed through me, and my head grew very heavy as
      I sat there; I closed my eyes and felt for Iselin's kiss. Iselin, are you
      here, lover of life? And have you Diderik there? ... But my head grew
      heavier still, and I floated off on the waves of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Lul! lul!</i> A voice speaking, as if the Seven Stars themselves were
      singing through my blood; Iselin's voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep, sleep! I will tell you of my love while you sleep. I was sixteen,
      and it was springtime, with warm winds; Dundas came. It was like the
      rushing of an eagle's flight. I met him one morning before the hunt set
      out; he was twenty-five, and came from far lands; he walked by my side in
      the garden, and when he touched me with his arm I began to love him. Two
      red spots showed in his forehead, and I could have kissed those two red
      spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the evening after the hunt I went to seek him in the garden, and I was
      afraid lest I should find him. I spoke his name softly to myself, and
      feared lest he should hear. Then he came out from the bushes and
      whispered: 'An hour after midnight!' And then he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'An hour after midnight,' I said to myself&mdash;'what did he mean by
      that? I cannot understand. He must have meant he was going away to far
      lands again; an hour after midnight he was going away&mdash;but what was
      it to me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour after midnight he came back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'May I sit there by you?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes,' I told him. 'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sat there on the sofa; I moved away. I looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You are cold,' he said, and took my hand. A little after he said: 'How
      cold you are!' and put his arm round me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was warmed with his arm. So we sat a little while. Then a cock
      crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Did you hear,' he said, 'a cock crow? It is nearly dawn.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Are you quite sure it was the cock crow?' I stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the day came&mdash;already it was morning. Something was thrilling
      all through me. What hour was it that struck just now?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My maid came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Your flowers have not been watered,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had forgotten my flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A carriage drove up to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Your cat has had no milk,' said the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I had no thought for my flowers, or my cat; I asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Is that Dundas outside there? Ask him to come in here to me at once; I
      am expecting him; there was something...'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knocked. I opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Iselin!' he cried, and kissed my lips a whole minute long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I did not send for you,' I whispered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Did you not?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, I did&mdash;I sent for you. I was longing so unspeakably for you
      again. Stay here with me a little.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I covered my eyes for love of him. He did not loose me; I sank
      forward and hid myself close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Surely that was something crowing again,' he said, listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I heard what he said, I cut off his words as swiftly as I could,
      and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No, how can you imagine it? There was nothing crowing then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He kissed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was evening again, and Dundas was gone. Something golden
      thrilling through me. I stood before the glass, and two eyes all alight
      with love looked out at me; I felt something moving in me at my own
      glance, and always that something thrilling and thrilling round my heart.
      Dear God! I had never seen myself with those eyes before, and I kissed my
      own lips, all love and desire, in the glass...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I have told you. Another time I will tell you of Svend Herlufsen.
      I loved him too; he lived a league away, on the island you can see out
      there, and I rowed out to him myself on calm summer evenings, because I
      loved him. And I will tell you of Stamer. He was a priest, and I loved
      him. I love all...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through my helf-sleep I heard a cock crowing down at Sirilund.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iselin, hear! A cock is crowing for us too!&rdquo; I cried joyfully, and
      reached out my arms. I woke. Æsop was already moving. &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; I said in
      burning sorrow, and looked round. There was no one&mdash;no one there. It
      was morning now; the cock was still crowing down at Sirilund.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the hut stood a woman&mdash;Eva. She had a rope in her hand; she was
      going to fetch wood. There was the morning of life in the young girl's
      figure as she stood there, all golden in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not think...&rdquo; she stammered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it I must not think, Eva?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I did not come this way to meet you; I was just passing...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her face darkened in a blush.

    <h2>
      XXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      My foot continued to trouble me a good deal. It often itched at nights,
      and kept me awake; a sudden spasm would shoot through it, and in
      changeable weather it was full of gout. It was like that for many days.
      But it did not make me lame, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack had returned, and I knew it soon enough. He took my boat away
      from me, and left me in difficulties, for it was still the closed season,
      and there was nothing I could shoot. But why did he take the boat away
      from me like that? Two of Herr Mack's folk from the quay had rowed out
      with a stranger in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have taken my boat away,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a new man come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They have to row him out every day and
      back in the evening. He's investigating the sea-floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The newcomer was a Finn. Herr Mack had met him accidentally on board the
      steamer; he had come from Spitzbergen with some collections of scales and
      small sea-creatures; they called him Baron. He had been given a big room
      and another smaller one in Herr Mack's house. He caused quite a stir in
      the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am in difficulties about meat; I might ask Edwarda for something for
      this evening,&rdquo; I thought. I walked down to Sirilund. I noticed at once
      that Edwarda was wearing a new dress. She seemed to have grown; her dress
      was much longer now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse my not getting up,&rdquo; she said, quite shortly, and offered her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter is not very well, I'm sorry to say,&rdquo; said Herr Mack. &ldquo;A chill&mdash;she
      has not been taking care of herself... You came to ask about your boat, I
      suppose? I shall have to lend you another one instead. It's not a new one,
      but as long as you bail it out every now and then ... We've a scientist
      come to stay with us, you see, and with a man like that, of course, you
      understand... He has no time to spare; works all day and comes home in the
      evening. Don't go now till he comes; you will be interested in meeting
      him. Here's his card, with coronet and all; he's a Baron. A very nice man.
      I met him quite by accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aha, I thought, so they don't ask you to supper. Well, thank Heaven, I
      only came down by way of a trial; I can go home again&mdash;I've still
      some fish left in the hut. Enough for a meal, I daresay. <i>Basta!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron came in. A little man, about forty, with a long, narrow face,
      prominent cheek bones, and a thinnish black beard. His glance was sharp
      and penetrating, but he wore strong glasses. His shirt studs, too, were
      ornamented with a little five-pointed coronet, like the one on his card.
      He stooped a little, and his thin hands were blue-veined, but the nails
      were like yellow metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delighted, Herr Lieutenant. Have you been here long, may I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pleasant man. Herr Mack asked him to tell us about his scales and
      sea-things, and he did so willingly&mdash;told us what kind of clay there
      was round Korholmerne&mdash;went into his room and fetched a sample of
      weed from the White Sea. He was constantly lifting up his right forefinger
      and shifting his thick gold spectacles back and forward on his nose. Herr
      Mack was most interested. An hour passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron spoke of my accident&mdash;that unfortunate shot. Was I well
      again now? Pleased to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now who had told him of that? I asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you hear of that, Baron?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, who was it, now? Fröken Mack, I think. Was it not you, Fröken Mack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda flushed hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had come so poor! for days past, a dark misery had weighed me down. But
      at the stranger's last words a joy fluttered through me on the instant. I
      did not look at Edwarda, but in my mind I thanked her: Thanks, for having
      spoken of me, named my name with your tongue, though it be all valueless
      to you. <i>Godnat.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I took my leave. Edwarda still kept her seat, excusing herself, for
      politeness' sake, by saying she was unwell. Indifferently she gave me her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Herr Mack stood chatting eagerly with the Baron. He was talking of his
      grandfather, Consul Mack:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know if I told you before, Baron; this diamond here was a gift
      from King Carl Johan, who pinned it to my grandfather's breast with his
      own hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I went out to the front steps; no one saw me to the door. I glanced in
      passing through the windows of the sitting-room; and there stood Edwarda,
      tall, upright, holding the curtains apart with both hands, looking out. I
      did not bow to her: I forgot everything; a swirl of confusion overwhelmed
      me and drew me hurriedly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt! Stop a moment!&rdquo; I said to myself, when I reached the woods. God in
      Heaven, but there must be an end of this! I felt all hot within on a
      sudden, and I groaned. Alas, I had no longer any pride in my heart; I had
      enjoyed Edwarda's favour for a week, at the outside, but that was over
      long since, and I had not ordered my ways accordingly. From now on, my
      heart should cry to her: Dust, air, earth on my way; God in Heaven, yes...
    </p>
    <p>
      I reached the hut, found my fish, and had a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are you burning out your life for the sake of a worthless schoolgirl,
      and your nights are full of desolate dreams. And a hot wind stands still
      about your head, a close, foul wind of last year's breath. Yet the sky is
      quivering with the most wonderful blue, and the hills are calling. Come,
      Æsop, <i>Hei</i>...
    </p>
    <p>
      A week passed. I hired the blacksmith's boat and fished for my meals.
      Edwarda and the Baron were always together in the evening when he came
      home from his sea trips. I saw them once at the mill. One evening they
      both came by my hut; I drew away from the window and barred the door. It
      made no impression on me whatever to see them together; I shrugged my
      shoulders. Another evening I met them on the road, and exchanged
      greetings; I left it to the Baron to notice me first, and merely put up
      two fingers to my cap, to be discourteous. I walked slowly past them, and
      looked carelessly at them as I did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      How many long days had not passed already? I was downcast, dispirited; my
      heart pondered idly over things; even the kindly grey stone by the hut
      seemed to wear an expression of sorrow and despair when I went by. There
      was rain in the air; the heat seemed gasping before me wherever I went,
      and I felt the gout in my left foot; I had seen one of Herr Mack's horses
      shivering in its harness in the morning; all these things were significant
      to me as signs of the weather. Best to furnish the house well with food
      while the weather holds, I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tied up Æsop, took my fishing tackle and my gun, and went down to the
      quay. I was quite unusually troubled in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will the mail-packet be in?&rdquo; I asked a fisherman there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mail-packet? In three weeks' time,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am expecting my uniform,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I met one of Herr Mack's assistants from the store. I shook hands
      with him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, do you never play whist now at Sirilund?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, often,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been there lately,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rowed out to my fishing grounds. The weather was mild, but oppressive.
      The gnats gathered in swarms, and I had to smoke all the time to keep them
      off. The haddock were biting; I fished with two hooks and made a good
      haul. On the way back I shot a brace of guillemots.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came in to the quay the blacksmith was there at work. A thought
      occurred to me; I asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going up my way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Herr Mack's given me a bit of work to do here that'll keep
      me till midnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, and thought to myself that it was well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took my fish and went off, going round by way of the blacksmith's house.
      Eva was there alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been longing for you with all my heart,&rdquo; I told her. And I was
      moved at the sight of her. She could hardly look me in the face for
      wonder. &ldquo;I love your youth and your good eyes,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Punish me to-day
      because I have thought more of another than of you. I tell you, I have
      come here only to see you; you make me happy, I am fond of you. Did you
      hear me calling for you last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called Edwarda, but it was you I meant. I woke up and heard myself.
      Yes, it was you I meant; it was only a mistake; I said 'Edwarda,' but it
      was only by accident. By Heaven, you are my dearest, Eva! Your lips are so
      red to-day. Your feet are prettier than Edwarda's&mdash;just look yourself
      and see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joy such as I had never seen in her lit up her face; she made as if to
      turn away, but hesitated, and put one arm round my neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      We talked together, sitting all the time on a long bench, talking to each
      other of many things. I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you believe it? Edwarda has not learnt to speak properly yet; she
      talks like a child, and says 'more happier.' I heard her myself. Would you
      say she had a lovely forehead? I do not think so. She has a devilish
      forehead. And she does not wash her hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we weren't going to talk of her any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. I forgot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little pause. I was thinking of something, and fell silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are your eyes wet?&rdquo; asked Eva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a lovely forehead, though,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and her hands are always
      clean. It was only an accident that they were dirty once. I did not mean
      to say what I did.&rdquo; But then I went on angrily, with clenched teeth: &ldquo;I
      sit thinking of you all the time, Eva; but it occurs to me that perhaps
      you have not heard what I am going to tell you now. The first time Edwarda
      saw Æsop, she said: 'Æsop&mdash;that was the name of a wise man&mdash;a
      Phrygian, he was.' Now wasn't that simply silly? She had read it in a book
      the same day, I'm sure of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Eva; &ldquo;but what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as far as I remember, she said, too, that Æsop had Xanthus for his
      teacher. Hahaha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what the devil is the sense of telling a crowd of people that Æsop
      had Xanthus for his teacher? I ask you. Oh, you are not in the mood
      to-day, Eva, or you would laugh till your sides ached at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think it is funny,&rdquo; said Eva, and began laughing forcedly and in
      wonder. &ldquo;But I don't understand it as well as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I sit silent and thoughtful, silent and thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like best to sit still and not talk?&rdquo; asked Eva softly. Goodness
      shone in her eyes; she passed her hand over my hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You good, good soul,&rdquo; I broke out, and pressed her close to me. &ldquo;I know
      for certain I am perishing for love of you; I love you more and more; the
      end of it will be that you must go with me when I go away. You shall see.
      Could you go with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hardly heard that yes, but I felt it in her breath and all through her.
      We held each other fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later I kissed Eva good-bye and went away. At the door I meet Herr
      Mack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started&mdash;stared into the house&mdash;stopped there on the
      doorstep, staring in. &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said he, and could say no more; he seemed
      thrown altogether off his balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not expect to find me here,&rdquo; I said, raising my cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eva did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack regained his composure; a curious confidence appeared in his
      manner, and he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken: I came on purpose to find you. I wish to point out to
      you that from the 1st of April it is forbidden to fire a shot within half
      a mile of the bird-cliffs. You shot two birds out at the island to-day;
      you were seen doing so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shot two guillemots,&rdquo; I said helplessly. I saw at once that the man was
      in the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two guillemots or two eiderducks&mdash;it is all the same. You were
      within the prohibited limit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;It had not occurred to me before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it ought to have occurred to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also fired off both barrels once in May, at very nearly the same spot.
      It was on a picnic one day. And it was done at your own request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is another matter,&rdquo; answered Herr Mack shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, devil take it, you know what you have to do, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly well,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eva held herself in readiness; when I went out, she followed me; she had
      put on a kerchief, and walked away from the house; I saw her going down
      towards the quay. Herr Mack walked back home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought it over. What a mind, to hit on that all at once, and save
      himself! And those piercing eyes of his. A shot, two shots, a brace of
      guillemots&mdash;a fine, a payment. And then everything, <i>everything</i>,
      would be settled with Herr Mack and his house. After all, it was going off
      so beautifully quickly and neatly...
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain was coming down already, in great soft drops. The magpies flew
      low along the ground, and when I came home and turned Æsop loose he began
      eating the grass. The wind was beginning to rustle.

    <h2>
      XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      A league below me is the sea. It is raining, and I am up in the hills. An
      overhanging rock shelters me from the rain. I smoke my pipe, smoke one
      pipe after another; and every time I light it, the tobacco curls up like
      little worms crawling from the ash. So also with the thoughts that twirl
      in my head. Before me, on the ground, lies a bundle of dry twigs, from the
      ruin of a bird's nest. And as with that nest, so also with my soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember every trifle of that day and the next. Hoho! I was hard put to
      it then! ...
    </p>
    <p>
      I sit here up in the hills and the sea and the air are voiceful, a
      seething and moaning of the wind and weather, cruel to listen to. Fishing
      boats and small craft show far out with reefed sails, human beings on
      board&mdash;making for somewhere, no doubt, and Heaven knows where all
      those lives are making for, think I. The sea flings itself up in foam, and
      rolls and rolls, as if inhabited by great fierce figures that fling their
      limbs about and roar at one another; nay, a festival of ten thousand
      piping devils that duck their heads down between their shoulders and
      circle about, lashing the sea white with the tips of their wings. Far, far
      out lies a hidden reef, and from that hidden reef rises a white merman,
      shaking his head after a leaky sailboat making out to sea before the wind.
      Hoho! out to sea, out to the desolate sea...
    </p>
    <p>
      I am glad to be alone, that none may see my eyes. I lean securely against
      the wall of rock, knowing that no one can observe me from behind. A bird
      swoops over the crest with a broken cry; at the same moment a boulder
      close by breaks loose and rolls down towards the sea. And I sit there
      still for a while, I sink into restfulness; a warm sense of comfort
      quivers in me because I can sit so pleasantly under shelter while the rain
      pours down outside. I button up my jacket, thanking God for the warmth of
      it. A little while more. And I fall asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was afternoon. I went home; it was still raining. Then&mdash;an
      unexpected encounter. Edwarda stood there before me on the path. She was
      wet through, as if she had been out in the rain a long time, but she
      smiled. Ho! I thought to myself, and my anger rose; I gripped my gun and
      walked fiercely although she herself was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Goddag!</i>&rdquo; she called, speaking first.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited till I had come some paces nearer, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair one, I give you greeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started in surprise at my jesting tone. Alas, I knew not what I was
      saying. She smiled timidly, and looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been up in the hills to-day?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Then you must be wet.
      I have a kerchief here, if you care for it; I can spare it... Oh, you
      don't know me.&rdquo; And she cast down her eyes and shook her head when I did
      not take her kerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A kerchief?&rdquo; I answer, grinning in anger and surprise. &ldquo;But I have a
      jacket here&mdash;won't you borrow it? I can spare it&mdash;I would have
      lent it to anyone. You need not be afraid to take it. I would have lent it
      to a fishwife, and gladly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I could see that she was eager to hear what I would say. She listened with
      such attention that it made her look ugly; she forgot to hold her lips
      together. There she stood with the kerchief in her hand&mdash;a white silk
      kerchief which she had taken from her neck. I tore off my jacket in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven's sake put it on again,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don't do that! Are you so
      angry with me? <i>Herregud!</i> put your jacket on, do, before you get wet
      through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put on my jacket again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; I asked sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;nowhere ... I can't understand what made you take off your
      jacket like that ...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you done with the Baron to-day?&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;The Count can't be
      out at sea on a day like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glahn, I just wanted to tell you something ...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I interrupted her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I beg you to convey my respects to the Duke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We looked at each other. I was ready to break in with further
      interruptions as soon as she opened her mouth. At last a twinge of pain
      passed over her face; I turned away and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seriously, you should send His Highness packing, Edwarda. He is not the
      man for you. I assure you, he has been wondering these last few days
      whether to make you his wife or not&mdash;and that is not good enough for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't let us talk about that, please. Glahn, I have been thinking of
      you; you could take off your jacket and get wet through for another's
      sake; I come to you ...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should advise you to take the Doctor instead. What have you against
      him? A man in the prime of life, and a clever head&mdash;you should think
      it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but do listen a minute ...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Æsop, my dog, was waiting for me in the hut. I took off my cap, bowed to
      her again, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair one, I give you farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I started off.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are tearing my heart out. I came to you to-day; I waited for you
      here, and I smiled when you came. I was nearly out of my mind yesterday,
      because of something I had been thinking of all the time; my head was in a
      whirl, and I thought of you all the time. To-day I was sitting at home,
      and someone came in; I did not look up, but I knew who it was. 'I rowed
      half a mile to-day,' he said. 'Weren't you tired?' I asked. 'Oh yes, very
      tired, and it blistered my hands,' he said, and was very concerned about
      it. And I thought: Fancy being concerned about that! A little after he
      said: 'I heard someone whispering outside my window last night; it was
      your maid and one of the store men talking very intimately indeed.' 'Yes,
      they are to be married,' I said. 'But this was at two o'clock in the
      morning!' 'Well, what of it?' said I, and, after a little: 'The night is
      their own.' Then he shifted his gold spectacles a little up his nose, and
      observed: 'But don't you think, at that hour of night, it doesn't look
      well?' Still I didn't look up, and we sat like that for ten minutes.
      'Shall I bring you a shawl to put over your shoulders?' he asked. 'No,
      thank you,' I answered. 'If only I dared take your little hand,' he said.
      I did not answer&mdash;I was thinking of something else. He laid a little
      box in my lap. I opened the box, and found a brooch in it. There was a
      coronet on the brooch, and I counted ten stones in it... Glahn, I have
      that brooch with me now; will you look at it? It is trampled to bits&mdash;come,
      come and see how it is trampled to bits... 'Well, and what am I to do with
      this brooch?' I asked. 'Wear it,' he answered. But I gave him back the
      brooch, and said, 'Let me alone&mdash;it is another I care for.' 'What
      other?' he asked. 'A hunter in the woods,' I said. 'He gave me two lovely
      feathers once, for a keepsake. Take back your brooch.' But he would not.
      Then I looked at him for the first time; his eyes were piercing. 'I will
      not take back the brooch. You may do with it as you please; tread on it,'
      he said. I stood up and put the brooch under my heel and trod on it. That
      was this morning... For four hours I waited and waited; after dinner I
      went out. He came to meet me on the road. 'Where are you going?' he asked.
      'To Glahn,' I answered, 'to ask him not to forget me...' Since one o'clock
      I have been waiting here. I stood by a tree and saw you coming&mdash;you
      were like a god. I loved your figure, your beard, and your shoulders,
      loved everything about you... Now you are impatient; you want to go, only
      to go; I am nothing to you, you will not look at me ...&rdquo; I had stopped.
      When she had finished speaking I began walking on again. I was worn out
      with despair, and I smiled; my heart was hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; I said, and stopped again. &ldquo;You had something to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at this scorn of mine she wearied of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something to say to you? But I have told you&mdash;did you not hear? No,
      nothing&mdash;I have nothing to tell you any more...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice trembled strangely, but that did not move me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Edwarda was standing outside the hut when I went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had thought it all over during the night, and taken my resolve. Why
      should I let myself be dazzled any longer by this creature of moods, a
      fisher-girl, a thing of no culture? Had not her name fastened for long
      enough on my heart, sucking it dry? Enough of that!&mdash;though it struck
      me that, perhaps, I had come nearer to her by treating her with
      indifference and scorn. Oh, how grandly I had scorned her&mdash;after she
      had made a long speech of several minutes, to say calmly: &ldquo;Yes? You had
      something to say to me...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing by the big stone. She was in great excitement, and would
      have run towards me; her arms were already opened. But she stopped, and
      stood there wringing her hands. I took off my cap and bowed to her without
      a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one thing I wanted to say to you to-day, Glahn,&rdquo; she said
      entreatingly. And I did not move, but waited, just to hear what she would
      say next. &ldquo;I hear you have been down at the blacksmith's. One evening it
      was. Eva was alone in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I started at that, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't go about spying,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I heard it last evening; my father
      told me. When I got home all wet through last night, my father said: 'You
      were rude to the Baron to-day.' 'No,' I answered. 'Where have you been
      now?' he asked again. I answered: 'With Glahn.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then my father told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I struggled with my despair; I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is more, Eva has been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she been here? In the hut?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than once. I made her go in. We talked together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pause. &ldquo;Be firm!&rdquo; I said to myself; and then, aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you are so kind as to mix yourself up in my affairs, I will not be
      behindhand. I suggested yesterday that you should take the Doctor; have
      you thought it over? For really, you know, the prince is simply
      impossible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes lit with anger. &ldquo;He is not, I tell you,&rdquo; she cried passionately.
      &ldquo;No, he is better than you; he can move about in a house without breaking
      cups and glasses; he leaves my shoes alone. Yes! He knows how to move in
      society; but you are ridiculous&mdash;I am ashamed of you&mdash;you are
      unendurable&mdash;do you understand that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her words struck deep; I bowed my head and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right; I am not good at moving in society. Be merciful. You do
      not understand me; I live in the woods by choice&mdash;that is my
      happiness. Here, where I am all alone, it can hurt no one that I am as I
      am; but when I go among others, I have to use all my will power to be as I
      should. For two years now I have been so little among people at all...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no saying what mad thing you will do next,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;And it
      is intolerable to be constantly looking after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How mercilessly she said it! A very bitter pain passed through me. I
      almost toppled before her violence. Edwarda had not yet done; she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might get Eva to look after you, perhaps. It's a pity though, that
      she's married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eva! Eva married, did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who is her husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you know that. She is the blacksmith's wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought she was his daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is his wife. Do you think I am lying to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not thought about it at all; I was simply astonished. I just stood
      there thinking: Is Eva married?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have made a happy choice,&rdquo; says Edwarda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there seemed no end to the business. I was trembling with
      indignation, and I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had better take the Doctor, as I said. Take a friend's advice;
      that prince of yours is an old fool.&rdquo; And in my excitement I lied about
      him, exaggerated his age, declared he was bald, that he was almost totally
      blind; I asserted, moreover, that he wore that coronet thing in his shirt
      front wholly and solely to show off his nobility. &ldquo;As for me, I have not
      cared to make his acquaintance, there is nothing in him of mark at all; he
      lacks the first principles; he is nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is something, he is something,&rdquo; she cried, and her voice broke
      with anger. &ldquo;He is far more than you think, you thing of the woods. You
      wait. Oh, he shall talk to you&mdash;I will ask him myself. You don't
      believe I love him, but you shall see you are mistaken. I will marry him;
      I will think of him night and day. Mark what I say: I love him. Let Eva
      come if she likes&mdash;hahaha! Heavens, let her come&mdash;it is less
      than nothing to me. And now let me get away from here...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began walking down the path from the hut; she took a few small hurried
      steps, turned round, her face still pale as death, and moaned: &ldquo;And let me
      never see your face again.&rdquo;

      Leaves were yellowing; the potato-plants had grown to full height and
      stood in flower; the shooting season came round again; I shot hare and
      ptarmigan and grouse; one day I shot an eagle. Calm, open sky, cool
      nights, many clear, clear tones and dear sounds in the woods and fields.
      The earth was resting, vast and peaceful...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not heard anything from Herr Mack about the two guillemots I
      shot,&rdquo; I said to the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can thank Edwarda for that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know. I heard that she set
      herself against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not thank her for it,&rdquo; said I...
    </p>
    <p>
      Indian summer&mdash;Indian summer. The stars lay like belts in through the
      yellowing woods; a new star came every day. The moon showed like a shadow;
      a shadow of gold dipped in silver...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven help you, Eva, are you married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pressed my hand silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God help you, child, what are we to do now?&rdquo; &ldquo;What <i>you</i> will.
      Perhaps you are not going away just yet; I will be happy as long as you
      are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Eva.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;only as long as you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked forsaken, kept pressing my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Eva. Go&mdash;never any more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Nights pass and days come&mdash;three days already since this last talk.
      Eva comes by with a load. How much wood has that child carried home from
      the forest this summer alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Set the load down, Eva, and let me see if your eyes are as blue as ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;smile again, Eva! I can resist no more; I am your, I am
      yours...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evening. Eva sings, I hear her singing, and a warmth goes through me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are singing this evening, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And being smaller than I, she jumps up a little to put her arms round my
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Eva, you have scratched your hands. <i>Herregud</i>! oh, if you had
      not scratched them so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face beams wonderfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eva, have you spoken to Herr Mack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say, and what did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so hard with us now; he makes my husband work day and night down at
      the quay, and keeps me at all sorts of jobs as well. He has ordered me to
      do man's work now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eva looks down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he do that, Eva?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could he know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to Heaven he were not so harsh with you, Eva.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter at all now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her voice is like a little tremulous song in the woods.

      The woods more yellow still. It is drawing towards autumn now; a few more
      stars have come in the sky, and from now on the moon looks like a shadow
      of silver dipped in gold. There is no cold; nothing, only a cool stillness
      and a flow of life in the woods. Every tree stands in silent thought. The
      berries are ripe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;the twenty-second of August and the three iron nights.

      XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The first iron night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine the sun sets. A dull darkness settles over the earth, a star or so
      can be seen; two hours later there is a glow of the moon. I wander up in
      the woods with my gun and my dog. I light a fire, and the light of the
      flames shines in between the fir-trunks. There is no frost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first iron night!&rdquo; I say. And a confused, passionate delight in the
      time and the place sends a strange shiver through me...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hail, men and beasts and birds, to the lonely night in the woods, in the
      woods! Hail to the darkness and God's murmuring between the trees, to the
      sweet, simple melody of silence in my ears, to green leaves and yellow!
      Hail to the life-sound I hear; a snout against the grass, a dog sniffing
      over the ground! A wild hail to the wildcat lying crouched, sighting and
      ready to spring on a sparrow in the dark, in the dark! Hail to the
      merciful silence upon earth, to the stars and the half moon; ay, to them
      and to it!&rdquo; ...
    </p>
    <p>
      I rise and listen. No one has heard me. I sit down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks for the lonely night, for the hills, the rush of the darkness and
      the sea through my heart! Thanks for my life, for my breath, for the boon
      of being alive to-night; thanks from my heart for these! Hear, east and
      west, oh, hear. It is the eternal God. This silence murmuring in my ears
      is the blood of all Nature seething; it is God weaving through the world
      and me. I see a glistening gossamer thread in the light of my fire; I hear
      a boat rowing across the harbour; the northern lights flare over the
      heavens to the north. By my immortal soul, I am full of thanks that it is
      I who am sitting here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence. A fir cone falls dully to the ground. A fir cone fell! I think to
      myself. The moon is high, the fire flickers over the half-burned brands
      and is dying. And in the late night I wander home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second iron night; the same stillness and mild weather. My soul is
      pondering. I walk mechanically over to a tree, pull my cap deep down over
      my eyes, and lean against that tree, with hands clasped behind my neck. I
      gazed and think; the flame from my fire dazzles my eyes, and I do not feel
      it. I stand in that stupor for a while, looking at the fire; my legs fail
      me first, and grow tired; thoroughly stiff, I sit down. Not till then do I
      think of what I have been doing. Why should I stare so long at the fire?
    </p>
    <p>
      Æsop lifts his head and listens; he hears footsteps; Eva appears among the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very thoughtful and sad this evening,&rdquo; I say.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in sympathy she makes no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love three things,&rdquo; I go on. &ldquo;I love a dream of love I once had; I love
      you; and I love this spot of ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which do you love most?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All still again. Æsop knows Eva; he lays his head on one side and looks at
      her. I murmur:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw a girl on the road to-day; she walked arm in arm with her lover.
      The girl looked towards me, and could scarcely keep from laughing as I
      passed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was she laughing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. At me, I suppose. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I bowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And didn't she know you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she acted as if she didn't know me... But why do you sit there
      worming things out of me? It is not a nice thing to do. You will not get
      me to tell you her name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      I murmur again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was she laughing at? She is a flirt; but what was she laughing at?
      What had I done to harm her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eva answers:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was cruel of her to laugh at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was not cruel of her,&rdquo; I cry. &ldquo;How dare you sit there speaking ill
      of her? She never did an unkind thing; it was only right that she should
      laugh at me. Be quiet, devil take you, and leave me in peace&mdash;do you
      hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Eva, terrified, leaves me in peace. I look at her, and repent my harsh
      words at once; I fall down before her; wringing my hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home, Eva. It is you I love most; how could I love a dream? It was
      only a jest; it is you I love. But go home now; I will come to you
      to-morrow; remember, I am yours; yes, do not forget it. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Eva goes home.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

      <br /><br />

    <p>
      The third iron night, a night of extremes! tension. If only there were a
      little frost! Instead, still heat after the sun of the day; the night is
      like a lukewarm marsh. I light my fire...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eva, it can be a delight at times to be dragged by the hair. So strangely
      can the mind of a man be warped. He can be dragged by the hair over hill
      and dale, and if asked what is happening, can answer in ecstasy: 'I am
      being dragged by the hair!' And if anyone asks: 'But shall I not help you,
      release you?' he answers: 'No.' And if they ask: 'But how can you endure
      it?' he answers: 'I can endure it, for I love the hand that drags me.'
      Eva, do you know what it is to hope?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look you, Eva, hope is a strange thing, a very strange thing. You can go
      out one morning along the road, hoping to meet one whom you are fond of.
      And do you? No. Why not? Because that one is busy that morning&mdash;is
      somewhere else, perhaps... Once I got to know an old blind Lapp up in the
      hills. For fifty-eight years he had seen nothing, and now he was over
      seventy. It seemed to him that his sight was getting better little by
      little; getting on gradually, he thought. If all went well he would be
      able to make out the sun in a few years' time. His hair was still black,
      but his eyes were quite white. When we sat in his hut, smoking, he would
      tell of all the things he had seen before he went blind. He was hardy and
      strong; without feeling, indestructible; and he kept his hope. When I was
      going, he came out with me, and began pointing in different ways. 'There's
      the south,' he said, 'and there's north. Now you go that way first, and
      when you get a little way down, turn off that way.' 'Quite right,' I said.
      And at that the Lapp laughed contentedly, and said: 'There! I did not know
      that forty or fifty years back, so I must see better now than I used to&mdash;yes,
      it is improving all the time.' And then he crouched down and crept into
      his hut again&mdash;the same old hut, his home on earth. And he sat down
      by the fire as before, full of hope that in some few years he would be
      able to make out the sun... Eva, 'tis strange about hope. Here am I, for
      instance, hoping all the time that I may forget the one I did not meet on
      the road this morning...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk so strangely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the third of the iron nights. I promise you, Eva, to be a different
      man to-morrow. Let me be alone now. You will not know me again to-morrow,
      I shall laugh and kiss you, my own sweet girl. Just think&mdash;only this
      one night more, a few hours&mdash;and then I shall be a different man. <i>Godnat</i>,
      Eva.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Godnat.&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      I lie down closer to the fire, and look at the flames. A pine cone falls
      from the branch; a dry twig or so falls too. The night is like a boundless
      depth. I close my eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour, my senses begin swinging in a certain rhythm. I am ringing
      in tune with the great stillness&mdash;ringing with it. I look at the
      half-moon; it stands in the sky like a white scale, and I have a feeling
      of love for it; I can feel myself blushing. &ldquo;It is the moon!&rdquo; I say softly
      and passionately; &ldquo;it is the moon!&rdquo; and my heart strikes toward it in a
      soft throbbing. So for some minutes. It is blowing a little; a stranger
      wind comes to me a mysterious current of air. What is it? I look round,
      but see no one. The wind calls me, and my soul bows acknowledging the
      call; and I feel myself lifted into the air, pressed to an invisible
      breast; my eyes are dewed, I tremble&mdash;God is standing near, watching
      me. Again several minutes pass. I turn my head round; the stranger wind is
      gone, and I see something like the back of a spirit wandering silently in
      through the woods...
    </p>
    <p>
      I struggle a short while with a heavy melancholy; I was worn out with
      emotions; I am deathly tired, and I sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke the night was past. Alas, I had been going about for a long
      time in a sad state, full of fever, on the verge of falling down stricken
      with some sickness or other. Often things had seemed upside down. I had
      been looking at everything through inflamed eyes. A deep misery had
      possessed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over now.

    <h2>
      XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was autumn. The summer was gone. It passed as quickly as it had come;
      ah, how quickly it was gone! The days were cold now. I went out shooting
      and fishing&mdash;sang songs in the woods. And there were days with a
      thick mist that came floating in from the sea, damming up everything
      behind a wall of murk.
    </p>
    <p>
      One such day something happened. I lost my way, blundered through into the
      woods of the annexe, and came to the Doctor's house. There were visitors
      there&mdash;the young ladies I had met before&mdash;young people dancing,
      just like madcap foals.
    </p>
    <p>
      A carriage came rolling up and stopped outside the gate; Edwarda was in
      it. She started at sight of me. &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; I said quietly. But the Doctor
      held me back. Edwarda was troubled by my presence at first, and looked
      down when I spoke; afterwards, she bore with me, and even went so far as
      to ask me a question about something or other. She was strikingly pale;
      the mist lay grey and cold upon her face. She did not get out of the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come on an errand,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I come from the parish church, and
      none of you were there to-day; they said you were here. I have been
      driving for hours to find you. We are having a little party to-morrow&mdash;the
      Baron is going away next week&mdash;and I have been told to invite you
      all. There will be dancing too. To-morrow evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all bowed and thanked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don't stay away, will you? Don't send a note at the last minute
      making some excuse.&rdquo; She did not say that to any of the others. A little
      after she drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so moved by this unexpected meeting that for a little while I was
      secretly mad with joy. Then I took leave of the Doctor and his guests and
      set off for home. How gracious she was to me, how gracious she was to me!
      What could I do for her in return? My hands felt helpless; a sweet cold
      went through my wrists. <i>Herregud!</i> I thought to myself, here am I
      with my limbs hanging helpless for joy; I cannot even clench my hands; I
      can only find tears in my eyes for my own helplessness. What is to be done
      about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the evening when I reached home. I went round by the quay
      and asked a fisherman if the post-packet would not be in by to-morrow
      evening. Alas, no, the post-packet would not be in till some time next
      week. I hurried up to the hut and began looking over my best suit. I
      cleaned it up and made it look decent; there were holes in it here and
      there, and I wept and darned them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had finished, I lay down on the bed. This rest lasted only a
      moment. Then a thought struck me, and I sprang up and stood in the middle
      of the floor, dazed. The whole thing was just another trick! I should not
      have been invited if I had not happened to be there when the others were
      asked. And, moreover, she had given me the plainest possible hint to stay
      away&mdash;to send a note at the last moment, making some excuse...
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not sleep all that night, and when morning came I went to the woods
      cold, sleepless, and feverish. Ho, having a party at Sirilund! What then?
      I would neither go nor send any excuse. Herr Mack was a very thoughtful
      man; he was giving this party for the Baron; but I was not going&mdash;let
      them understand that! ...
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist lay thick over valley and hills; a clammy rime gathered on my
      clothes and made them heavy, my face was cold and wet. Only now and then
      came a breath of wind to make the sleeping mists rise and fall, rise and
      fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon, and getting dark; the mist hid everything
      from my eyes, and I had no sun to show the way. I drifted about for hours
      on the way home, but there was no hurry. I took the wrong road with the
      greatest calmness, and came upon unknown places in the woods. At last I
      stood my gun against a tree and consulted my compass. I marked out my way
      carefully and started off. It would be about eight or nine o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then something happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      After half an hour, I heard music through the fog, and a few minutes later
      I knew where I was: quite close to the main building at Sirilund. Had my
      compass misled me to the very place I was trying to avoid? A well-known
      voice called me&mdash;the Doctor's. A minute later I was being led in.
    </p>
    <p>
      My gun-barrel had perhaps affected the compass and, alas, set it wrong.
      The same thing has happened to me since&mdash;one day this year. I do not
      know what to think. Then, too, it may have been fate.

    <h2>
      XXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the evening I had a bitter feeling that I should not have come to that
      party. My coming was hardly noticed at all, they were all so occupied with
      one another; Edwarda hardly bade me welcome. I began drinking hard because
      I knew I was unwelcome; and yet I did not go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack smiled a great deal and put on his most amiable expression; he
      was in evening dress, and looked well. He was now here, now there,
      mingling with his half a hundred guests, dancing one dance now and then,
      joking and laughing. There were secrets lurking in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whirl of music and voices sounded through the house. Five of the rooms
      were occupied by the guests, besides the big room where they were dancing.
      Supper was over when I arrived. Busy maids were running to and fro with
      glasses and wines, brightly polished coffee-pots, cigars and pipes, cakes
      and fruit. There was no sparing of anything. The chandeliers in the rooms
      were filled with extra-thick candles that had been made for the occasion;
      the new oil lamps were lit as well. Eva was helping in the kitchen; I
      caught a glimpse of her. To think that Eva should be here too!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron received a great deal of attention, though he was quiet and
      modest and did not put himself forward. He, too, was in evening dress; the
      tails of his coat were miserably crushed from the packing. He talked a
      good deal with Edwarda, followed her with his eyes, drank with her, and
      called her Fröken, as he did the daughters of the Dean and of the district
      surgeon. I felt the same dislike of him as before, and could hardly look
      at him without turning my eyes away with a wretched silly grimace. When he
      spoke to me, I answered shortly and pressed my lips together after.
    </p>
    <p>
      I happen to remember one detail of that evening. I stood talking to a
      young lady, a fair-haired girl; and I said something or told some story
      that made her laugh. It can hardly have been anything remarkable, but
      perhaps, in my excited state, I told it more amusingly than I remember now&mdash;at
      any rate, I have forgotten it. But when I turned round, there was Edwarda
      standing behind me. She gave me a glance of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards I noticed that she drew the fair girl aside to find out what I
      had said. I cannot say how that look of Edwarda's cheered me, after I had
      been going about from room to room like a sort of outcast all the evening;
      I felt better at once, and spoke to several people, and was entertaining.
      As far as I am aware, I did nothing awkward or wrong...
    </p>
    <p>
      I was standing outside on the steps. Eva came carrying some things from
      one of the rooms. She saw me, came out, and touched my hands swiftly with
      one of hers; then she smiled and went in again. Neither of us had spoken.
      When I turned to go in after her, there was Edwarda in the passage,
      watching me. She also said nothing. I went into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy&mdash;Lieutenant Glahn amuses himself having meetings with the
      servants on the steps!&rdquo; said Edwarda suddenly, out loud. She was standing
      in the doorway. Several heard what she said. She laughed, as if speaking
      in jest, but her face was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer to this; I only murmured:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was accidental; she just came out, and we met in the passage...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some time passed&mdash;an hour, perhaps. A glass was upset over a lady's
      dress. As soon as Edwarda saw it, she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened? That was Glahn, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I had not done it: I was standing at the other end of the room when it
      happened. After that I drank pretty hard again, and kept near the door, to
      be out of the way of the dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron still had the ladies constantly round him. He regretted that his
      collections were packed away, so that he could not show them&mdash;that
      bunch of weed from the White Sea, the clay from Korholmerne, highly
      interesting stone formations from the bottom of the sea. The ladies peeped
      curiously at his shirt studs, the five-pointed coronets&mdash;they meant
      that he was a Baron, of course. All this time the Doctor created no
      sensation; even his witty oath, <i>Död og Pinsel</i>, no longer had any
      effect. But when Edwarda was speaking, he was always on the spot,
      correcting her language, embarrassing her with little shades of meaning,
      keeping her down with calm superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... until I go over the valley of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Doctor asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The valley of death. Isn't that what it's called&mdash;the valley of
      death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard of the river of death. I presume that is what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later on, she talked of having something guarded like a ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dragon,&rdquo; put in the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, like a dragon,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Doctor said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can thank me for saving you there. I am sure you were going to say
      Argus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baron raised his eyebrows and looked at the Doctor in surprise through
      his thick glasses, as if he had never heard such ridiculous things. But
      the Doctor paid no heed. What did he care for the Baron?
    </p>
    <p>
      I still lurked by the door. The dancers swept through the room. I managed
      to start a conversation with the governess from the vicarage. We talked
      about the war, the state of affairs in the Crimea, the happenings in
      France, Napoleon as Emperor, his protection of the Turks; the young lady
      had read the papers that summer, and could tell me the news. At last we
      sat down on a sofa and went on talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda, passing, stopped in front of us. Suddenly she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must forgive me, Lieutenant, for surprising you outside like that. I
      will never do it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she laughed again, and did not look at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edwarda,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken very formally, which meant no good, and her look was
      malicious. I thought of the Doctor, and shrugged my shoulders carelessly,
      as he would have done. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why don't you go out in the kitchen? Eva is there. I think you ought
      to stay there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there was hate in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had not been to parties often; certainly I had never before heard such a
      tone at any of the few I had been to. I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you afraid of being misunderstood, Edwarda?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but how? Possibly, of course, but how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sometimes speak without thinking. Just now, for instance, it <i>seemed</i>
      to me as if you were actually telling me to go to the kitchen and stay
      there; and that, of course, must be a misunderstanding&mdash;I know quite
      well that you did not intend to be so rude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked a few paces away from us. I could see by her manner that she
      was thinking all the time of what I had said. She turned round, came back,
      and said breathlessly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no misunderstanding, Lieutenant; you heard correctly&mdash;I did
      tell you to go to the kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Edwarda!&rdquo; broke out the terrified governess.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I began talking again about the war and the state of affairs in the
      Crimea; but my thoughts were far distant. I was no longer intoxicated,
      only hopelessly confused. The earth seemed fading from under my feet, and
      I lost my composure, as at so many unfortunate times before. I got up from
      the sofa and made as if to go out. The Doctor stopped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just been hearing your praises,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praises! From whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Edwarda. She is still standing away off there in the corner, looking
      at you with glowing eyes. I shall never forget it; her eyes were
      absolutely in love, and she said out loud that she admired you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; I said with a laugh. Alas, there was not a clear thought in my
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went up to the Baron, bent over him as if to whisper something&mdash;and
      when I was close enough, I spat in his ear. He sprang up and stared
      idiotically at me. Afterwards I saw him telling Edwarda what had occurred;
      I saw how disgusted she was. She thought, perhaps, of her shoe that I had
      thrown into the water, of the cups and glasses I had so unfortunately
      managed to break, and of all the other breaches of good taste I had
      committed; doubtless all those things flashed into her mind again. I was
      ashamed. It was all over with me; whichever way I turned, I met frightened
      and astonished looks. And I stole away from Sirilund, without a word of
      leave-taking or of thanks.

    <p>
      The Baron is going away. Well and good: I will load my gun, go up into the
      hills, and fire a salvo in his honour and Edwarda's. I will bore a deep
      hole in a rock and blow up a mountain in his honour and Edwarda's. And a
      great boulder shall roll down the hillside and dash mightily into the sea
      just as his ship is passing by. I know a spot&mdash;a channel down the
      hillside&mdash;where rocks have rolled before and made a clean road to the
      sea. Far below there is a little boat-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two mining drills,&rdquo; I say to the smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the smith whets two drills...
    </p>
    <p>
      Eva has been put to driving back and forth between the mill and the quay,
      with one of Herr Mack's horses. She has to do a man's work, transporting
      sacks of corn and flour. I meet her; her face is wonderfully fresh and
      glowing. Dear God, how tender and warm is her smile! Every evening I meet
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look as if you had no troubles, Eva, my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You call me your love! I am an ignorant woman, but I will be true to you.
      I will be true to you if I should die for it. Herr Mack grows harsher and
      harsher every day, but I do not mind it; he is furious, but I do not
      answer him. He took hold of my arm and went grey with fury. One thing
      troubles me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is it that troubles you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Herr Mack threatens you. He says to
      me: 'Aha, it's that lieutenant you've got in your head all the time!' I
      answer: 'Yes, I am his.' Then he says: 'Ah, you wait. I'll soon get rid of
      him.' He said that yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter; let him threaten...&rdquo; And with closed eyes she throws
      her arms about my neck. A quiver passes through her. The horse stands
      waiting.

    <p>
      I sit up in the hills, mining. The autumn air is crystal about me. The
      strokes of my drill ring steady and even. Æsop looks at me with wondering
      eyes. Wave after wave of content swells through my breast. No one knows
      that I am here among the lonely hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The birds of passage have gone; a happy journey and welcome back again!
      Titmouse and blackcap and a hedge-sparrow or so live now alone in the bush
      and undergrowth: tuitui! All is so curiously changed&mdash;the dwarf birch
      bleeds redly against the grey stones, a harebell here and there shows
      among the heather, swaying and whispering a little song: sh! But high
      above all hovers an eagle with outstretched neck, on his way to the inland
      ridges.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the evening comes; I lay my drill and my hammer in under the rock and
      stop to rest. All things are glooming now. The moon glides up in the
      north; the rocks cast gigantic shadows. The moon is full; it looks like a
      glowing island, like a round riddle of brass that I pass by and wonder at.
      Æsop gets up and is restless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Æsop? As for me, I am tired of my sorrow; I will forget it,
      drown it. Lie still, Æsop, I tell you; I will not be pestered. Eva asks:
      'Do you think of me sometimes?' I answer: 'Always.' Eva asks again: 'And
      is it any joy to you, to think of me?' I answer: 'Always a joy, never
      anything but a joy.' Then says Eva: 'Your hair is turning grey.' I answer:
      'Yes, it is beginning to turn grey.' But Eva says: 'Is it something you
      think about, that is turning it grey?' And to that I answer: 'Maybe.' At
      last Eva says: 'Then you do not think only of me...' Æsop, lie still; I
      will tell you about something else instead...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Æsop stands sniffing excitedly down towards the valley, pointing, and
      dragging at my clothes. When at last I get up and follow, he cannot get
      along fast enough. A flush of red shows in the sky above the woods. I go
      on faster; and there before my eyes is a glow, a huge fire. I stop and
      stare at it, go on a few steps and stare again.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hut is ablaze.

    </h2>
    <p>
      The fire was Herr Mack's doing. I saw through it from the first. I lost my
      skins and my birds' wings, I lost my stuffed eagle; everything was
      destroyed. What now? I lay out for two nights under the open sky, without
      going to Sirilund to ask for shelter. At last I rented a deserted
      fisher-hut by the quay. I stopped the cracks with dried moss, and slept on
      a load of red horseberry ling from the hills. Once more my needs were
      filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda sent me a message to say she had heard of my misfortune and that
      she offered me, on her father's behalf, a room at Sirilund. Edwarda
      touched! Edwarda generous! I sent no answer. Thank Heaven, I was no longer
      without shelter, and it gave me a proud joy to make no answer to Edwarda's
      offer. I met her on the road, with the Baron; they were walking arm in
      arm. I looked them both in the face and bowed as I passed. She stopped,
      and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you will not come and stay with us, Lieutenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am already settled in my new place,&rdquo; I said, and stopped also.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me; her bosom was heaving. &ldquo;You would have lost nothing by
      coming to us,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thankfulness moved in my heart, but I could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron walked on slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you do not want to see me any more,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Edwarda, for offering me shelter when my house was burned,&rdquo;
       I said. &ldquo;It was the kinder of you, since your father was hardly willing.&rdquo;
       And with bared head I thanked her for her offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In God's name, will you not see me again, Glahn?&rdquo; she said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Baron was calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Baron is calling,&rdquo; I said, and took off my hat again respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I went up into the hills, to my mining. Nothing, nothing should make
      me lose my self-possession any more. I met Eva. &ldquo;There, what did I say?&rdquo; I
      cried. &ldquo;Herr Mack cannot drive me away. He has burned my hut, and I
      already have another hut...&rdquo; She was carrying a tar-bucket and brush.
      &ldquo;What now, Eva?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack had a boat in a shed under the cliff, and had ordered her to tar
      it. He watched her every step&mdash;she had to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why in the shed there? Why not at the quay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herr Mack ordered it so..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eva, Eva, my love, they make a slave of you and you do not complain. See!
      now you are smiling again, and life streams through your smile, for all
      that you are a slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When I got up to my mining work, I found a surprise. I could see that
      someone had been on the spot. I examined the tracks and recognised the
      print of Herr Mack's long, pointed shoes. What could he be ferreting about
      here for? I thought to myself, and looked round. No one to be seen&mdash;I
      had no suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I fell to hammering with my drill, never dreaming what harm I did.

      The mail-packet came; it brought my uniform; it was to take the Baron and
      all his cases of scales and seaweeds on board. Now it was loading up
      barrels of herrings and oil at the quay; towards evening it would be off
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took my gun and put a heavy load of powder in each barrel. When I had
      done that, I nodded to myself. I went up into the hills and filled my mine
      with powder as well; I nodded again. Now everything was ready. I lay down
      to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      I waited for hours. All the time I could hear the steamer's winches at
      work hoisting and lowering. It was already growing dusk. At last the
      whistle sounded: the cargo was on board, the ship was putting off. I still
      had some minutes to wait. The moon was not up, and I stared like a madman
      through the gloom of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first point of the bow thrust out past the islet, I lit my slow
      match and stepped hurriedly away. A minute passed. Suddenly there was a
      roar&mdash;a spurt of stone fragments in the air&mdash;the hillside
      trembled, and the rock hurtled crashing down the abyss. The hills all
      round gave echo. I picked up my gun and fired off one barrel; the echo
      answered time and time again. After a moment I fired the second barrel
      too; the air trembled at the salute, and the echo flung the noise out into
      the wide world; it was as if all the hills had united in a shout for the
      vessel sailing away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little time passed; the air grew still, the echoes died away in all the
      hills, and earth lay silent again. The ship disappeared in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was still trembling with a strange excitement. I took my drills and my
      gun under my arm and set off with slack knees down the hillside. I took
      the shortest way, marking the smoking track left by my avalanche. Æsop
      followed me, shaking his head all the time and sneezing at the smell of
      burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I came down to the shed, I found a sight that filled me with violent
      emotion. A boat lay there, crushed by the falling rock. And Eva&mdash;Eva
      lay beside it, mangled and broken, dashed to pieces by the shock&mdash;torn
      beyond recognition. Eva&mdash;lying there, dead.

    <p>
      What more have I to write? I fired no shot for many days; I had no food,
      and did not eat at all; I sat in my shed. Eva was carried to the church in
      Herr Mack's white-painted house-boat. I went there overland on foot...
    </p>
    <p>
      Eva is dead. Do you remember her little girlish head, with hair like a
      nun's? She came so quietly, laid down her head and smiled. And did you see
      how full of life that smile was? Be still, Æsop; I remember a strange saga
      story, of four generations ago, of Iselin's time, when Stamer was a
      priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl sat captive in a stone tower. She loved a lord. Why? Ask the winds
      and the stars, ask the God of life, for there is none that knows such
      things. The lord was her friend and lover; but time went on, and one fine
      day he saw another and his liking changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a youth he loved his maid. Often he called her his blessing and his
      dove, and said: &ldquo;Give me your heart!&rdquo; And she did so. He said: &ldquo;May I ask
      for something, love?&rdquo; And, wild with joy, she answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And she gave
      him all, and yet he did not thank her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other he loved as a slave, as a madman and a beggar. Why? Ask the dust
      of the road and the leaves that fall, ask the mysterious God of life, for
      there is no other that knows such things. She gave him nothing&mdash;no,
      nothing did she give him&mdash;and yet he thanked her. She said, &ldquo;Give me
      your peace and your understanding!&rdquo; and he was only sorry that she did not
      ask his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his maid was set in the tower...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you there, maiden, sitting and smiling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of something ten years back. It was then I met him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember him still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember him still.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And time goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you there, maiden? And why do you sit and smile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am embroidering his name on a cloth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose name? His who shut you up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the one I met twenty years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You remember him still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember him as I did before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And time goes on...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you there, prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grow old, and can no longer see to sew; I scrape the plaster from the
      walls. And of that I am making an urn to be a little gift for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of whom are you speaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my lover, who shut me in the tower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you smile at that, because he locked you in the tower?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking of what he will say now. 'Look, look,' he will say, 'my
      maiden has sent me a little urn; she has not forgotten me in thirty
      years.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And time goes on...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, prisoner! sit you there idle, and smile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grow old, I grow old, my eyes are blind, I am only thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of him that you met forty years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of him whom I met when I was young. Maybe it was forty years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you not know, then, that he is dead? ... Pale beldam, you do not
      answer; your lips are white, you breathe no more...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There! That was the strange tale of the girl in the tower. Wait, Æsop,
      wait a little: there was something I forgot. One day she heard her lover's
      voice in the courtyard, and she fell on her knees and blushed. And that
      was when she was forty years...
    </p>
    <p>
      I bury you, Eva, and in humility kiss the sand above your grave. A
      luxuriant, rose-red memory flowers in me when I think of you; I am as if
      drenched in blessing at the memory of your smile. You gave all; all did
      you give, and it cost you nothing, for you were the wild child of life
      itself. But others, the miserly ones who begrudge even a glance, can have
      all my thoughts. Why? Ask the twelve months and the ships on the sea; ask
      the mysterious God of the heart...

      A man said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never go out shooting now? Æsop is running loose in the woods; he is
      after a hare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and shoot it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some days passed. Herr Mack looked me up. He was hollow-eyed; his face was
      grey. I thought: Is it true that I can see through my fellows, or is it
      not? I do not know, myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack spoke of the landslip, the catastrophe. It was a misfortune, a
      sad accident; I was in no way to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was someone who wished to separate Eva and me at any price, he has
      gained his end. God's curse be on him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack looked at me suspiciously. He murmured something about the fine
      funeral. Nothing had been spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat admiring the alertness of his mind. He would have no compensation
      for the boat that my landslide had crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but surely,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;will you not have some payment for the boat and
      the tar-bucket and the brush?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my dear Lieutenant,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;How could you think of such a
      thing?&rdquo; And he looked at me with hatred in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three weeks I saw nothing of Edwarda. Yes, once I met her at the
      store: when I went to buy some bread, she stood inside the counter looking
      over some different sorts of cloth stuff. Only the two assistants were
      there besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      I greeted her aloud, and she looked up, but did not answer. It occurred to
      me that I could not ask for bread while she was there; I turned to the
      assistants and asked for powder and shot. While they were weighing it out,
      I watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A grey dress, much too small for her, with the buttonholes worn; her flat
      breast heaved restlessly. How she had grown that summer! Her brow was knit
      in thought; those strangely curved eyebrows stood in her face like two
      riddles; all her movements were grown more mature. I looked at her hands;
      the contour of her long, delicate fingers moved me violently, made me
      tremble. She was still turning over the stuffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stood wishing that Æsop would run to her behind the counter&mdash;then I
      could call him back at once and apologise. What would she say then?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; said the storekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I paid for the things, took up my parcels, and took my leave of her. She
      looked up, but again without speaking. Good, I thought to myself. She is
      the Baron's bride already, as like as not. And I went, without my bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I got outside, I looked up at the window. No one was watching me.

    <p>
      Then one night the snow came, and it began to be cold in my hut. There was
      a fireplace where I cooked my food, but the wood burned poorly and it was
      very draughty, though I had caulked the walls as well as I could. The
      autumn was past, and the days were growing shorter. The first snow was
      still melting under the rays of the sun. Presently the ground was bare
      again, but the nights were cold, and the water froze. And all the grass
      and all the insects died.
    </p>
    <p>
      A secret stillness fell upon people; they pondered and were silent; their
      eyes awaited the winter. No more calling from the drying grounds: the
      harbour lay quiet. Everything was moving towards the eternal winter of the
      northern lights, when the sun sleeps in the sea. Dull came the sound of
      the oars from a lonely boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl came rowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been, my girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere? Look, I recognize you: I met you last summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She brought the boat in, stepped ashore, made fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were herding goats. You stopped to fasten your stocking. I met you
      one night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little flush rose to her cheeks, and she laughed shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little goat-girl, come into the hut and let me look at you. I knew your
      name, too&mdash;it is Henriette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she walked past me without speaking. The autumn, the winter, had laid
      hold of her too; her senses drowsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the sun had gone to sea.

    <p>
      And I put on my uniform for the first time, and went down to Sirilund. My
      heart was beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remembered everything from the day when Edwarda had come hurrying to me
      and embraced me before them all. Now she had thrown me hither and thither
      for many months, and made my hair turn grey. My own fault? Yes, my star
      had led me astray. I thought: How she would chuckle if I were to throw
      myself at her feet and tell her the secret of my heart to-day! She would
      offer me a chair and have wine brought in, and just as she was raising the
      glass to her lips to drink with me, she would say: &ldquo;Lieutenant, I thank
      you for the time we have been together. I shall never forget it!&rdquo; But when
      I grew glad and felt a little hope, she'd pretend to drink, and set down
      the glass untouched. And she wouldn't hide from me that she'd only been
      pretending to drink; she'd be careful to let me see it. That was her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good&mdash;it was nearing the last hour now.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as I walked down the road I thought further: My uniform will impress
      her; the trappings are new and handsome. The sword will rattle against the
      floor. A nervous joy thrilled me, and I whispered to myself: Who knows
      what may happen yet? I raised my head and threw out a hand. No more
      humility now&mdash;a man's honour and pride! Whatever came of it, I would
      make no more advances now. Pardon me, my fair one, for not asking your
      hand...
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Mack met me in the courtyard, greyer still, more hollow-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going away? So? I suppose you've not been very comfortable lately, eh?
      Your hut burned down...&rdquo; And Herr Mack smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment it seemed as if the wisest man in the world stood before my
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go indoors, Lieutenant; Edwarda is there. Well, I will say good-bye. See
      you on the quay, I suppose, when the vessel sails.&rdquo; He walked off, with
      head bowed in thought, whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda was sitting indoors, reading. At the instant of my entering, she
      started at my uniform; she looked at me sideways like a bird, and even
      blushed. She opened her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to say good-bye,&rdquo; I managed to get out at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose quickly to her feet, and I saw that my words had had some effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glahn, are you going away? Now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as the boat comes.&rdquo; I grasped her hand&mdash;both her hands&mdash;a
      senseless delight took possession of me&mdash;I burst out, &ldquo;Edwarda!&rdquo; and
      stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in a moment she was cold&mdash;cold and defiant. Her whole being
      resisted me; she drew herself up. I found myself standing like a beggar
      before her. I loosed her hand and let her go. I remember that from that
      moment I stood repeating mechanically: &ldquo;Edwarda, Edwarda!&rdquo; again and again
      without thinking, and when she asked: &ldquo;Yes? What were you going to say?&rdquo; I
      explained nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think you are going already,&rdquo; she said again. &ldquo;Who will come next
      year, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;The hut will be built up again, no doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pause. She was already reaching for her book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry my father is not in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I will tell him you were
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer to this. I stepped forward, took her hand once more, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Farvel,</i> Edwarda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Farvel,&rdquo;</i> she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened the door as if to go. Already she was sitting with the book in
      her hand, reading&mdash;actually reading and turning the page. Nothing
      affected, not the least in the world affected by my saying good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      I coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned and said in surprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, are you not gone? I thought you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Heaven alone knows, but it struck me that her surprise was too great; that
      she was not careful, that she overdid it. And it came into my head that
      perhaps she had known all the time that I was standing behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going now,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she rose and came over to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have something to remember you by when you go,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I thought of asking you for something, but perhaps it is too much.
      Will you give me Æsop?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I did not hesitate. I answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, perhaps, you would come and bring him to-morrow,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked up at the window. No one there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all over now...

    </p>
    <p>
      The last night in the hut. I sat in thought, I counted the hours; when the
      morning came I made ready my last meal. It was a cold day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had she asked me to come myself and bring the dog? Would she tell me
      something, speak to me, for the last time? I had nothing more to hope for.
      And how would she treat Æsop? Æsop, Æsop, she will torture you! For my
      sake she will whip you, caress you too, perhaps, but certainly whip you,
      with and without reason; ruin you altogether...
    </p>
    <p>
      I called Æsop to me, patted him, put our two heads together, and picked up
      my gun. He was already whining with pleasure, thinking we were going out
      after game. I put our heads together once more; I laid the muzzle of the
      gun against Æsop's neck and fired...
    </p>
    <p>
      I hired a man to carry Æsop's body to Edwarda.

      The mail-packet was to sail in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went down to the quay. My things were already on board. Herr Mack
      pressed my hand, and said encouragingly that it would be nice weather,
      pleasant weather; he would not mind making the trip himself in such
      weather. The Doctor came walking down. Edwarda was with him; I felt my
      knees beginning to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Came to see you safely off,&rdquo; said the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thanked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda looked me straight in the face and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must thank you for your dog.&rdquo; She pressed her lips together; they were
      quite white. Again she had called me &ldquo;<i>Eder</i>.&rdquo; [Footnote: The most
      formal mode of address.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does the boat go?&rdquo; the Doctor asked a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In half an hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda was turning restlessly this way and that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor, don't you think we may as well go home again?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have
      done what I came for to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done what you came <i>to do</i>,&rdquo; said the Doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, humiliated by his everlasting correction, and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't that almost what I said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I looked at him. The little man stood there cold and firm; he had made a
      plan, and he carried it out to the last. And if he lost after all? In any
      case, he would never show it; his face never betrayed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;And thanks for&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edwarda looked at me dumbly. Then she turned her head and stood looking
      out at the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got into the boat. Edwarda was still standing on the quay. When I got on
      board, the Doctor called out &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; I looked over to the shore.
      Edwarda turned at the same time and walked hurriedly away from the quay,
      the Doctor far behind. That was the last I saw of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wave of sadness went through my heart...
    </p>
    <p>
      The vessel began to move; I could still see Herr Mack's sign: &ldquo;Salt and
      Barrels.&rdquo; But soon it disappeared. The moon and the stars came out; the
      hills towered round about, and I saw the endless woods. There is the mill;
      there, there stood my hut, that was burned; the big grey stone stands
      there all alone on the site of the fire. Iselin, Eva...
    </p>
    <p>
      The night of the northern lights spreads over valley and hill.

    </h2>
    <p>
      I have written this to pass the time. It has amused me to look back to
      that summer in Nordland, when I often counted the hours, but when time
      flew nevertheless. All is changed. The days will no longer pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have many a merry hour even yet. But time&mdash;it stands still, and I
      cannot understand how it can stand so still. I am out of the service, and
      free as a prince; all is well; I meet people, drive in carriages; now and
      again I shut one eye and write with one finger up in the sky; I tickle the
      moon under the chin, and fancy that it laughs&mdash;laughs broadly at
      being tickled under the chin. All things smile. I pop a cork and call gay
      people to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Edwarda, I do not think of her. Why should I not have forgotten her
      altogether, after all this time? I have some pride. And if anyone asks
      whether I have any sorrows, then I answer straight out, &ldquo;No&mdash;none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cora lies looking at me. Æsop, it used to be, but now it is Cora that lies
      looking at me. The clock ticks on the mantel; outside my open window
      sounds the roar of the city. A knock at the door, and the postman hands me
      a letter. A letter with a coronet. I know who sent it; I understand it at
      once, or maybe I dreamed it one sleepless night. But in the envelope there
      is no letter at all&mdash;only two green bird's feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      An icy horror thrills me; I turn cold. Two green feathers! I say to
      myself: Well, and what of it? But why should I turn cold? Why, there is a
      cursed draught from those windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I shut the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      There lie two bird's feathers, I think to myself again. I seem to know
      them; they remind me of a little jest up in Nordland, just a little
      episode among a host of others. It is amusing to see those two feathers
      again. And suddenly I seem to see a face and hear a voice, and the voice
      says: &ldquo;Her, Herr Lieutenant: here are your feathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your feathers.&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Cora, lie still&mdash;do you hear? I will kill you if you move!
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather is hot, an intolerable heat is in the room; what was I
      thinking of to close the windows? Open them again&mdash;open the door too;
      open it wide&mdash;this way, merry souls, come in! Hey, messenger, an
      errand&mdash;go out and fetch me a host of people...
    </p>
    <p>
      And the day passes; but time stands still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I have written this for my own pleasure only, and amused myself with
      it as best I could. No sorrow weighs on me, but I long to be away&mdash;where,
      I do not know, but far away, perhaps in Africa or India. For my place is
      in the woods, in solitude...

    </h2>
    <p>
      The Glahn family can go on advertising as long as they please for
      Lieutenant Thomas Glahn, who disappeared; but he will never come back. He
      is dead, and, what is more, I know how he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell the truth, I am not surprised that his people should still keep on
      seeking information; for Thomas Glahn was in many ways an uncommon and
      likable man. I admit this, for fairness' sake, and despite the fact that
      Glahn is still repellant to my soul, so that the bare memory of him
      arouses hatred. He was a splendidly handsome man, full of youth, and with
      an irresistible manner. When he looked at you with his hot animal eyes,
      you could not but feel his power; even I felt it so. A woman, they say,
      said: &ldquo;When he looks at me, I am lost; I feel a sensation as if he were
      touching me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Thomas Glahn had his faults, and I have no intention of hiding them,
      seeing that I hate him. He could at times be full of nonsense like a
      child, so kindly natured was he; and perhaps it was that which made him so
      irresistible to women. God knows! He could chat with them and laugh at
      their senseless twaddle; and so he made an impression. Once, speaking of a
      very corpulent man in the place, he said that he looked as if he went
      about with his breeches full of lard. And he laughed at that joke himself,
      though I should have been ashamed of it. Another time, after we had come
      to live in the same house together, he showed his foolishness in an
      unmistakable way. My landlady came in one morning and asked what I would
      have for breakfast, and in my hurry I happened to answer: &ldquo;A bread and a
      slice of egg.&rdquo; Thomas Glahn was sitting in my room at the time&mdash;he
      lived in the attic up above, just under the roof&mdash;and he began to
      chuckle and laugh childishly over my little slip of the tongue. &ldquo;A bread
      and a slice of egg!&rdquo; he repeated time over and over, until I looked at him
      in surprise and made him stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe I shall call to mind other ridiculous traits of his later on. If so,
      I will write them down too, and not spare him, seeing that he is still my
      enemy. Why should I be generous? But I will admit that he talked nonsense
      only when he was drunk. But is it not a great mistake to be drunk at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I first met him, in the autumn of 1859, he was a man of
      two-and-thirty&mdash;we were of an age. He wore a full beard at that time,
      and affected woolen sports shirts with an exaggerated lowness of neck; not
      content with that, he sometimes left the top button undone. His neck
      appeared to me at first to be remarkably handsome; but little by little he
      made me his deadly enemy, and then I did not consider his neck handsomer
      than mine, though I did not show off mine so openly. I met him first on a
      river boat, and we were going to the same place, on a hunting trip; we
      agreed to go together up-country by ox-wagon when we came to the end of
      the railway. I purposely refrained from stating the place we were going
      to, not wishing to set anyone on the track. But the Glahns can safely stop
      advertising for their relative; for he died at the place we went to, which
      I will not name.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had heard of Thomas Glahn, by the way, before I met him; his name was
      not unknown to me. I had heard of some affair of his with a young girl
      from Nordland, from a big house there, and that he had compromised her in
      some way, after which she broke it off. This he had sworn, in his foolish
      obstinacy, to revenge upon himself, and the lady calmly let him do as he
      pleased in that respect, considering it no business of hers. From that
      time onwards, Thomas Glahn's name began to be well known; he turned wild,
      mad; he drank, created scandal after scandal, and resigned his commission
      in the army. A queer way of taking vengeance for a girl's refusal!
    </p>
    <p>
      There was also another story of his relations with that young lady, to the
      effect that he had not compromised her in any way, but that her people had
      showed him the door, and that she herself had helped in it, after a
      Swedish Count, whose name I will not mention, had proposed to her. But
      this account I am less inclined to trust; I regard the first as true, for
      after all I hate Thomas Glahn and believe him capable of the worst. But,
      however it may have been, he never spoke himself of the affair with that
      noble lady, and I did not ask him about it. What business was it of mine?
    </p>
    <p>
      As we sat there on the boat, I remember we talked about the little village
      we were making for, to which neither of us had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a sort of hotel there, I believe,&rdquo; said Glahn, looking at the
      map. &ldquo;Kept by an old half-caste woman, so they say. The chief lives in the
      next village, and has a heap of wives, by all accounts&mdash;some of them
      only ten years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, I knew nothing about the chief and his wives, or whether there was a
      hotel in the place, so I said nothing. But Glahn smiled, and I thought his
      smile was beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I forgot, by the way, that he could not by any means be called a perfect
      man, handsome though he was. He told me himself that he had an old gunshot
      wound in his left foot, and that it was full of gout whenever the weather
      changed.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week later we were lodged in the big hut that went by the name of hotel,
      with the old English half-caste woman. What a hotel it was! The walls were
      of clay, with a little wood, and the wood was eaten through by the white
      ants that crawled about everywhere. I lived in a room next the main
      parlor, with a green glass window looking on to the street&mdash;a single
      pane, not very clear at that&mdash;and Glahn had chosen a little bit of a
      hole up in the attic, much darker, and a poor place to live in. The sun
      heated the thatched roof and made his room almost insufferably hot at
      night and day; besides which, it was not a stair at all that led up to it,
      but a wretched bit of a ladder with four steps. What could I do? I let him
      take his choice, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are two rooms, one upstairs and one down; take your choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Glahn looked at the two rooms and took the upper one, possibly to give
      me the better of the two&mdash;but was I not grateful for it? I owe him
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as the worst of the heat lasted, we left the hunting alone and
      stayed quietly in the hut, for the heat was extremely uncomfortable. We
      lay at night with a mosquito net over the bedplace, to keep off the
      insects; but even then it happened sometimes that blind bats would come
      flying silently against our nets and tear them. This happened too often to
      Glahn, because he was obliged to have a trap in the roof open all the
      time, on account of the heat; but it did not happen to me. In the daytime
      we lay on mats outside the hut, and smoked and watched the life about the
      other huts. The natives were brown, thick-lipped folk, all with rings in
      their ears and dead, brown eyes; they were almost naked, with just a strip
      of cotton cloth or plaited leaves round the middle, and the women had also
      a short petticoat of cotton stuff to cover them. All the children went
      about stark naked night and day, with great big prominent bellies simply
      glistening with oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women are too fat,&rdquo; said Glahn.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I too thought the women were too fat. Perhaps it was not Glahn at all,
      but myself, who thought so first; but I will not dispute his claim&mdash;I
      am willing to give him the credit. As a matter of fact, not all the women
      were ugly, though their faces were fat and swollen. I had met a girl in
      the village, a young half-Tamil with long hair and snow-white teeth; she
      was the prettiest of them all. I came upon her one evening at the edge of
      a rice field. She lay flat on her face in the high grass, kicking her legs
      in the air. She could talk to me, and we did talk, too, as long as I
      pleased. Glahn sat that evening in the middle of our village outside a hut
      with two other girls, very young&mdash;not more than ten years old,
      perhaps. He sat there talking nonsense to them, and drinking rice beer;
      that was the sort of thing he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of days later, we went out shooting. We passed by tea gardens,
      rice fields, and grass plains; we left the village behind us and went in
      the direction of the river, and came into forests of strange foreign
      trees, bamboo and mango, tamarind, teak and salt trees, oil&mdash;and
      gum-bearing plants&mdash;Heaven knows what they all were; we had, between
      us, but little knowledge of the things. But there was very little water in
      the river, and so it remained until the rainy season. We shot wild pigeons
      and partridges, and saw a couple of panthers one afternoon; parrots, too,
      flew over our heads. Glahn was a terribly accurate shot; he never missed.
      But that was merely because his gun was better than mine; many times I too
      shot terribly accurately. I never boasted of it, but Glahn would often
      say: &ldquo;I'll get that fellow in the tail,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that one in the head.&rdquo; He
      would say that before he fired; and when the bird fell, sure enough, it
      was hit in the tail or the head as he had said. When we came upon the two
      panthers, Glahn was all for attacking them too with his shot-gun, but I
      persuaded him to give it up, as it was getting dusk, and we had no more
      than two or three cartridges left. He boasted of that too&mdash;of having
      had the courage to attack panthers with a shot-gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I did not fire at them after all,&rdquo; he said to me. &ldquo;What do you
      want to be so infernally cautious for? Do you want to go on living?&rdquo; &ldquo;I'm
      glad you consider me wiser than yourself,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't let us quarrel over a trifle,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were his words, not mine; if he had wished to quarrel, I for my part
      had no wish to prevent him. I was beginning to feel some dislike for him
      for his incautious behavior, and for his manner with women. Only the night
      before, I had been walking quietly along with Maggie, the Tamil girl that
      was my friend, and we were both as happy as could be. Glahn sits outside
      his hut, and nods and smiles to us as we pass. It was then that Maggie saw
      him for the first time, and she was very inquisitive about him. So great
      an impression had he made on her that, when it was time to go, we went
      each our own way; she did not go back home with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glahn would have put this by as of no importance when I spoke to him about
      it. But I did not forget it. And it was not to me that he nodded and
      smiled as we passed by the hut! it was to Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that she chews?&rdquo; he asked me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;She chews&mdash;I suppose that's what her
      teeth are for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was no news to me either that Maggie was always chewing something;
      I had noticed it long before. But it was not betel she was chewing, for
      her teeth were quite white; she had, however, a habit of chewing all sorts
      of other things&mdash;putting them in her mouth and chewing as if they
      were something nice. Anything would do&mdash;a piece of money, a scrap of
      paper, feathers&mdash;she would chew it all the same. Still, it was
      nothing to reproach her for, seeing that she was the prettiest girl in the
      village, anyway. Glahn was jealous of me, that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was friends again with Maggie, though, next evening, and we saw nothing
      of Glahn.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week passed, and we went out shooting every day, and shot a heap of
      game. One morning, just as we were entering the forest, Glahn gripped me
      by the arm and whispered: &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; At the same moment he threw up his rifle
      and fired. It was a young leopard he had shot, I might have fired myself,
      but Glahn kept the honour to himself and fired first. Now he'll boast of
      that later on, I said to myself. We went up to the dead beast. It was
      stone dead, the left flank all torn up and the bullet in its back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I do not like being gripped by the arm, so I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have managed that shot myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glahn looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said: &ldquo;You think perhaps I couldn't have done it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Glahn made no answer. Instead, he showed his childishness once more,
      shooting the dead leopard again, this time through the head. I looked at
      him in utter astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know,&rdquo; he explains, &ldquo;I shouldn't like to have it said that I
      shot a leopard in the flank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very amiable this evening,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too much for his vanity to have made such a poor shot; he must
      always be first. What a fool he was! But it was no business of mine,
      anyway. I was not going to show him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when we came back to the village with the dead leopard, a
      lot of the natives came out to look at it. Glahn simply said we had shot
      it that morning, and made no sort of fuss about it himself at the time.
      Maggie came up too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who shot it?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Glahn answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see for yourself&mdash;twice hit. We shot it this morning when we
      went out.&rdquo; And he turned the beast over and showed her the two bullet
      wounds, both that in the flank and that in the head. &ldquo;That's where mine
      went,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the side&mdash;in his idiotic fashion he
      wanted me to have the credit of having shot it in the head. I did not
      trouble to correct him; I said nothing. After that, Glahn began treating
      the natives with rice beer&mdash;gave them any amount of it, as many as
      cared to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both shot it,&rdquo; said Maggie to herself; but she was looking at Glahn all
      the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew her aside with me and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you looking at him all the time for? I am here too, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And listen: I am coming this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the day after this that Glahn got the letter. There came a letter
      for him, sent up by express messenger from the river station, and it had
      made a detour of a hundred and eighty miles. The letter was in a woman's
      hand, and I thought to my self that perhaps it was from that former friend
      of his, the noble lady. Glahn laughed nervously when he had read it, and
      gave the messenger extra money for bringing it. But it was not long before
      he turned silent and gloomy, and did nothing but sit staring straight
      before him. That evening he got drunk&mdash;sat drinking with an old dwarf
      of a native and his son, and clung hold of me too, and did all he could to
      make me drink as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he laughed out loud and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we are, the two of us, miles away in the middle of all India
      shooting game&mdash;what? Desperately funny, isn't it? And hurrah for all
      the lands and kingdoms of the earth, and hurrah for all the pretty women,
      married or unmarried, far and near. Hoho! Nice thing for a man when a
      married woman proposes to him, isn't it&mdash;a married woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A countess,&rdquo; I said ironically. I said it very scornfully, and that cut
      him. He grinned like a dog because it hurt him. Then suddenly he wrinkled
      his forehead and began blinking his eyes, and thinking hard if he hadn't
      said too much&mdash;so mighty serious was he about his bit of a secret.
      But just then a lot of children came running over to our hut and crying
      out: &ldquo;Tigers, ohoi, the tigers!&rdquo; A child had been snapped up by a tiger
      quite close to the village, in a thicket between it and the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was enough for Glahn, drunk as he was, and cut up about something
      into the bargain. He picked up his rifle and raced off at once to the
      thicket&mdash;didn't even put on his hat. But why did he take his rifle
      instead of a shot-gun, if he was really as plucky as all that? He had to
      wade across the river, and that was rather a risky thing in itself&mdash;but
      then, the river was nearly dry now, till the rains. A little later I heard
      two shots, and then, close on them, a third. Three shots at a single
      beast, I thought; why, a lion would have fallen for two, and this was only
      a tiger! But even those three shots were no use: the child was torn to
      bits and half eaten by the time Glahn come up. If he hadn't been drunk he
      wouldn't have made the attempt to save it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent the night drinking and rioting in the hut next door. For two days
      he was never sober for a minute, and he had found a lot of companions,
      too, to drink with him. He begged me in vain to take part in the orgy. He
      was no longer careful of what he said, and taunted me with being jealous
      of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your jealousy makes you blind,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      My jealousy? I, jealous of him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I jealous of you? What's there for me to be jealous
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, of course you're not jealous of me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I saw Maggie
      this evening, by the way. She was chewing something, as usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer; I simply walked off.

    <h2>
      IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      We began going out shooting again. Glahn felt he had wronged me, and
      begged my pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'm dead sick of the whole thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I only wish you'd make a
      slip one day and put a bullet in my throat.&rdquo; It was that letter from the
      Countess again, perhaps, that was smouldering in his mind. I answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a man soweth, so shall he also reap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Day by day he grew more silent and gloomy. He had given up drinking now,
      and didn't say a word, either; his cheeks grew hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day I heard talking and laughter outside my window; Glahn had turned
      cheerful again, and he stood there talking out loud to Maggie. He was
      getting in all his fascinating tricks. Maggie must have come straight from
      her hut, and Glahn had been watching and waiting for her. They even had
      the nerve to stand there making up together right outside my glass window.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt a trembling in all my limbs. I cocked my gun; then I let the hammer
      down again. I went outside and took Maggie by the arm; we walked out of
      the village in silence; Glahn went back into the hut again at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you talking with him again for?&rdquo; I asked Maggie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was thoroughly desperate. My heart beat so I could hardly breathe. I had
      never seen Maggie look so lovely as she did then&mdash;never seen a real
      white girl so beautiful. And I forgot she was a Tamil&mdash;forgot
      everything for her sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What were you talking to him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him best,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You like him better than me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh, indeed! She liked him better than me, though I was at least as good a
      man! Hadn't I always been kind to her, and given her money and presents?
      And what had he done?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He makes fun of you; he says you're always chewing things,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not understand that, and I explained it better; how she had a
      habit of putting everything in her mouth and chewing it, and how Glahn
      laughed at her for it. That made more impression on her than all the rest
      I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Maggie,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;you shall be mine for always. Wouldn't
      you like that? I've been thinking it over. You shall go with me when I
      leave here; I will marry you, do you hear? and we'll go to our own country
      and live there. You'd like that, wouldn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that impressed her too. Maggie grew lively and talked a lot as we
      walked. She only mentioned Glahn once; she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will Glahn go with us when we go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He won't. Are you sorry about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;I am glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said no more about him, and I felt easier. And Maggie went home with
      me, too, when I asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she went, a couple of hours later, I climbed up the ladder to Glahn's
      room and knocked at the thin reed door. He was in. I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to tell you that perhaps we'd better not go out shooting
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Glahn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I'm not so sure but I might make a little mistake and put a
      bullet in your throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glahn did not answer, and I went down again. After that warning he would
      hardly dare to go out to-morrow&mdash;but what did he want to get Maggie
      out under my window for, and fool with her there at the top of his voice?
      Why didn't he go back home again, if the letter really asked him, instead
      of going about as he often did, clenching his teeth and shouting at the
      empty air: &ldquo;Never, never! I'll be drawn and quartered first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the morning after I had warned him, as I said, there was Glahn the
      same as ever, standing by my bed, calling out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up with you, comrade! It's a lovely day; we must go out and shoot
      something. That was all nonsense you said yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was no more than four o'clock, but I got up at once and got ready to go
      with him, in spite of my warning. I loaded my gun before starting out, and
      I let him see that I did. And it was not at all a lovely day, as he had
      said; it was raining, which showed that he was only trying to irritate me
      the more. But I took no notice, and went with him, saying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day we wandered round through the forest, each lost in his own
      thoughts. We shot nothing&mdash;lost one chance after another, through
      thinking of other things than sport. About noon, Glahn began walking a bit
      ahead of me, as if to give me a better chance of doing what I liked with
      him. He walked right across the muzzle of my gun; but I bore with that
      too. We came back that evening. Nothing had happened. I thought to myself:
      &ldquo;Perhaps he'll be more careful now, and leave Maggie alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This has been the longest day of my life,&rdquo; said Glahn when we got back to
      the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was said on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few days he was in the blackest humor, seemingly all about the
      same letter. &ldquo;I can't stand it; no, it's more than I can bear,&rdquo; he would
      say sometimes in the night; we could hear it all through the hut. His ill
      temper carried him so far that he would not even answer the most friendly
      questions when our landlady spoke to him; and he used to groan in his
      sleep. He must have a deal on his conscience, I thought&mdash;but why in
      the name of goodness didn't he go home? Just pride, no doubt; he would not
      go back when he had been turned off once.
    </p>
    <p>
      I met Maggie every evening, and Glahn talked with her no more. I noticed
      that she had given up chewing things altogether; she never chewed now. I
      was pleased at that, and thought: She's given up chewing things; that is
      one failing the less, and I love her twice as much as I did before!
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she asked about Glahn&mdash;asked very cautiously. Was he not
      well? Had he gone away?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he's not dead, or gone away,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he's lying at home, no doubt.
      It's all one to me. He's beyond all bearing now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But just then, coming up to the hut, we saw Glahn lying on a mat on the
      ground, hands at the back of his neck, staring up at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maggie went straight up to him, before I could stop her, and said in a
      pleased sort of voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't chew things now&mdash;nothing at all. No feathers or money or
      bits of paper&mdash;you can see for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glahn scarcely looked at her. He lay still. Maggie and I went on. When I
      reproached her with having broken her promise and spoken to Glahn again,
      she answered that she had only meant to show him he was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right&mdash;show him he's wrong,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But do you mean it was
      for his sake you stopped chewing things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She didn't answer. What, wouldn't she answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear? Tell me, was it for his sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And I could not think otherwise. Why should she do anything for Glahn's
      sake?
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Maggie promised to come to me, and she did.
    </p>

    <h2>
      V
    </h2>
    <p>
      She came at ten o'clock. I heard her voice outside; she was talking loud
      to a child whom she led by the hand. Why did she not come in, and what had
      she brought the child for? I watched her, and it struck me that she was
      giving a signal by talking out loud to the child; I noticed, too, that she
      kept her eyes fixed on the attic&mdash;on Glahn's window up there. Had he
      nodded to her, I wondered, or beckoned to her from inside when he heard
      her talking outside? Anyhow, I had sense enough myself to know there was
      no need to look up aloft when talking to a child on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was going out to take her by the arm. But just then she let go the
      child's hand, left the child standing there, and came in herself, through
      the door to the hut. She stepped into the passage. Well, there she was at
      last; I would take care to give her a good talking to when she came!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I stood there and heard Maggie step into the passage. There was no
      mistake: she was close outside my door. But instead of coming in to me, I
      heard her step up the ladder&mdash;up to the attic&mdash;to Glahn's hole
      up there. I heard it only too well. I threw my door open wide, but Maggie
      had gone up already. That was ten o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went in, sat down in my room, and took my gun and loaded it. At twelve
      o'clock I went up the ladder and listened at Glahn's door. I could hear
      Maggie in there; I went down again. At one I went up again; all was quiet
      this time. I waited outside the door. Three o'clock, four o'clock, five.
      Good, I thought to myself. But a little after, I heard a noise and
      movement below in the hut, in my landlady's room; and I had to go down
      again quickly, so as not to let her find me there. I might have listened
      much more, but I had to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the passage I said to myself: &ldquo;See, here she went: she must have
      touched my door with her arm as she passed, but she did not open the door:
      she went up the ladder, and here is the ladder itself&mdash;those four
      steps, she has trodden them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My bed still lay untouched, and I did not lie down now, but sat by the
      window, fingering my rifle now and again. My heart was not beating&mdash;it
      was trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later I heard Maggie's footstep on the ladder again. I lay
      close up to the window and saw her walk out of the hut. She was wearing
      her little short cotton petticoat, that did not even reach to her knees,
      and over her shoulders a woolen scarf borrowed from Glahn. She walked
      slowly, as she always did, and did not so much as glance towards my
      window. Then she disappeared behind the huts.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after came Glahn, with his rifle under his arm, all ready to go
      out. He looked gloomy, and did not even say good-morning. I noticed,
      though, that he had got himself up and taken special care about his dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I got ready at once and went with him. Neither of us said a word. The
      first two birds we shot were mangled horribly, through shooting them with
      the rifle; but we cooked them under a tree as best we could, and ate in
      silence. So the day wore on till noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glahn called out to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure your gun is loaded? We might come across something unexpectedly.
      Load it, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is loaded,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he disappeared a moment into the bush. I felt it would be a pleasure
      to shoot him then&mdash;pick him off and shoot him down like a dog. There
      was no hurry; he could still enjoy the thought of it for a bit. He knew
      well enough what I had in mind: that was why he had asked if my gun were
      loaded. Even to-day he could not refrain from giving way to his beastly
      pride. He had dressed himself up and put on a new shirt; his manner was,
      lordly beyond all bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      About one o'clock he stopped, pale and angry, in front of me, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't stand this! Look and see if you're loaded, man&mdash;if you've
      anything in your gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kindly look after your own gun,&rdquo; I answered. But I knew well enough why
      he kept asking about mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he turned away again. My answer had so effectively put him in his
      place that he actually seemed cowed: he even hung his head as he walked
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while I shot a pigeon, and loaded again. While I was doing so, I
      caught sight of Glahn standing half hidden behind a tree, watching me to
      see if I really loaded. A little later he started singing a hymn&mdash;and
      a wedding hymn into the bargain. Singing wedding hymns, and putting on his
      best clothes, I thought to myself&mdash;that's his way of being extra
      fascinating to-day. Even before he had finished the hymn he began walking
      softly in front of me, hanging his head, and still singing as he walked.
      He was keeping right in front of the muzzle of my gun again, as if
      thinking to himself: Now it is coming, and that is why I am singing this
      wedding hymn! But it did not come yet, and when he had finished his
      singing he had to look back at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shan't get much to-day anyhow, by the look of it,&rdquo; he said, with a
      smile, as if excusing himself, and asking pardon of me for singing while
      we were out after game. But even at that moment his smile was beautiful.
      It was as if he were weeping inwardly, and his lips trembled, too, for all
      that he boasted of being able to smile at such a solemn moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was no woman, and he saw well enough that he made no impression on me.
      He grew impatient, his face paled, he circled round me with hasty steps,
      showing up now to the left, now to the right of me, and stopping every now
      and then to wait for me to come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      About five, I heard a shot all of a sudden, and a bullet sang past my left
      ear. I looked up. There was Glahn standing motionless a few paces off,
      staring at me; his smoking rifle lay along his arm. Had he tried to shoot
      me? I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You missed that time. You've been shooting badly of late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had not been shooting badly. He never missed. He had only been
      trying to irritate me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take your revenge, damn you!&rdquo; he shouted back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; I said, clenching my teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood there looking at each other. And suddenly Glahn shrugged his
      shoulders and called out &ldquo;Coward&rdquo; to me. And why should he call me a
      coward? I threw my rifle to my shoulder&mdash;aimed full in his face&mdash;fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a man soweth...
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there is no need, I insist, for the Glahns to make further inquiry
      about this man. It annoys me to be constantly seeing their advertisements
      offering such and such reward for information about a dead man. Thomas
      Glahn was killed by accident&mdash;shot by accident when out on a hunting
      trip in India. The court entered his name, with the particulars of his
      end, in a register with pierced and threaded leaves. And in that register
      it says that he is dead&mdash;<i>dead</i>, I tell you&mdash;and what is
      more, that he was killed by accident.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
