<p class="s1 center">Translator's Note</p>


<p><em>The Woman and the Priest</em><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> is an unusual
book, both in its story and its setting
in a remote Sardinian hill village, half civilized
and superstitious. But the chief interest lies
in the psychological study of the two chief
characters, and the action of the story takes
place so rapidly (all within the space of two
days) and the actual drama is so interwoven
with the mental conflict, and all so forced by
circumstances, that it is almost Greek in its
simple and inevitable tragedy.</p>

<p>The book is written without offence to any
creed or opinions, and touches on no questions
of either doctrine or Church government. It
is just a human problem, the result of primitive
human nature against man-made laws it cannot
understand.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>To-night again Paul was preparing to
go out, it seemed.</p>

<p>From her room adjoining his the mother
could hear him moving about furtively, perhaps
waiting to go out until she should have
extinguished her light and got into bed.</p>

<p>She put out her light, but she did not get
into bed.</p>

<p>Seated close against the door, she clasped
her hands tightly together, those work-worn
hands of a servant, pressing the thumbs one
upon the other to give herself courage; but
every moment her uneasiness increased and
overcame her obstinate hope that her son
would sit down quietly, as he used to do, and
begin to read, or else go to bed. For a few
minutes, indeed, the young priest's cautious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
steps were silent. She felt herself all alone.
Outside, the noise of the wind mingled with
the murmuring of the trees which grew on
the ridge of high ground behind the little
presbytery; not a high wind, but incessant,
monotonous, that sounded as though it were
enveloping the house in some creaking, invisible
band, ever closer and closer, trying to uproot
it from its foundations and drag it to the
ground.</p>

<p>The mother had already closed the house door
and barricaded it with two crossed bars, in
order to prevent the devil, who on windy
nights roams abroad in search of souls, from
penetrating into the house. As a matter of fact,
however, she put little faith in such things.
And now she reflected with bitterness, and a
vague contempt of herself, that the evil spirit
was already inside the little presbytery, that
it drank from her Paul's cup and hovered about
the mirror he had hung on the wall near his
window.</p>

<p>Just then she heard Paul moving about again.
Perhaps he was actually standing in front of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the mirror, although that was forbidden to
priests. But what had Paul not allowed himself
for some considerable time now?</p>

<p>The mother remembered that lately she had
several times come upon him gazing at himself
in the glass like any woman, cleaning and
polishing his nails, or brushing his hair, which
he had left to grow long and then turned back
over his head, as though trying to conceal the
holy mark of the tonsure. And then he made
use of perfumes, he brushed his teeth with
scented powder, and even combed out his
eyebrows.</p>

<p>She seemed to see him now as plainly as
though the dividing wall did not exist, a black
figure against the white background of his
room; a tall, thin figure, almost too tall, going
to and fro with the heedless steps of a boy,
often stumbling and slipping about, but always
holding himself erect. His head was a little
too large for the thin neck, his face pale and
over-shadowed by the prominent forehead that
seemed to force the brows to frown and the
long eyes to droop with the burden of it. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the powerful jaw, the wide, full mouth and the
resolute chin seemed in their turn to revolt
with scorn against this oppression, yet not be
able to throw it off.</p>

<p>But now he halted before the mirror and
his whole face lighted up, the eyelids opened
to the full and the pupils of his clear brown
eyes shone like diamonds.</p>

<p>Actually, in the depths of her maternal
heart, his mother delighted to see him so
handsome and strong, and then the sound of
his furtive steps moving about again recalled
her sharply to her anxiety.</p>

<p>He was going out, there could be no more
doubt about that. He opened the door of his
room and stood still again. Perhaps he, too,
was listening to the sounds without, but there
was nothing to be heard save the encircling
wind beating ever against the house.</p>

<p>The mother made an effort to rise from her
chair, to cry out "My son, Paul, child of God,
stay here!" but a power stronger than her
own will kept her down. Her knees trembled
as though trying to rebel against that infernal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
power; her knees trembled, but her feet
refused to move, and it was as though two
compelling hands were holding her down upon
her seat.</p>

<p>Thus Paul could steal noiselessly downstairs,
open the door and go out, and the wind seemed
to engulf him and bear him away in a flash.</p>

<p>Only then was she able to rise and light her
lamp again. But even this was only achieved
with difficulty, because, instead of igniting, the
matches left long violet streaks on the wall
wherever she struck them. But at last the
little brass lamp threw a dim radiance over the
small room, bare and poor as that of a servant,
and she opened the door and stood there,
listening. She was still trembling, yet she
moved stiffly and woodenly, and with her large
head and her short, broad figure clothed in
rusty black she looked as though she had been
hewn with an axe, all of a piece, from the trunk
of an oak.</p>

<p>From her threshold she looked down the
slate stairs descending steeply between white-washed
walls, at the bottom of which the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
shook upon its hinges with the violence of the
wind. And when she saw the two bars which
Paul had unfastened and left leaning against
the wall she was filled with sudden wild anger.</p>

<p>Ah no, she must defeat the devil. Then she
placed her light on the floor at the top of the
stairs, descended and went out, too.</p>

<p>The wind seized hold of her roughly, blowing
out her skirts and the handkerchief over her
head, as though it were trying to force her back
into the house. But she knotted the handkerchief
tightly under her chin and pressed
forward with bent head, as though butting
aside all obstacles in her path. She felt her
way past the front of the presbytery, along the
wall of the kitchen garden and past the front
of the church, but at the corner of the church
she paused. Paul had turned there, and swiftly,
like some great black bird, his cloak flapping
round him, he had almost flown across the
field that extended in front of an old house
built close against the ridge of land that shut
in the horizon above the village.</p>

<p>The uncertain light, now blue, now yellow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
as the moon's face shone clear or was traversed
by big clouds, illumined the long grass of the
field, the little raised piazza in front of the
church and presbytery, and the two lines of
cottages on either side of the steep road,
which wound on and downwards till it lost
itself amidst the trees in the valley. And in
the centre of the valley, like another grey and
winding road, was the river that flowed on and
in its turn lost itself amidst the rivers and
roads of the fantastic landscape that the wind-driven
clouds alternately revealed and concealed
on that distant horizon that lay beyond the
valley's edge.</p>

<p>In the village itself not a light was to be
seen, nor even a thread of smoke. They were
all asleep by now in the poverty-stricken
cottages, which clung to the grassy hill-side like
two rows of sheep, whilst the church with its
slender tower, itself protected by the ridge of
land behind it, might well represent the
shepherd leaning upon his staff.</p>

<p>The elder-trees which grew along the parapet
of the piazza before the church were bending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and tossing furiously in the wind, black and
shapeless monsters in the gloom, and in answer
to their rustling cry came the lament of the
poplars and reeds in the valley. And in all this
dolour of the night, the moaning wind and the
moon drowning midst the angry clouds, was
merged the sorrow of the mother seeking for
her son.</p>

<p>Until that moment she had tried to deceive
herself with the hope that she would see him
going before her down into the village to visit
some sick parishioner, but instead, she beheld
him running as though spurred on by the devil
towards the old house under the ridge.</p>

<p>And in that old house under the ridge there
was no one save a woman, young, healthy
and alone....</p>

<p>Instead of approaching the principal entrance
like an ordinary visitor, he went straight to the
little door in the orchard wall, and immediately
it opened and closed again behind him like a
black mouth that had swallowed him up.</p>

<p>Then she too ran across the meadow, treading
in the path his feet had made in the long grass;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
straight to the little door she ran, and she put
her open hands against it, pushing with all her
strength. But the little door remained closed,
it even seemed to repulse her by an active power
of its own, and the woman felt she must strike
it and cry aloud. She looked at the wall and
touched it as though to test its solidity, and
at last in despair she bent her head and listened
intently. But nothing could be heard save
the creaking and rustling of the trees inside
the orchard, friends and accomplices of their
mistress, trying to cover with their own noises
all other sounds there within.</p>

<p>But the mother would not be beaten, she
must hear and know&mdash;or rather, since in her
inmost soul she already knew the truth, she
wanted some excuse for still deceiving herself.</p>

<p>Careless now whether she were seen or not,
she walked the whole length of the orchard
wall, past the front of the house, and beyond
it as far as the big gate of the courtyard; and
as she went she touched the stones as though
seeking one that would give way and leave a
hole whereby she might enter in. But everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was solid, compact, fast shut&mdash;the big
entrance gate, the hall door, the barred
windows, were like the openings in a fortress.</p>

<p>At that moment the moon emerged from
behind the clouds and shone out clear in a lake
of blue, illuminating the reddish frontage of
the house, which was partly over-shadowed by
the deep eaves of the overhanging grass-grown
roof; the inside shutters of the windows were
closed and the panes of glass shone like greenish
mirrors, reflecting the drifting clouds and the
patches of blue sky and the tossing branches
of the trees upon the ridge.</p>

<p>Then she turned back, striking her head
against the iron rings let into the wall for
tethering horses. Again she halted in front of
the chief entrance, and before that big door
with its three granite steps, its Gothic porch
and iron gate, she felt suddenly humiliated,
powerless to succeed, smaller even than when,
as a little girl, she had loitered near with other
poor children of the village, waiting till the
master of the house should come out and fling
them a few pence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>It had happened sometimes in those far-off
days that the door had been left wide open
and had afforded a view into a dark entrance
hall, paved with stone and furnished with stone
seats. The children had shouted at this and
thrust themselves forward even to the threshold,
their voices re-echoing in the interior of the
house as in a cave. Then a servant had appeared
to drive them away.</p>

<p>"What! You here, too, Maria Maddalena!
Aren't you ashamed to go running about with
those boys, a great girl like you?"</p>

<p>And she, the girl, had shrunk back abashed,
but nevertheless she had turned to stare curiously
at the mysterious inside of the house.
And just so did she shrink back now and move
away, wringing her hands in despair and staring
again at the little door which had swallowed
up her Paul like a trap. But as she retraced her
steps and walked homeward again she began to
regret that she had not shouted, that she had
not thrown stones at the door and compelled
those inside to open it and let her try to rescue
her son. She repented her weakness, stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
still, irresolute, turned back, then homewards
again, drawn this way and that by her tormenting
anxiety, uncertain what to do: until at last
the instinct of self-preservation, the need of
collecting her thoughts and concentrating her
strength for the decisive battle, drove her home
as a wounded animal takes refuge in its lair.</p>

<p>The instant she got inside the presbytery she
shut the door and sat down heavily on the
bottom stair. From the top of the staircase
came the dim flickering light of the lamp, and
everything within the little house, up to now
as steady and quiet as a nest built in some
crevice of the rocks, seemed to swing from side
to side: the rock was shaken to its foundations
and the nest was falling to the ground.</p>

<p>Outside the wind moaned and whistled more
loudly still; the devil was destroying the
presbytery, the church, the whole world of
Christians.</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, oh Lord!" wailed the mother,
and her voice sounded like the voice of some
other woman speaking.</p>

<p>Then she looked at her own shadow on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
staircase wall and nodded to it. Truly, she
felt that she was not alone, and she began to
talk as though another person were there with
her, listening and replying.</p>

<p>"What can I do to save him?"</p>

<p>"Wait here till he comes in, and then speak
to him plainly and firmly whilst you are still
in time, Maria Maddalena."</p>

<p>"But he would get angry and deny it all.
It would be better to go to the Bishop and beg
him to send us away from this place of perdition.
The Bishop is a man of God and knows the
world. I will kneel at his feet; I can almost
see him now, dressed all in white, sitting in his
red reception room, with his golden cross
shining on his breast and two fingers raised in
benediction. He looks like our Lord Himself! I
shall say to him: Monsignore, you know that
the parish of Aar, besides being the poorest
in the kingdom, lies under a curse. For nearly
a hundred years it was without a priest and
the inhabitants forgot God entirely; then at
last a priest came here, but Monsignore knows
what manner of man he was. Good and holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
till he was fifty years of age: he restored the
presbytery and the church, built a bridge
across the river at his own expense, and went
out shooting and shared the common life of
the shepherds and hunters. Then suddenly
he changed and became as evil as the devil.
He practised sorcery. He began to drink and
grew overbearing and passionate. He used to
smoke a pipe and swear, and he would sit on
the ground playing cards with the worst
ruffians of the place, who liked him and
protected him, however, and for this very
reason the others let him alone. Then, during
his latter years, he shut himself up in the
presbytery all alone without even a servant,
and he never went outside the door except to
say Mass, but he always said it before dawn,
so that nobody ever went. And they say he
used to celebrate when he was drunk. His
parishioners were too frightened to bring any
accusation against him, because it was said
that he was protected by the devil in person.
And then when he fell ill there was not a
woman who would go and nurse him. Neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
woman nor man, of the decent sort, went to
help him through his last days, and yet at
night every window in the presbytery was
lighted up; and the people said that during
those last nights the devil had dug an underground
passage from this house to the river,
through which to carry away the mortal remains
of the priest. And by this passage the spirit of
the priest used to come back in the years that
followed his death and haunt the presbytery, so
that no other priest would ever come to live
here. A priest used to come from another
village every Sunday to say Mass and bury the
dead, but one night the spirit of the dead priest
destroyed the bridge, and after that for ten
years the parish was without a priest, until my
Paul came. And I came with him. We found
the village and its inhabitants grown quite wild
and uncivilized, without faith at all, but
everything revived again after my Paul came,
like the earth at the return of the spring. But
the superstitious were right, disaster will fall
upon the new priest because the spirit of the
old one still reigns in the presbytery. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
say that he is not dead and that he lives in an
underground dwelling communicating with the
river. I myself have never believed in such
tales, nor have I ever heard any noises. For
seven years we have lived here, my Paul and
I, as in a little convent. Until a short time
ago Paul led the life of an innocent child, he
studied and prayed and lived only for the good
of his parishioners. Sometimes he used to play
the flute. He was not merry by nature, but he
was calm and quiet. Seven years of peace and
plenty have we had, like those in the Bible.
My Paul never drank, he did not go out
shooting, he did not smoke and he never looked
at a woman. All the money he could save he
put aside to rebuild the bridge below the
village. He is twenty-eight years old, is my Paul,
and now the curse has fallen upon him. A
woman has caught him in her net. Oh, my
Lord Bishop, send us away from here; save my
Paul, for otherwise he will lose his soul as did
the former priest! And the woman must be
saved, too. After all, she is a woman living
alone and she has her temptations also in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
lonely house, midst the desolation of this little
village where there is nobody fit to bear her
company. My Lord Bishop, your Lordship
knows that woman, you were her guest with
all your following when you came here on
your pastoral visitation. There is room and
stuff to spare, in that house! And the woman
is rich, independent, alone, too much alone!
She has brothers and a sister, but they are all
far away, married and living in other countries.
She remained here alone to look after the
house and the property, and she seldom goes
out. And until a little while ago my Paul did
not even know her. Her father was a strange
sort of man, half gentleman, half peasant, a
hunter and a heretic. He was a friend of the
old priest, and I need say no more. He never
went to church, but during his last illness he
sent for my Paul, and my Paul stayed with him
till he died and gave him a funeral such as had
never been seen in these parts. Every single
person in the village went to it, even the babies
were carried in their mothers' arms. Then
afterwards my Paul went on visiting the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
survivor of that household. And this orphan
girl lives alone with bad servants. Who directs
her, who advises her? Who is there to help
her if we do not?"</p>

<p>Then the other woman asked her:</p>

<p>"Are you certain of this, Maria Maddalena?
Are you really sure that what you think is
true? Can you actually go before the Bishop
and speak thus about your son and that other
person, and prove it? And suppose it should
not be true?"</p>

<p>"Oh Lord, oh Lord!"</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands, and
immediately there rose before her the vision
of her Paul and the woman together in a
ground-floor room in the old house. It was
a very large room looking out into the orchard,
with a domed ceiling, and the floor was of
pounded cement with which small sea-shells and
pebbles had been mixed; on one side was an
immense fireplace, to right and left of which
stood an arm-chair and in front was an antique
sofa. The white-washed walls were adorned
with arms, stags' heads and antlers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
paintings whose blackened canvases hung in
tatters, little of the subjects being distinguishable
in the shadows save here and there a
dusky hand, some vestige of a face, of a woman's
hair, or bunch of fruit.</p>

<p>Paul and the woman were seated in front of
the fire, clasping each other's hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" came the mother's moaning
cry.</p>

<p>And in order to banish that diabolic vision
she evoked another. It was the same room
again, but illumined now by the greenish light
that came through the barred window looking
out over the meadow and the door which
opened direct from the room into the orchard,
and through which she saw the trees and
foliage gleaming, still wet with the autumn
dew. Some fallen leaves were blown softly
about the floor and the chains of the antique
brass lamp that stood upon the mantelshelf
swung to and fro in the draught. Through a
half-open door on the other side she could see
other rooms, all somewhat dark and with closed
windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>She stood there waiting, with a present of
fruit which her Paul had sent to the mistress
of the house. And then the mistress came,
with a quickened step and yet a little shy; she
came from the dark rooms, dressed in black,
her pale face framed between two great knots
of black plaits, and her thin white hands
emerging from the shadows like those in the
pictures on the wall.</p>

<p>And even when she came close and stood in
the full light of the room there was about her
small slender figure something evanescent,
doubtful. Her large dark eyes fell instantly
on the basket of fruit standing on the table,
then turned with a searching look upon the
woman who stood waiting, and a swift smile,
half joy, half contempt, passed over the sad
and sensual curves of her lips.</p>

<p>And in that moment, though she knew not
how or why, the first suspicion stirred in the
mother's heart.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She could not have explained the reason
why, but her memory dwelt on the eagerness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with which the girl had welcomed her, making
her sit down beside her and asking for news of
Paul. She called him Paul as a sister might
have done, but she did not treat her as though
she were their common mother, but rather as
a rival who must be flattered and deceived.
She ordered coffee for her, which was served
on a large silver tray by a barefoot maid whose
face was swathed like an Arab's. She talked
of her two brothers, both influential men living
far away, taking secret delight in picturing
herself between these two, as between columns
supporting the fabric of her solitary life. And
then at last she led the visitor out to see the
orchard, through the door opening straight
from the room.</p>

<p>Big purple figs covered with a silver sheen,
pears, and great bunches of golden grapes hung
amidst the vivid green of the trees and vines.
Why should Paul send a gift of fruit to one
who possessed so much already?</p>

<p>Even now, sitting on the stairs in the dim
light of the flickering lamp, the mother could
see again the look, at once ironical and tender,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
which the girl had turned upon her as she bade
her farewell, and the manner in which she
lowered her heavy eyelids as though she knew
no other way of hiding the feelings her eyes
betrayed too plainly. And those eyes, and
that way of revealing her soul in a sudden flash
of truth and then instantly drawing back into
herself again, was extraordinarily like Paul. So
much so that during the days following, when
because of his manner and his reserve her
suspicions grew and filled her heart with fear,
she did not think with any hatred of the woman
who was leading him into sin, but she thought
only of how she might save her too, as though
it had been the saving of a daughter of her
own.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>Autumn and winter had passed without
anything happening to confirm her
suspicions, but now with the return of the
spring, with the blowing of the March winds,
the devil took up his work again.</p>

<p>Paul went out at night, and he went to the
old house.</p>

<p>"What shall I do, how can I save him?"</p>

<p>But the wind only mocked at her in reply,
shaking the house door with its furious
blasts.</p>

<p>She remembered their first coming to the
village, immediately after Paul had been
appointed parish priest here. For twenty
years she had been in service and had resisted
every temptation, every prompting and instinct
of nature, depriving herself of love, even of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
bread itself, in order that she might bring up
her boy rightly and set him a good example.
Then they came here, and just such a furious
wind as this had beset them on their journey.
It had been springtime then, too, but the
whole valley seemed to have slipped back into
the grip of winter. Leaves were blown hither
and thither, the trees bent before the blast,
leaning one against another, as though gazing
fearfully at the battalions of black clouds
driving rapidly across the sky from all parts
of the horizon, while large hailstones fell and
bruised the tender green.</p>

<p>At the point where the road turns, over-looking
the valley, and then descends towards
the river, there was such a sudden onslaught
of wind that the horses came to a dead stop,
pricking their ears and neighing with fear.
The storm shook their bridles like some bandit
who had seized their heads to stop them that
he might rob the travellers, and even Paul,
although apparently he was enjoying the
adventure, had cried out with vague superstition
in his voice:</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must be the evil spirit of the old priest
trying to prevent us coming here!"</p>

<p>But his words were lost in the shrill whistling
of the wind, and although he smiled a little
ruefully, a one-sided smile that touched but
one corner of his lips, his eyes were sad as they
rested on the village which now came in sight,
like a picture hanging on the green hill-side on
the opposite slope of the valley beyond the
tumbling stream.</p>

<p>The wind dropped a little after they had
crossed the river. The people of the village,
who were as ready to welcome the new priest
as though he were the Messiah, were all
gathered together in the piazza before the
church, and on a sudden impulse a group of
the younger men amongst them had gone
down to meet the travellers on the river bank.
They descended the hill like a flight of young
eagles from the mountains, and the air resounded
with their merry shouts. When they
reached their parish priest they gathered round
him and bore him up the hill in triumph,
every now and then firing their guns into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
air as a mark of rejoicing. The whole valley
echoed with their cheering and firing, the
wind itself was pacified and the weather began
to clear up.</p>

<p>Even in this present hour of anguish the
mother's heart swelled with pride when she
recalled that other hour of triumph. Again
she seemed to be living in a dream, to be borne
as though on a cloud by those noisy youths,
while beside her walked her Paul, so boyish
still, but with a look half divine upon his face
as those strong men bowed before him with
respect.</p>

<p>Up and up they climbed. Fireworks were
being let off on the highest and barest point of
the ridge, the flames streaming out like red
banners against the background of black clouds
and casting their reflections on the grey village,
the green hill-side and the tamarisks and elder-trees
that bordered the path.</p>

<p>Up and still up they went. Over the parapet
of the piazza leaned another wall of human
bodies and eager faces crowned with men's
caps or framed in women's kerchiefs with long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
fluttering fringes. The children's eyes danced
with delight at the unwonted excitement, and
on the edge of the ridge the figures of the boys
tending the fireworks looked like slender black
demons in the distance.</p>

<p>Through the wide-open door of the church
the flames of the lighted candles could be seen
trembling like narcissi in the wind; the bells
were ringing loudly, and even the clouds in the
pale silvery sky seemed to have gathered round
the tower to watch and wait.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry rang out from the little
crowd: "Here he is! Here he is!... And
he looks like a saint!"</p>

<p>There was nothing of a saint about him,
however, except that air of utter calm: he
did not speak, he did not even acknowledge
the people's greetings, he seemed in no way
moved by that popular demonstration: he
only pressed his lips tightly together and bent
his eyes upon the ground with a slight frown, as
though tired by the burden of that heavy brow.
Then suddenly, when they had reached the
piazza and were surrounded by the welcoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
throng, the mother saw him falter as though
about to fall, a man supported him for an
instant, then immediately he recovered his
balance and turning swiftly into the church
he fell on his knees before the altar and began
to intone the evening prayer.</p>

<p>And the weeping women gave the responses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The poor women wept, but their tears were
the happy tears of love and hope and the
longing for a joy not of this world, and the
mother felt the balm of those tears falling on
her heart even in this hour of her grief. Her
Paul! Her love, her hope, the embodiment
of her desire for unearthly joy! And now the
spirit of evil was drawing him away, and she
sat there at the bottom of the staircase as at
the bottom of a well, and made no effort to
rescue him.</p>

<p>She felt she was suffocating, her heart was
heavy as a stone. She got up in order to breathe
more easily, and mounting the stairs she picked
up the lamp and held it aloft as she looked
round her bare little room, where a wooden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
bedstead and a worm-eaten wardrobe kept
each other company as the only furniture in
the place. It was a room fit only for a servant&mdash;she
had never desired to better her lot, content
to find her only wealth in being the mother
of her Paul.</p>

<p>Then she went into his room with its white
walls and the narrow virginal bed. This
chamber had once been kept as simple and
tidy as that of a girl; he had loved quiet,
silence, order, and always had flowers upon his
little writing-table in front of the window.
But latterly he had not cared about anything:
he had left his drawers and cupboards open
and his books littered about on the chairs
or even on the floor.</p>

<p>The water in which he had washed before
going out exhaled a strong scent of roses: a
coat had been flung off carelessly and lay on
the floor like a prostrate shadow of himself.
That sight and that scent roused the mother
from her preoccupation: she picked up the
coat and thought scornfully that she would be
strong enough even to pick up her son himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Then she tidied the room, clattering to and
fro without troubling now to deaden the sound
of her heavy peasant shoes. She drew up to
the table the leather chair in which he sat to
read, thumping it down on the floor as though
ordering it to remain in its place awaiting
the speedy return of its master. Then she
turned to the little mirror hanging beside
the window....</p>

<p>Mirrors are forbidden in a priest's house, he
must forget that he has a body. On this point,
at least, the old priest had observed the law,
and from the road he could have been seen
shaving himself by the open window, behind
the panes of which he had hung a black cloth
to throw up the reflection. But Paul, on the
contrary, was attracted to the mirror as to a
well from whose depths a face smiled up at
him, luring him down to perish. But it was
the mother's own scornful face and threatening
eyes that the little mirror reflected now, and
with rising anger she put out her hand and
tore it from its nail. Then she flung the
window wide open and let the wind blow in to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
purify the room: the books and papers on
the table seemed to come alive, twisting and
circling into every corner, the fringe of the
bed-cover shook and waved and the flame of
the lamp flickered almost to extinction.</p>

<p>She gathered up the books and papers and
replaced them on the table. Then she noticed
an open Bible, with a coloured picture that
she greatly admired, and she bent down to
examine it more closely. There was Jesus the
Good Shepherd watering His sheep at a spring
in the midst of a forest. Between the trees,
against the background of blue sky, could be
seen a distant city, red in the light of the setting
sun, a holy city, the City of Salvation.</p>

<p>There had been a time when he used to
study far into the night; the stars over the
ridge looked in at his window and the nightingales
sang him their plaintive notes. For the
first year after they came to the village he
often talked of leaving and going back into
the world: then he settled down into a sort
of waking sleep, in the shadow of the ridge and
the murmur of the trees. Thus seven years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
passed, and his mother never suggested they
should move elsewhere, for they were so happy
in the little village that seemed to her the most
beautiful in all the world, because her Paul
was its saviour and its king.</p>

<p>She closed the window and replaced the
mirror, which showed her now her own face
grown white and drawn, her eyes dim with
tears. Again she asked herself if perhaps she
were not mistaken. She turned towards a
crucifix which hung on the wall above a
kneeling-stool, raising the lamp above her head
that she might see it better; and midst the
shadows that her movements threw on the
wall it seemed as though the Christ, thin and
naked, stretched upon the Cross, bowed His
head to hear her prayer. And great tears
coursed down her face and fell upon her dress,
heavy as tears of blood.</p>

<p>"Lord, save us all! Save Thou me, even
me. Thou Who hangest there pale and bloodless,
Thou Whose Face beneath its crown of
thorns is sweet as a wild rose, Thou Who art
above our wretched passions, save us all!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she hurried out of the room and went
downstairs. She passed through the tiny
dining-room, where drowsy flies, startled by
the lamp, buzzed heavily round and the
howling wind and swaying trees outside beat
like rain upon the small, high window and
thence into the kitchen, where she sat down
before the fire, already banked up with cinders
for the night. Even there the wind seemed
to penetrate by every crack and cranny, so
that instead of being in the long low kitchen,
whose uneven ceiling was supported by smoke-blackened
beams and rafters, she felt as if she
were in a rocking boat adrift on a stormy sea.
And although determined to wait up for her
son and begin the battle at once, she still
fought against conviction and tried to persuade
herself that she was mistaken.</p>

<p>She felt it unjust that God should send her
such sorrow, and she went back over her past
life, day by day, trying to find some reason
for her present unhappiness; but all her days
had passed hard and clean as the beads of the
rosary she held in her shaking fingers. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
had done no wrong, unless perchance sometimes
in her thoughts.</p>

<p>She saw herself again as an orphan in the
house of poor relations, in that same village, ill-treated
by every one, toiling barefoot, bearing
heavy burdens on her head, washing clothes
in the river, or carrying corn to the mill. An
elderly man, a relative of hers, was employed
by the miller, and each time she went down
to the mill, if there was nobody to see him,
he followed her into the bushes and tufts of
tamarisk and kissed her by force, pricking her
face with his bristly beard and covering her
with flour. When she told of this, the aunts
with whom she lived would not let her go to
the mill again. Then one day the man, who
ordinarily never came up to the village,
suddenly appeared at the house and said he
wished to marry the girl. The other members
of the family laughed at him, slapped him on
the back and brushed the flour off his coat
with a broom. But he took no notice of their
jests and kept his eyes fixed on the girl. At
last she consented to marry him, but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
continued to live with her relations and went
down each day to the mill to see her husband,
who always gave her a small measure of flour
unknown to his master. Then one day as she
was going home with her apron full of flour
she felt something move beneath it. Startled,
she dropped the corners of her apron and all
the flour was scattered, and she was so giddy
that she had to sit down on the ground. She
thought it was an earthquake, the houses
rocked before her eyes, the path went up and
down and she flung herself prone on the
floury grass. Then she got up and ran home
laughing, yet afraid, for she knew she was
with child.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She was left a widow before her Paul was
old enough to talk, but his bright baby eyes
followed her everywhere, and she had mourned
for her husband as for a good old man who had
been kind to her, but nothing more. She was
soon consoled, however, for a cousin proposed
that they should go together to the town and
there take service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"In that way you will be able to support
your boy, and later on you can send for him
and put him to school."</p>

<p>And so she worked and lived only for him.</p>

<p>She had lacked neither the occasion nor the
inclination to indulge in pleasures, if not in
sin. Master and servants, peasant and townsman,
all had tried to catch her as once the old
kinsman had caught her amongst the tamarisks.
Man is a hunter and woman his prey, but she
had succeeded in evading all pitfalls and keeping
herself pure and good, since she already looked
on herself as the mother of a priest. Then
wherefore now this chastisement, O Lord?</p>

<p>She bowed her weary head and the tears
rolled down her face and fell on the rosary in
her lap.</p>

<p>Gradually she grew drowsy, and confused
memories floated through her mind. She
thought she was in the big warm kitchen of the
Seminary, where she had been servant for
ten years and where she had succeeded in
getting her Paul admitted as student. Black
figures went silently to and fro, and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
passage outside she could hear the smothered
laughter and larking the boys indulged in
when there was nobody to reprove them.
Tired to death, she sat beside a window
opening on to a dark yard, a duster on her
lap, but too weary to move so much as a finger
towards her work. In the dream, too, she
was waiting for Paul, who had slipped out of
the Seminary secretly without telling her where
he was going.</p>

<p>"If they find out they will expel him at
once," she thought, and she waited anxiously
till the house was quite quiet that she might
let him in without being observed.</p>

<p>Suddenly she awoke and found herself back
in the narrow presbytery kitchen, shaken by
the wind like a ship at sea, but the impression
of the dream was so strong that she felt on
her lap for the duster and listened for the
smothered laughter of the boys knocking each
other about in the passage. Then in a moment
reality gripped her again, and she thought
Paul must have come in while she was fast
asleep and thus succeeded in escaping her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
notice. And actually, midst all the creakings
and shaking caused by the wind, she could
hear steps inside the house: some one was
coming downstairs, crossing the ground-floor
rooms, entering the kitchen. She thought she
was still dreaming when a short, stout priest,
with a week's growth of beard upon his chin,
stood before her and looked her in the face
with a smile. The few teeth he had left were
blackened with too much smoking, his light-coloured
eyes pretended to be fierce, but she
could tell that he was really laughing, and
immediately she knew him for the former
priest&mdash;but still she did not feel afraid.</p>

<p>"It is only a dream," she told herself, but
in reality she knew she only said that to give
herself courage and that it was no phantom,
but a fact.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said, moving her stool
aside to make room for him in front of the
fire. He sat down and drew up his cassock a
little, exhibiting a pair of discoloured and
worn blue stockings.</p>

<p>"Since you are sitting here doing nothing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
you might mend my stockings for me, Maria
Maddalena: I have no woman to look after
me," he said simply. And she thought to
herself:</p>

<p>"Can this be the terrible priest? That
shows I am still dreaming."</p>

<p>And then she tried to make him betray
himself:</p>

<p>"If you are dead you have no need of
stockings," she said.</p>

<p>"How do you know I am dead? I am very
much alive, on the contrary, and sitting here.
And before long I am going to drive both you
and your son out of my parish. It was a bad
thing for you, coming here, you had better
have brought him up to follow his father's
trade. But you are an ambitious woman, and
you wanted to come back as mistress where
you had lived as a servant: so now you will
see what you have gained by it!"</p>

<p>"We will go away," she answered humbly
and sadly. "Indeed, I want to go. Man or
ghost, whatever you are, have patience for a
few days and we shall be gone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"And where can you go?" said the old
priest. "Wherever you go it will be the same
thing. Take rather the advice of one who
knows what he is talking about and let your
Paul follow his destiny. Let him know the
woman, otherwise the same thing will befall
him that befell me. When I was young I
would have nothing to do with women, nor
with any other kind of pleasure. I only thought
of winning Paradise, and I failed to perceive
that Paradise is here on earth. When I did
perceive it, it was too late: my arm could no
longer reach up to gather the fruit of the tree
and my knees would not bend that I might
quench my thirst at the spring. So then I
began to drink wine, to smoke a pipe and to
play cards with all the rascals of the place.
You call them rascals, but I call them honest
lads who enjoy life as they find it. It does
one good to be in their company, it diffuses
a little warmth and merriment, like the company
of boys on a holiday. The only difference
is that it is always holiday for them, and
therefore they are even merrier and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
careless than the boys, who cannot forget that
they must soon go back to school."</p>

<p>While he was talking thus the mother
thought to herself:</p>

<p>"He is only saying these things in order to
persuade me to leave my Paul alone and let
him be damned. He has been sent by his
friend and master, the Devil, and I must be
on my guard."</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of herself, she listened to him
readily and found herself almost agreeing with
what he said. She reflected that, in spite of
all her efforts, Paul too might "take a holiday,"
and instinctively her mother's heart instantly
sought excuses for him.</p>

<p>"You may be right," she said with increased
sadness and humility, which now, however,
was partly pretence. "I am only a poor,
ignorant woman and don't understand very
much: but one thing I am sure of, that God
sent us into the world to suffer."</p>

<p>"God sent us into the world to enjoy it.
He sends suffering to punish us for not having
understood how to enjoy, and that is the truth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
you fool of a woman! God created the world
with all its beauty and gave it to man for his
pleasure: so much the worse for him if he
does not understand! But why should I
trouble to explain this to you&mdash;all I mind about
is turning you out of this place, you and your
Paul, and so much the worse for you if you
want to stop!"</p>

<p>"We are going, never fear, we are going
very soon. That I can promise you, for it's
my wish, too."</p>

<p>"You only say that because you are afraid
of me. But you are wrong to be afraid. You
think that it was I who prevented your feet
from walking and your matches from striking:
and perhaps it was I, but that is not to say
that I mean any harm to you or your Paul.
I only want you to go away. And mind, if
you do not keep your word you will be sorry!
Well, you will see me again and I shall remind
you of this conversation. Meanwhile, I will
leave you my stockings to mend."</p>

<p>"Very well, I will mend them."</p>

<p>"Then shut your eyes, for I don't choose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
that you should see my bare legs. Ha, ha!"
he laughed, pulling off one shoe with the toe
of the other and bending down to draw off
his stockings, "no woman has ever seen my
bare flesh, however much they have slandered
me, and you are too old and ugly to be
the first. Here is one stocking, and here is
the other; I shall come and fetch them
soon...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She opened her eyes with a start. She was
alone again, in the kitchen with the wind
howling round it.</p>

<p>"O Lord, what a dream!" she murmured
with a sigh. Nevertheless, she stooped to look
for the stockings, and she thought she heard
the faint footfall of the ghost as it passed out
of the kitchen, vanishing through the closed
door.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>When Paul left the woman's house and
found himself out in the meadow again
he too had the sensation that there was something
alive, something ghostly, undefinable in
the wind. It buffeted him about and chilled
him through and through after his ardent dream
of love, and as it twisted and flattened his coat
against his body he thought with a quiver of the
woman clinging to him in a passionate embrace.</p>

<p>When he turned the corner by the church
the fury of the wind forced him to stop for a
moment, with head bent before the blast, one
hand holding on his hat and the other clutching
his coat together. He had no breath left, and
giddiness overcame him as it had overcome his
young mother that far-off day on the way from
the mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>And with mingled excitement and loathing he
felt that something terrible and great was born
in him at that moment: for the first time he
realized clearly and unmistakably that he loved
Agnes with an earthly love, and that he gloried
in this love.</p>

<p>Until a few hours ago he had been under a
delusion, persuading both himself and her that
his love was purely spiritual. But he had to
admit that it was she who had first let her gaze
linger upon him, that from their earliest meeting
her eyes had sought his with a look that
implored his help and his love. And little by
little he had yielded to the fascination of that
appeal, had been drawn to her by pity, and the
solitude that surrounded her had brought
them together.</p>

<p>And after their eyes had met their hands had
sought and found each other, and that night
they had kissed. And now his blood, which
had flowed quietly so many years, rushed
through his veins like liquid fire and the
weak flesh yielded, at once the vanquished
and the victor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman had proposed that they two
should secretly leave the village and live or
die together. In the intoxication of the
moment he had agreed to the proposal and
they were to meet again the following night
to settle their plans. But now the reality of
the outside world, and that wind that seemed
trying to strip him bare, tore away the veil
of self-deception. Breathless, he stood before
the church door; he was icy cold, and felt as
though he were standing naked there in the
midst of the little village, and that all his poor
parishioners, sleeping the sleep of the weary,
were beholding him thus in their dreams,
naked, and black with sin.</p>

<p>Yet all the time he was thinking how best
to plan his flight with the woman. She had
told him that she possessed much money....
Then suddenly he felt impelled to go back to
her that instant and dissuade her; he actually
walked a few steps beside the wall where his
mother had passed shortly before, then turned
back in despair and fell on his knees in front
of the church door and leaned his head against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
it, crying low, "O God, save me!" and his
black cloak was blown flapping about his
shoulders as he knelt there, like a vulture nailed
alive upon the door.</p>

<p>His whole soul was fighting savagely, with
a violence greater even than that of the wind
on those high hills; it was the supreme struggle
of the blind instinct of the flesh against the
dominion of the spirit.</p>

<p>After a few moments he rose to his feet,
uncertain still which of the two had conquered.
But his mind was clearer and he
recognized the real nature of his motives,
confessing to himself that what swayed him
most, more than the fear and the love of God,
more than the desire for promotion and the
hatred of sin, was his terror of the consequences
of an open scandal.</p>

<p>The realization that he judged himself so
mercilessly encouraged him to hope still for
salvation. But at the bottom of his heart he
knew he was henceforth bound to that woman
as to life itself, that her image would be with
him in his house, that he would walk at her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
side by day and at night sleep entangled in
the inextricable meshes of her long dark hair.
And beneath his sorrow and remorse, deeper
and stronger still, he felt a tumult of joy glow
through his inmost being as a subterranean
fire burns within the earth.</p>

<p>Directly he opened the presbytery door he
perceived the streak of light that issued from
the kitchen and shone across the little dining-room
into the entrance hall. Then he saw
his mother sitting by the dead ashes, as though
watching by a corpse, and with a pang of
grief, a grief that never left him again, he
instantly knew the whole truth.</p>

<p>He followed the streak of light through the
little dining-room, faltered a second at the
kitchen door, and then advanced to the hearth
with hands outstretched as though to save
himself from falling.</p>

<p>"Why have you not gone to bed?" he
asked curtly.</p>

<p>His mother turned to look at him, her dream-haunted
face still deathly pale; yet she was
steady and quiet, almost stern, and while her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
eyes sought those of her son, his tried to evade
her gaze.</p>

<p>"I was waiting up for you, Paul. Where
have you been?"</p>

<p>He knew instinctively that every word that
was not strictly true would be only a useless
farce between them; yet he was forced to
lie to her.</p>

<p>"I have been with a sick person," he replied
quickly.</p>

<p>For an instant his deep voice seemed to
disperse the evil dream; for an instant only,
and the mother's face was transfigured with
joy. Then the shadow fell again on face and
heart.</p>

<p>"Paul," she said gently, lowering her eyes
with a feeling of shame, but with no hesitation
in her speech, "Paul, come nearer to me, I
have something to say to you."</p>

<p>And although he moved no nearer to her,
she went on speaking in a low voice, as though
close to his ear:</p>

<p>"I know where you have been. For many
nights now I have heard you go out, and to-night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I followed you and saw where you went.
Paul, think of what you are doing!"</p>

<p>He did not answer, made no sign that he
had heard. His mother raised her eyes and
beheld him standing tall and straight above
her, pale as death, his shadow cast by the
lamp upon the wall behind him, motionless
as though transfixed upon a cross. And she
longed for him to cry out and reproach her,
to protest his innocence.</p>

<p>But he was remembering his soul's appeal
as he knelt before the church door, and now
God had heard his cry and had sent his own
mother to him to save him. He wanted to
bow before her, to fall at her knee and implore
her to lead him away from the village, then
and there, immediately; and at the same
time he was shaking with rage and humiliation,
humiliation at finding his weakness exposed,
rage at having been watched and followed.
Yet he grieved for the sorrow he was causing
her. Then suddenly he remembered that he
had not only to save himself, but to save
appearances also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother," he said, going close to her and
placing his hand on her head, "I tell you
that I have been with some one who is ill."</p>

<p>"There is nobody ill in that house."</p>

<p>"Not all sick persons are in bed."</p>

<p>"Then in that case you yourself are more
ill than the woman you went to see, and you
must take care of yourself. Paul, I am only
an ignorant woman, but I am your mother,
and I tell you that sin is an illness worse than
any other, because it attacks the soul. Moreover,"
she added, taking his hand and drawing
him down towards her that he might hear
her better, "it is not yourself only that you
have to save, O child of God ... remember
that you must not destroy her soul ... nor
bring her to harm in this life either."</p>

<p>He was bending over her, but at these words
he shot upright again like a steel spring. His
mother had cut him to the quick. Yes, it
was true; during all that hour of perturbation
since he had quitted the woman he had thought
only of himself.</p>

<p>He tried to withdraw his hand from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mother's, so hard and cold, but she grasped
it so imperatively that he felt as though he
had been arrested and were being led bound
to prison. Then his thoughts turned again to
God; it was God who had bound him, therefore
he must submit to be led, but nevertheless
he felt the rebellion and desperation of
the guilty prisoner who sees no way of escape.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone," he said roughly, dragging
his hand away by force, "I am no longer
a boy and know myself what is good or bad
for me!"</p>

<p>Then the mother felt as though she were
turned to stone, for he had practically confessed
his fault.</p>

<p>"No, Paul, you don't see the wrong you
have done. If you did see it you would not
speak like that."</p>

<p>"Then how should I speak?"</p>

<p>"You would not shout like that, but you
would assure me there is nothing wrong between
you and that woman. But that is just what
you don't tell me, because you cannot do so
conscientiously, and therefore it is better you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
should say nothing at all. Don't speak! I
don't ask it of you now, but think well what
you are about, Paul."</p>

<p>Paul made no reply, but moved slowly from
his mother's side and stood in the middle of
the kitchen waiting for her to go on speaking.</p>

<p>"Paul, I have nothing more to say to you,
and I have no wish to say anything more. But
I shall talk with God about you."</p>

<p>Then he sprang back to her side with blazing
eyes as though he were about to strike her.</p>

<p>"Enough!" he cried, "you will be wise
never to speak of this again, neither to me
nor to anyone else; and keep your fancies
to yourself!"</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, stern and resolute,
seized him by the arms and forced him to
look her straight in the eyes; then she let
him go and sat down again, her hands gripping
each other tightly in her lap.</p>

<p>Paul moved towards the door, then turned
and began to walk up and down the kitchen.
The moaning of the wind outside made an
accompaniment to the rustle of his clothes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
which was like the rustle of a woman's dress,
for he wore a cassock made of silk and his
cloak was of the very finest material. And in
that moment of indecision, when he felt
himself caught in a whirlpool of conflicting
emotions, even that silken rustle seemed to
speak and warn him that henceforth his life
would be but a maze of errors and light things
and vileness. Everything spoke to him; the
wind outside, that recalled the long loneliness
of his youth, and inside the house the mournful
figure of his mother, the sound of his own
steps, the sight of his own shadow on the
floor. To and fro he walked, to and fro,
treading on his shadow as he sought to overcome
and stamp down his own self. He
thought with pride that he had no need of
any supernatural aid, such as he had invoked
to save him, and then immediately this pride
filled him with terror.</p>

<p>"Get up and go to bed," he said, coming
back to his mother's side; and then, seeing
that she did not move but sat with head
bowed as though asleep, he bent down to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
look more closely in her face and perceived
that she was weeping silently.</p>

<p>"Mother!"</p>

<p>"No," she said, without moving, "I shall
never mention this thing to you again, neither
to you nor to anyone else. But I shall not
stir from this place except to leave the presbytery
and the village, never to return, unless
you swear to me that you will never set foot
in that house again."</p>

<p>He raised himself from his bending position,
overtaken again by that feeling of giddiness,
and again superstition took hold of him, urging
him to promise whatever his mother asked of
him, since it was God Himself who was speaking
by her mouth. And simultaneously a flood
of bitter words rose to his lips, and he wanted
to cry out upon his mother, to throw the
blame on her and reproach her for having
brought him from his native village and set
his feet upon a way that was not his. But
what would be the use? She would not
even understand. Well, well!... With one
hand he made a gesture as though brushing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
away the shadows from before his eyes, then
suddenly he stretched out this hand over his
mother's head, and in his imagination saw his
opened fingers extend in luminous rays above
her:</p>

<p>"Mother, I swear to you that I will never
enter that house again."</p>

<p>And immediately he left the kitchen, feeling
that here was the end of everything. He
was saved. But as he crossed the adjoining
dining-room he heard his mother weeping
unrestrainedly, as though she were weeping
for the dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Back in his room, the scent of roses and
the sight of the various objects strewn about
which were associated with his passion, impregnated
and coloured by it, as it were, shook
him afresh. He moved here and there without
any reason, opened the window and thrust
his head out into the wind, feeling as helpless
as one of the million leaves whirled about in
space, now in the dark shadow, now in the
bright light of the moon, playthings of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
winds and clouds. At last he drew himself
up and closed the window, saying aloud as
he did so:</p>

<p>"Let us be men!"</p>

<p>He stood erect to his full height, numb as
though all his body were cold and hard and
enclosed in an armour of pride. He desired
no more to feel the sensations of the flesh,
nor the sorrow nor the joy of sacrifice, nor
the sadness of his loneliness; he had no wish
even to kneel before God and receive the word
of approval granted to the willing servant.
He asked nothing from anyone; he wanted
only to go forward in the straight way,
alone and hopeless. Yet he was afraid of
going to bed and putting out the light, and
instead he sat down and began to read St.
Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians: but the
printed words fled his gaze, they swelled and
shrank and danced up and down before his
eyes. Why had his mother wept so bitterly,
after he had sworn an oath to her? What
could she have understood? Ah, yes, she
understood; the mother's heart understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
only too well the mortal anguish of her son,
his renunciation of life itself.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wave of red overspread his face,
and he raised his head, listening to the wind.</p>

<p>"There was no need to have sworn," he
said to himself with a doubtful smile, "the
really strong man never swears. Whoever
takes an oath, as I did, is also ready to break
his oath, even as I am ready."</p>

<p>And instantly he knew that the struggle was
only really beginning, and so great was his
consternation that he rose from his seat and
went to look at himself in the mirror.</p>

<p>"Here thou standest, the man appointed
by God, and if thou wilt not give thyself
wholly to Him, then the spirit of evil will
take possession of thee for ever."</p>

<p>Then he staggered to his narrow bed and,
dressed as he was, flung himself down upon
it and burst into tears. He wept silently that
his mother might not hear him, and that he
might not hear his own crying, but his heart
within him cried aloud and he was wrung
with inward grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"O God, take me, bring me out of this!"</p>

<p>And the uttered words brought him real
relief, as though he had found a plank of
salvation in the midst of that sea of sorrow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The crisis over he began to reflect. Everything
seemed clear to him now, like a landscape
seen from a window in the full light of the
sun. He was a priest, he believed in God,
he had wedded the Church and was vowed
to chastity, he was like a married man and
had no right to betray his wife. Why he had
fallen in love with that woman and still loved
her he did not exactly know. Perhaps he had
reached a sort of physical crisis, when the
youth and strength of his twenty-eight years
awoke suddenly from its prolonged sleep and
yearned towards Agnes because she had the
closest affinity with him, and because she too,
no longer very young, had like him been
deprived of life and love, shut up in her house
as in a convent.</p>

<p>Thus from the very first it had been love
masquerading as friendship. They had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
caught in a net of smiles and glances, and
the very impossibility of there being any
question of love between them drew them
together: nobody entertained the faintest
suspicion of their relationship to each other,
and they met without emotion, without fear
and without desire. Yet little by little desire
crept into that love of theirs, chaste and pure
as a pool of still water beneath a wall that
suddenly crumbles and falls in ruins.</p>

<p>All these things passed through his mind
as he probed deep into his conscience and
found the truth. He knew that from the
first glance he had desired the woman, from
the first glance he had possessed her in his
heart, and all the rest had been only self-deception
whereby he had sought to justify
himself in his own eyes.</p>

<p>Thus it was, and he was forced to acknowledge
the truth. Thus it was, because it is
man's nature to suffer, to love, to find his
mate and have her and to suffer again; to
do good and receive it, to do evil and receive
it, this is the life of man. Yet all his reflections
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
lifted not one iota of the anguish that
weighed upon his heart; and now he comprehended
the true meaning of that anguish:
it was the bitterness of death, for to renounce
love and the possession of Agnes was to renounce
life itself. Then his thoughts went further:
"Was not even this vain and futile? When
the momentary pleasure of love is past, the
spirit resumes mastery over itself, and, with a
more intense longing for solitude than before,
it takes refuge again within its prison-house,
the mortal body that clothes it. Why, therefore,
should he be made unhappy by this
loneliness? Had he not accepted and endured
it for so many years, all the best years of his
life? Even supposing he could really escape
with Agnes and marry her, would he not
always be alone within himself just the same...?"</p>

<p>Yet the mere fact of pronouncing her name,
the bare idea of the possibility of living with
her, made him spring up in a fever of excitement.
In imagination again he saw her
stretched beside him, in imagination he held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
out his arms to draw her close to him, slender
and supple as a reed in the stream; he whispered
sweet words into the little hollow
behind her ear, covered his face with her
loosened hair, warm and scented like the
flowers of the wild saffron. And biting hard
into his pillow, he repeated to her all the
Song of Songs, and when this was ended he
told her he would come back to her the next
day, that he was glad to grieve his mother
and his God, glad that he had sworn an oath
and given himself over to remorse, to superstition
and to fear, for now he could break
loose from everything and return to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a><br /><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>Then he grew calmer and began to reflect
again.</p>

<p>As a sick man is relieved to know at least
the nature of his malady, so Paul would have
been relieved to know at least why all these
things had befallen him, and like his mother,
he went over all the story of his past life.</p>

<p>The moaning of the wind outside mingled
with his earliest memories, faint and indistinct.
He saw himself in a courtyard, where, he did
not know, but perhaps the courtyard of the
house where his mother was a servant, and
he was climbing on the wall with other boys.
The top of the wall was edged with pieces of
glass as sharp as knives, but this did not prevent
the boys from scrambling up to look over,
even though they cut their hands. As a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
matter of fact, there was a certain daring
pleasure in wounding themselves, and they
showed each other their blood and then dried
it beneath their armpits, under the delusion
that nobody would notice their cut hands.
From the top of the wall they could see nothing
except the street, into which they were perfectly
free to go; but they preferred climbing
on to the wall because that was forbidden,
and they amused themselves by throwing
stones at the few people who passed and then
hiding, their sensations divided between delight
in their own boldness and their fear of being
discovered. A deaf and dumb girl, who was
also a cripple, used to sit by the wood pile
at the bottom of the courtyard, and from there
she used to watch them with an expression at
once imploring and severe in her large dark
eyes. The boys were afraid of her, but they
did not dare to molest her; on the contrary,
they lowered their voices as though she could
hear them and sometimes they even invited
her to play with them. Then the crippled
child used to laugh with an almost insane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
delight, but she never moved from her
corner.</p>

<p>In imagination he saw again those dark
eyes, in whose depths the light of sorrow and
desire already shone; he saw them far off at
the bottom of his memory as at the bottom
of that mysterious courtyard, and it seemed
to him that they resembled the eyes of Agnes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then he saw himself again in that same
street where he had thrown stones at the
passers-by, but farther down, at the turning
of a little lane shut in by a group of dilapidated
old houses. His home lay just between the
street and the lane, in the house of well-to-do
people, all women and all fat and serious; they
used to close all doors and windows at dusk
and they received no visitors except other
women and priests, with whom they used to
joke and laugh, but always in a decorous,
guarded manner.</p>

<p>It had been one of these priests who had
caught him by the shoulders one day, and
gripping him firmly between his bony knees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and raising his timid face with a vigorous hand,
had asked him:</p>

<p>"Is it true that you want to be a priest?"</p>

<p>The boy had nodded yes, and having been
given a sacred picture and a friendly slap he
had remained in a corner of the room listening
to the conversation between the priests and
the women. They were discussing the parish
priest of Aar and describing how he went out
hunting and smoked a pipe and let his beard
grow, yet how nevertheless the Bishop hesitated
to interdict him because he would have great
difficulty in finding another priest willing to
bury himself in that remote village. Moreover,
the easygoing priest in possession threatened
to tie up and fling into the river anyone who
ventured to try and oust him from his place.</p>

<p>"The worst of it is that the simpletons of
Aar are attached to the man, although they
are frightened of him and his sorceries. Some
of them actually believe he is the Antichrist,
and the women all declare that they will help
him to truss up his successor and throw him
into the river."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you hear that, Paul? If you become
a priest and have any idea of going back to
your mother's village, you must look out for
a lively time!"</p>

<p>It was a woman who flung this joke at him,
Marielena; she was the one who had charge
of him, and when she drew him towards her
to comb his hair her fat stomach and her soft
breast used to make him think she was made
of cushions. He was very fond of Marielena;
in spite of her corpulent body she had a refined
and pretty face, with cheeks softly tinted with
pink and gentle brown eyes. He used to look
up at her as one looks at the ripe fruit hanging
on the tree, and perhaps she had been his
first love.</p>

<p>Then came his life at the Seminary. His
mother had taken him there one October
morning, when the sky was blue and everything
smelt of new wine. The road mounted
steeply and at the top of the hill was the
archway which connected the Seminary with
the Bishop's house, curved like a vast frame
over the sunny landscape of cottages, trees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and granite steps, with the cathedral tower
at the bottom of the picture. The grass was
springing up between the cobblestones in
front of the Bishop's house, several men rode
past on horseback and the horses had long
legs with hairy fetlocks and were shod with
gleaming iron shoes. He noticed all these
things because he kept his eyes shyly on the
ground, a little ashamed of himself, a little
ashamed of his mother. Yes, why not confess
it once for all? He had always been more
or less ashamed of his mother, because she
was a servant and came from that village of
poor simpletons. Only later, very much later,
had he overcome this ignoble feeling by sheer
force of pride and will, and the more he had
been unreasonably ashamed of his origin, all
the more did he subsequently glory in it to
himself and before God, choosing voluntarily
to live in this miserable hamlet, subjecting
himself to his mother, and respecting her most
trifling wishes and conforming to her humblest
ways.</p>

<p>But the remembrance of his mother as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
servant, aye, even less than a servant, a mere
drudge in the Seminary kitchen, brought back
with it the most humiliating memories of his
youth. And yet she worked as a servant for
his sake. On the days when he went to confession
and communion his Superior obliged
him to go and kiss his mother's hand and ask
her pardon for the faults he had committed.
The hand which she dried hurriedly with a
dishcloth smelt of soapsuds and was chapped
and wrinkled like an old wall, and he was
filled with shame and rage at being forced to
kiss it; but he asked forgiveness of God for
his inability to ask forgiveness of her.</p>

<p>Thus God had revealed Himself to Paul,
as hidden behind his mother in the damp and
smoky kitchen of the Seminary: God Who is
in every place, in heaven and on earth and in
all things created.</p>

<p>And in his hours of exaltation, when he lay
in his little room staring with wide-open eyes
into the darkness, he had dwelt with wonder
on the thought, "I shall be a priest, I shall
be able to consecrate the host and change it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
into God." And at those times he thought
also of his mother, and when he was away
from her and could not see her, he loved her
and realized that his own greatness was all
due to her, for instead of sending him to herd
goats or carry sacks of grain to the mill, as
his father had done, she was making him into
a priest, one who had power to consecrate the
host and change it into God.</p>

<p>It was thus he conceived his mission in life.
He knew nothing of the world; his brightest
and most emotional memories were the ceremonies
of the great religious festivals, and
recalling these memories now, in all the bitterness
of his present anguish, they awoke in him
a sense of light and joy and presented themselves
to his mind's eye as great living pictures.
And the remembered music of the cathedral
organ and the sense of mystery in the ceremonies
of Holy Week became part of his present
sorrow, of that anguish of life and death which
seemed to weigh him down upon his bed as
the burden of man's sin had lain upon Christ
in the sepulchre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>It was during one of these periods of mystical
agitation that for the first time he had come
into intimate relations with a woman. When
he thought of it now it seemed like a dream,
neither good nor evil, but only strange.</p>

<p>Every holiday he went to visit the women
with whom he had lived during his boyhood,
and they welcomed him as though he were
already a priest, with familiar friendliness and
cheerfulness, but always with a certain dignity.
When he looked at Marielena he used to
blush, and then scorned himself for blushing,
because though he still liked her, he now saw
her in all her crude realism, fat, soft and
shapeless; nevertheless her presence and her
gentle eyes still roused little tremors in him.</p>

<p>Marielena and her sisters used often to
invite him to dinner on feast days. On one
occasion, Palm Sunday, he happened to arrive
early, and whilst his hostesses were busy laying
the table and awaiting their other guests, Paul
went out into their little garden and began
to walk up and down the path which ran
beside the outer wall, beneath the aspens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
covered with little golden leaves. The sky
was all a milky blue, the air soft and warm
with the light wind from the eastern hills,
and the cuckoo could already be heard calling
in the distance.</p>

<p>Just as he was standing on tiptoe childishly
to pick a drop of resin off an almond tree, he
suddenly saw a pair of large greenish eyes fixed
upon him from the lane on the other side of
the garden wall. They looked like the eyes
of a cat, and the whole personality of the
woman, who was sitting crouched upon the
steps of a dark doorway at the end of the
lane, had something feline about it. He could
conjure up her image again so clearly that
he even felt as if he still held the drop of soft
resin between his finger and thumb, whilst
his fascinated eyes could not withdraw themselves
from hers! And over the doorway he
remembered a little window surrounded by a
white line with a small cross over it. He had
known that doorway and that window very
well ever since he was a boy, and the cross
placed there as a charm against temptation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
had always amused him, because the woman
who lived in the cottage, Maria Paska, was
a lost woman. He could see her now before
him, with her fringed kerchief showing her
white neck, and her long coral ear-rings, like
two long drops of blood. With her elbows
resting on her knees and her pale, delicate
face supported between her hands, Maria
Paska looked at him steadily, and at last she
smiled at him, but without moving. Her
white even teeth and the somewhat cruel
expression of her eyes only served to accentuate
the feline look about her face. Suddenly,
however, she dropped her hands into her lap,
raised her head and assumed a grave and sad
expression. A big man, with his cap drawn
down to hide his face, was coming cautiously
down the lane and keeping close in the shadow
of the wall.</p>

<p>Then Maria Paska got up quickly and went
into the house, and the big man followed her
and shut the door.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Paul never forgot his terrible agitation as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
he walked about in the little garden and
thought of those two shut up in that squalid
house in the lane. It was a sort of uneasy
sadness, a sense of discomfort that made him
want to be alone and to hide himself like a
sick animal, and during dinner he was unusually
silent amidst the cheerful talk of the other
guests. Directly dinner was over he returned
to the garden: the woman was there, on the
look-out again and in the same position as
before. The sun never reached the damp
corner where her door was, and she looked as
if she were so white and delicate because she
always lived in the shade.</p>

<p>When she saw the seminarist she did not
move, but she smiled at him, and then her
face became grave as on the arrival of the
big man. She called out to Paul, speaking as
one would speak to a young boy:</p>

<p>"I say, will you come and bless my house
on Saturday? Last year the priest who was
going round blessing the houses refused to
come into mine. May he go to hell, he and
all his bag of tricks!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul made no answer, he felt inclined to
throw a stone at the woman, in fact he did
pick one up from the wall, but then put it
back and wiped his hand on his handkerchief.
But all through Holy Week, whilst he was
hearing Mass, or taking part in the sacred
function, or, taper in hand, escorting the
Bishop with all the other seminarists, he always
seemed to see the woman's eyes staring at
him till it became a veritable obsession. He
had wanted to exorcize her, as one possessed
of the Devil, yet at the same time he felt somehow
that the spirit of evil was within himself.
During the ceremony of feet-washing, when
the Bishop stooped before the twelve beggars
(who looked as though they might really have
been the twelve apostles), Paul's heart was
moved by the thought that on the Saturday
before Easter of the previous year the priest
had refused to bless the house of the lost
woman. And yet Christ had pardoned Mary
Magdalene. Perhaps if the priest had blessed
the lost woman's house she might have amended
her ways. This last reflection presently began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to take hold of him to the exclusion of all
other thoughts, but on examining it now at
this distance of time he perceived that here
his instinct had played him false, for at that
period he had not yet learnt to know himself.
And yet perhaps, even if he had known himself,
he would still have gone back on the Saturday
to see the lost woman in the lane.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When he turned the corner he saw that
Maria Paska was not sitting on her doorstep,
but the door was open, a sign that she had
no visitor. Involuntarily he imitated the big
man and went down the lane in the shadow
of the wall, but he wished she had been there
on the look-out and that she had risen up
with a grave, sad face at his approach. When
he reached the end of the lane he saw her
drawing water from a well at the side of the
house, and his heart gave a jump, for she
looked just like the pictures of Mary Magdalene;
and she turned and saw him as she was
drawing up the bucket, and blushed. Never
in his life had he seen a more beautiful woman.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Then he was seized with a desire to run away,
but he was too shy, and as she re-entered the
house carrying the jug of water in her hand
she said something to him which he did not
understand, but he followed her inside and
she shut the door. A little wooden staircase
ending in a trapdoor gave access to the upper
room, the one with the window over which
hung a cross as a protection against temptation,
and she led him up, snatching his cap from
his head and tossing it aside with a laugh.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Paul went to see her again several times,
but after he had been ordained and had taken
the vow of chastity he had kept away from
all women. His senses seemed to have grown
petrified within the frozen armour of his vow,
and when he heard scandalous tales of other
priests he felt a pride in his own purity, and
only thought of his adventure with the woman
in the lane as an illness from which he had
completely recovered.</p>

<p>During the first years passed in the little
village he thought of himself as having already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
lived his life, as having known all it could
offer, misery, humiliation, love, pleasure, sin
and expiation; as having withdrawn from the
world like some old hermit and waiting only
for the Kingdom of God. And now suddenly
he beheld the earthly life again in a woman's
eyes, and at first he had been so deceived as
to mistake it for the life eternal.</p>

<p>To love and be loved, is not this the Kingdom
of God upon earth? And his heart swelled
within him at the remembrance. O Lord,
are we so blind? Where shall we find the
light? Paul knew himself to be ignorant:
his knowledge was made up of fragments of
books of which he only imperfectly understood
the meaning, but above all the Bible had
impressed him with its romanticism and its
realistic pictures of past ages. Wherefore he
could place no reliance even on himself nor
on his own inward searchings: he realized
that he had no self-knowledge, that he was
not master of himself and that he deceived
himself ever and always.</p>

<p>His feet had been set upon the wrong road.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
He was a man of strong natural instincts, like
his forbears, the millers and shepherds, and
he suffered because he was not allowed to
obey his instincts. Here he got back to his
first simple and correct diagnosis of what
ailed him: he was unhappy because he was
a man and was forbidden to lead man's natural
life of love and joy and the fulfilment of life's
natural ends. Then he reflected that pleasure
enjoyed leaves only horror and anguish behind
it; therefore it could not be the flesh that
cried out for its chance of life, but rather the
soul imprisoned within the flesh that longed
to escape from its prison. In those supreme
moments of love it had been the soul which
had soared upward in a rapid flight, only to
fall back more swiftly into its cage; but that
instant of freedom had sufficed to show it the
place to which it would take its flight when
its prison days were ended and the wall of
flesh for ever overthrown, a place of infinite
joy, the Infinite itself.</p>

<p>He smiled at last, saddened and weary.
Where had he read all these things? Certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
he must have read them somewhere,
for he had no pretensions to evolve new ideas
himself. But it was of no consequence, the
truth is always the same, alike for all men,
as all men's hearts are alike. He had thought
himself different from other men, a voluntary
exile and worthy of being near to God, and
perhaps God was punishing him in this way,
by sending him back among men, into the
community of passion and of pain.</p>

<p>He must rise up and pursue his appointed
way.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>He became aware that some one was
knocking at the door.</p>

<p>Paul started as though suddenly awakened
from sleep and sprang up from his bed with
the confused sensation of one who has to
depart on a journey and is afraid of being too
late. But directly he tried to stand up he
was forced to sit down weakly on his bed
again, for his limbs gave way under him and
he felt as if he had been beaten all over whilst
he lay asleep. Crouched together with his
head sunk on his breast, he could only nod
faintly in response to the knock. His mother
had not forgotten to call him early, as he had
requested her on the previous day: his mother
was following her own straight path, she
remembered nothing of what had happened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
during the night and called him as though
this were just like any other morning.</p>

<p>Yes, it was like any other morning. Paul
got up again and began to dress, and gradually
he pulled himself together and stood stiff and
erect in the garments of his order. He flung
open the window, and his eyes were dazzled
by the vivid light of the silvery sky; the thickets
on the hill-side, alive with the song of birds,
quivered and sparkled in the morning sun,
the wind had dropped and the sound of the
church bell vibrated through the pure air.</p>

<p>The bell called him, he lost sight of all
external things, although he sought to escape
from the things within him: the scent of his
room caused him physical distress and the
memories it evoked stung him to the quick.
The bell went on calling him, but he could
not make up his mind to leave his room and
he wandered round it almost in a fury. He
looked in the mirror and then turned away,
but it was useless for him to avoid it; the
image of the woman was reflected in his mind
as in a mirror, he might break it in a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
fragments, but each fragment would still retain
that image entire and complete.</p>

<p>The second bell for Mass was ringing insistently,
inviting him to come: he moved about
here and there, searching for something he
could not find, and finally sat down at his
table and began to write. He began by copying
out the verses which said, "Enter ye in
by the narrow gate," etc.; then he crossed
them out and on the other side of the paper
he wrote:</p>

<p>"Please do not expect me again. We have
mutually entangled each other in a net of
deception and we must cut ourselves loose
without delay, if we want to free ourselves
and not sink to the bottom. I am coming
to you no more; forget me, do not write to
me, and do not try to see me again."</p>

<p>Then he went downstairs and called his
mother, and held out the letter towards her
without looking at her.</p>

<p>"Take this to her at once," he said hoarsely,
"try and give it into her own hands and then
come away immediately."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt the letter taken out of his hand and
hurried outside, for the moment uplifted and
relieved.</p>

<p>Now the bell was ringing the third time,
pealing out over the quiet village and the
valleys grey in the silvery light of the dawn.
Up the hilly road, as though ascending from
the depths of the valley, came figures of old
men with gnarled sticks hanging from their
wrists by leather straps, and women whose
heads wrapped in voluminous kerchiefs looked
too large for their small bodies. When they
had all entered the church and the old men
had taken their places in front close by the
altar rails, the place was filled with the odour
of earth and field, and Antiochus, the youthful
sacristan, swung his censer energetically, sending
out the smoke in the direction of the old
men to drive away the smell. Gradually a
dense cloud of incense screened the altar from
the rest of the little church, and the brown-faced
sacristan in his white surplice and the
pale-faced priest in his vestments of red brocade
moved about as in a pearly mist. Both Paul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and the boy loved the smoke and the scent
of the incense and used it lavishly. Turning
towards the nave, the priest half closed his
eyes and frowned as though the mist impeded
his sight; apparently he was displeased at
the small number of worshippers and was
waiting for others to arrive. And in fact a
few late comers did enter then, and last of
all his mother, and Paul turned white to the
lips.</p>

<p>So the letter had been delivered and the
sacrifice was accomplished: a deathlike sweat
broke out upon his forehead, and as he raised
his hands in consecration his secret prayer
was that the offering of his own flesh and blood
might be accepted. And he seemed to see
the woman reading his letter and falling to
the ground in a swoon.</p>

<p>When the Mass was ended he knelt down
wearily and recited a Latin prayer in a monotonous
voice. The congregation responded,
and he felt as though he were dreaming and
longed to throw himself down at the foot of
the altar and fall asleep like a shepherd on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
bare rocks. Dimly through the clouds of
incense he saw in her glass-fronted niche the
little Madonna which the people believed to
be miraculous, a figure as dark and delicate
as a cameo in a medallion, and he gazed at it
as though he were seeing it again for the first
time after a long absence. Where had he been
all that time? His thoughts were confused
and he could not recollect.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he rose to his feet and turned
round and began to address the congregation,
a thing he only did very occasionally. He
spoke in dialect and in a harsh voice, as though
he were scolding the old men, now thrusting
their bearded faces between the pillars of the
altar rails in order to hear better, and the
women crouching on the ground, divided
between curiosity and fear. The sacristan,
holding the Mass-book in his arms, glanced at
Paul out of his long dark eyes, then turned
them on the people and shook his head,
threatening them in jest if they did not
attend.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the priest, "the number of you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
who come here grows ever less; when I have
to face you I am almost ashamed, for I feel
like a shepherd who has lost his sheep. Only
on Sunday is the church a little fuller, but I
fear you come because of your scruples and
not because of your belief, from habit rather
than from need, as you change your clothes
or take your rest. Up now, it is time to
awake! I do not expect mothers of families,
or men who have to be at work before the
dawn, to come here every morning, but young
women and old men and children, such as I
shall see now when I leave the church, standing
at their own doors to greet the rising sun, all
those should come here to begin the day with
God, to praise Him in His own house and to
gain strength for the path they have to tread.
If you did this the poverty that afflicts you
would disappear, and evil habits and temptation
would no longer assail you. It is time to
awake early in the morning, to wash yourselves
and to change your clothing every day
and not only on Sundays! So I shall expect
you all, beginning from to-morrow, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
will pray together that God will not forsake
us and our little village, as He will not forsake
the smallest nest, and for those who are sick
and cannot come here we will pray that they
may recover and be able to march forward
too."</p>

<p>He turned round swiftly and the sacristan
did the same, and for a few minutes there
reigned in the little church a silence so intense
that the stone-breaker could be heard at his
work behind the ridge. Then a woman got
up and approached the priest's mother, placing
a hand on her shoulder as she bent down and
whispered:</p>

<p>"Your son must come at once to hear the
confession of King Nicodemus, who is seriously
ill."</p>

<p>Roused from her own sad thoughts, the
mother raised her eyes to the speaker. She
remembered that King Nicodemus was a
fantastic old hunter who lived in a hut high
up in the mountains, and she asked if Paul
would have to climb up there to hear the
confession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," whispered the woman, "his relations
have brought him down to the
village."</p>

<p>So the mother went to tell Paul, who was
in the little sacristy, disrobing with the help
of Antiochus.</p>

<p>"You will come home first and drink your
coffee, won't you?" she asked.</p>

<p>He avoided looking at her and did not even
answer, but pretended to be in a great hurry
to go to the old man who was ill. The thoughts
of both mother and son dwelt upon the same
thing, the letter which had been delivered to
Agnes, but neither spoke of it. Then he
hastened away, and she stood there like a
block of wood whilst the sacristan busied himself
in replacing the vestments in the black
cupboard.</p>

<p>"It would have been better if I had not
told him about Nicodemus until he had been
home and had his coffee," she said.</p>

<p>"A priest must get accustomed to everything,"
replied Antiochus gravely, poking his
head round the cupboard door, and then he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
added as though to himself as he turned back
to his work inside:</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is angry with me, because he
says I am inattentive: but it's not true, I
assure you it's not true! Only when I looked
at those old men I felt inclined to laugh, for
they did not understand a word of the sermon.
They sat there with their mouths open, but
they understood nothing. I bet you that old
Marco Panizza really thinks he ought to wash
his face every day, he who never washes at all
except at Easter and Christmas! And you'll
see that from now on they will all come to
church every day, because he told them that
poverty would disappear if they did that."</p>

<p>The mother still stood there, her hands
clasped beneath her apron.</p>

<p>"The poverty of the soul," she said, to
show that she at least had understood. But
Antiochus only looked at her as he had looked
at the old men, with a strong desire to laugh.
Because he was quite sure that nobody could
understand these matters as he understood
them, he who already knew the four gospels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
by heart and intended to be a priest himself,
which fact did not prevent him from
being as mischievous and inquisitive as other
boys.</p>

<p>As soon as he had finished putting everything
in order and the priest's mother had gone
away, Antiochus locked the sacristy and walked
across the little garden attached to the church,
all overgrown with rosemary and as deserted
as a cemetery. But instead of going home to
where his mother kept a tavern in one corner
of the village square, he ran off to the presbytery
to hear the latest news of King Nicodemus,
and also for another reason.</p>

<p>"Your son scolded me for not paying attention,"
he repeated uneasily, whilst the priest's
mother was busy preparing her Paul's breakfast.
"Perhaps he won't have me as sacristan
any longer, perhaps he will take Ilario Panizza.
But Ilario cannot read, whereas I have even
learnt to read Latin. Besides, Ilario is so
dirty. What do you think? Will he send
me away?"</p>

<p>"He wants you to pay attention, that is all:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
it is not right to laugh in church," she answered
sternly and gravely.</p>

<p>"He is very angry. Perhaps he did not
sleep last night, on account of the wind. Did
you hear what an awful wind?"</p>

<p>The woman made no reply; she went into
the dining-room and placed on the table
enough bread and biscuits to satisfy the twelve
apostles. Probably Paul would not touch a
thing, but the mere act of moving about and
making preparations for him, as though he
were sure to come in as merry and hungry as
a mountain shepherd, did something to assuage
her trouble and perhaps quiet her conscience,
which every moment stung her more and more
sharply, and the boy's very remark, that "perhaps
he was angry because he did not sleep
last night," only increased her uneasiness.
Her heavy footsteps echoed through the silent
rooms as she went to and fro: she felt instinctively
that although apparently <em>all was over</em>,
in reality it was all only just beginning. She
had well understood the words he spoke from
the altar, that one must awake early and wash
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
oneself and march forward, and she went to
and fro, up and down, trying to imagine that
she was marching forward in very truth. She
went upstairs to put his room in order; but
the mirror and the perfumes still vexed and
alarmed her, in spite of the assurance that
everything was now at an end, while a vision
of Paul, pale and rigid as a corpse, seemed to
meet her eyes from the depths of that cursed
mirror, to hang with his cassock on the wall
and lie stretched lifeless upon the bed. And
her heart was heavy within her, as though
some inward paralysis prevented her breathing.</p>

<p>The pillow-slip was still damp with Paul's
tears and his fevered anguish of the night, and
as she drew it off to replace it with a fresh one
the thought came to her, for the first time in
her life:</p>

<p>"But why are priests forbidden to marry?"</p>

<p>And she thought of Agnes's wealth, and how
she owned a large house with gardens and
orchards and fields.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she felt horribly guilty in
even entertaining such thoughts, and quickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
drawing on the fresh pillow-slip she went away
into her own room.</p>

<p>Marching forward? Yes, she had been
marching since dawn and was yet only at the
beginning of the way. And however far one
went, one always came back to the same place.
She went downstairs and sat by the fire beside
Antiochus, who had not moved and was determined
to wait there all day, if needs be, for
the sake of seeing his superior and making his
peace with him. He sat very still, one leg
crossed over the other and his hands clasped
round his knee, and presently he remarked, not
without a slight accent of reproach:</p>

<p>"You ought to have taken him his coffee
into the church, as you do when he is delayed
there hearing the women's confessions. As it
is, he will be famished!"</p>

<p>"And how was I to know he would be sent
for in such a hurry? The old man is dying,
it seems," retorted the mother.</p>

<p>"I don't think that can be true. His
grandchildren want him to die because he has
some money to leave. I know the old chap!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
I saw him once when I went up into the
mountains with my father: he was sitting
amongst the rocks in the sun, with a dog and
a tame eagle beside him and all sorts of dead
animals all round. That is not how God
orders us to live!"</p>

<p>"What does He order, then?"</p>

<p>"He orders us to live amongst men, to
cultivate the ground, and not to hide our
money, but to give it to the poor."</p>

<p>The little sacristan spoke with a man's
confidence, and the priest's mother was touched
and smiled. After all, if Antiochus could say
such sensible things it was because he had been
taught by her Paul. It was her Paul who
taught them all to be good, wise and prudent;
and when he really wished to he succeeded
in convincing even old men whose opinions
were already fixed, and even thoughtless
children. She sighed, and bending down to
draw the coffee-pot nearer the glowing embers,
she said:</p>

<p>"You talk like a little saint, Antiochus; but
it remains to be seen if you will do as you say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
when you're a man, whether you really will
give your money to the poor."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall give everything to the poor.
I shall have a great deal of money, because
my mother makes a lot with her tavern, and
my father is a forest keeper and earns pretty
well, too. I shall give all I get to the poor:
God tells us to do that, and He Himself will
provide for us. And the Bible says, the ravens
do not sow, neither do they reap, yet they
have their food from God, and the lily of the
valley is clothed more splendidly than the king."</p>

<p>"Yes, Antiochus, when a man is alone he
can do that, but what if he has children?"</p>

<p>"That makes no difference. Besides, I
shall never have children; priests are not
allowed to have any."</p>

<p>She turned to look at him; his profile was
towards her, against the bright background
of the open doorway and the courtyard outside;
it was a profile of pure, firm outline
and dark skin, almost like a head of bronze,
with long lashes shading the eyes with their
large dark pupils. And as she gazed at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
boy she could have wept, but she knew not
why.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure you want to be a
priest?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, if that is God's will."</p>

<p>"Priests are not allowed to marry, and suppose
that some day you wanted to take a
wife?"</p>

<p>"I shall not want a wife, since God has forbidden
it."</p>

<p>"God? But it is the Pope who has forbidden
it," said the mother, somewhat taken
aback at the boy's answer.</p>

<p>"The Pope is God's representative on
earth."</p>

<p>"But in olden times priests had wives and
families, just as the Protestant clergy have
now," she urged.</p>

<p>"That is a different thing," said the boy,
growing warm over the argument; "<em>we</em> ought
not to have them!"</p>

<p>"The priests in olden times...." she
persisted.</p>

<p>But the sacristan was well-informed. "Yes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the priests in olden times," he said, "but then
they themselves held a meeting and decided
against it; and those who had no wives or
families, the younger ones, were the very ones
who opposed marriage the most strongly.
That is as it should be."</p>

<p>"The younger ones!" repeated the mother
as if to herself. "But they know nothing about
it! And then they may repent, they may
even go astray," she added in a low voice, "they
may come to reason and argue like the old
priest."</p>

<p>A tremor seized her and she looked swiftly
round to assure herself that the ghost was not
there, instantly repenting for having thus
evoked it. She did not wish even to think
about it, and least of all in connection with
<em>that matter</em>. Was it not all ended? Moreover,
Antiochus's face wore an expression
of the deepest scorn.</p>

<p>"That man was not a priest, he was the
devil's brother come to earth! God save us
from him! We had best not even think about
him!" and he made the sign of the cross.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Then he continued, with recovered serenity:</p>

<p>"As for repenting! Do you suppose that
<em>he</em>, your son, ever dreams of repenting?"</p>

<p>It hurt her to hear the boy talk like that.
She longed to be able to tell him something of
her trouble, to warn him for the future, yet at
the same time she rejoiced at his words, as
though the conscience of the innocent lad were
speaking to her conscience to commend and
encourage it.</p>

<p>"Does he, does my Paul say it is right for
priests not to marry?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>"If <em>he</em> does not say it is right, who should
say so? Of course he says it is right; hasn't
he said so to you? A fine thing it would be
to see a priest with his wife beside him and a
child in his arms! And when he ought to go
and say Mass he has to nurse the baby because
it's howling! What a joke! Imagine your
son with one child in his arms and another
hanging on to his cassock!"</p>

<p>The mother smiled wanly; but there passed
before her eyes a fleeting vision of lovely
children running about the house, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was a pang at her heart. Antiochus laughed
aloud, his dark eyes and white teeth flashing
in his brown face, but there was something
cruel in his laughter.</p>

<p>"A priest's wife would be a funny thing!
When they went out for a walk together
they would look from behind like two women!
And would she go and confess to him, if they
lived in a place where there was no other
priest?"</p>

<p>"What does a mother do? Who do I
confess to?"</p>

<p>"A mother is different. And who is there
that your son could marry? The granddaughter
of King Nicodemus, perhaps?"</p>

<p>He began to laugh merrily again, for the
granddaughter of King Nicodemus was the
most unfortunate girl in the village, a cripple
and an idiot. But he instantly grew serious
again when the mother, forced to speak by a
will other than her own, said softly:</p>

<p>"For that matter, there is some one,
Agnes."</p>

<p>But Antiochus objected jealously: "She is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
ugly, I don't like her, and he does not like her
either."</p>

<p>Then the mother began to praise Agnes, but
she spoke almost in a whisper as though afraid
of being overheard by anyone except the boy,
while Antiochus, his hands still clasped round
his knee, shook his head energetically, his lower
lip stuck out in disgust like a ripe cherry.</p>

<p>"No, no, I don't like her&mdash;can't you hear
what I say! She is ugly and proud and old.
And besides...."</p>

<p>A step sounded in the little hall and instantly
they both were silent and stood waiting.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>Paul sat down at the table, which was
laid ready for breakfast, and put his hat
on the chair beside him, and while his mother
was pouring out his coffee he asked in a calm
voice:</p>

<p>"Did you take that letter?"</p>

<p>She nodded, pointing towards the kitchen
for fear the boy should hear.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"Antiochus."</p>

<p>"Antiochus!" he called, and with one spring
the boy was before him, cap in hand, standing
to attention like a little soldier.</p>

<p>"Listen, Antiochus, you must go back
to the church and get everything ready for
taking extreme unction to the old man later
on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy was speechless with joy: so <em>he</em> was
no longer angry and was not going to dismiss
him and take another boy in his place!</p>

<p>"Wait a moment, have you had anything
to eat?"</p>

<p>"He would not have anything to eat; he
never will," said the mother.</p>

<p>"Sit down there," ordered Paul, "you must
eat. Mother, give him something."</p>

<p>It was not the first time that Antiochus had
sat at the priest's table, so he obeyed without
shyness, though his heart beat fast. He was
aware somehow that his position had changed,
that the priest was speaking to him in a way
different from usual; he could not explain how
or why, he only felt there was a difference. He
looked up in Paul's face as though he saw him
for the first time, with mingled fear and joy.
Fear and joy and a whole throng of new
emotions, gratitude, hope and pride, filled his
heart as a nest full of warm fledglings ready to
spread their wings and fly away.</p>

<p>"Then at two o'clock you must come for your
lesson. It is time to set to work seriously with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Latin; and I must write for a new grammar,
mine is centuries old."</p>

<p>Antiochus had stopped eating: now he went
very red and offered his services enthusiastically
without inquiring the why or the wherefore.
The priest looked at him with a smile, then
turned his face to the window, through which
the trees could be seen waving against the
clear sky, and his thoughts were evidently far
away. Antiochus felt again as if he had been
dismissed and his spirits fell; he brushed the
crumbs from the tablecloth, folded his napkin
carefully and carried the cups into the kitchen.
He prepared to wash up, too, and would have
done it very well, for he was accustomed
to washing glasses in his mother's wine-shop;
but the priest's mother would not
allow it.</p>

<p>"Go to the church and get ready," she
whispered, pushing him away. He went out
immediately, but before going to the church
he ran round to his mother to warn her to have
the house clean and tidy as the priest was
coming to see her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the priest's mother had gone back
into the dining-room, where Paul was still
idling at the table with a newspaper in front
of him. Usually, when he was at home, he
sat in his own room, but this morning he was
afraid of going up there again. He sat reading
the newspaper, but his thoughts were elsewhere.
He was thinking of the old dying
hunter, who had once confessed to him that
he shunned the company of men because "they
are evil itself," and men in mockery had called
him King, as they had called Christ King of the
Jews. But Paul was not interested in the old
man's confession; his thoughts turned rather
to Antiochus and his father and mother, for he
meant to ask the latter whether they conscientiously
realized what they were doing in
allowing the boy to have his own way and carry
out his unreasoning fancy for becoming a
priest. But even this was really of little
importance: what Paul actually wanted was
to get away from his own thoughts, and
when his mother came into the room he
bowed his head over his paper, for he knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
that she alone could divine what those
thoughts were.</p>

<p>He sat there with bowed head, but he forbade
his lips to frame the question he longed to ask.
The letter had been delivered; what more was
there for him to know? The stone of the
sepulchre had been rolled into its place: but
ah! how it weighed upon him, how alive he felt,
buried alive beneath that great stone!</p>

<p>His mother began to clear the table, putting
each object back in the cupboard that served as
a sideboard. It was so quiet that the birds
could be heard chirping in the bushes and the
regular tap-tap of the stone-breaker by the
roadside. It seemed like the end of the world,
as though the last habitation of living men was
this little white room, with its time-blackened
furniture and its tiled flooring, upon which the
green and gold light from the high window cast
a tremulous reflexion as of water and made the
small place seem like some prison chamber in the
dungeon of a castle.</p>

<p>Paul had drunk his coffee and eaten his
biscuits as usual, and now he was reading the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
news of the great world far away. Outwardly
there was nothing to show that this day
was in any way different from other days, but his
mother would rather he had gone up to his
room as was his custom and shut the door.
And why, since he was sitting there, did he not
ask her more about her errand, and to whom
she had given the letter? She went to the
kitchen door with a cup in her hand, then
carried it back to the table and stood there.</p>

<p>"Paul," she said, "I gave the letter into
her own hand. She was already up and
dressed, and in the garden."</p>

<p>"Very well," he answered, without raising
his eyes from the newspaper.</p>

<p>But she could not leave him, she felt she
must speak; something stronger than her will
impelled her, something stronger even than
the will of her son. She cleared her throat
and fixed her eyes on the little Japanese
landscape painted at the bottom of the cup
she was holding, its colours stained and
darkened with coffee. Then she went on with
her tale:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"She was in the garden, for she gets up
early. I went straight to her and gave her the
letter: nobody saw. She took it and looked
at it; then she looked at me, but still she did
not open it. I said 'There is no answer,' and
turned to go away, but she said, 'Wait.'
Then she opened the letter as if to show me
there was no secret in it, and she turned as
white as the paper itself. Then she said to me,
'Go, and God be with you!'"</p>

<p>"That's enough!" he cried sharply, still
without looking up, but his mother saw the
lashes quiver over his downcast eyes and his
face turn as white as that of Agnes. For a
moment she thought he was about to faint, then
the blood slowly came back into his face and she
breathed again with relief. Such moments as
these were terrible, but they must be met
bravely and overcome. She opened her lips to
say something else, to murmur at least, "See
what you have done, how you have hurt both
yourself and her!" but at that instant he
looked up, jerking his head back as though
to drive the blood of evil passion from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
face, and glaring angrily at his mother, he
said roughly:</p>

<p>"Now that is enough! Do you hear? It's
enough! I absolutely refuse to hear another
word on this matter, otherwise I shall do what
you threatened to do last night: I shall go
away."</p>

<p>Then he got up quickly, but instead of going
to his room he left the house again. His mother
went into the kitchen, the cup still in her
trembling hands; she put it down on the
table and leaned against the corner of the
fireplace, utterly broken down. She knew now
he had gone away for ever; even if he came
back he would no longer be her Paul, but a poor
wretch possessed by his evil passion, one who
looked with threatening eyes at whoever crossed
his path, like some thief lying in wait to commit
a crime.</p>

<p>And Paul, indeed, was like one who has fled
from home in fear. He had rushed out to
avoid going up to his room, for he had an idea
that Agnes might have got in secretly and be
waiting for him there, with her white face and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the letter in her hand. He had escaped from
the house in order to escape from himself, but
he was carried away by his passion more
violently than by the wind on the night before.
He crossed the meadow without any definite
aim, feeling as though he were some inanimate
thing flung bodily against the wall of Agnes's
house and thrown back by the rebound as far as
the square before the church, where the old men
and the boys and the beggars sit on the low
parapet all day long. Scarce knowing how he
had come there, Paul stayed a little while talking
to one or another of them without heeding their
replies, and then descended the steep road that
led from the village down to the valley. But
he saw nothing of the road he trod nor the
landscape before his eyes: his whole world
had turned upside-down and was a mere
chaos of rocks and ruins, upon which he
looked down as boys lie flat on the ground at
the cliff's edge to gaze over into the depths
below.</p>

<p>He turned and climbed up again towards the
church. The village seemed almost deserted;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
here and there a peach tree showed its ripe
fruit over a garden wall and little white clouds
floated across the clear September sky like a
peaceful flock of sheep. In one house a child
was crying, from another came the regular
sound of the weaver at his loom. The rural
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">guardia</i>, half-keeper, half-police, who had
charge of the village also, the only public
functionary in the place, came strolling along
the road with his great dog on a leash. He
wore a mixed costume, the hunter's jacket of
discoloured velvet with the blue, red-striped
trousers of his official uniform, and his dog was
a huge black and red animal with bloodshot
eyes, something between a lion and a wolf,
known and feared by villagers and peasants, by
shepherds and hunters, by thieves and children
alike. The keeper kept his beast beside him
day and night, chiefly for fear of him being
poisoned. The dog growled when he saw the
priest, but at a sign from his master he was
quiet and hung his head.</p>

<p>The keeper stopped in front of the priest and
gave a military salute, then said solemnly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"I went early this morning to see the sick
man. His temperature is forty, his pulse a hundred
and two. In my poor opinion he has inflammation
of the loins, and his granddaughter
wanted me to give him quinine." (The keeper
had charge of the drugs and medicines supplied
for the parish and permitted himself to go round
visiting the sick, which was exceeding his duty,
but gave him importance in his own eyes, as he
imagined he was thus taking the place of the
doctor who only came to the village twice a
week.) "But I said, 'Gently, my girl; in my
humble opinion he does not want quinine, but
another sort of medicine.' The girl began to
cry, but she shed no tears; may I die if I judged
wrongly! She wanted me to rush off immediately
to call the doctor, but I said, 'The
doctor is coming to-morrow, Sunday, but if
you are in such a hurry then send a man yourself
to fetch him! The sick man can well afford
to pay a doctor to see him die, he has spent
no money during his life.' I was quite right,
wasn't I?"</p>

<p>The keeper waited gravely for the priest's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
approval, but Paul was looking at the dog, now
quiet and docile at his master's bidding, and he
was thinking to himself:</p>

<p>"If we could only thus keep our passions on a
leash!" And then he said aloud, but in an
absent-minded way, "Oh yes, he can wait
till the doctor comes to-morrow. But he is
seriously ill, all the same."</p>

<p>"Well then, if he is seriously ill," persisted
the keeper firmly and not without contempt for
the priest's apparent indifference, "a man had
better go for the doctor at once. The old fellow
can pay, he is not a pauper. But his granddaughter
disobeyed my orders and did not give
him the medicine I myself prepared and left
for him."</p>

<p>"He should receive the Communion first of
all," said Paul.</p>

<p>"But you have told me that a sick person may
receive the Communion even if they are not
fasting?"</p>

<p>"Well then," said the priest, losing patience at
last, "the old man did not want the medicine;
he clenched his teeth, and he has them all still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
sound, and struck out as if nothing was the
matter with him."</p>

<p>"And then the granddaughter, in my
humble opinion," continued the keeper indignantly,
"has no right to order me, an official, to
rush off for the doctor as though I were a
servant! It was not a question of an accident
or anything requiring the doctor's official
presence, and I have other things to do. I
must now go down to the river by the ford,
because I have received information that some
benefactor of his neighbours has placed dynamite
in the water to destroy the trout. My
respects!"</p>

<p>He repeated the military salute and departed,
jerking his dog up by the leash.
Suddenly sharing its master's repressed contempt,
the animal stalked off waving its
ferocious tail; it did not growl at the
priest, but merely turned its head to give
him a parting glance of menace out of its
savage eyes.</p>

<p>Having completed his preparations for carrying
extreme unction to the old man, Antiochus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was leaning over the parapet of the piazza under
the shade of the elms, waiting for the priest;
and when he saw him approaching, the boy
darted into the sacristy and waited with the surplice
in his hands. The pair were ready in a
few minutes, Paul in surplice and stole, carrying
the silver amphora of oil, Antiochus robed in red
from head to foot and holding a brocade umbrella
with gold fringe open over Paul's head,
so that he and his silver amphora were in shadow
whilst the boy himself appeared the more brilliant
in the sunshine in contrast to the black and
white figure of the priest. Antiochus's face
wore a look of almost tragic gravity, for he was
much impressed with his own importance and
imagined himself specially deputed to protect
the holy oil. Nevertheless this did not prevent
him from grinning with amusement at the sight
of the old men hurriedly shuffling down from
the parapet as the little procession passed, and
the boys kneeling with their faces to the wall
instead of towards the priest. The youngsters
jumped up immediately, however, and followed
Antiochus, who rang his bell before each door to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
warn the people; dogs barked, the weavers
stopped their looms and the women thrust
their heads out of the windows to see, and the
whole village was in a tremor of mysterious
excitement.</p>

<p>A woman who was coming from the fountain
bearing a jug of water on her head set down her
jug upon the ground and knelt beside it. And
the priest grew pale, for he recognized one of
Agnes's servants, and a nameless dread seized
upon him, so that unconsciously he clasped the
silver amphora tightly between his hands as
though seeking there support.</p>

<p>The attendant crowd of boys grew larger as
they approached the old hunter's dwelling.
This was a two-story cottage built of rough
stone and standing a little back from the road
on the side towards the valley; it had a single
unglazed window and in front a small yard of
bare earth enclosed by a low wall. The door
stood open and the priest knew that the old man
was lying fully dressed on a mat in the lower
room; so he entered at once, reciting the
prayers for the sick, whilst Antiochus closed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
umbrella and rang his bell loudly to drive away
the children as if they were flies. But the room
was empty and the mat unoccupied; perhaps
the old man had at last consented to go to bed
or had been carried there in a dying condition.
The priest pushed open the door of an inner
room, but that too was empty; so, puzzled,
he returned to the door, whence he saw the old
man's granddaughter limping down the road
with a bottle in her hand. She had been to
fetch the medicine.</p>

<p>"Where is your grandfather?" asked Paul,
as the girl crossed herself on entering the house.
She glanced at the empty mat and gave a
scream, and the inquisitive boys immediately
swarmed over the wall and round the door,
engaging in a free fight with Antiochus, who
tried to oppose their entrance, till Paul himself
sternly bade them disperse.</p>

<p>"Where is he? Where is he?" cried the
granddaughter, running from room to room,
whereupon one of the boys, the last to join
the crowd, sauntered up with his hands in
his pockets and inquired casually, "Are you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
looking for the king? He went down
there."</p>

<p>"Down where?"</p>

<p>"Down there," repeated the boy, pointing
with his nose towards the valley.</p>

<p>The girl rushed down the steep path and the
boys after her: the priest signed to Antiochus
to reopen the umbrella and gravely and in
silence the two returned to the church, whilst
the villagers gathered together in wondering
groups and the news of the sick man's flight
spread from mouth to mouth.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>



<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>Paul was back again in his quiet dining-room,
seated at the table and waited on
by his mother. Fortunately there was now
something they dare talk about and the flight
of King Nicodemus was being discussed.
Having hastily deposited the silver amphora and
other things taken out for the rite and doffed
his red cope, Antiochus had run off to collect
news. The first time he came back it was with
a strange report; the old man had disappeared
and his relations were said to have carried him
off in order to get possession of his money.</p>

<p>"They say that his dog and his eagle came
down and carried him off themselves!" corrected
some sceptic jestingly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe in the dog," said one of the
old men, "but the eagle is no joke. I remember
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that when I was a boy, one carried off a
heavy sheep from our yard."</p>

<p>Then Antiochus came back with the further
news that the sick man had been overtaken half-way
up to the mountain plateau, where he
wished to die. The last upflickering of his
fever lent him a fictitious strength and the
dying hunter walked like a somnambulist to the
place where he longed to be, and in order not to
worry him and make him worse, his relatives had
accompanied him and seen him safely to his
own hut.</p>

<p>"Now sit down and eat," said the priest to
the boy.</p>

<p>Antiochus obeyed and took his place at the
table, but not without first glancing inquiringly
at the priest's mother. She smiled and signed
to him to do as he was bidden and the boy felt
that he had become one of the family. He
could not know, innocent child, that the other
two, having exhausted the subject of the old
hunter, were afraid of being alone together.
The mother would see her son's uneasy wandering
eyes arrested suddenly, as though upon some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
unseen object, with a stony, sombre gaze, o'er-shadowed
by the darkness of his mind, and he
in turn would start from his preoccupation,
aware that she was observing him and divining
his inward grief. But when she had placed the
meal on the table she left the room and did not
return.</p>

<p>With the bright noonday the wind rose again,
but now it was a soft west wind that scarcely
stirred the trees upon the ridge; the room was
flooded with sunshine chequered by the dancing
of the leaves outside the window, and white
clouds drifted across the sky like harp-strings
whereon the wind played its gentle music.</p>

<p>The charm was broken suddenly by a knock
at the door and Antiochus ran to open. A pale
young widow with frightened eyes stood on the
threshold and asked to see the priest. By the
hand she held fast a little girl, with small, livid
face and a red scarf tied over her untidy black
hair; and, as the child dragged and struggled
from side to side in her efforts to free herself,
her eyes blazed like a wild cat's. "She is ill,"
said the widow, "and I want the priest to read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the gospel over her to drive out the evil spirit
that has taken possession of her."</p>

<p>Puzzled and scared, Antiochus stood holding
the door half open: this was not the time to
worry the priest with such matters, and moreover
the girl, who was twisting herself all to one
side and trying to bite her mother's hand as she
could not escape, was truly an object of both
fear and pity.</p>

<p>"She is possessed, you see," said the widow,
turning red with shame. So then Antiochus
let her in immediately and even helped her to
push in the child, who clung to the jamb of the
door and resisted with all her might.</p>

<p>On hearing what was the matter and that
this was already the third day on which the little
victim had behaved so strangely, always trying
to escape, deaf and dumb to all persuasions, the
priest had her brought in to him, and taking her
by the shoulders he examined her eyes and her
mouth.</p>

<p>"Has she been much in the sun?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"It's not that," whispered the mother. "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
think she is possessed by an evil spirit. No,"
she added, sobbing, "my little girl is no longer
alone!"</p>

<p>Paul rose to fetch his Testament from his
room, then stopped and sent Antiochus for it.
The book was placed open on the table, and
with his hand upon the burning head of the
child, clasped tightly in the arms of her kneeling
mother, he read aloud:</p>

<p>"And they arrived at the country of the
Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee. And
when he went forth to land, there met him out
of the city a certain man which had devils a long
time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any
house, but in the tombs. When he saw Jesus
he cried out and fell down before him, and
with a loud voice said, 'What have I to do
with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high?
I beseech thee, torment me not.'"</p>

<p>Antiochus turned over the page of the book
and his eyes strayed to the priest's hand which
rested on the table; at the words, "What have
I to do with thee," he saw the hand tremble,
and looking up quickly he perceived that Paul's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
eyes were full of tears. Then, overcome by an
irresistible emotion, the boy knelt down beside
the widow, but still keeping his arm stretched
out to touch the book. And he thought to
himself:</p>

<p>"Surely <em>he</em> is the best man in all the world,
for he weeps when he reads the word of God!"
And he did not venture to raise his eyes again
to look at Paul, but with his free hand he pulled
the little girl's skirt to keep her quiet, though
not without a secret fear that the demons who
were being exorcised from her body would
enter into his own.</p>

<p>The possessed child had ceased throwing herself
about and stood up straight and stiff, her
thin brown neck stretched to its full length, her
little chin stuck forward over the knot of her
kerchief and her eyes fixed upon the priest's
face. Gradually her expression changed, her
mouth relaxed and opened, and it seemed as if
the words of the Gospel, the murmuring of the
wind and the rustle of the trees on the ridge
were working upon her as a charm. Suddenly
she tore her skirt from Antiochus's restraining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
hand and fell on her knees beside him, and the
priest's hand which had rested upon her head
remained outstretched above it, as his tremulous
voice continued reading:</p>

<p>"Now the man out of whom the devils were
departed besought him that he might be with
him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, Return
to thine own house and show how great things
God hath done unto thee...."</p>

<p>He ceased reading and withdrew his hand.
The child was now perfectly quiet and had
turned her face wonderingly towards the boy,
and in the silence that succeeded the Gospel
words nothing was audible save the trees rustling
in the breeze and the faint tap-tap of the
stone-breaker by the roadside.</p>

<p>Paul was suffering acutely. Not for one
moment had he shared the widow's superstition
that the girl was possessed by a devil and he
felt, therefore, that he had been reading the
Gospel without belief. The only devil which
existed was the one within himself, and this one
would not be driven forth. And yet there had
been a moment when he had felt nearer to God:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
"What have I to do with thee?" And it
seemed to him that those three believers in
front of him, and his own mother kneeling at
the kitchen door, were bowed, not before his
power, but before his utter wretchedness. Yet
when the widow bent low to kiss his feet he
drew back sharply: he thought of his mother,
<em>who knew all</em>, and feared lest she should misjudge
him.</p>

<p>The widow was so overwhelmed with mortification
when she raised her head that the two
children began to laugh, and even Paul's distress
relaxed a little.</p>

<p>"That's all right, get up now," he said,
"the child is quiet."</p>

<p>They all rose to their feet and Antiochus ran
to open the door, at which now somebody else
was knocking. It was the keeper with his dog
on the leash, and Antiochus burst out instantly,
his face beaming with joy:</p>

<p>"A miracle has just happened! He has
driven out the devils from the body of Nina
Masia!"</p>

<p>But the keeper did not believe in miracles;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
he stood a little away from the door and
said:</p>

<p>"Then let us make room for them to escape!"</p>

<p>"They will enter into the body of your dog,"
cried Antiochus.</p>

<p>"They cannot enter because they are there
already," replied the keeper. He spoke in jest,
but maintained his usual gravity. On the
threshold of the room he drew himself up and
saluted the priest without condescending even
to glance at the women.</p>

<p>"Can I speak to you in private, sir?"</p>

<p>The women withdrew into the kitchen and
Antiochus carried the Testament upstairs.
When he came down, although still full of excitement
at the miracle, he stopped to listen to
what the keeper was saying:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for bringing this animal
into the house, but he is quite clean and he will
give no trouble because he understands where
he is." (The dog, in fact, was standing
motionless, with lowered eyes and hanging
tail.) "I've come about the matter of old
Nicodemus Pania, nicknamed King Nicodemus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
He is back in his hut and has expressed the wish
to see you again and to receive extreme unction.
In my humble opinion...."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the priest
impatiently, but the next instant he was filled
with childish joy at the thought of going up to
the mountain plateau and by physical exertion
banishing for a time the perplexities that
tormented him.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he added quickly, "and I shall
want a horse. What is the road like?"</p>

<p>"I will see about the horse and the road,"
said the keeper, "that is my duty."</p>

<p>The priest offered him a drink. On principle
the keeper never accepted anything from
anyone, not even a glass of wine, but on this
occasion he felt that his own civil functions
and the priest's religious functions were so
much each a part of the other that he accepted
the invitation; so he drank, and emptied
the last drops of wine on the ground (since
the earth claims her share of whatever man
consumes), and expressed his thanks with a
military salute. Then the great dog wagged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
his tail and looked up at Paul with an offer of
friendship in his eyes.</p>

<p>Antiochus was ready to open the door again
and then returned to the dining-room to await
orders. He was sorry for his mother, waiting
in vain for the priest in the little room behind
the bar, which had been specially cleaned up for
the occasion and the tray with glasses placed
ready for the guest; but duty before all things
and the visit would obviously be impossible
that day.</p>

<p>"What must I prepare?" he asked, imitating
the keeper's solemn tones. "Shall we take
the umbrella?"</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of! I am going on
horseback and you need not come at all. I
could take you up behind me, however."</p>

<p>"No, I will walk, I am never tired," urged
the boy, and in a few minutes he was ready,
with a little box in his hand and his red cope
folded over his arm. As far as he was concerned,
he would have liked to take the umbrella
too, but he was obliged to obey superior orders.</p>

<p>Whilst he was waiting for the priest in front
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of the church all the ragged urchins who made
of the square their regular playground and
battlefield gathered round him curiously
without venturing too near, and regarded the
box with respect not unmixed with terror.</p>

<p>"Let's go nearer," said one.</p>

<p>"You keep your distance, or I'll let loose the
keeper's dog at you!" shouted Antiochus.</p>

<p>"The keeper's dog? Why, you daren't go
within ten miles of him!" jeered the urchins.</p>

<p>"Daren't I?" said Antiochus with magnificent
scorn.</p>

<p>"No, you daren't! And you think you're
as good as the Lord himself because you're
carrying the holy oil!"</p>

<p>"If I were you," advised one open-minded
youth, "I should make off with that box and
perform all kinds of sorceries with the holy
oil."</p>

<p>"Be off, you horse-fly! The devil that came
out of Nina Masia's body has entered into
yours!"</p>

<p>"What's that? The devil?" cried the
boys in chorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Antiochus solemnly, "this very
afternoon <em>he</em> drove out a devil from the body of
Nina Masia. Here she comes."</p>

<p>The widow, leading the little girl by the
hand, was just coming out of the presbytery;
the boys all rushed to meet her and in one moment
the news of the miracle spread through
the village. Then occurred a scene which
recalled that which had taken place on the first
arrival of the priest. The whole population
assembled together in the square and Nina
Masia was placed by her mother on the top step
before the church door, where she sat, thin and
brown-skinned, with her green eyes and the red
kerchief over her head, looking like some
primitive idol set up to be worshipped by those
simple and credulous country folk.</p>

<p>The women began to weep and all wanted to
touch the girl. Meanwhile the keeper had
arrived on the scene with his dog, and then the
priest crossed the square on horseback. The
crowd immediately collected round him and
made a procession to follow him, but whilst he
waved his hand to them and turned from side to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
side acknowledging their greetings, his annoyance
at what had happened was even greater
than his distress. When he reached the top of
the hill he reined in his horse and seemed about
to speak, then suddenly put spurs to the animal
and rode rapidly down the road. He had a
desperate craving to gallop furiously away, to
escape through the valley and lose himself and
his whole being somewhere in that wide horizon
spread out before his gaze.</p>

<p>The wind was freshening: the afternoon
sun shone warmly on the thickets and bushes,
the river reflected the blue sky and the spray
thrown up by the mill-wheel sparkled like
diamonds. The keeper with his dog and
Antiochus with his box descended the hill
soberly, fully conscious of their office, and
presently Paul drew rein and rode along
quietly. After crossing the river the road became
a mere path and wound upwards towards
the plateau, bordered by stones and low walls,
rocks and stunted trees, and the west wind blew
sweet and warm, heavy-laden with perfume, as
though it had gathered all the thyme flowers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and wild roses it had found upon its way and
was now strewing them again upon the earth.</p>

<p>The path wound ever upwards: when they
turned round the side of the hill and lost sight
of the village, the world seemed nothing but
wind and stones, and white vapours that on the
horizon linked earth and sky in one. From
time to time the dog barked, and the echo in
the hills seemed to bring him answers from
other dogs all around.</p>

<p>When they were half-way to their destination
the priest offered to take Antiochus up behind
him on the horse, but the boy refused, and
only very unwillingly yielded up the box.
And only then did he permit himself to open a
conversation with the keeper; a vain attempt,
however, for the keeper never forgot his own
imaginary importance for one moment. Every
now and then he would stop, with a portentous
frown, and drawing the peak of his cap low
over his eyes he would inspect the landscape
on every side, as though the whole world
belonged to him and were threatened with
some imminent peril. Then the dog would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
stop too, rigid on his four paws, snuffing the
wind and quivering from ears to tail. Luckily
all was serene on that windy afternoon, the
only moving things in sight being the agile
goats climbing on distant rocks, black silhouettes
against the blue sky and rosy clouds.</p>

<p>At last they came to a sort of declivity
covered with masses of granite, a regular
waterfall of rocks balanced one upon another
with marvellous precision. Antiochus recognized
the place, as he had once been there
with his father, and whilst the priest kept to
the path, which wound some considerable way
round, and the keeper followed him as in duty
bound, the boy scrambled down from rock to
rock and was the first to reach the hut of the
old hunter.</p>

<p>The hut was a ramshackle erection of logs
and boughs surrounded by a partly natural
enclosure of great boulders, against which the
old man, in order to complete this sort of
prehistoric fortress, had piled other stones in
large numbers. The sun slanted down into
this enclosure as into a well: the view was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
completely shut in on three sides, and only on
the right, between two rocks, a silver streak in
the blue distance, might be discerned the sea.</p>

<p>On hearing steps the old man's grandson
thrust his curly black head out of the hut door.</p>

<p>"They are coming," announced Antiochus.</p>

<p>"Who are coming?"</p>

<p>"The priest and the keeper."</p>

<p>The man sprang out, as agile and hairy as
his own goats, and swore roundly at the keeper
for always interfering in other people's business.</p>

<p>"I'll break all his bones for him!" he
growled threateningly, but when he saw the
dog he drew back, while the old man's dog ran
forward to sniff at and greet the visitor.</p>

<p>Antiochus took charge of the box again and
sat down on a stone facing the opening in the
rocks. All around were an immense number
of wild-boar-skins, striped black and grey, and
of marten skins flecked with gold, spread out
on the rocks to dry. Inside the hut he could
see the form of the old man lying on a heap of
other skins, his dark face, framed in the white
hair and beard, already set in the composure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of approaching death. The priest was bending
down to interrogate him, but the dying man
made no reply, and lay with closed eyes and a
drop of blood trembling on his violet lips.
A little way off, on another stone, sat the
keeper with his dog stretched at his feet and
his eyes also fixed on the interior of the hut.
He was indignant because the dying man was
disobeying the law in not declaring what was
his last will and testament, and as Antiochus
turned his mischievous eyes in that direction
he thought somewhat maliciously that the
keeper would have liked to set his dog on the
stubborn old hunter as on a thief.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>Inside the hut the priest bent still lower,
his hands clasped between his knees, his
face heavy with weariness and displeasure. He
too was silent now: he almost seemed to have
forgotten why he was there and sat listening to
the wind as if it were the distant murmur of the
sea. Suddenly the keeper's dog sprang up
barking, and Antiochus heard the rustle of
wings over his head: he looked up and saw
the old hunter's tame eagle alighting on a rock,
with its great wings outspread and slowly
beating the air like an immense black fan.</p>

<p>Inside the hut Paul was thinking to himself:</p>

<p>"And this is death. This man fled from
other men because he was afraid of committing
murder or some other great crime. And here
he lies now, a stone amongst stones. So shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
I lie in thirty, forty years, after an exile that
has lasted through eternity. And perhaps she
will still be expecting me to-night...."</p>

<p>He started up. Ah, no, he was not dead
as he had thought: life was beating within
him, surging up strong and tenacious like the
eagle amongst the stones.</p>

<p>"I must remain up here all night," he told
himself. "If I can get through this night
without seeing her I shall be saved."</p>

<p>He went outside and sat down beside
Antiochus. The sun was sinking in a crimson
sky, the shadows of the high rocks were
lengthening over the enclosure and the wind-tossed
bushes, and in the same way as he could
not distinguish objects clearly in the uncertain
light without, so Paul could not tell which of
the two desires within him was the strongest.
Presently he said:</p>

<p>"The old man cannot speak now, he is dying.
It is time to administer extreme unction, and
if he dies we must arrange for the body to be
moved. It will be necessary ..." he added
as though to himself, but did not dare to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
complete the sentence, "it will be necessary
to spend the night here."</p>

<p>Antiochus got up and began to make preparations
for the ceremony. He opened the box,
pressing the silver fasteners with enjoyment,
and drew out the white cloth and the amphora
of oil: then he unfolded his red cope and put
it on&mdash;he might have been himself the priest!
When everything was ready they went back
into the hut, where the grandson, on his
knees, was supporting the dying man's head.
Antiochus knelt down on the other side, with
the folds of his cope spread out on the ground.
He laid the white cloth over the stone that
served as a table, and the scarlet of his cope
was reflected in the silver amphora. The
keeper, too, knelt down outside the hut, with
his dog beside him.</p>

<p>Then the priest anointed the old man's
forehead, and the palms of his hands which
had never sought to do violence to anyone,
and his feet which had borne him far from
men as from evil itself.</p>

<p>The setting sun shone direct into the hut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
with a last dazzling splendour, lighting up
Antiochus in his scarlet cope, so that between
the old man and the priest he looked like a
live coal amongst dead cinders.</p>

<p>"I shall have to go back," thought Paul.
"I have no excuse for remaining here."
Presently he went outside the hut and said:
"There is no hope, he is quite unconscious."</p>

<p>"Comatose," said the keeper with precision.</p>

<p>"He cannot live more than a few hours and
arrangements must be made for transporting
the body down to the village," continued
Paul; and he longed to add, "And I must stay
here all night," but he was ashamed of his
untruth.</p>

<p>Moreover he was beginning now to feel the
need of walking and a craving to get back to
the village. As night fell the thought of sin
began subtly to attract him again and drew
him in with the invisible net of darkness. He
felt it and was afraid; but he kept guard over
himself, and he knew his conscience was awake
and ready to uphold him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"If only I could get through this one night
without seeing her I should be saved!" was
his silent cry. If only some one would detain
him by force! If the old man would revive
and hold him fast by the hem of his robe!</p>

<p>He sat down again and cast about for some
excuse for delaying his departure. The sun
had now sunk below the edge of the high
plateau, and the trunks of the oaks stood out
boldly against the red glow of the sky like the
pillars of some gigantic portico, surmounted
by an immense black roof. Not even the
presence of death could mar the peace of that
majestic solitude. Paul was weary and, as in
the morning at the foot of the altar, he would
have liked to lie down upon the stones and
fall asleep.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the keeper had come to a decision
on his own account. He entered the hut and,
kneeling down beside the dying man, whispered
something into his ear. The grandson looked
on with suspicion and contempt, then approached
the priest and said:</p>

<p>"Now that you have done your duty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
depart in peace. I know what has to be done
now."</p>

<p>At that moment the keeper came outside
again.</p>

<p>"He is past speaking," he said, "but he
gave me to understand by a sign that he has
put all his affairs in order. Nicodemus Pania,"
he added, turning towards the grandson, "can
you assure us on your conscience that we may
leave here with quiet minds?"</p>

<p>"Except for the holy sacrament of extreme
unction, you need not have come at all. What
business have you to meddle in my affairs?"
answered the grandson truculently.</p>

<p>"We must carry out the law! And don't
raise your voice like that, Nicodemus Pania!"
retorted the keeper.</p>

<p>"Enough, enough, no shouting," said the
priest, pointing to the hut.</p>

<p>"You are always teaching that there is only
one duty in life, and that is to do one's own
duty," said the keeper sententiously.</p>

<p>Paul sprang to his feet, struck by those
words. Everything he heard now seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
meant specially for him, and he thought God
was making known His will through the mouths
of men. He mounted his horse and said to
the old man's grandson:</p>

<p>"Stay with your grandfather until he is
dead. God is great and we never know what
may happen."</p>

<p>The man accompanied him part of the way,
and when they were out of earshot of the
keeper he said:</p>

<p>"Listen, sir. My grandfather did give his
money into my charge; it's here, inside my
coat. It is not much, but whatever it is, it
belongs to me, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"If your grandfather gave it to you for
yourself alone, then it is yours," replied Paul,
turning round to see if the others were
following.</p>

<p>They were following. Antiochus was leaning
on a stick he had fashioned for himself out of the
branch of a tree, and the keeper, the glazed
peak of his cap and the buttons of his tunic
reflecting the last rays of the evening light,
had halted at the corner of the path and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
giving the military salute in the direction of
the hut. He was saluting death. And from
his rocky perch the eagle answered the salute
with a last flap of his great wings before he
too went to sleep.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The shades of night crept rapidly up from
the valley and soon enveloped the three
wayfarers. When they had crossed the river,
however, and had turned into the path that
led up towards home, their road was lit up
by a distant glare that came from the village
itself. It looked as if the whole place were on
fire; huge flames were leaping on the summit
of the ridge, and the keeper's keen sight
distinguished numerous figures moving about
in the square in front of the church. It was
a Saturday, and nearly all the men would have
returned to their homes for the Sunday rest,
but this did not explain the reason for the
bonfires and the unusual excitement in the
village.</p>

<p>"I know what it is!" called Antiochus
joyfully. "They are waiting for us to come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
back, and they are going to celebrate the
miracle of Nina Masia!"</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Are you quite mad,
Antiochus?" cried the priest, with something
akin to terror as he gazed at the hill-side below
the village, over which the bonfires were casting
their lurid glare.</p>

<p>The keeper made no remark, but in contemptuous
silence he rattled the dog's chain
and the animal barked loudly. Whereupon
hoarse shouts and yells echoed through the
valley, and to the priest in his misery it seemed
as though some mysterious voice were protesting
against the way in which he had imposed
on the simplicity of his parishioners.</p>

<p>"What have I done to them?" he asked
himself. "I have made fools of them just as
I have made a fool of myself. May God save
us all!"</p>

<p>Suggestions for heroic action rushed into
his mind. When he reached the village he
would stop in the midst of his people and
confess his sin; he would tear open his breast
before them all and show them his wretched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
heart, consumed with grief, but burning more
fiercely with the flame of his anguish than the
fires of brushwood upon the ridge.</p>

<p>But here the voice of his conscience
spoke:</p>

<p>"It is their faith that they are celebrating.
They are glorifying God in thee and thou hast
no right to thrust thyself and thy wretchedness
between them and God."</p>

<p>But from deeper still within him another
voice made itself heard:</p>

<p>"It is not that. It is because thou art base
and vile and art afraid of suffering, of burning
in very truth."</p>

<p>And the nearer they came to the village and
the men, the more abased did Paul feel. As
the leaping flames fought with the shadows on
the hill-side so light and darkness seemed to
fight in his conscience, and he did not know
what to do. He remembered his first arrival
in the village years ago, with his mother
following him anxiously as she had followed
the first steps of his infancy.</p>

<p>"And I have fallen in her sight," he groaned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
"She thinks she has raised me up again, but
I am wounded to death."</p>

<p>Then suddenly he bethought him, with a
sense of relief, that this improvised festival
would help him out of his difficulty and avert
the danger he feared.</p>

<p>"I will invite some of them to the presbytery
to spend the evening, and they are sure to stay
late. If I can get through this night I shall
be safe."</p>

<p>The black figures of the men leaning over
the parapet of the square could now be
distinguished, and higher up, behind the church,
the flames of the bonfires were waving in the
air like long red flags. The bells were not
ringing as on that former occasion, but the
melancholy sound of a concertina accompanied
the general uproar.</p>

<p>All at once from the top of the church tower
there shot up a silver star, which instantly
broke into a thousand sparks with an explosion
that echoed through the valley. A shout of
delight went up from the crowd, followed by
another brilliant shower of sparks and the noise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of shots being fired. They were letting off
their guns in sign of rejoicing, as they did on
the nights of the great feasts.</p>

<p>"They have gone mad," said the keeper,
and he ran off at full speed in advance, the dog
barking fiercely as though there were some
revolt to be quelled up there.</p>

<p>Antiochus, on the other hand, felt inclined
to weep. He looked at the priest sitting
straight upright on his horse and thought he
resembled some saint carried in procession.
Nevertheless, his reflections took a practical
turn:</p>

<p>"My mother will do good business to-night
with all these merry folk!"</p>

<p>And he felt so happy that he unfolded the
cope and threw it over his shoulders. Then he
wanted to carry the box again, though he
would not give up his new stick, and thus
he entered the village looking like one of the
Three Kings.</p>

<p>The old hunter's granddaughter called to
the priest from her door and asked for news
of her grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"All is well," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Then grandfather is better, is he?"</p>

<p>"Your grandfather is dead by this time."</p>

<p>She gave a scream, and that was the only
discordant note of the festival.</p>

<p>The boys had already gone down the hill to
meet the priest; they swarmed round his horse
like a cloud of flies, and all went up together
to the church square. The people there were
not so numerous as they had looked from a
distance, and the presence of the keeper with
his dog had infused some sort of order into the
proceedings. The men were ranged round the
parapet underneath the trees and some were
drinking in front of the little wine-shop kept
by the mother of Antiochus: the women,
their sleeping infants in their arms, were sitting
on the church steps, and in the midst of them
sat Nina Masia, as quiet now as a drowsy cat.</p>

<p>In the centre of the square stood the keeper
with his dog, as stiff as a statue.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the priest they all got up
and gathered round him; but the horse,
secretly spurred by its rider, started forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
towards a street on the opposite side from the
church, where was the house of its master.
Whereupon the master, who happened to be
one of the men drinking in front of the wine-shop,
came forward glass in hand and caught
the animal by the bridle.</p>

<p>"Heh, nag, what are you thinking of?
Here I am!"</p>

<p>The horse stopped immediately, nuzzling
towards its master as if it wanted to drink the
wine in his glass. The priest made a movement
to dismount, but the man held him fast by
one leg, while he led horse and rider in front
of the wine-shop, where he stretched out his
glass to a companion who was holding the
bottle.</p>

<p>The whole crowd, men and women, now
formed a circle round the priest. In the
lighted doorway of the wine-shop, smiling at
the scene, stood the tall, gipsy-like figure of
Antiochus's mother, her face almost bronze-coloured
in the reflection of the bonfires. The
babies had wakened up startled and were
struggling in their mothers' arms, the gold and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
coral amulets with which all, even the poorest,
was adorned, gleaming as they moved. And in
the centre of this restless throng, confused
grey figures in the darkness, sat the priest high
upon his horse, in very truth like a shepherd in
the midst of his flock.</p>

<p>A white-bearded old man placed his hand on
Paul's knee and turned towards the people:</p>

<p>"Good folk," he said in a voice shaking with
emotion, "this is truly a man of God!"</p>

<p>"Then drink to a good vintage!" cried
the owner of the horse offering the glass, which
Paul accepted and immediately put to his lips;
but his teeth shook against the edge of the
glass as though the red wine glowing in the
light of the fires were not wine, but blood.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>Paul was seated again at his own table in
the little dining-room, lighted by an oil
lamp. Behind the ridge, which looked a
mountain as seen from the presbytery window,
the full moon was rising in the pale sky.</p>

<p>He had invited several of the villagers to come
in and keep him company, amongst them the
old man with the white beard and the owner
of the horse, and they were still sitting there
drinking and joking, and telling hunting stories.
The old man with the white beard, a hunter
himself, was criticizing King Nicodemus because,
in his opinion, the old recluse did not conduct
his hunting according to the law of God.</p>

<p>"I don't want to speak ill of him in his last
hour," he was saying; "but to tell the truth,
he went out hunting simply as a speculation.
Now last winter he must have made thousands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of lire by marten skins alone. God allows us
to shoot animals, but not to exterminate them!
And he used to snare them, too, and that is
forbidden, because animals feel pain just as we
do, and the hours they lie caught in the snares
must be terrible. Once I myself, with these
very eyes, I saw a snare where a hare had left
her foot. Do you understand what that
means? The hare had been caught in the
snare and had gnawed the flesh away all round
her foot, and had broken her leg off to get free.
And what did Nicodemus do with his money,
after all? He hid it, and now his grandson will
drink it all in a few days."</p>

<p>"Money is made to be spent," said the
owner of the horse, a man much given to boasting;
"I myself, for instance, I have always
spent freely and enjoyed myself, without hurting
anyone. Once at our festival, having
nothing else to do, I stopped a man who sold
silk reels and happened to be passing with a
load of his goods; I bought the whole lot, then
I set them rolling about on the piazza and ran
after them, kicking them here and there and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
everywhere! In one instant the whole crowd
was after me, laughing and yelling, and the
boys and young men, and even some of the
older men began to imitate me. That was a
game that's not forgotten yet! Every time
the old priest saw me he used to shout from
ever so far: 'Hallo, Pasquale Masia, haven't
you any reels to set rolling to-day?'"</p>

<p>All the guests laughed at the tale, only Paul
seemed absent-minded and looked pale and
tired. The old man with the white beard, who
was observing him with reverent affection,
winked at his companions to suggest an immediate
departure. It was time to leave the servant
of God to his holy solitude and well-merited
repose.</p>

<p>The guests rose from their seats all together
and took respectful leave of their host; and
Paul found himself alone, between the flickering
flame of the oil lamp and the calm splendour
of the moon that shone in through the high
window, while the sound of the heavy iron-shod
shoes of his departing guests echoed down the
deserted street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>It was yet early to go to bed, and although
he was utterly worn out and his shoulders
ached with fatigue, as though he had been bearing
a heavy yoke all the day, he had no thought
of going up to his own room. His mother was
still in the kitchen: he could not see her from
where he sat, but he knew that she was watching
as on <em>the previous night</em>.</p>

<p>The previous night! He felt as if he had
been suddenly awakened out of a long sleep, and
the distress of his return home from the house
of Agnes, and his thoughts in the night, the
letter, the Mass, the journey up the mountain,
the villagers' demonstration, had all been only
a dream. His real life was beginning again
now: he had but to take a step, a dozen steps,
to open the door ... and go back to her....
His real life was beginning again.</p>

<p>"But perhaps she is not expecting me any
longer. Perhaps she will never expect me
again!"</p>

<p>Then he felt his knees trembling and terror
took hold of him again, not at the thought of
going back to her, but at the thought that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
might have accepted her fate and be already
beginning to forget him.</p>

<p>Then he realized that in the depths of his
heart the hardest thing to bear since he came
down from the mountain had been this&mdash;not
knowing anything about her, her silence, her
vanishing out of his life.</p>

<p>This was the veritable death, that she should
cease to love him.</p>

<p>He buried his face in his hands and tried to
bring her image before his mind's eye, then he
began to reproach her for those things for which
she might justly have reproached him.</p>

<p>"Agnes, you cannot forget your promises!
How can you forget them? You held my
wrists in your two strong hands and said to me:
'We are bound to each other for ever, in life
and in death.' Is it possible that you can forget?
You said, you know...."</p>

<p>His fingers gripped at his collar, for he was
suffocating with his distress.</p>

<p>"The devil has caught me in his snare," he
thought, and remembered the hare who had
gnawed off her own foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew a deep breath, rose from his chair,
and took up the lamp. He determined to
conquer his will, to gnaw his own flesh also if
thereby he could only free himself. Now he
decided to go up to his room, but as he moved
towards the hall he saw his mother sitting in
her accustomed place in the silent kitchen, and
beside her was Antiochus fast asleep. He went
to the door:</p>

<p>"Why is that boy still here?" he asked.</p>

<p>His mother looked at him hesitatingly: she
would have preferred not to answer, but to have
hidden Antiochus behind her wide skirts in
order that Paul should not wait up any longer,
but go to his room and to bed. Her faith in
him was now completely restored, but she too
thought of the devil and his snares. At this
moment, however, Antiochus woke up and
remembered very well why he was still waiting
there, in spite of the fact that the woman had
several times asked him to go.</p>

<p>"I was waiting here because my mother is
expecting a visit from you," he explained.</p>

<p>"But is this a time of night to go paying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
visits?" protested the priest's mother.
"Come now, be off with you, and tell her that
Paul is tired and will go and see her to-morrow."</p>

<p>She spoke to the boy, but she was looking at
her son: she saw his glassy eyes fixed upon the
lamp, but his eyelids quivered like the wings of
a moth in a candle.</p>

<p>Antiochus got up with an expression of deep
disappointment.</p>

<p>"But my mother is expecting him; she
thinks it's something important."</p>

<p>"If it was anything important he would go
and tell her at once. Come, be off with you!"</p>

<p>She spoke sharply, and as Paul looked at her
his eyes lit up again with quick resentment:
he saw that his mother was afraid lest he should
go out again, and the knowledge filled him with
unreasoning anger. He banged the lamp down
on the table again and called to Antiochus:</p>

<p>"We will go and see your mother."</p>

<p>In the hall, however, he turned and added:</p>

<p>"I shall be back directly, mother; don't
fasten the door."</p>

<p>She had not moved from where she sat, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
when the two had left the house she went to
peep through the half-open door and saw them
cross the moonlit square and enter the wine-shop,
which was still lighted up. Then she
went back to the kitchen and began her vigil
as on the previous night.</p>

<p>She marvelled at herself to find that she was
no longer afraid of the old priest reappearing;
it had all been a dream. At the bottom of her
heart, however, she did not feel at all certain
that the ghost would not come back and
demand his mended socks.</p>

<p>"I have mended them all right," she said
aloud, thinking of those she had mended for
her son. And she felt that even if the ghost
did come back she would be able to hold her
own with him and keep on friendly terms.</p>

<p>Complete silence reigned all round. Outside
the window the trees shone silver in the
bright moonlight, the sky was like a milky sea,
and the perfume of the aromatic shrubs penetrated
even into the house. And the mother
herself was tranquil now, though she hardly
knew why, seeing that Paul might yet fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
again into sin; but she no longer felt the same
terror of it. She saw again in her mind's eye
the lashes trembling on his cheeks, like those of
a child about to cry, and her mother's heart
melted with tenderness and pity.</p>

<p>"And why, oh Lord, why, why?"</p>

<p>She dared not complete her question, but it
remained at the bottom of her heart like a
stone at the bottom of a well. Why, oh Lord,
was Paul forbidden to love a woman? Love
was lawful for all, even for servants and herdsmen,
even for the blind and for convicts in
prison; so why should Paul, her child, be the
only one to whom love was forbidden?</p>

<p>Then again the consciousness of reality
forced itself on her. She remembered the
words of Antiochus, and was ashamed of being
less wise than a boy.</p>

<p>"They themselves, the youngest amongst
the priests, asked permission to live chaste and
free, apart from women."</p>

<p>Moreover, her Paul was a strong man, in no
wise inferior to his ancient predecessors. He
would never give way to tears; his eyelids
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
would close over eyes dry as those of the dead,
for he was a strong man.</p>

<p>"I am growing childish!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>She felt as if she had grown twenty years
older in that one long day of wearing emotions:
each hour that passed had added to the burden
she bore, each minute had struck a blow upon
her soul as the hammer of the stone-breaker
struck upon the heaps of broken rock there
behind the ridge. So many things now seemed
clear to her, different from on the previous day.
The figure of Agnes came before her, with the
proud look that concealed all she really felt.</p>

<p>"She is strong too," thought the mother;
"she will hide everything."</p>

<p>Then slowly she rose from her chair and
began to cover the fire with ashes, banking it
up carefully so that no sparks could fly out and
set fire to anything near: then she shut the
house door, for she knew Paul always carried a
key with him. She stamped about loudly,
as though he could hear her across the square,
and believe her firm footsteps to be an outward
sign of her inward assurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>She felt, however, that this assurance was
not so very firm after all. But then what is
really firm in this life? Neither the base of
the mountains nor the foundations of the
churches, for an earthquake may overthrow
them both. Thus she felt sure of Paul for the
future, and sure of herself, but always with an
underlying dread of the unknown which might
chance to supervene. And when she reached
her bedroom she dropped wearily into a chair,
wondering whether it would not have been
better after all to leave the front door open.</p>

<p>Then she got up and began to untie her apron
string; but it had twisted into a knot over
which she lost patience at last, and went to
fetch a pair of scissors from her work-basket.
She found the kitten curled up asleep inside
the basket, and the scissors and reels were all
warm from contact with its tiny body; and
somehow the touch of the living thing made
her repent of her impatience, and she went
back to the lamp, and drawing the knot in
front of her she succeeded at last in untying it.
With a sigh of relief she slowly undressed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
carefully folding her garments one by one on
the chair, first, however, taking the keys out of
her apron pocket and laying them in a row on
the table like a respectable family all asleep.
Thus her masters had taught her in her youth
to cultivate order and tidiness, and she still
obeyed the old instructions.</p>

<p>She sat down again, half undressed, her short
chemise displaying thin brown legs that might
have been made of wood, and she yawned with
weariness and resignation. No, she would not
go downstairs again; her son should come home
and find the door closed, and see from that
fact that his mother had full confidence in him.
That was the right way to manage him, show
that you trusted him absolutely. Nevertheless,
she was on the alert, and listened for the least
sound; not in the same way as on the previous
night, but still she listened. She drew off her
shoes and placed them side by side, like two sisters
who must keep each other company even during
the night, and went on murmuring her prayers
and yawning, yawning with weariness and resignation,
and with sheer nervousness, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever could Paul have to say to Antiochus's
mother? The woman had by no means
a good reputation, she lent money on usury
and was commonly supposed to be a procuress
too. No, Paul's mother could not understand
it. Then she blew out the candle, snuffed the
smoking wick with her fingers and got into bed,
but could not bring herself to lie down.</p>

<p>Presently she thought she heard a step in
her room. Was it the ghost come back? She
was filled with a horrible fear lest he should
come up to the bed and take hold of her; for
a moment her blood froze in her veins, then
surged to her heart as a people in tumult
rushes through the streets of its city to the
principal square. Then she recovered herself
and was ashamed of her fear, only caused, she
was sure, by the wicked doubts she had entertained
of her Paul.</p>

<p>No, those doubts were all ended: never
again would she inquire into the very smallest
of his actions; it was her place to keep quietly
in the background, as she was now, in her little
room fit only for a servant. She lay down and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
drew the bedclothes over her, covering her
ears, too, so that she might not hear whether
Paul came home or not; but in her inner consciousness
she <em>felt</em> all the same, she felt that
he was not coming home, that he had been
carried off by some one against his will, as one
drawn reluctantly into a dance.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she felt quite sure of him;
sooner or later he would manage to escape and
come home. Anyhow, she was resting quietly
under the bedclothes, though not yet asleep,
and she had a confused impression that she was
still trying to undo the knot in her apron string.
Then the faint buzzing in her ears beneath the
coverlet turned gradually into the murmuring
of the crowd in the square beneath her window,
and farther off still the murmuring of a people
who lamented, and yet whilst lamenting
laughed and danced and sang. Her Paul was
there in the midst of them, and above them all
in some high, far place, a lute was being softly
played. Perhaps it was God Himself playing
to the dance of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>All day long Antiochus's mother had been
speculating as to what could be the
object of the priest's visit, for which her boy
had prepared her, but she took good care not
to betray by her manner that she was expecting
him. Perhaps he intended making a few
remarks on the subject of usury, and certain
other trades which she practised; or because
she was in the habit of lending out&mdash;for purely
medical purposes, but always for a small fee&mdash;certain
very ancient relics which she had
inherited from her husband's family. Or
perhaps he wanted to borrow money, either
for himself or some one else. Whatever it
might prove to be, as soon as the last customer
had departed she went to the door and stood
there with her hands in her pockets, heavy with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
copper coins, looking out to see whether
Antiochus at least were not in sight.</p>

<p>Then immediately she pretended to be
busied with shutting the door, and in fact she
did shut the lower half, bending down to fasten
the bolt. She was active in her movements,
although tall and stout; but, contrary to the
other women of the place, she had a small head,
which only looked large because of the great
mass of black plaits that encircled it.</p>

<p>As the priest approached she drew herself
up and bade him good evening with much
dignity, though her black eyes looked straight
into his with an ardent, languorous gaze. Then
she invited him to take a seat in the room
behind the wine-shop, and Antiochus's wistful
eyes begged her to press the invitation. But
the priest said good-humouredly:</p>

<p>"No, let us stay here," and he sat down at
one of the long, wine-stained tables that
furnished the little tavern, whilst Antiochus,
resigned to the inevitable, stood beside him,
casting anxious glances round, however, to see
if everything was in order and fearful lest any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
belated customer should come in to disturb the
conference.</p>

<p>Nobody came and everything was in order.
The big petroleum lamp threw an immense
shadow of his mother on the wall behind the
little bar, covered with shelves filled with bottles
of red, yellow and green liqueurs, the light falling
crudely on the small black casks ranged along
the opposite side of the shop. There was no
other furniture except the long table at which
sat the priest, and another smaller one, and
over the door hung a bunch of broom which
served the double purpose of informing
passers-by that this was the door of a wine-shop
and of attracting flies away from the glasses.</p>

<p>Antiochus had been waiting for this moment
during the whole of the day, with the feeling
that some mystery would then be revealed.
He was afraid of some intruder coming in, or
that his mother would not behave as she should.
He would have liked her to be more humble,
more docile in the presence of the priest; but
instead of that she had taken her seat again
behind the bar, and sat there as composedly as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
queen on her throne. She did not even appear
to realize that the man seated at the tavern
table like an ordinary customer was a saint who
worked miracles, and she was not even grateful
for the large quantity of wine which he had
been the indirect means of her selling that
day!</p>

<p>At last, however, Paul opened the conversation.</p>

<p>"I should have liked to see your husband as
well," he began, resting his elbows on the table
and placing his finger-tips together, "but
Antiochus tells me that he will not be back
until Sunday week."</p>

<p>The woman merely nodded in assent.</p>

<p>"Yes, on Sunday week, but I can go and fetch
him, if you like," broke in Antiochus, with an
eagerness of which neither of the others took
the least notice.</p>

<p>"It is about the boy," continued Paul.
"The time has come when you must really consider
in earnest what you are going to do with
him. He is growing big now and you must
either teach him a trade or, if you want to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a priest of him, you must think very seriously
of the responsibility you are undertaking."</p>

<p>Antiochus opened his lips, but as his mother
began to speak he listened to her silently,
though with a shade of disapproval on his
anxious young face.</p>

<p>The woman seized the occasion, as she always
did, to sound the praises of her husband, also
to excuse herself for having married a man
much older than herself:</p>

<p>"My Martin, as your Reverence knows, is
the most conscientious man in the world; he is
a good husband and a good father and a better
workman than anyone else. Who is there in
the whole village who works as hard as he does?
Tell me that, your Reverence, you who know
what sort of a character the village has got
through the idleness of its inhabitants! I say,
then, that if Antiochus wants to choose a trade,
he has only to follow his father's; that is the
best trade for him. The boy is free to do as he
likes, and even if he wants to do nothing (I
don't say it for vanity), he will be able to live
without turning thief, thank God! But if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
wants a trade different from his father's, then he
must choose for himself. If he wants to be a
charcoal-burner, let him be a charcoal-burner;
if he wants to be a carpenter, let him be a
carpenter; if he wants to be a labourer, let
him be a labourer."</p>

<p>"I want to be a priest!" said the boy with
quivering lips and eager eyes.</p>

<p>"Very well then, be a priest," replied his
mother.</p>

<p>And thus his fate was decided.</p>

<p>Paul let his hands fall upon the table and
gazed slowly round him. Quite suddenly he
felt it was ridiculous that he should thus interest
himself in other people's business. How could
he possibly solve the problem of the future
for Antiochus when he could not succeed in
solving it for himself? The boy stood before
him in ardent expectation, like a piece of red-hot
iron awaiting the stroke of the hammer to
mould it into shape, and every word had the
power to either make or mar him. Paul's
gaze rested on him with something akin to
envy, and in the depths of his conscience he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
applauded the mother's action in leaving her
son free to follow his own instincts.</p>

<p>"Instinct never leads us wrong," he said
aloud, following his own train of thought.
"But now, Antiochus, tell me in your mother's
presence the reason why you wish to be a
priest. Being a priest is not a trade, you know;
it is not like being a charcoal-burner or a
carpenter. You think now that it is a very easy,
comfortable kind of life, but later on you will
find that it is very difficult. The joys and
pleasures allowed to all other men are forbidden
to us, and if we truly desire to serve the Lord
our life is one continuous sacrifice."</p>

<p>"I know that," replied the boy very simply.
"I desire to serve the Lord."</p>

<p>He looked at his mother then, because he
was a little ashamed of betraying all his enthusiasm
before her, but she sat behind the
bar as calmly and coldly as when she was
merely serving customers. So Antiochus went
on:</p>

<p>"Both my father and mother are willing for
me to become a priest; why should they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
object? I am very careless sometimes, but
that is because I am still only a boy, and in
future I mean to be much more serious and
attentive."</p>

<p>"That is not the question, Antiochus; you
are too serious and attentive already!" said
Paul. "At your age you should be heedless
and merry. Learn and prepare yourself for
life, certainly, but be a boy too."</p>

<p>"And am I not a boy?" protested Antiochus;
"I do play, only you don't happen to
see me just when I am playing! Besides, why
should I play if I don't feel inclined? I have
lots of amusements: I enjoy ringing the church
bells and I feel as if I was a bird up in the tower.
And haven't I had an amusing time to-day? I
enjoyed carrying the box and climbing up ever
so high amongst the rocks, and I got there
before you, although you were riding! I enjoyed
coming home again ... and to-day I
enjoyed ... I was happy," and the boy's eyes
sought the ground as he added, "when you
drove the devils out of the body of Nina
Masia."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"You believed in that?" asked the priest in
a low voice, and immediately he saw the boy's
eyes look upward, so glorious with the light of
faith and wonder that instinctively he lowered
his own to hide the dark shadow that rested on
his soul.</p>

<p>"Only, when we are children we think in one
way and everything looks great and beautiful
to us," continued Paul, much disturbed, "but
when we are grown up things look different.
One must reflect very carefully before undertaking
anything important so that one may not
come to repent afterwards."</p>

<p>"I shall not repent, I'm sure," said the boy
with decision. "Have you repented? No,
and neither shall I repent."</p>

<p>Paul lifted up his eyes: again he felt that he
held in his hands the soul of this child, to mould
it like wax, and that a few careless touches
might deform it for ever. And again he feared
and was silent.</p>

<p>All this time the woman behind the bar had
listened quietly, but now the priest's words
began to cause her a certain uneasiness. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
opened a drawer in front of her, wherein she
kept her money, and the cornelian rings and
the brooches and mother-of-pearl ornaments
pledged by the village women in return for small
loans; and evil thoughts flashed through the
darkest recesses of her mind, like those forlorn
trinkets at the bottom of her drawer.</p>

<p>"The priest is afraid that Antiochus will
turn him out of his parish some time or other,"
she was thinking, "or else he is in need of money
and is working off his bad temper first. Now
he'll be asking for a loan."</p>

<p>She closed the drawer softly and resumed her
tranquil demeanour. She always sat there in
silence and never took part in the discussions
between her customers, even though invited
to give her opinion, especially if they were
playing cards. Thus she left her little Antiochus
to face his adversary by himself.</p>

<p>"How is it possible not to believe?" said
the boy, between awe and excitement. "Nina
Masia was possessed, wasn't she? Why, I myself
felt the devil inside her shaking her like a wolf
in a cage. And it was nothing but the words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the Gospel spoken by you that set her free!"</p>

<p>"That is true, the Word of God can achieve
all things," admitted the priest. Then suddenly
he rose from his seat.</p>

<p>Was he going? Antiochus gazed at him in
consternation.</p>

<p>"Are you going?" he murmured.</p>

<p>Was this the famous visit? He ran to the
bar and made a desperate sign to his mother,
who turned round and took down a bottle from
the shelves. She was disappointed too, for she
had hoped for a chance of lending money to
the parish priest, even at a very low interest,
thereby in some way legitimizing her usury in
the sight of God. But instead of that, he had
simply come to inform Antiochus that being
a priest was not the same thing as being a carpenter!
However, she must do him honour, in
any case.</p>

<p>"But your Reverence is not going away like
that! Accept something to drink, at least;
this wine is very old."</p>

<p>Antiochus was already holding the tray with
a glass goblet upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then only a little," said Paul.</p>

<p>Leaning across the bar, the woman poured
out the wine, careful not to spill a drop. Paul
raised his glass, within which the ruby liquid
exhaled a perfume like a dusky rose, and after
first making Antiochus taste it, he put it to his
own lips:</p>

<p>"Then let us drink to the future parish priest
of Aar!" he said.</p>

<p>Antiochus was obliged to lean against the bar,
for his knees gave way under him; that was
the happiest moment of his life. The woman
had turned round to replace the precious bottle
on the shelf, and, absorbed in his joy, the lad did
not notice that the priest had gone deathly
pale and was staring out of the doorway as
though he beheld a ghost.</p>

<p>A dark figure was running silently across the
square, came to the wine-shop door, looked
round the interior with wide-open black eyes,
and then entered, panting.</p>

<p>It was one of Agnes's servants.</p>

<p>The priest instinctively withdrew to the far
end of the tavern, trying to hide himself, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
came forward again on a sudden impulse. He
felt as if he were revolving round and round
like a top, then pulled himself together and
remembered that he was not alone and must be
careful not to excite remark. So he stood
still. But he had no desire to hear what the
servant was telling the woman, listening eagerly
behind the bar, his only desire was flight and
safety; his heart had stopped beating, and all
the blood in his body had rushed to his head
and was roaring in his ears. Nevertheless the
servant's words penetrated to the utmost depths
of his soul.</p>

<p>"She fell down," said the girl breathlessly,
"and the blood poured from her nose in a
stream, such a stream that we thought she had
broken something inside her head! And she's
bleeding still! Give me the keys of St. Mary
of Egypt, for that is the only thing that can
stop it."</p>

<p>Antiochus, who stood listening with the tray
and glass still in his hands, ran to fetch the keys
of an old church, now demolished, which keys
when actually laid on the shoulders of anyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
suffering from hæmorrhage of the nose did to
some extent arrest the flow of blood.</p>

<p>"All this is just pretence," thought Paul,
"there is no truth whatever in the tale.
She sent her servant to spy on me and endeavour
to lure me to her house, and they are
probably in league with this worthless woman
here."</p>

<p>And yet deep, deep within him the agitation
grew till all his being was in a tumult. Ah no,
the servant was not lying; Agnes was too proud
to confide in anyone, and least of all in her
servants. Agnes was really ill, and with his
inward eye he saw her sweet face all stained
with blood. And it was he himself who had
struck her the blow. "We thought she had
broken something inside her head."</p>

<p>He saw the shifty eyes of the woman behind
the bar glance swiftly in his direction, with
obvious surprise at his apparent indifference.</p>

<p>"But how did it happen?" he then asked
the servant, but coolly and calmly, as though
seeking to conceal his anxiety even from himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl turned and confronted him, her
dark, hard, pointed face thrust out towards
him like a rock against which he feared to
strike.</p>

<p>"I was not at home when she fell. It
happened this morning whilst I was at the
fountain, and when I got back I found her very
ill. She had fallen over the doorstep and blood
was flowing from her nose, but I think she was
more frightened than hurt. Then the blood
stopped, but she was very pale all day and
refused to eat. Then this evening her nose
began to bleed again, and not only that, but
she had a sort of convulsions, and when I left her
just now she was lying cold and stiff, with blood
still flowing. I am very nervous," added the
girl, taking the keys which Antiochus handed
to her and wrapping them in her apron, "and
we are only women in the house."</p>

<p>She moved towards the door, but kept her
black eyes on Paul as though seeking to draw
him after her by the sheer power of her gaze,
and the woman seated behind the bar said in
her cold voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why does not your Reverence go and see
her?"</p>

<p>He wrung his hands unconsciously and
stammered: "I hardly know ... it is too
late...."</p>

<p>"Yes, come, come!" urged the servant.
"My little mistress will be very glad, and it will
give her courage to see you."</p>

<p>"It is the devil speaking by your mouth,"
thought Paul, but unconsciously he followed
the girl. He had gripped Antiochus by the
shoulder and was drawing him along as a
support, and the boy went with him like a plank
of safety upon the waves. So they crossed the
square and went as far as the presbytery, the
servant running on ahead, but turning every
few steps to look back at them, the whites of her
eyes gleaming in the moonlight. Seen thus at
night, the black figure with the dark and mask-like
face had truly something diabolical about it,
and Paul followed it with a vague sense of fear,
leaning on Antiochus's shoulder as he walked
and feeling like Tobit in his blindness.</p>

<p>On passing the presbytery door the boy tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
to open it, and then Paul perceived that his
mother had locked it. He stopped short and
disengaged himself from his companion.</p>

<p>"My mother has locked up because she knew
in advance that I should not keep my word," he
thought to himself; then said to the boy:
"Antiochus, you must go home at once."</p>

<p>The servant had stopped also, then went on
a few steps, then stopped again and saw the
boy returning towards his own home and the
priest inserting his key in his door; then she
went back to him:</p>

<p>"I am not coming," he said, turning almost
threateningly to confront her, and looking her
straight in the face as though trying to recognize
her true nature through her outward mask;
"if you should absolutely need me, you understand&mdash;only
if you do absolutely need me&mdash;you
can come back and fetch me."</p>

<p>She went away without another word, and
he stood there before his own door, with his
hand on the key as though it had refused to turn
in the lock. He could not bring himself to
enter, it was beyond his power; neither could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
he go forward in that other path he had begun
to tread. He felt as if he were doomed to
stand there for all eternity, before a closed door
of which he held the key.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile Antiochus had reached home.
His mother locked the door and he went to wash
up the glasses and put them away; and the first
glass he washed in the clean water was the one
from which <em>he</em> had drunk. The boy dried it
very carefully with a white cloth, which he
passed round and round inside with his thumb;
then he held it up to the flame of the lamp and
examined it with one eye, keeping the other
screwed up, which had the effect of making the
glass shine like a big diamond. Then he hid
it away in a secret cupboard of his own with as
much reverence as if it had been the chalice of
the Mass.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>Paul had gone home too, and was feeling
his way upstairs in the dark: he dimly
remembered going up some stairs in the dark
like this when he was a boy, but he could not
remember where it had been. Now, as then,
he had the feeling that there was some danger
near him which he could only escape by strict
attention to what he was doing. He reached
the landing, he stood before his own door, he
was safe. But he hesitated an instant before
opening it, then crossed over and tapped lightly
with the knuckle of his forefinger at his mother's
door and entered without waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>"It is I," he said brusquely; "don't light
the candle, I have something to tell you."</p>

<p>He heard her turning round in her bed, the
straw mattress creaking under her: but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
could not see her, he did not want to see her;
their two souls must speak together in the darkness
as though they had already passed to the
world beyond.</p>

<p>"Is it you, Paul? I was dreaming," she said
in a sleepy yet frightened voice; "I thought I
heard dancing, some one playing on the flute."</p>

<p>"Mother, listen," he said, paying no attention
to her words. "That woman, Agnes, is
ill. She has been ill since this morning. She
had a fall; it seems she hurt her head and is
bleeding from her nose."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it, Paul? Is she in
danger?"</p>

<p>In the darkness her voice sounded alarmed,
yet at the same time incredulous. He went
on, repeating the breathless words of the
servant:</p>

<p>"It happened this morning, after she got
the letter. All day long she was pale and
refused to eat, and this evening she grew worse
and fell into convulsions."</p>

<p>He knew that he was exaggerating, and
stopped: his mother did not speak. For a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
moment in the silence and the night there was
a deathlike tension, as though two enemies
were seeking each other in the darkness and
seeking in vain. Then the straw mattress
creaked again; his mother must have raised
herself to a sitting position in the high bed,
because her clear voice now seemed to come
from above.</p>

<p>"Paul, who told you all this? Perhaps
it is not true."</p>

<p>Again he felt that it was his conscience
speaking to him through her, but he answered
at once:</p>

<p>"It may be true. But that is not the question,
mother. It is that I fear she may commit
some folly. She is alone in the hands of servants,
and I must see her."</p>

<p>"Paul!"</p>

<p>"I must," he repeated, raising his voice
almost to a shout; but it was himself he was
trying to convince, not his mother.</p>

<p>"Paul, you promised!"</p>

<p>"I know I promised, and for that very
reason I have come to tell you before I go. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
tell you that it is necessary that I should go
to her; my conscience bids me go."</p>

<p>"Tell me one thing, Paul: are you sure
you saw the servant? Temptation plays evil
tricks on us and the devil has many disguises."</p>

<p>He did not quite understand her.</p>

<p>"You think I am telling a lie? I saw the
servant."</p>

<p>"Listen&mdash;last night I saw the old priest,
and I thought I heard his footsteps again just
now. Last night," she went on in a low voice,
"he sat beside me before the fire. I actually
saw him, I tell you: he had not shaved, and
the few teeth he had left were black from too
much smoking. And he had holes in his
stockings. And he said, 'I am alive and I am
here, and very soon I shall turn you and your
son out of the presbytery.' And he said I
ought to have taught you your father's trade
if I did not wish you to fall into sin. He so
upset my mind, Paul, that I don't know whether
I have acted rightly or wrongly! But I am
absolutely sure that it was the devil sitting
beside me last night, the spirit of evil. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
servant you saw might have been temptation
in another shape."</p>

<p>He smiled in the darkness. Nevertheless,
when he thought of the fantastic figure of the
servant running across the meadow, he felt a
vague sense of terror in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"If you go there," continued his mother's
voice, "are you certain you will not fall
again? Even if you really saw the servant
and if that woman is really ill, are you sure
not to fall?"</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly; she seemed to see
his pale face through the darkness, and she was
filled with pity for him. Why should she
forbid him to go to the woman? Supposing
Agnes really died of grief? Supposing Paul died
of grief? And she was as wracked with uncertainty
as he had been in the case of Antiochus.</p>

<p>"Lord," she sighed; then she remembered
that she had already placed herself in the hands
of God, Who alone can solve all our difficulties.
She felt a sort of relief, as if she had really
settled the problem. And had she not settled
it by entrusting it in the hands of God?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>She lay back on her pillow and her voice
came again nearer to her son.</p>

<p>"If your conscience bids you go, why did
you not go at once instead of coming in here?"</p>

<p>"Because I promised. And you threatened
to leave me if I went back to that house. I
swore...." he said with infinite sadness. And
he longed to cry out, "Mother, force me to
keep my oath!" but the words would not
come. And then she spoke again:</p>

<p>"Then go: do whatever your conscience
bids you."</p>

<p>"Do not be anxious," he said, coming close
up to the bed; and he stood there motionless
for a few minutes and both were silent. He
had a confused impression that he was standing
before an altar with his mother lying upon it
like some mysterious idol, and he remembered
how, when he was a boy in the Seminary, he
was always obliged to go and kiss her hand after
he had been to confession. And something of
the same repugnance and the same exaltation
moved him now. He felt that if he had been
alone, without her, he would have gone back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to Agnes long since, worn out by that endless
day of flight and strife; but his mother held
him in check, and he did not know whether he
was grateful to her or not.</p>

<p>"Do not be anxious!" Yet all the time
he longed and feared that she would say more
to him, or that she would light the lamp and,
looking into his eyes, read all his thoughts and
forbid him to go. But she said nothing. Then
the mattress creaked again as she stretched
herself in the bed.</p>

<p>And he went out.</p>

<p>He reflected that after all he was not a
scoundrel: he was not going with any bad
motive or moved by passion, but because he
honestly thought that there might be some
danger he could avert, and the responsibility
for this danger rested upon him. He recalled
the fantastic figure of the servant running
across the moonlit grass, and turning back to
look at him with bright eyes as she said:</p>

<p>"My little mistress will take courage if only
you will come."</p>

<p>And all his efforts to break away from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
appeared now base and stupid: his duty was
to have gone to her at once and given her
courage. And as he crossed the meadow, silvery
in the moonlight, he felt relieved, almost happy,
he was like a moth attracted by the light. And
he mistook the joy he felt at the prospect of
seeing Agnes again in a few moments for the
satisfaction of doing his duty in going to save
her. All the sweet scent of the grass, all the
tender radiance of the moon bathed and purified
his soul, and the healing dew fell upon it even
through his clothes of deathlike black.</p>

<p>Agnes, little mistress! In truth, she was
little, weak as a child, and she was all alone,
without father or mother, living in that
labyrinth of stone, her dark house under the
ridge. And he had taken advantage of her,
had caught her in his hand like a bird from
the nest, gripping her till the blood seemed
driven from her body.</p>

<p>He hurried on. No, he was not a bad man,
but as he reached the bottom of the steps that
led up to the door he stumbled, and it was
sharply borne in upon him that even the stones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of her threshold repulsed him. Then he
mounted softly, hesitatingly, raised the knocker
and let it fall. They were a long time coming
to answer the door, and he felt humiliated
standing there, but for nothing in the world
would he have knocked a second time. At
last the fanlight over the door was lit up and
the dark-faced maid let him in, showing him
at once into the room he knew so well.</p>

<p>Everything was just as it had been on other
nights, when Agnes had admitted him secretly
by way of the orchard; the little door stood
ajar, and through the narrow opening he
could smell the fragrance of the bushes in the
night air. The glass eyes in the stuffed heads
of stags and deer on the walls shone in the
steady glow of the big lamp, as though taking
careful note of all that happened in the room.
Contrary to custom, the door leading to the
inner rooms stood wide open; the servant had
gone through there and the board flooring
could be heard creaking under her heavy step.
After a moment a door banged violently as
though blown by a gust of wind, making the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
whole house shake, and he started involuntarily
when immediately afterwards he beheld Agnes
emerge from the darkness of the inner rooms,
with white face and distorted hair floating in
black wisps across it, like the phantom of a
drowned woman. Then the little figure came
forward into the lamplight and he almost
sobbed with relief.</p>

<p>She closed the door behind her and leaned
against it with bowed head. She faltered as
though about to fall, and Paul ran to her,
holding out his hands, but not daring to touch
her.</p>

<p>"How are you?" he asked in a low voice, as
he had asked at former meetings. But she did
not answer, only stood trembling all over her
body, her hands pressed against the door behind
her for support. "Agnes," he continued after
a moment's tense silence, "we must be brave."</p>

<p>But as on that day when he had read the
Gospel words over the frenzied girl, he knew
that his voice rang false, and his eyes sought
the ground as Agnes raised hers, bewildered,
yes, but full of mingled scorn and joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then why have you come?"</p>

<p>"I heard that you were ill."</p>

<p>She drew herself up proudly and pushed
back the hair from her face.</p>

<p>"I am quite well and I did not send for
you."</p>

<p>"I know that, but I came all the same&mdash;there
was no reason why I should not come.
I am glad to find that your maid exaggerated,
and that you are all right."</p>

<p>"No," she repeated, interrupting him, "I
did not send for you and you ought not to
have come. But since you are here, since you
are here, I want to ask you&mdash;why you did it ...
why?&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>Her words were broken by sobs and her hands
sought blindly for support, so that Paul was
afraid, and repented that he had come. He
took her hands and led her to the couch where
they had sat together on other evenings, placing
her in the corner where the weight of other
women of the family had worn a sort of niche,
and seated himself beside her, but he let go
her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>He was afraid of touching her; she was like
a statue which he had broken and put together
again, and which sat there apparently whole
but ready to fall in pieces again at the slightest
movement. So he was afraid of touching her,
and he thought to himself:</p>

<p>"It is better so, I shall be safe," but in his
heart he knew that at any moment he might be
lost again, and for that reason he was afraid of
touching her. Looking closely at her beneath
the lamplight, he perceived that she was
changed. Her mouth was half-open, her lips
discoloured and greyish like faded rose-leaves;
the oval of her face seemed to have grown
longer and her cheekbones stood out sharply
beneath eyes sunk deep in their livid sockets.
Grief had aged her by twenty years in a single
day, yet there was something childlike still in
the expression of her trembling lips, drawn
tightly over her teeth to check her weeping,
and in the little hands, one of which, lying
nerveless on the dark stuff of the couch, invited
his own towards it. And he was filled with
anger because he dared not take that little hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in his and link up again the broken chain of
their two lives. He remembered the words of
the man possessed with a devil, "What have I
to do with Thee?" and he began to speak
again, clasping his hands together to prevent
himself taking one of hers. But still he heard
his voice ring false, and as on that morning in
church when he read the Gospel, and when he
carried the sacrament to the old hunter, he
knew himself to be lying.</p>

<p>"Agnes, listen to me. Last night we were
both on the brink of destruction&mdash;God had
left us to ourselves and we were slipping over
the edge of the abyss. But now God has
taken us by the hand again and is guiding us.
We must not fall, Agnes, Agnes," and his voice
shook with emotion as he spoke her name.
"You think I don't suffer? I feel as if I were
buried alive and that my torments would last
through all eternity. But we must endure
for your good, for your salvation. Listen,
Agnes, be brave, for the sake of the love
which united us, for God's goodwill towards us
in putting us through this trial. You will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
forget me. You will recover; you are young,
with all your life still before you. When you
think of me it will be like a bad dream, as
though you had lost your way in the valley
and met some evil creature who had tried to
do you harm; but God has saved you, as you
deserved to be saved. Everything looks black
at present, but it will clear up soon and you
will realize that I am only acting for your good
in causing you a little momentary pain now,
just as we are sometimes obliged to seem cruel
to those who are ill...."</p>

<p>He stopped, the words froze in his throat.</p>

<p>Agnes had roused herself and was sitting
upright in her corner, gazing at him with eyes
as glassy as those in the stags' heads on the
walls. They reminded him of the women's
eyes in church, fixed on him as he preached.
She waited for his words, patient and gentle
in every line of her fragile form, yet ready to
break down at a touch. Then speechless himself,
he heard her low voice as she shook her
head slowly:</p>

<p>"No, no, that is not the truth," she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then what is the truth?" he asked, bending
his troubled face towards her.</p>

<p>"Why did you not speak like that last night?
And the other nights? Because it was a
different kind of truth then. Now somebody
has found you out, perhaps your mother herself,
and you are afraid of the world. It is not
the fear of God which is driving you away
from me!"</p>

<p>He wanted to cry out, to strike her; he
seized her hand and twisted the slender wrist
as he would have liked to twist and stifle the
words she spoke. Then he drew himself up
stiffly.</p>

<p>"What then? You think it does not matter?
Yes, my mother has discovered everything
and she talked to me like my conscience
itself. And have you no conscience? Do you
think it right that we should injure those who
depend on us? You wanted us to go away
and live together, and that would have been
the right thing to do if we had not been able
to overcome our love; but since there are
beings who would have been cut off from life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
by our flight and our sin, we had to sacrifice
ourselves for them."</p>

<p>But she seemed not to understand, caught
only one word, and shook her head as before.</p>

<p>"Conscience? Of course I have a conscience,
I am no longer a child! And my
conscience tells me that I did wrong in listening
to you and letting you come here. What
is to be done? It is too late now; why did
not God make you see things clearly at first?
I did not go to your home, but you came to
mine and played with me as if I had been a
child's toy. And what must I do now? Tell
me that. I cannot forget you, I cannot change
as you change. I shall go away, even if you
will not come with me&mdash;I want to try and
forget you. I must go right away, or else...."</p>

<p>"Or else?"</p>

<p>Agnes did not reply; she leaned back in her
corner and shivered. Something ominous, like
the dark wing of madness, must have touched
her, for her eyes grew dim and she raised her
hand with an instinctive movement as though
to brush away a shadow from before her face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
He bent again towards her, stretching across
the couch and his fingers gripping and breaking
through the old material as though it were a
wall that rose between them and threatened to
stifle him.</p>

<p>He could not speak. Yes, she was right;
the explanation he had been trying to make
her believe was not the truth&mdash;it was the truth
that was rising like a wall and stifling him, and
which he did not know how to break down.
And he sat up, battling with a real sense of
suffocation. Now it was she who caught his
hand and held it as though her fingers had
been grappling-hooks.</p>

<p>"O God," she whispered, covering her
eyes with her free hand, "if there be a God,
He should not have let us meet each other if
we must part again. And you came to-night
because you love me still. You think I don't
know that? I do know, I do know, and that
is the truth!"</p>

<p>She raised her face to his, her trembling lips,
her lashes wet with tears. And his eyes were
dazzled as by the glitter of deep waters, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
glitter that blinds and beckons, and the face
he gazed into was not the face of Agnes, nor
the face of any woman on this earth,&mdash;it
was the face of Love itself. And he fell forward
into her arms and kissed her upon the
mouth.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>The world had ceased for Paul. He felt
himself sinking slowly, swept down by a
whirlpool through luminous depths to some
dazzling iridescent place beneath the sea. Then
he came to himself again and drew his lips
away from hers, and found himself, like a ship-wrecked
man upon the sand, safe though
maimed, and shaking with fear and joy, but
more with fear than joy. And the enchantment
that he thought had been broken for ever, and
for this very reason had seemed more beautiful
and dear, wove its spell over him afresh
and held him again in thrall. And again he
heard the whisper of her voice:</p>

<p>"I knew you would come back to me...."</p>

<p>He wanted to hear no more, just as he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
tried not to hear the servant's tale in the house
of Antiochus. He put his hand over Agnes's
mouth as she leaned her head upon his shoulder
and then gently caressed her hair, on which
the lamplight threw golden gleams. She was
so small, so helpless in his grasp, and therein
lay her terrible power to drag him down to the
bottom of the sea, to raise him to the highest
heights of heaven, to make of him a thing
without will or desire of his own. Whilst he
had fled through the valleys and the hills she
had remained shut up within her prison-house,
waiting in the certainty that he would come
back to her, and he came.</p>

<p>"You know, you know...." She tried to
tell him more; her soft breath touched his
neck like a caress, he placed his hand on her
mouth again and with her own she pressed it
close. And so they remained in silence for a
while; then he pulled himself together and
tried to regain the mastery over his fate. He
had come back to her, yes, but not the same
man she had expected. And his gaze still
rested on her gleaming hair, but as on something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
far away, as on the bright sparkle of the
sea from which he had escaped.</p>

<p>"Now you are happy," he whispered. "I
am here, I have come back and I am yours for
life. But you must be calm, you have given
me a great fright. You must not excite yourself,
nor wander on any account from the
straight path of your life. I shall cause you
no more trouble, but you must promise me to
be calm and good, as you are now."</p>

<p>He felt her hands tremble and struggle
between his own; he divined that she was
already beginning to rebel and he held them
tightly, as he would have liked to hold her soul
imprisoned.</p>

<p>"Dear Agnes, listen! You will never know
all I have suffered to-day, but it was necessary.
I stripped off all the outward shell of me, all
that was impure, and I scourged myself until I
bled. But now here I am, yours, yours, but
as God wills that I should be yours, in spirit....
You see," he went on, speaking slowly
and laboriously, as though dragging his words
up painfully from his inmost depths and offering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
them to her, "it seems to me that we
have loved each other for years and years, that
we have rejoiced and suffered the one for the
other, even unto hatred, even unto death. And
all the tempests of the sea and all its implacable
life are within us. Agnes, soul of my soul, what
wouldst thou have of me greater than that
which I can give thee, my soul itself?"</p>

<p>He stopped short. He felt that she did not
understand, she could not understand. And
he beheld her ever more detached from him,
as life from death; but for this very reason he
loved her still, yea, more than ever, as one
loves life that is dying.</p>

<p>She slowly raised her head from his shoulder
and looked him in the face with eyes grown
hostile again.</p>

<p>"Now you listen to me," she said, "and tell
me no more lies. Are we or are we not going
away together as we settled last night? We
cannot go on living here, in this way. That is
certain!... That is certain!" she repeated
with rising anger, after a moment of painful
silence. "If we are to live together we must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
go away at once, this very night. I have
money, you know, it is my own. And your
mother and my brothers and every one else
will excuse us afterwards when they see that
we only wanted to live according to the truth.
We cannot go on living like this, no, we cannot!"</p>

<p>"Agnes!"</p>

<p>"Answer me quick! Yes or no?"</p>

<p>"I cannot go away with you."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;then why have you come back?...
Leave me! Get away, leave me!"</p>

<p>He did not leave her. He felt her whole
body shaking and he was afraid of her; and
as she bowed herself over their united hands
he expected to feel her teeth fasten in his
flesh.</p>

<p>"Go, go!" she insisted, "I did not send
for you! Since we must be brave, why did
you come back? Why have you kissed me
again? Ah, if you think you can play with
me like this you are mistaken! If you think
you can come here at night and write me
humiliating letters in the day you are mistaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
again! You came back to-night and you will
come back to-morrow night and every night
after that, until at last you drive me mad. But
I won't have it, I won't have it!"</p>

<p>"We must be pure and brave, you say," she
continued, and her face, grown old and tragic,
became now pale as death; "but you never
said that before to-night. You fill me with
horror! Go away, far away, and go at once,
so that to-morrow I can wake up without the
terror of expecting you and being humiliated
like this again."</p>

<p>"O God, O God!" he groaned, bending over
her, but she repulsed him sharply.</p>

<p>"Do you think you are speaking to a child?"
she burst out now: "I am old, and it is you
who have made me grow old in a few hours.
The straight path of life! Oh, yes, it would
be going straight if we continued this secret
intrigue, wouldn't it? I should find myself
a husband and you should marry me to him,
and then we could go on seeing each other, you
and I, and deceiving every one for the rest
of our lives. Oh, you don't know me if that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
is your idea! Last night you said, 'Let us go
away, we will get married and I will work.'
Didn't you say that? Didn't you? But
to-night you come and talk to me instead
about God and sacrifice. So now there is an
end of it all: we will part. But you, I say it
again, you must leave the village this very
night, I never wish to see you again. If to-morrow
morning you go once more into our
church to say Mass I shall go there too, and
from the altar steps I shall say to the people:
'This is your saint, who works miracles by day
and by night goes to unprotected girls to
seduce them!'"</p>

<p>He tried in vain to shut her mouth with his
hand, and as she kept on crying aloud, "Go,
go!" he seized her head and pressed it to his
breast, glancing with alarm at the closed doors.
And he remembered his mother's words and
her voice, mysterious in the darkness: "The
old priest sat beside me and said, I will soon
turn both you and your son out of the
parish."</p>

<p>"Agnes, Agnes, you are mad!" he groaned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
his lips close to her ear, whilst she struggled
fiercely to escape from him: "Be calm, listen
to me. Nothing is lost; don't you feel how I
love you? A thousand times more than before!
And I am not going away, I am going to stay
near you, to save you, to offer up my soul to
you as I shall offer it up to God in the hour of
death. How can you know all that I have
suffered between last night and now? I fled
and I bore you with me: I fled like one who is
on fire and who thinks by fleeing to escape the
flames which only envelop him the more.
Where have I not been to-day, what have I
not done to keep myself from coming back to
you? Yet here I am, Agnes, and how could
I not be here?... Do you hear me? I shall
not betray you, I shall not forget you, I do not
wish to forget you! But, Agnes, we must keep
ourselves unsoiled, we must keep our love for
all eternity, we must unite it with all that is
best in life, with renunciation, with death
itself, that is to say, with God. Do you understand,
Agnes? Yes, tell me that you
understand!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>She fought him back, as though she wanted
to break in his breast with her head, till at last
she freed herself from his embrace and sat
rigid and upright, her beautiful hair twisted
like ribbons round her stony face. With tight-shut
lips and closed eyes, she seemed to have
suddenly fallen into a deep sleep, wherein she
dreamed of vengeance. And he was more
afraid of her silence and immobility than
of her frenzied words and excited gestures.
He took her hands again in his, but now all
four hands were dead to joy and to the clasp
of love.</p>

<p>"Agnes, can't you see that I am right?
Come, be good; go to bed now and to-morrow
a new life will begin for us all. We shall see
each other just the same, always supposing you
desire it: I will be your friend, your brother,
and we shall be a mutual help and support.
My life is yours, dispose of me as you wish. I
shall be with you till the hour of death, and
beyond death, for all eternity."</p>

<p>This tone of prayer irritated her afresh.
She twisted her hands slightly within his and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
opened her lips to speak. Then, as he
set her free, she folded her hands in her
lap and bowed her head and her face took
on an expression of the deepest grief, but
now a grief that was desperate and determined.</p>

<p>He continued to gaze steadfastly at her, as
one gazes at the dying, and his fear increased.
He slid to his knees before her, he laid his head
in her lap and kissed her hands; he cared nothing
now if he were seen or heard, he knelt there
at the feet of the woman and her sorrow as at
the feet of the Mother of Sorrows herself.
Never before had he felt so pure of evil thought,
so dead to this earthly life; and yet he was
afraid.</p>

<p>Agnes sat motionless, with icy hands, insensible
to those kisses of death. Then he got up
and began to speak lies again.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Agnes&mdash;that is right and I am
very pleased. The trial has been won and you
can rest in peace. I am going now, and to-morrow,"
he added in a whisper, bending
nervously towards her, "to-morrow morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
you will come to Mass and together we will
offer our sacrifice to God."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and looked at him, then
closed them again. She was as one wounded
to death, whose eyes had opened wide with a
last menace and appeal before they closed for
ever.</p>

<p>"You will go away to-night, quite away,
so that I shall never see you again," she
said, pronouncing each word distinctly and
decisively, and he realized that for the moment
at least it was useless to oppose that blind
force.</p>

<p>"I cannot go like that," he murmured: "I
must say Mass to-morrow morning and you will
come and hear it, and afterwards I will go
away, if necessary."</p>

<p>"Then I shall come to-morrow morning and
denounce you before all the congregation."</p>

<p>"If you do that it will be a sign that it is
God's will. But you won't do it, Agnes!
You may hate me, but I leave you in peace.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>Even yet he did not go. He stood quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
still, looking down at her, at her soft and
gleaming hair, the sweet hair he loved and
through which so often his hands had strayed,
and it awoke in him an infinite pity, for it
seemed like the black bandage round a wounded
head.</p>

<p>For the last time he called her by her
name:</p>

<p>"Agnes! Is it possible that we can part
like this?... Come," he added after a
moment, "give me your hand, get up and open
the door for me."</p>

<p>She got up obediently, but she did not give
him her hand; she went direct to the door
through which she had entered the room, and
there she stood still, waiting.</p>

<p>"What can I do?" he asked himself. And
he knew very well that there was only one
thing he could do to appease her: to fall at
her feet again, to sin and be lost with her for
ever.</p>

<p>And that he would not do, never never more.
He remained firm, there where he stood, and
lowered his eyes that he might not meet her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
look, and when he raised them again she was
no longer there; she had disappeared, swallowed
up in the darkness of her silent house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The glass eyes of the stags' and deer's heads
upon the walls looked down at him with mingled
sadness and derision. And in that moment of
suspense, alone in the big melancholy room, he
realized the whole immensity of his wretchedness
and his humiliation. He felt himself a
thief, and worse than a thief, a guest who takes
advantage of the solitude of the house that
shelters him to rob it basely. He averted his
eyes, for he could not meet even the glassy
stare of the heads upon the wall: but he did
not waver in his purpose for one moment, and
even if the death-cry of the woman had suddenly
filled the house with horror, he would
not have repented having rejected her.</p>

<p>He waited a few minutes longer, but nobody
appeared. He had a confused idea that he was
standing in the middle of a dead world of all
his dreams and his mistakes, waiting till some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
one came and helped him to get away. But
nobody came. So at last he pushed open the
door that led into the orchard, traversed the
path that ran beside the wall and went out
by the little gate he knew so well.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>Once more Paul found himself ascending
his own staircase; but now the danger
was past, or at least the fear of danger.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he halted before his mother's
door, deeming that it would be advisable to tell
her the result of his interview with Agnes and of
her threat to denounce him. But he heard the
sound of regular breathing and passed on; his
mother had quietly fallen asleep, for henceforth
she was sure of him and felt that he was safe.</p>

<p>Safe! He looked round his room as though
he had just returned from a long and disastrous
journey. Everything was peaceful and tidy,
and he moved about on tiptoe as he began to
undress, for the sake of not disturbing that
orderliness and silence. His clothes hanging
from their hooks, blacker than their shadows on
the wall, his hat above them, stuck forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
on a wooden peg, the sleeves of his cassock
falling limply as though tired out, all had the
vague appearance of some dark and empty
phantom, some fleshless and bloodless vampire
that inspired a nameless dread. It was like the
shadow of that sin from which he had cut himself
free, but which was waiting to follow him
again to-morrow on his way through the world.</p>

<p>An instant more, and he perceived with
terror that the nightmare obsessed him still.
He was not safe yet, there was another night
to be got through, as the voyager crosses a last
stretch of turbulent sea. He was very weary
and his heavy eyelids drooped with fatigue, but
an intolerable anxiety prevented him from
throwing himself on his bed, or even sitting
down on a chair or resting in any way whatever;
he wandered here and there, doing small,
unusual, useless things, softly opening drawer
after drawer and inspecting what there was
inside.</p>

<p>As he passed before the mirror he looked at
his own reflection and beheld himself grey of
face, with purple lips and hollow eyes. "Look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
well at yourself, Paul," he said to his image,
and he stepped back a little so that the lamplight
might fall better on the glass. The figure
in the mirror stepped back also, as though seeking
to escape him, and as he stared into its
eyes and noted the dilated pupils he had a
strange impression that the real Paul was the
one in the glass, a Paul who never lied and who
betrayed by the pallor of his face all his awful
fear of the morrow.</p>

<p>"Why do I pretend even to myself a security
which I do not feel?" was his silent question.
"I must go away this very night as she bade
me."</p>

<p>And somewhat calmer for the resolve he
threw himself on his bed. And thus, with
closed eyes and face pressed into the pillow,
he believed he could search more deeply into
his conscience.</p>

<p>"Yes, I must leave to-night. Christ himself
commands us to avoid creating scandals. I
had better wake my mother and tell her, and
perhaps we can leave together; she can take
me away with her again as she did when I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a child and I can begin a new life in another
place."</p>

<p>But he felt that all this was mere exaltation
and that he had not the courage to do as he
proposed. And why should he? He really felt
quite sure that Agnes would not carry out her
threat, so why should he go away? He was not
even confronted with the danger of going back
to her and falling into sin again, for he had
now been tried and had overcome temptation.</p>

<p>But the exaltation took hold of him again.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, Paul, you will have to go.
Awaken your mother and depart together.
Don't you know who it is speaking to you? It
is I, Agnes. You really believe that I shall not
carry out my threat? Perhaps I shall not,
but I advise you to go, all the same. You think
you have got rid of me? And yet I am within
you, I am the evil genius of your life. If you
remain here I shall never leave you alone for
one single instant; I shall be the shadow
beneath your feet, the barrier between you
and your mother, between you and your own
self. Go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he tried to pacify her, in order to
pacify his own conscience.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going, I tell you! I am going&mdash;we
will go together, you within me, more alive
than I myself. Be content, torment me no
more! We are together, journeying together,
borne on the wings of time towards eternity.
Divided and distant we were when our eyes
first met and our lips kissed; divided were we
then and enemies; only now begins our real
union, in thy hatred, in my patience, in my
renunciation."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then weariness slowly overcame him. He
heard a subdued, continuous moaning outside
his window, like a dove seeking her mate: and
that mournful cry was like the lament of the
night itself, a night pale with moonlight, a
soft, veiled light, with the sky all flecked with
little white clouds like feathers. Then he
became aware that it was he himself who was
moaning; but sleep was already stealing over
him, calming his senses, and fear and sorrow
and remembrance faded away. He dreamed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
he was really on a journey, riding up the mountain
paths towards the plateau. Everything
was peaceful and clear; between the big yellow
elder trees he could see stretches of grass, of a
soft green that gave rest to the eyes, and
motionless upon the rocks the eagles blinked
at the sun.</p>

<p>Suddenly the keeper stood before him, saluted,
and placed an open book on his saddle-bow.
And he began to read St. Paul's Epistle to the
Corinthians, taking it up at the precise point
where he had left off the previous night:
"The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise
and that they are vain."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On Sundays Mass was later than on other
days, but Paul always went early to the church
to hear the confessions of those women who
wished to attend Communion later. So his
mother called him at the usual time.</p>

<p>He had slept for some hours, a heavy dreamless
sleep, and when he woke his memory was
a complete blank, he only had a supreme desire
to go to sleep again immediately. But the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
knocks on his door persisted, and then he
remembered. Instantly he was on his feet,
numb with dread.</p>

<p>"Agnes will come to church and denounce
me before all the people," was his one thought.</p>

<p>He did not know why, but somehow whilst
he slept the certainty that she would carry
out her threat had taken firm root in his
consciousness.</p>

<p>He dropped down in his chair with trembling
knees and a sense of complete helplessness.
His mind was clouded and confused: he
wondered vaguely if it would not be possible
even now to avert the scandal&mdash;he might
feign illness and not say Mass at all, and thus
gain time in which he might endeavour to
pacify Agnes. But the very idea of beginning
the whole thing over again, of suffering a
second time all his misery of the previous
day, only increased his mental torment.</p>

<p>He got up, and his head seemed to hit the
sky through the glass of his window, and he
stamped his feet on the floor to dispel the
numbness that was paralysing his very blood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Then he dressed, drawing his leather belt
tightly round his waist and folding his mantle
round him as he had seen the hunters buckle
on their cartridge-belts and wrap themselves
up in their cloaks before starting out for the
mountains. When at last he flung open his
window and leaned out he felt that only
then were his eyes awaking to the light of
day after the nightmare of the dark hours,
only then had he escaped from the prison of
his own self to make his peace with external
things. But it was a forced peace, full of
secret rancour, and it sufficed for him to draw
in his head from the cool fresh air outside
to the warm and perfumed atmosphere of
his room for him to fall back into himself, a
prey again to his gnawing dread.</p>

<p>So he fled downstairs, wondering what he
had better tell his mother.</p>

<p>He heard her somewhat harsh voice driving
off the chickens who were trying to invade
the dining-room, and the fluttering of their
wings as they scattered before her, and he
smelt the fragrance of hot coffee and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
clean sweet scents from the garden. In the
lane under the ridge there was a tinkle of
bells as the goats were driven to their pasture,
little bells that sounded like childish echoes of
the cheerful if monotonous chime wherewith
Antiochus, up in the church tower, summoned
the people to wake from sleep and come to
hear Mass.</p>

<p>Everything around was sweet and peaceful,
bathed in the rosy light of early morning.
And Paul remembered his dream.</p>

<p>There was nothing to hinder him from
going out, from going to church and taking up
his ordinary life again. Yet all his fear returned
upon him; he was afraid alike of going forward
or of turning back. As he stood on the step
of the open door he felt as if he were on the
summit of some precipitous mountain, it was
impossible to get any higher and below him
yawned the abyss. So he stood there for
unspeakable moments, during which his heart
beat furiously and he had the physical sensation
of falling, of struggling at the bottom of a
gulf, in a swirl of foaming waters, a wheel that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
turned helplessly, vainly beating the stream
that swept on its relentless course.</p>

<p>It was his own heart that turned and turned
helplessly in the whirlpool of life. He closed
the door and went back into the house, and
sat down on the stairs as his mother had done
the previous night. He gave up trying to solve
the problem that tortured him and simply
waited for some one to come and help him.</p>

<p>And there his mother found him. When he
saw her he got up immediately, feeling somehow
comforted at once, yet humiliated, too,
in the very depths of his being, so sure was he
of the advice she would give him to proceed
upon his chosen way.</p>

<p>But at the first sight of him her worn face
grew pale, as though refined through grief.</p>

<p>"Paul!" she cried, "what are you doing
there? Are you ill?"</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, walking to the front
door without turning into the dining-room,
"I did not want to wake you last night, it
was so late. Well, I went to see her. I went
to see her...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>His mother had already recovered her composure
and stood looking fixedly at him. In
the brief silence that followed his words they
could hear the church bell ringing quickly and
insistently as though it were right over the
house.</p>

<p>"She is quite well," continued Paul, "but
she is very excited and insists that I shall
leave the place at once: otherwise she threatens
to come to church and create a scandal by
denouncing me before the congregation."</p>

<p>His mother kept silence, but he felt her
at his side, stern and steadfast, upholding him,
supporting him as she had supported his
earliest steps.</p>

<p>"She wanted me to go away this very night.
And she said that ... if I did not go, she
would come to church this morning.... I
am not afraid of her: besides, I don't believe
she will come."</p>

<p>He opened the front door and a flood of
golden light poured into the dark little passage,
as though trying to entice him and his mother
out into the sunshine. Paul walked towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the church without turning round, and his
mother stood at the door looking after him.</p>

<p>She had not opened her lips, but a slight
trembling seized her again, and only with an
effort could she maintain her outward composure.
All at once she went up to her
bedroom and hurriedly dressed for church:
she was going too, and she, too, drew in her
belt and walked with firm steps. And before
she left the house she remembered to drive
out the intruding chickens again, and to draw
the coffee-pot to the side of the fire; then
she twisted the long end of her scarf over her
mouth and chin to hide the obstinate trembling
that would persist in spite of all her efforts
to overcome it.</p>

<p>So it was only with a glance of the eyes that
she could return the greetings of the women
who were coming up from the village, and
of the old men already seated on the low parapet
round the square before the church, their
black pointed caps standing out in sharp relief
against the background of rosy morning sky.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>Meanwhile Paul had gone into the
church.</p>

<p>A few eager penitents were waiting for him,
gathered round the confessional; the woman
who had arrived first was already kneeling at
the little grating, whilst the others waited
their turn in the benches close by.</p>

<p>Nina Masia was kneeling on the floor under
the holy-water stoup, which looked as though
it were resting on her wicked little head, while
several boys who were early astir were gathered
in a circle round her. Hurrying in with his
thoughts elsewhere the priest knocked up
against them, and his anger rose instantly as
he recognized the girl, who had been placed
there by her mother on purpose that she might
attract attention. She seemed to be always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in his way, at once a hindrance and a reproach.</p>

<p>"Clear out of this instantly!" he bade
them, in a voice so loud that it was heard all
over the church; and immediately the circle
of boys spread itself out and moved a little
farther off, with Nina still in the middle, but
they grouped themselves round her in such a
way that she could be seen by every one. The
women all turned their heads to look at her,
though without interrupting their prayers for
an instant: she really looked as if she were
the idol of the barbaric little church, redolent
of the smell of the fields brought in by the
peasants and flooded with the rosy haze of a
country morning.</p>

<p>Paul walked straight up the nave, but his
secret anguish grew ever greater. As he
passed, his cassock brushed against the seat
where Agnes usually sat; it was the old family
pew, the kneeling-stool in front of it richly
carved, and with his eyes and measured paces
he calculated the distance between it and the
altar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I watch for the moment when she rises
to carry out her fatal threat I shall have time
to get into the sacristy," was his conclusion,
and he shivered now as he entered.</p>

<p>Antiochus had hurried down from the belfry
to help Paul robe himself, and was waiting for
him beside the open cupboard where his
vestments hung. He had a pale and serious,
almost tragic air, as though already over-shadowed
by the future career which had been
settled for him the previous evening. But the
gravity was transient and a smile flickered
over the boy's face, just fresh from the windswept
belfry; his eyes sparkled with joy beneath
their decorously lowered lids, and he had to
bite his lips to check the ready laugh; his
young heart responded to all the radiance, the
inspirations, the joyousness of that festal
morning. Then his eyes clouded suddenly
as he was arranging the lace of the alb over
the priest's wrist and he shot a quick look at
his master, for he had perceived that the hand
beneath the lace was trembling and he saw that
the beloved face was pallid and distraught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you feel ill, sir?"</p>

<p>Paul did feel ill, although he shook his head
in denial. He felt as though his mouth were
full of blood, yet a tiny germ of hope was
springing up in the midst of his distress.</p>

<p>"I shall fall down dead, my heart will break;
and then, at least, there will be an end of
everything."</p>

<p>He went down into the church again to hear
the confessions of the women, and saw his
mother at the bottom of the nave near the
door. Stern and motionless she knelt there,
keeping watch over all who entered the church,
over the whole church itself, ready, apparently,
to support and hold it up were it even to
collapse upon her head.</p>

<p>But he had no more courage left: only
that tiny germ of hope within his heart, the
hope of death, grew and grew till the breath
in him stifled and failed.</p>

<p>When he was seated inside the confessional
he felt somewhat calmer; it was like being
in a grave, but at least he was hidden from
view and could look his horror in the face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
The subdued whispering of the women behind
the gratings, broken by their little sighs and
their warm breath, was like the rustling of
lizards in the long grass on the ridge. And
Agnes was there too, safe in the secret retreat
where he had so often taken her in his thoughts.
And the soft breathing of the young women,
the scent of their hair and their gala dress,
all perfumed with lavender, mingled with his
distress and further inflamed his passion.</p>

<p>And he gave them all absolution, absolved
them from all their sins, thinking that perhaps
before many days had passed he himself would
be a suppliant to them for their compassion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Then he was seized with the craving to
get out, to see whether Agnes had arrived.
But her seat was empty.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was not coming after all. Yet
sometimes she remained at the bottom of
the church, kneeling on a chair which her
servant brought for her. He turned to look,
but saw only his mother's rigid figure, and as
he knelt before the altar and began the Mass,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
he felt that her soul was bending before God,
clothed in her grief as he was clothed in his
alb and stole.</p>

<p>Then he determined not to look behind
him again, to close his eyes each time he had
to turn round to give the blessing. He felt
as if he were climbing ever higher up some
steep and stony Calvary, and a sensation of
giddiness seized him whenever the ritual
obliged him to face the congregation. Then
he closed his eyes to shut out the sight of the
abyss that yawned at his feet; but even through
his closed eyelids he saw the carven bench and
the figure of Agnes, her black dress standing
out in relief against the grey wall of the church.</p>

<p>And Agnes was really there, dressed in black
with a black veil round her ivory-white face;
her eyes were fixed on her prayer-book, the
gilt clasp of which glittered in her black-gloved
hands, but she never turned a page. The
servant with the head of a slave was kneeling
on the floor of the aisle beside the bench,
and every now and then she raised her eyes,
like a faithful dog, to her mistress's face, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
though in silent sympathy with the sad thoughts
that possessed her.</p>

<p>And he beheld everything from his place
at the altar and hope died within him; only
from the bottom of his heart he told himself
it was impossible that Agnes would carry out
her insane threat. He turned the pages of
the Gospel, but his faltering voice could
scarcely pronounce the words; he broke into a
sweat of apprehension, and caught hold of the
book as he felt himself fainting.</p>

<p>In a moment he pulled himself together.
Antiochus was looking at him, watching the
awful change that came over his face as over
the face of a corpse, keeping close beside him
to support him if he fell, and glancing at the
old men by the altar rails to see if they had
noticed the priest's distress. But nobody
noticed it&mdash;even his mother remained in her
place, praying and waiting without seeing
anything amiss with her son. Then Antiochus
drew still closer to him with a protecting
movement, so that Paul looked round startled,
but the boy gave him a reassuring glance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
out of his bright eyes, as much as to say:</p>

<p>"I am here, it's all right, go on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he went on, climbing that steep Calvary
till the blood flowed back into his heart and
the tension of his nerves relaxed. But it was
the relaxation of despair, the abandonment to
danger, the quiet of the drowning man who
has no more strength to battle with the waves.
When he turned again to the congregation he
did not close his eyes.</p>

<p>"The Lord be with you."</p>

<p>Agnes was there in her place, bent over
the page she never turned, the gilt clasp of
the book shining in the dim light. The servant
was crouching at her feet and all the
other women, including his mother at the
bottom of the church, were sitting back on
their heels on the bare floor, ready to resume
their kneeling position immediately the priest
should move the book.</p>

<p>And he moved the book and went on with
the prayers and the slow gestures of the ritual.
And a feeling of tenderness crept into his
despair at the thought that Agnes was bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
him company on his road to Calvary, as Mary
had followed too, that in another moment
she would mount the altar steps and stand
beside him once again, having overcome their
transgression, to expiate together as together
they had sinned. How could he hate her if
she brought his punishment with her, if her
hatred was only love disguised?</p>

<p>Then came the Communion, and the few
drops of wine went down into his breast like
quickening blood; he felt strong, revived, his
heart filled with the presence of God.</p>

<p>And as he descended the steps towards the
women the figure of Agnes in her seat stood
out prominent amidst the crowd of bowed
heads. She, too, had bowed her head upon
her hands; perhaps she was summoning her
courage before she moved. And suddenly he
felt infinite pity for her; he would have liked
to go down to her and give her absolution,
and administer the Communion as to a dying
woman. He, too, had summoned his courage,
but his hands shook as he held the wafer to
the women's lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Immediately the Communion was ended
an old peasant began to intone a hymn. The
congregation sang the verses after him in
subdued voices, and repeated the antiphons
twice out loud. The hymn was primitive and
monotonous, old as the earliest prayers of man
uttered in forests where as yet scarcely man
dwelt, old and monotonous as the breaking
of waves on a solitary shore; yet that low
singing around her sufficed to bring Agnes's
thoughts back, as though she had been rushing
breathless by night through some primeval
forest and had suddenly emerged upon the
seashore, amidst sandhills covered with sweet
flowers and golden in the light of dawn.</p>

<p>Something stirred in the very depths of
her being, a strange emotion gripped her throat;
she felt the world turning round with her as
though she had been walking head downwards
and now resumed her natural position.</p>

<p>It was her past and the past of all her race
that surged up and took hold of her, with the
singing of the women and the old men, with
the voices of her nurse and her servants, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
men and women who had built and furnished
her house, and ploughed her fields and woven
the linen for her swaddling clothes.</p>

<p>How could she denounce herself before all
these people who looked up to her as their
mistress and held her even purer than the
priest at the altar? And then she, too, felt
the presence of God around her and within
her, even in her passion itself.</p>

<p>She knew very well that the punishment she
meant to inflict upon the man with whom she
had sinned was her own punishment too;
but now a merciful God spoke to her with the
voices of the old men and women and the
innocent children, and bade her beware of her
own self, counselled her to seek salvation.</p>

<p>As her people round her sang the verses
of the hymn, all the days of her solitary life
unrolled themselves before her inward vision.
She saw herself again a little child, then a
young girl, then a grown woman in this same
church, on this same seat blackened and worn
by the elbows and knees of her forefathers.
In a sense the church belonged to her family;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
it had been built by one of her ancestors, and
tradition said that the image of the Madonna
had been captured from Barbary pirates and
brought back to the village by a far-away
grandfather of hers.</p>

<p>She had been born and brought up amidst
these traditions, in an atmosphere of simple
grandeur that kept her aloof from the smaller
people of Aar, yet still in the midst of them,
shut in amongst them like a pearl in its rough
shell.</p>

<p>How could she denounce herself before her
people? But this very feeling of being mistress
even of the sacred building rendered
more insufferable still the presence of the man
who had been her companion in sin, and who
appeared at the altar wearing a mask of saintliness
and bearing the holy vessels in his hands&mdash;tall
and splendid he stood above her as she
knelt at his feet, guilty in that she had loved
him.</p>

<p>Her heart swelled anew with rage and grief
as the hymn rose and fell around her, like a
supplication rising from out some abyss, imploring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
help and justice, and she heard the voice
of God, dark and stern, bidding her drive His
unworthy servant out of His temple.</p>

<p>She grew pale as death and broke into a cold
sweat; her knees shook against the seat, but
she bowed no more and with head erect she
watched the movements of the priest at the
altar. And it was as though some evil breath
went out from her to him, paralysing him,
enveloping him in the same icy grip that held
her fast.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And he felt that mortal breath that emanated
from her will, and just as on bitter winter
mornings, his fingers were frozen and uncontrollable
shivers ran down his spine. When
he turned to give the benediction he saw Agnes
gazing at him. Their eyes met as in a flash,
and like a drowning man he remembered in
that instant all the joy of his life, joy sprung
wholly and solely from love of her, from the
first look of her eyes, the first kiss of her lips.</p>

<p>Then he saw her rise from her seat, book in
hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh God, Thy will be done," he stammered,
kneeling&mdash;and he seemed to be actually in the
Garden of Olives, watching the shadow of an
inexorable fate.</p>

<p>He prayed aloud and waited, and midst the
confused sound of the people's prayers he
thought he could distinguish Agnes's step as
she moved toward the altar.</p>

<p>"She is coming&mdash;she has left her seat, she
is between her seat and the altar. She is
coming ... she is here&mdash;every one is staring
at her. She is at my side!"</p>

<p>The obsession was so strong that the words
failed on his lips. He saw Antiochus, who
had already begun to extinguish the candles,
suddenly turn and look round, and he knew
for certain that she was there, close to him, on
the chancel steps.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, the roof seemed to fall
down upon his head and fracture it; his knees
scarcely upheld him, but with a sudden effort
he managed to get up to the altar again and
take the pyx. And as he turned to enter the
sacristy he saw that Agnes had advanced from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
her seat to the railing and was about to mount
the steps.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, why not let me die?" and he
bowed his head over the pyx as though baring
his neck to the sword that was about to strike
it. But as he entered the sacristy door he
looked again and perceived Agnes bowed
at the altar railing as she knelt on the lowest
step.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She had stumbled at the lowest step outside
the railing, and as though a wall had suddenly
risen up before her, she had dropped on her
knees. A thick mist dimmed her sight and
she could go no further.</p>

<p>Presently the dimness cleared and she could
see the steps again, the yellow carpet before
the altar, the flowers upon the table and the
burning lamp. But the priest had disappeared,
and in his place a ray of sunlight smote obliquely
through the dusk and made a golden patch upon
the carpet.</p>

<p>She crossed herself, rose to her feet and
moved towards the door. The servant followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
her and the old men, the women and the children
turned to smile at her and bless her with
their eyes; she was their mistress, their symbol
of beauty and of faith, so far removed from
them and yet in the midst of them and all
their misery, like a wild rose amongst the
brambles.</p>

<p>At the church door the servant offered her
holy water on the tips of her fingers, and then
stooped to brush off the dust of the altar
steps which still clung to her dress. As the
girl raised herself again she saw the ashen face
of Agnes turned towards the corner where the
priest's mother had knelt through all the
service. Then she saw the mother sitting
motionless on the ground, her head sunk
forward on her breast, her shoulders leaning
against the wall as though she had made a
supreme effort to uphold it in a great collapse.
Noticing the fixed gaze of Agnes and the servant,
a woman also turned to look, then sprang quickly
to the side of the priest's mother, spoke to her
in a whisper and raised her face in her hand.</p>

<p>The mother's eyes were half-closed, glassy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
the pupils upturned; the rosary had dropped
from her hand and her head fell sideways on to
the shoulder of the woman who held her.</p>

<p>"She is dead!" shrieked the woman.</p>

<p>And instantly the whole congregation was
on its feet and crowding to the bottom of the
church.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Paul had gone back into the
sacristy with Antiochus, who was carrying
the book of the Gospel. He was trembling
with cold and with relief; he actually felt as
though he had just escaped from a shipwreck,
and he wanted to energize and walk about to
warm himself and convince himself that it
had all been a bad dream.</p>

<p>Then a confused murmur of voices was heard
in the church, at first low, then growing
quickly louder and louder. Antiochus put
his head out of the sacristy door and saw all
the people collected together at the bottom
of the nave, as though there were some obstruction
at the entrance, but an old man was
already hastening up the chancel steps and
making mysterious signs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"His mother is taken ill," he said.</p>

<p>Paul, still robed in his alb, was down there
at one bound and threw himself on his knees
that he might look more closely into his
mother's face as she lay stretched on the ground,
with her head in a woman's lap and hemmed
in by the pressing crowd.</p>

<p>"Mother, mother!"</p>

<p>The face was still and rigid, the eyes half-closed,
the teeth clenched in the effort not to
cry aloud.</p>

<p>And he knew instantly that she had died of
the shock of that same grief, that same terror
which he had been enabled to overcome.</p>

<p>And he, too, clenched his teeth that he
might not cry aloud when he raised his head;
and across the confused mass of the people
surging round, his eyes met the eyes of Agnes
fixed upon him.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
