<blockquote><p>This is perhaps the finest study of the mind
of a dog ever written. The author is a famous
Austrian novelist, a great stylist, and a man of
extreme delicacy and subtlety of mind. He
studies Bashan with such insight, and describes
what he learnt with such art, that one feels
that no one can ever again penetrate more
deeply into that charming, wistful mystery,
the mind of a dog, and his feeling towards
mankind.</p></blockquote>

<div class="chtitle">  FOREWORD </div>

<p>It was during the war that Thomas Mann,
one of the great modern stylists, wrote this
simple little idyll as a refuge and relief. It
was a flight from the hideous realities of the
world to the deeper realities of Nature,
from the hate and inhumanity of man to
the devotion and lovableness of the brute.
This delectable symphony of human and
canine psychology, of love of nature and
of pensive humour, struck the true note
of universality, a document packed with
greater potencies in this direction than the
deliberate, idealistic manifestos of the pacifists.
It is for these reasons that the book
has acquired a permanent charm, value,
and significance, not only beyond the confines
of the war and the confines of the
author’s own land and language, but also
beyond those of the period.</p>

<p>In every land there still exists the same
friendly and primitive relation between man
and the dog, brought to its fullest expression
of strength and beauty in the environment
of the green world, rural or suburban.</p>

<p>Simple and unpretentious as a statement
by Francis d’Assisi, yet full of a gentle
modern sophistication and humour, this little
work will bring delight and refreshment to
all who seek flight from the heavy-laden
hour. It is, moreover, one of the most
subtle and penetrating studies of the psychology
of the dog that has ever been written—tender
yet unsentimental, realistic and full
of the detail of masterly observation and
description, yet in its final form and precipitation
a work of exquisite literary art.</p>

<div class="chtitle">    BASHAN PUTS IN HIS APPEARANCE </div>


<p>When spring, which all men agree is the
fairest season of the year, comes round
again and happens to do honour to its name,
I love to go for half an hour’s stroll in the
open air before breakfast. I take this stroll
whenever the early chorus of the birds has
succeeded in rousing me betimes—because
I had been wise enough to terminate the
preceding day at a seemly hour. And then
I go walking—hatless—in the spacious avenue
in front of my house, and sometimes in the
parks which are more distant. Before I
capitulate to the day’s work, I long to draw
a few draughts of young morning air and
to taste the joy of the pure early freshness
of things. Standing on the steps which
lead down from my front door, I give a
whistle. This whistle consists of two tones,
a base tone and a deeper quarter-tone—as
though I were beginning the first notes
of the second phrase of Schubert’s unfinished
symphony, a signal which may be regarded
as equal in tonal value to a name of two
syllables.</p>

<p>The very next moment, as I go on
towards the garden gate, a sound is heard
in the distance, a sound at first almost
inaudible, then growing rapidly nearer and
clearer—a sound such as might ensue if a
metal tag were to be set clinking against
the brass trimmings of a leather collar. Then,
as I turn round, I see Bashan curving in
swift career around the corner of the house
and heading for me full tilt as though he
intended to knock me over. His efforts
cause him to shorten his underlip a bit, so
that two or three of his lower front teeth
are laid bare. How splendidly they gleam
in the early sun!</p>

<p>Bashan comes straight from his kennel.
This is situated behind the house under the
floor of the veranda, which is supported on
pillars. It is probable that, after a night
of divers and unknown adventures, he had
been enjoying a short morning doze in
this kennel, until my two-syllabic whistle
roused him to swift activity. This kennel
or miniature hut is equipped with curtains
made of coarse material, and is lined with
straw. Thus it chances that a stray straw
or two may be clinging to Bashan’s coat—already
rather ruffled up from his lying and
stretching—or that one of these refractory
straws may even be left sticking between
his toes. This is a vision which always
reminds me of the old Count Moor in
Schiller’s <i>Robbers</i>—as I once saw him in a
most vivid and imaginative production,
coming out of the Hunger Tower, with a
straw between two of his toes.</p>

<p>Involuntarily I take up a flank position
to the charging Bashan as he comes storming
onward—an attitude of defence—for his
apparent intention of lunging himself between
my feet and laying me low is most amazingly
deceptive. But always at the last moment
and just before the collision, he manages
to put on the brakes and to bring himself
to—something which testifies to his physical
as well as his mental self-control. And
now—without uttering a sound—for Bashan
makes but scant use of his sonorous and
expressive voice—he begins to carry out
a confused dance of welcome and salutation
all about me, a dance consisting of rapid
tramplings, of prodigious waggings—waggings
which are not limited to that member
which is intended for their proper
expression—but which demand tribute of his entire
hindquarters up to his very ribs, furthermore
an annular contraction of his body, as
well as darting, far-flung leaps into the air,
also rotations about his own axis—performances
which, strange to say, he endeavours
to hide from my gaze, for whenever I turn
towards him, he transfers them to the other
side. The very moment, however, I bend
down and stretch out my hand, he is
brought suddenly with a single leap to my
side. There he stands, like a statue, with
his shoulder-blade pressing against my shinbone.
He stands aslant, with his strong
paws braced against the ground, his face
uplifted towards mine, so that he peers into
my eyes from below and in a reversed direction.
His stillness whilst I pat his shoulder
and mutter friendly words, breathes forth
the same concentration and emotion as the
preceding delirium.</p>

<p>He is a short-haired setter—if you will
not take this designation too sternly and
strictly, but with a grain of salt. For
Bashan cannot really claim to be a setter
such as are described in books—a setter in
accordance with the most meticulous laws
and decrees. He is perhaps a trifle too
small for this—for he is somewhat under
the size of a full-fledged setter. And then
his legs are not quite straight, but somewhat
disposed to bend outward, a condition of
things which would also be scarcely in
accordance with the ideal of a Simon-pure
breed.</p>

<p>The slight disposition to dewlaps or
“wattles,” that is, to those folds of skin
about the neck which are capable of lending
a dog such a dignified expression, becomes
him admirably, though it is certain that
this feature would also be objected to as a
flaw by implacable experts on breeding,
for I am told that in this species of dog the
skin should lie close and firm about the
throat.</p>

<p>Bashan’s colouring is very beautiful. His
coat is a rusty brown in the ground colour,
striped with black. But there are also
considerable mixtures of white. These predominate
on the chest, the paws, and the
belly. His entire nose, which is very short,
seems to be painted black. This black and
rusty brown makes a pretty velvety pattern
on his broad skull as well as on his cool
ear-laps. One of his most edifying external
features is the whorl, tuft or tassel into which
the white hair on his chest twists itself and
which sticks out like the spike on certain
ancient armour. To be sure, one of his
rather arbitrary glories—the colour of his
hair—might also appear a dubious point to
those who rate racial laws higher than the
values of personality. It is possible that the
classic setter should be monochrome or
decorated with shaded or toned spots, and
not, like Bashan, with tiger-like stripes.
But the most emphatic warning against
classifying Bashan in any rigid or iron-clad
category, is a certain drooping manner of
the hirsute appendages about the corners of
his mouth and the underside of his jaws,
features which might not incorrectly be
designated as a kind of bristling moustache
and goatee—features which, if you will
rivet your eye upon them from near or far,
will remind you of a <i>griffon</i> or an Airedale
terrier!	</p>

<p>But what odds?—setter or pointer or
terrier—Bashan is a fine and handsome
animal. Look at him as he leans rigidly
against my knee and looks up at me with a
profound and concentrated devotion! His
eye, ah, his eye! is beautiful, soft, and wise,
even though a trifle glassy and protuberant.
The iris is a rusty brown—of the same
colour as his coat, though it forms only a
small ring in consequence of the tremendous
expanse of the black mirrors of the pupils.
On the outer periphery the colour blends
into the white of the eye, swimming in it,
as it were. The expression of his face, an
expression of reasonable cheerfulness, proclaims
the fine masculinity of his moral
nature, which is reflected physically in the
structure of his body. The vaulted chest,
beneath whose smooth, supple, and clinging
skin the ribs show powerfully, the drawn-in
haunches, the nervous, clear-veined legs,
the strong and well-shaped paws—all proclaim
a brave heart and much virile virtue—proclaim
peasant blood—hunting blood.
Yes, there can be no doubt of it—the hunter
and the tracker dominate prodigiously in
Bashan’s education. He is a bona-fide setter—if
you must know—even though he may
not owe his existence to some snobbish bit
of blue-blooded inbreeding. And this perhaps
is what I would imply by the rather
confused and unrelated words which I
address to him whilst patting him on the
shoulder-blade.</p>

<p>He stands and stares, listening intently to
the tone of my voice. He finds that this
tone is full of accents which decidedly
approve of his existence, something which I
am at pains to emphasise in my speech.
And suddenly, with an upward lunge of
the head and a swift opening and shutting
of his jaws, he makes a snap towards my
face, as though he intended to bite off my
nose, a bit of pantomime that is obviously
meant to be an answer to my remarks and
which invariably throws me backward in a
sudden recoil, laughing—as Bashan well
knows. He intends this to be a kind of
air-kiss, half tenderness, half mischievousness—a
manœuvre which has been peculiar to
him from puppyhood on—I had never
observed it in the case of any of his predecessors.
Moreover, he at once begs pardon
for the liberty he has taken by waggings,
short abrupt bows and an embarrassed air.
And then we pass out of the garden-gate
into the open.</p>

<p>We are now invested with a sound of
rushing and roaring as of the sea. For
my house fronts almost directly on the
River Isar “rolling rapidly” as in the
famous lines by Campbell, and foaming
over flat terraces in its bed. We are
separated from it only by the rows of
poplars, by a strip of fenced-in grass which
is planted with young maples and an elevated
road which is fringed by great aspens,
giants which conduct themselves in the
same bizarre manner as willows and snow
up the whole region with their white, seed-bearing
fluff at the beginning of June.
Up river, towards the city, I see a detachment
of pioneers practising the building of
a pontoon bridge. The thudding of their
heavy boots upon the boards and the shouts
of their officers echo across the stream.
From the farther bank there come sounds
of industrial activity, for yonder, at some
distance down-stream from the house, there
is a locomotive plant working under increased
pressure—in accordance with the times. The
tall windows of this great brick shed glow
through the darkness at all hours of the
night. New and beautifully lacquered
engines hurry to and fro on their trial
trips, a steam siren occasionally lets its heady
howl be heard, a dull, thunderous pother
makes the air quiver from time to time, and
from the throats of several stacks the smoke
creams darkly forth. This, however, is
driven away by a kindly-disposed wind
towards the distant tracts of woods, so that
it seldom rolls across the river. Thus in
the suburban, semi-rural solitude of this
region, the whisperings of contemplative
nature mingle with those of human activity.
Over all lies the blank-eyed freshness of the
morning hour.</p>

<p>According to the daylight-saving law,
the time might be half-past seven when I
take my walk; in reality it is half-past
six. With arms crossed behind my back
I stroll through the tender sunshine down
the poplar-lined avenue, barred by the long
shadows of the trees. From here I cannot
see the river, but its broad and even flow is
audible. There is a soft whispering in the
trees, the penetrating twittering, fluting,
chirping, and sob-like trill of the songbirds
fills the air. Under the moist blue heavens
an aeroplane coming from the east, a stark
mechanical bird with a roaring voice, now
swelling, and now softly ebbing away, steers
its independent way across land and river,
and Bashan delights my eye with beautiful
leaps at full length to and fro across the low
fence of the grass plot to the left.</p>

<p>Bashan is jumping because he actually
knows that I take pleasure in his jumping.
Often by means of calls and knockings
upon the fence, have I encouraged him in
it and praised him when he had fulfilled my
wishes. And now, too, he comes after
almost every jump so that I may tell him
that he is a daring and elegant fence-vaulter,
at which he also ventures a jump or two
towards my face and beslobbers my thrust-out,
defensive arm with the slaver of his
mouth. These exercises, however, he likewise
intends to be a kind of gymnastic
morning toilet, for he smooths his ruffled
coat by means of these athletic movements
and rids himself of the straws which had
disfigured it.</p>

<p>It is good thus to go walking in the
morning, the senses rejuvenated, the spirit
purged by the healing bath and long Lethean
draught of the night. You look upon the
day that lies before you, regard it with
strong, serene confidence, but you hesitate
lazily to begin it—you are master of an
unusually free and unburdened span of time
lying between the dream and the day, your
reward for the good use you have made of
your time. The illusion that you are leading
a life that is constant, simple, undissipated
and benignly introspective, the illusion that
you belong utterly to yourself, renders you
happy. Man is disposed to regard his case
or condition of the moment, be this glad or
troubled, peaceful or passionate, for the true,
essential, and permanent aspect of his life,
and above all is in fancy inclined to elevate
every happy <i>ex tempore</i> to a radiant rule and
an unbreakable habit, whereas he is really
condemned to live by improvisation, from
hand to mouth, so to speak.</p>

<p>So, drawing in deep breaths of the morning
air, you believe in your freedom and in
your worth, though you ought to be aware,
and at heart <i>are</i> aware, that the world is
holding its snares ready to entangle you in
them, and that in all probability you will
again be lying in bed until nine to-morrow
morning, because you had got into it at
two the night before, heated, befogged, and
full of passionate debate. . . . Well, so be
it. To-day you are the man of sobriety and
the dew-clad early hour, the right royal
lord of that mad hunter yonder who is
just making another jump across the fence
out of sheer joy that you are apparently
content to live this day with him and not
waste it upon the world you have left behind
you.</p>

<p>We follow the tree-lined avenue for about
five minutes, to that point where it ceases
to be a road and becomes a coarse desert of
gravel parallel to the course of the river.
We turn our backs upon this and strike
into a broad, finely-gravelled street which,
like the poplar-lined road, is equipped with
a cycle-path, but is still void of houses.
This leads to the right, between low-lying
allotments of wooded land, towards the
declivity which bounds our river-banks—Bashan’s
field of action towards the east.</p>

<p>We cross another street of an equally
futuristic nature, which runs openly between
the woods and the meadows, and which,
farther up in the direction of the city and
the tram-stop, is lined with a compact mass
of flats. A slanting pebble path leads us
to a prettily arranged dingle, almost like a
<i>kurgarten</i> to the eye, but void of all
humanity, like the entire district at this
hour. There are benches along the rounded
walks—which enlarge themselves here and
there to <i>rondels</i> or to trim playgrounds for
the children and to spacious planes of grass
on which are growing old and well-formed
trees with deep pendant crowns, revealing
only a short stretch of trunk above the
grass. There are elms, beeches, limes, and
silvery willows in parklike groups. I find
great pleasure in this carefully-groomed
park, in which I could not wander more
undisturbed, if it were my own. It is perfect
and complete. The gravel paths which
curve down and around the gentle, sloping
lawns, are even equipped with stone gutters.
And there are far and pleasing glimpses
between all this greenery, the architecture
of a few villas which peer in from both
sides and form the background.</p>

<p>Here for a little while, I stroll to and fro
upon the walks, whilst Bashan, his body
inclined in a centrifugal plane, and drunk
with joy of the fetterless unlimited space
about him, executes gallopades criss and
cross and head over heels upon the smooth
grassy surfaces. Or else with barkings
wherein indignation and pleasure mix and
mingle, he pursues some bird, which, either
bewitched by fear or out of sheer mischief,
flutters along always a few inches in front
of his open jaws. But no sooner do I sit
down upon a bench than he comes and
takes up a position on my foot. It is one
of the immutable laws of his life that he
will run about only when I myself am in
motion, and that as soon as I sit down he
too should become inactive. The necessity
for this is not quite obvious, but to
Bashan it is as the laws of the Medes and
Persians.</p>

<p>It is quaint, cosy, and amusing to feel him
sitting upon my foot and penetrating it with
the feverish glow of his body. A sense of
gaiety and sympathy fills my bosom, as
always when I am abandoned to him and
to his idea of things. His manner of sitting
is a bit peasant-like, a bit uncouth—with his
shoulder-blades turned outward and his paws
turned in, irregularly. In this position his
figure appears smaller and stockier than it
really is, and the white whorl of hair upon
his chest is thrust into comic prominence.
But his head is thrown back in the most
dignified manner and redeems his disregard
for a fine pose by virtue of the intense
concentrated attention it displays.</p>

<p>It is so quiet that both of us remain
absolutely still. The rushing of the water
reaches us only in a subdued murmur.
Under such conditions the tiny secret activities
in our immediate world take on a
particular importance and preoccupy the
senses,—the brief rustling of a lizard, the
note of a bird, the burrowing of a mole
in the ground. Bashan’s ears are erected, in
so far as the muscular structure of flapping
ears admits of this. He cocks his head in
order to intensify his sense of hearing. And
the nostrils of his moist black nose are in
incessant and sensitive motion, responsive
to innumerable subtle reactions.</p>

<p>He then lies down once more, being
careful, however, to maintain his contact
with my foot. He is lying in a profile
position, in the ancient, well-proportioned,
animalistic, idol-like attitude of the sphinx,
with elevated head and breast, his thighs
pressed close to his body, his paws extended
in front of him. He is overheated, so he
opens his jaws, a manœuvre which causes
the concentrated cleverness of his expression
to pass into the purely bestial. His
eyes twinkle and narrow to mere slits,
and between his white and strong triangular
teeth a long, rose-red tongue lolls
forth.</p>




<div class="titlepagemediumjoined">  HOW WE ACQUIRED BASHAN </div>




<h2 id="CH2">  CHAPTER II </h2>


<div class="chtitle">     HOW WE ACQUIRED BASHAN </div>


<p>It was a short, buxom, dark-eyed young
woman who, with the help of her equally
sturdy and dark-eyed daughter, keeps a
hillside tavern not far from the Bavarian
mountain resort called Tolz, who acted as
go-between in the business of our making
Bashan’s acquaintance and then acquiring
him. That is over two years ago and he
was only half a year old at the time.
Anastasia—this is the name of mine hostess—knew
that we had been compelled to have our
Percy shot—he was a Scotch collie, a harmless,
somewhat weak-minded aristocrat, who
had been visited in his old age by a painful
and disfiguring skin disease—and that for
over a year we had been without a faithful
guardian. She therefore rang us up from
her perch in the hills and told us that she
was boarding a dog who was sure to suit
us to a dot, and that he was to be seen at
any time.</p>

<p>The children coaxed and urged, and as
the curiosity of their elders was scarcely
less than their own, we all sallied forth the
very next afternoon to climb the heights
where Anastasia’s tavern lay. We found
her in her roomy kitchen which was filled
with warm and succulent vapours. There
she stood with her round bare forearms and
her dress open at the throat, with her face
rosy and shiny, preparing the evening meal
for her boarders, whilst her daughter, busily
but quietly going to and fro, lent assistance.
We were given a pleasant greeting, and the
fact that we had not postponed our visit
but had come to attend to business without
delay, was favourably commented upon.
In answer to our inquisitive glances, Resi,
the daughter, steered us toward the kitchen
table. Here she bent down, placed her
hands upon her knees, and directed a few
flattering and encouraging words under the
table. There, tied to a table-leg with a
frazzled rope, stood a creature of whom we
had until then been unaware in the smouldering
half-light of this kitchen. It was a
vision, however, which would have induced
any one to burst into peals of pitying
laughter.</p>

<p>There he stood on long, knock-kneed
legs, his tail between them, his four feet
close together, his back arched. He was
trembling. It is possible that he was trembling
out of fear, but one had the impression
that it was due to a lack of flesh and fat.
For the little apparition before us was a
mere skeleton, a chest with a spinal column
covered with rough hair and supported on
four sticks. He had drawn back his ears,
a muscular manœuvre which, of course,
immediately extinguishes every gleam of
intelligent cheerfulness in a dog’s physiognomy.
This effect in his still so childish
face was so extreme that it expressed nothing
but stupidity and misery as well as an
insistent plea for consideration. There was
also the fact to consider that the appendage
which one might now call his goatee was at
that time still more developed in relation
to the rest of his face, something which
gave to the aggregate woebegoneness of
his appearance a trace of sour hypochondria.</p>

<p>We all bent down to address comforting
and coaxing words to this picture of
misery. Anastasia, from her post in front
of the stove, mingled her remarks with
the rapturous and pitying exclamations
of the children, and retailed information
as to the personality of her boarder. His
name, she declared in her pleasant and
even voice, was, for the time being,
Lux. He was the son of most respectable
parents. She was personally acquainted
with his mother, and as for his father she
had heard nothing but good of him. Lux
was born on a farm at Huglfing, and it
was only owing to special circumstances
that his owners were willing to sell him
so cheaply. For that reason they had
brought him to the tavern—in view of the
lively traffic there. They had come in a
small wagon and Lux had gallantly trotted
the whole twenty kilometres, between the
hind wheels. She had at once thought of
us, for she knew we were looking for a
good dog, and she felt quite certain that we
could not help taking him. If we could
decide upon taking him at once, it would
be a fine thing all round. She was sure that
we would have great joy of him, and as for
him, he would no longer be alone in the
world, but have a cosy berth, and she,
Anastasia, would cease to worry about
him. We ought, however, not to be prejudiced
against him because of the faces he
was now making. He was a bit cowed at
present and not sure of himself, because
of the strange surroundings. But we
would soon see that he had a fine
pedigree, that his parents were excellent
stock.</p>

<p>Yes, we objected, but it was clear—was it
not—that these parents of his had not been
well matched?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, they had, and both of them were
a fine breed, too! She, Anastasia, would
guarantee that his points were all good. He
was also unspoiled and very moderate in
his demands—something which was worth
a good deal in such lean times as these. Up
to the present he had supported himself
entirely on potato-skins. She suggested
that we take him home first, on probation,
as it were. We were under no obligation
at all. In case we did not like him she
would take him back and return the small
sum we had paid. She was not afraid to
say this—not afraid that we might take her
at her word. For knowing us as she did, and
knowing <i>him</i>, too—both parties to the bargain—she
was convinced that we should learn
to love him and never think of ever giving
him up again.</p>

<p>She said a good deal more in this vein—quietly,
glowingly, and amiably—the while
she negotiated things on the stove, with the
flames at times shooting up magically in
front of her. And finally she came herself
and with both hands opened Lux’s mouth
in order to show us his fine teeth and for
some mysterious reason also the rosy and
riffled roof of his mouth.</p>

<p>Upon our asking, with professional air,
whether he had already had the mange, she
replied with a slight show of impatience,
that she did not know. And as to his size
when he had finally stopped growing?—well,
she declared with a smart promptness,
this would be exactly that of our deceased
Percy. There was a good deal more of
talk to and fro, a good deal of warm-hearted
encouragement on the part of Anastasia,
reinforced by pleas from the children, and
a good deal of half-conquered irresolution
on our part. We finally begged leave to
be permitted to consider the matter for a
short time, and this was graciously granted
us. And so we descended to the valley,
thoughtfully rehearsing and ruminating upon
our impressions.</p>

<p>That bit of four-legged misery under the
table had naturally captured the hearts of
the children, and we grown-ups attempted
in vain to smile away their lack of taste
and judgment. We, too, felt a tugging at
our hearts and realised all too clearly that
we should be hard put to it to banish the
vision of the unfortunate Lux from our
memories. What was to become of him?—if
we turned away in contumely? Into
whose—into what hands would he fall?
A terrible and mysterious figure arose in
our phantasies: the knacker in his flaying-house,
from whose loathsome attentions we
had once saved Percy by means of a few
chivalrous bullets from the rifle of a gamekeeper
and the honourable burial-place we
had given him at the edge of our garden.
If we were minded to leave Lux to an unknown
and possibly ghastly fate we should
not have been so careless as to make his
acquaintance, and to look upon his childish
face with the goatee. But now that we were
aware of his existence, a responsibility seemed
laid upon us which we could dispute only
with difficulty and with forced, half-hearted
denials.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the third day
following saw us once more climbing up
that gentle spur of the lower Alps. It was
not that we had already decided upon the
acquisition of Lux. But we saw that
things being as they were, it was not
likely that the matter would have any other
outcome.</p>

<p>This time we found Anastasia and her
daughter sitting opposite each other at the
kitchen-table and drinking coffee. Between
them, in front of the table, sat he who bore
the preliminary name of Lux—sat as he is
still accustomed to sit to-day, his shoulder-blades
twisted like a yokel’s, his paws turned
in. Under his worn leather collar there
was a little nosegay of wild-flowers which
decidedly augmented his appearance and
lent it something festive, like that of an
enterprising village youth on a Sunday or
the bridegroom at a country wedding. The
young hostess, who herself made a neat
and pretty appearance in her peasant costume
with its laced velvet bodice, had furbished
him out in this fashion in order to celebrate
his entry into his new home—as she put it.
And mother and daughter both assured us
that they had been absolutely certain that
we should come again to fetch Lux, and
that they knew that we should come today.</p>

<p>Thus all further controversy and debate
proved to be impossible, in fact, precluded
almost before we had entered. In her own
pleasant way, Anastasia thanked us for the
purchase-money which we handed to her
and which amounted to ten marks. It was
clear that she had imposed this price upon
us more in our own interests than in hers,
or those of the farmer-folk who had Lux
to sell—that is, she felt that it was necessary
to give a positive, computable value to poor
Lux in our eyes. This we understood and
gladly paid the tribute. Lux was detached
from his table-leg, the end of the rope
handed over to me, and thus we passed over
the threshold of Anastasia’s kitchen, our
procession attended by the most friendly
wishes and congratulations.</p>

<p>It was, however, not a triumphal procession
which proceeded on the hour’s march
towards home with our new household companion—the
less so since our bridegroom
soon lost his nosegay. It is true that we read
amusement and also mocking and derogatory
depreciation in the glances of the people we
met, the opportunities for which became
multiplied as we made our way through
the market place—longitudinally. To cap
everything we soon discovered that Lux was
suffering from a disorder of the bowels,
apparently a chronic one, something which
forced us to make frequent halts under the
cynical eyes of the townspeople. We formed
a protective circle and hid his internal misery
from rude eyes, and solemnly asked ourselves
whether it was not, after all, the
mange which was thus displaying its most
sinister symptoms? But this anxiety was
uncalled-for, as the future proved to us,
for we soon saw that we had to deal with a
sound and hearty constitution which has
proved itself proof against plagues and distempers
up to this very moment.</p>

<p>As soon as we reached home, the servant-maids
were called forth, so that they might
make acquaintance with this new addition
to the family and also deliver their humble
judgment upon him. We saw that they had
been prepared to express admiration, but
after they had caught sight of him and read
our own vacillating and uncertain looks,
they broke into rude laughter, turned their
backs upon him of the rueful countenance,
and made motions of rejection in his direction.
Confirmed by this in our doubt as
to whether they would fully appreciate the
humanitarian nature of the small fee which
Anastasia had demanded, we declared that
the dog had been presented to us. And then
we led Lux to the veranda and set before
him a welcoming feast composed of liberal
scraps of considerable content.</p>

<p>But his timidity caused him to reject
all this. He sniffed, to be sure, at the titbits
which he was invited to consume, but stood
aside shy and incapable of bringing himself
to the pitch of believing that all these cheese-rinds
and chicken-bones were really intended
for him. On the other hand, he did not
reject the sack which we had stuffed with
seaweed and which we had made ready
upon the floor for his comfort. And there
he lay down with his paws tucked under
him, whilst we retired to the inner rooms
and consulted as to the name which he
was finally to bear through all the years to
come.</p>

<p>He still refused to eat on the following
day. Then followed a period during which
he devoured indiscriminately everything that
came within the radius of his jaws, until he
attained the necessary degree of quiet regularity
and critical dignity in matters of diet.
The process of his domiciling and civic
habitation should be described in some bold
and spacious manner. I shall not lose
myself in a too meticulous portrayal of this
process. It suffered an interruption through
the temporary disappearance of Bashan.
The children had led him into the garden
and they had taken off the rope in order to
give him freedom of action. During an
unguarded moment he had escaped into
the vastness of the outer world through the
gap left between the lower part of the gate
and the gravel path. His disappearance
aroused grief and consternation—at least
among the master and mistresses of the
house, for the servants were disposed to
make light of the loss of a gift-dog, if they
really regarded it as a loss at all.</p>

<p>The telephone began to play tempestuously
between our domain and Anastasia’s
mountain caravanserai, at which we hopefully
adjudged him to be. But in vain,
he had not shown himself there. Two days
heavy with care went by, and then Anastasia
reported that she had received tidings from
Huglfing that Lux had appeared at the
parental farm an hour and a half ago. He
was there, no denying it—the idealism of
his instinct had drawn him back to the world
of potato-parings. And in lonely one-day
marches, facing all kinds of wind and
weather, he had covered the twenty kilometres
which he had once travelled between
the wheels of the farm wagon. And so
his former owners were obliged to hitch
up this vehicle in order to deliver the
fugitive home-comer into Anastasia’s hands
once more. Two more days rolled by and
then we again went forth to bring home
the errant one. We found him fastened as
before to the table-leg, unkempt and gaunt
and splashed with the mud of the country
roads. To be sure, he gave signs of recognition
and of joy as he caught sight of us.
But why then had he left us?</p>

<p>There came a time when it was clear that
he had rid his mind of the charms of the
farm, but had not yet fully taken root with
us, so that his soul was masterless and like
to a leaf that is set tumbling about by the
wind. During this period it was necessary
to keep a sharp eye on him whilst out walking,
for he was all too prone to tear asunder
unperceived the weak band of sympathy
that bound us, and in a grand burst of
independent living to lose himself in the
woods—where he would certainly have
reverted to the condition of his savage
forbears. Our solicitude preserved him from
this sinister destiny. We strove to keep him
on that high moral level which his kind had
achieved at the side of man during thousands
of years of association in common. And
then a radical change of residence—our
removal to the city, or rather its suburbs—led
to his becoming wholly dependent upon
us and entering upon an intimate connection
with our household life.</p>





<div class="titlepagemediumjoined">    REGARDING BASHAN’S CHARACTER </div>




<h2 id="CH3">     CHAPTER III </h2>


<div class="chtitle">A FEW ITEMS REGARDING BASHAN’S
                     CHARACTER AND MANNER OF LIFE </div>


<p>A man in the Valley of the Isar had told
me that dogs of this species might become
obnoxious, for they were always anxious
to be with the master. I was therefore
warned against accepting the tenacious faithfulness
which Bashan soon began to display
towards me as all too personal in its origin.
On the other hand, this made it easier for
me to discourage it a little—in so far as this
may, in self-defence, have been necessary.
We have to deal here with a remote and
long-derived patriarchal instinct of the dog
which determines him—at least so far as
the more manly, open-air loving breeds are
concerned—to regard and honour the man,
the head of the house and the family, as
the master, the protector of the home, the
lord, and to find the goal and meaning of
his existence in a peculiar relationship of
loyal vassal-friendship, and in the maintenance
of a far greater spirit of independence
towards the other members of the
family. It was this spirit that Bashan manifested
towards me from the very beginning.
His eyes followed me about with a manly
trustfulness shining in them. He seemed
to be asking for commands which he might
fulfil but which I chose not to give, since
obedience was not one of his strong points.
He clung to my heels with the visible conviction
that his inseparability from me was
something firmly rooted in the sacred nature
of things.</p>

<p>It went without saying that in the family
circle he would lie down only at <i>my</i> feet
and never at any one else’s. It went equally
without saying that in case I should separate
from the others when out walking and
pursue my own ways, he should join me
and follow <i>my</i> footsteps. He also insisted
upon my company when I was working,
and when he chanced to find the door that
gave upon the garden closed, he would
come vaulting in through the window with
startling suddenness, whereby a good deal
of gravel would come rattling in upon the
floor, and then with a sob and a sigh he
would throw himself under my desk.</p>

<p>But there is a reverence which we pay to
life and to living things which is too vigilant
and keen not to be violated even by a dog’s
presence when we feel the need of being
alone, and it was then that Bashan always
disturbed me in the most tangible fashion.
He would step up to my chair, wag his tail,
look at me with devouring glances, and keep
up an incessant trampling. The slightest
receptive or approving movement on my
part would result in his climbing up on the
arm-rests of the chair, and glueing himself
against my chest, in order to force me to
laugh by the air-kisses which he kept lunging
in my direction. And then he would proceed
to an investigation of the top of my desk,
assuming, no doubt, that something edible
was to be found there, since I was so often
caught bending over it. And then his
broad and hairy paws would smear or blur
the wet ink of my manuscript.</p>

<p>Called sharply to account, he would lie
down once more and fall asleep. But no
sooner was he asleep than he would begin
to dream, during which he would execute
the movements of running with all his four
feet stretched out, at the same time giving
vent to a clear yet subdued ventriloquistic
barking which sounded as if it came from
another world. That this had a disturbing
and distracting effect upon me need surprise
no one, for, first of all, it was eerie, and then
it stirred and burdened my conscience. This
dream-life was all too clearly an artificial
substitute for the real chase, the real hunt,
and was prepared for him by his nature,
because in his common life with me, the
happiness of unrestrained movement in the
open did not devolve upon him in that
measure which his blood and his instincts
demanded. This came home to me very
strongly, but as it was not to be altered, it
was necessary that my moral disquietude
should be dispelled by an appeal to other
and higher interests. This led me to affirm
that he brought a great deal of mud into
the room during bad weather, and moreover,
that he tore the carpets with his claws.
Hence, as a matter of principle, he was
forbidden to remain in the house or to bear
me company as long as I chanced to be in
the house—even though occasional exceptions
were made. He understood this law
at once and submitted to the unnatural
prohibition, since it was precisely this which
expressed in itself the inscrutable will of
the master and lord of the house.</p>

<p>For this remoteness from me, which often
continues, especially in the winter, for the
greater part of the day, is merely a matter
of being away—no actual separation or
lack of connection. He is no longer with
me—by my orders—but then that is merely
the carrying-out of an order, after all a
kind of negative being-with-me, as he would
say. As for any independent life which
Bashan might lead without me during these
hours—that is not to be thought of. Through
the glass door of my study I see him disporting
in a clumsy, uncle-like manner with
the children on the small patch of grass in
front of the house. But constantly he comes
running up to the door, and as he cannot see
me through the muslin curtain which
stretches across the pane, he sniffs at the
crack between door and jamb so as to
assure himself of my presence, and then
sits down on the steps with his back turned
towards the room, mounting guard. From
my writing-table I can also see him moving
at a thoughtful trot between the old aspens
on the elevated highway yonder. But such
promenades are merely a tepid pastime
devoid of pride, joy, and life. And it
would be unutterably unthinkable that
Bashan should take to devoting himself to
the glorious pleasures of the chase upon his
own account, even though no one would
hinder him from doing this, and my presence,
as will be shown later, would not be particularly
favourable towards such an objective.</p>

<p>He begins to live only when I go forth—though,
alas, he cannot always be said to
begin life even then! For after I leave the
house the question is whether I am going
to turn towards the right, that is, down the
avenue that leads into the open and to the
solitude of our hunting-grounds, or towards
the left in the direction of the tram station
in order to ride to the city and into the great
and spacious world. It is only in the first
instance that Bashan finds that there is any
sense in accompanying me. At first he joined
me after I had chosen the great and spacious
world, regarded with vast astonishment
the car as it came thundering on, and,
forcibly suppressing his shyness, made a
blind and loyal jump upon the platform,
directly amongst the passengers. But the
storm of public indignation swept him off
again, and so he resolved to go galloping
alongside the roaring vehicle—which bore
so little resemblance to the farm wagon
between the wheels of which he had once
trotted. Faithfully he kept step as long as
this was possible, and his wind would no
doubt have held out too. But being a son
of the upland farm, he was lost in the traffic
of the metropolis; he got between people’s
legs, strange dogs made flank attacks upon
him; a tumult of wild odours such as he
had never before experienced, vexed and
confused his senses; house-corners, impregnated
with the essences of old adventures,
lured him irresistibly. He remained behind,
and though he once more overtook the wagon
on rails, this proved to be a wrong one,
even though it exactly resembled the right
one. Bashan ran blindly in the wrong
direction, lost himself more and more in
the disconcerting strangeness of the world.
And it was more than two days before he
came home, starved and limping—to that
last house along the river to which his
master had also been sensible enough to
return in the meantime.</p>

<p>This happened two or three times, then
Bashan finally gave up accompanying me
when I turned towards the left. He knows
instantly what I intend to do as soon as I
emerge from the doorway of the house—make
a trip to the hunting-grounds or a
trip to the great world. He jumps up from
the door-mat upon which he has been awaiting
my coming forth under the protecting
arch of the entrance. He jumps up and at
the same moment he sees what my intentions
are. My clothing betrays these to him, the
cane that I carry, also my attitude and
expression, the cool and preoccupied look I
give him, or the irritation and challenge in
my eyes. He understands. Headlong he
plunges down the steps and goes dancing
before me in swift and sudden bounds and
full of excitement towards the gate when
my going forth seems to be certain. But
when he beholds hope vanish, he subsides
within himself, lays his ears close to his
head and his eyes take on that expression
of shy misery which is found in contrite
sinners—that look which misfortune begets
in the eyes of men and also of animals.</p>

<p>At times he is really unable to believe
what he sees and knows, that it is all up
and that there is no use hoping for a hunt.
His desires have been too intense. He
repudiates the signs and symbols—chooses
not to see the city walking-stick, the careful
citified clothes I am wearing. He pushes
through the gate with me, switches around
outside in a half turn, and seeks to draw
me towards the right by starting to gallop
in this direction and by turning his head
towards me, forces himself to overlook the
fateful No which I oppose to his efforts.
He comes back when I actually do turn
towards the left, accompanies me, snorting
deeply, and ejaculating short, confused high
notes which seem to arise from the tremendous
tension in his interior, as I walk
along the fence of the garden, and then he
begins to jump back and forth over the
pickets of the adjacent public park. These
pickets are rather high, and he groans a
little in his flight through the air out of
fear lest he hurt himself. He makes these
leaps impelled by a kind of desperate gaiety,
scornful of all hard facts, and also to bribe
me, to work upon my sympathies by his
cleverness. For it is not yet quite <i>impossible</i>—however
improbable it may seem—that I
may nevertheless leave the city path at the
end of the park, once more turn towards
the left and lead him on to liberty—even if
only by way of the slightly roundabout
way to the post-box. This happens, it is
true, but it happens only rarely. Once this
hope has dissolved into empty air, Bashan
settles down upon his haunches and lets
me go my way.</p>

<p>There he sits now, in yokel-like, ungraceful
attitude, in the very middle of the road,
and stares after my retreating form, down
the whole long vista. If I turn my head,
he pricks up his ears, but does not follow
me. Nor would he follow me if I should
call or whistle—he knows this would all
be to no purpose. Even from the very end
of the avenue I can see him still sitting
there, a small, dark, awkward shape in the
middle of the highroad. A pang goes
through my heart—I mount the tram with
an uneasy conscience. He has waited so
long and so patiently—and who does not know
what torture waiting can be! His whole
life is nothing but waiting—for the next
walk in the open—and this waiting begins
as soon as he has rested after his last run.
During the night, too, he waits, for his
slumbers are distributed throughout the entire
twenty-four hours of the sun’s revolution,
and many a siesta upon the smooth lawn,
whilst the sun beats upon his coat, or behind
the curtains of his hut, must help to shorten
the bare and empty spaces of the day. His
nocturnal rest is therefore dismembered and
without unity. He is driven by blind
impulses hither and thither in the darkness,
through the yard and the garden—he runs
from place to place—and waits. He waits
for the recurrent visit of the local watchman
with the lantern, the heavy thud of whose
footfall he accompanies against his own
better knowledge with a terrible burst of
heralding barks. He waits for the paling
of the heavens, the crowing of the cock in
the near-by nursery-garden, the stir of the
morning wind in the trees, and for the
unlocking of the kitchen entrance, so that
he may slip in and warm himself at the
white-tiled range.</p>

<p>But I believe that the torture of this
nightly vigil is mild, compared to that which
Bashan must endure in the broad of day,
particularly when the weather is fair, be it
winter or summer, when the sun lures into
the open, and the desire for violent motion
tugs in every muscle, and his master, without
whom, of course, there can be no real enjoyment,
persistently refuses to leave his seat
behind the glass door.</p>

<p>Bashan’s mobile little body, through which
life pulsates so swiftly and feverishly, has
been, so to speak, exhausted with rest—and
there can be no thought of sleep. Up
he comes to the terrace in front of my door,
drops himself in the gravel with a sob
which comes from the very depths of his
being, and lays his head upon his paws,
turning up his eyes with a martyr’s expression
towards heaven. This, however, lasts
only a few seconds, the new position irks
him at once, he feels it to be untenable.
There is still one thing he can do. He may
descend the steps and pay attention to a
small tree trimmed in the shape of a rose-tree
and flanking the beds of roses, an
unfortunate tree which, owing to these
visits of Bashan, dwindles away every year
and must be replanted. There he stands
on three legs, melancholy and contemplative—the
slave of a habit, whether urged by
Nature or not. Then he reverts to his
four legs, and is no better off than before.
Dumbly he gazes aloft into the branches
of a group of ash-trees. Two birds are
flitting from bough to bough with lively
twitterings—he watches feathered ones
dashing away swift as arrows, and turns
aside, seeming to shrug his shoulders at so
much childish <i>élan</i> of life.</p>

<p>He stretches and strains as though he
intended to tear himself asunder. This
undertaking, for the sake of thoroughness,
he divides into two parts: first of all, he
stretches his front legs, lifting his hindquarters
into the air, and then exercises these by
stretching his hind legs far behind him.
He yawns tremendously both times, with
wide, red-gaping jaws and upcurled tongue.
Well, now he has also achieved this—the
performance cannot be carried on any
further, and having once stretched yourself
according to all the rules of the game, it
is inconceivable that you should immediately
repeat the manœuvre. So Bashan stands
and gazes at the ground. Then he begins
to turn himself slowly and searchingly about
his own axis as though he wished to lie down
and were not as yet certain as to the way
in which this should be done. He changes
his mind, however, and goes with lazy step
to the middle of the lawn, where with a
sudden, almost convulsive movement, he
hurls himself upon his back in order to cool
and scour this by a lively rolling hither and
thither upon the mown surface of grass.</p>

<p>This must induce a mighty feeling of bliss,
for stiffly he draws up his paws as he rolls
and snaps into the air in all directions in a
tumult of joy and satisfaction. All the more
passionately he drains this rapture to the
very dregs in that he knows that it is purely
a fleeting rapture, and that one cannot very
well wallow in this fashion more than ten
seconds, and that that beneficent weariness
which comes to one after such honest and
happy efforts will not follow—but merely
disillusion and two-fold disquietude—the
price paid for this delirium, this drug-like
dissipation. For a moment he lies with
twisted eyeballs upon his side as though he
were dead. Then he rises and shakes himself.
He shakes himself as only his kind
is able to shake itself—without having to
fear a concussion of the brain. He shakes
himself to a crescendo of flappings and
rattlings, and his ears go slapping under his
jawbone and his loose lips part from his
white, bare triangular teeth.</p>

<p>And then? Then he stands motionless,
in stark abstraction. He has reached the
ultimate limit and no longer has a single
idea as to what he shall do with himself.
Under such circumstances as these, he has
recourse to something extreme. He climbs
up to the terrace, approaches the glass door—scratches
only once and very feebly. But
this soft and timidly lifted paw, this soft,
solitary scratching, upon which he had
resolved, after all other counsel had failed,
work mightily upon me, and I arise to open
the door for him in order to let him in,
although I know that this can lead to no
good. For he immediately begins to leap
and cavort, as a call to engage in manly
enterprises. He pushes the carpet into a
hundred folds, spreads confusion through
the room, and my peace and quiet are at
an end.</p>

<p>But now judge whether it is easy for me
to sail off in the tram, after seeing Bashan
wait thus, and leave him sitting as a melancholy
little heap of misery deep within the
converging lines of the avenue of poplars!</p>

<p>When the summer is on and the daylight
is long and lingering, this misfortune may
not be so overwhelming, for then there is
always a good chance that at least my evening
promenade will take me out into the open,
so that Bashan, even though the period of
waiting be arduous, may nevertheless still
meet with his reward and, provided one has
a certain amount of luck, be able to chase
a rabbit. But in winter, it is all up for this
day and Bashan must bury all hope for a
full twenty-four hours. For then the night
will have already fallen upon the hour of
my second going-forth; the hunting grounds
are buried in impenetrable darkness, and I
must direct my steps towards regions artificially
lighted, upstream, through streets
and public parks, and this does not suit
Bashan’s nature and simplicity of soul. It
is true that at first he followed me even
here, but soon gave this up and remained
at home. It was not only that visible chances
for gadding about were lacking—the half-dark
made him hesitant, he shied in confused
alarm at man and bush. The sudden
flapping of a policeman’s cape caused him
to jump aside with a howl, and with the
courage of horror to make a sudden dash
at the policeman, who was also scared half
to death and strove to even up the fright he
had received by a torrent of harsh and
threatening words directed at me and Bashan.
And there were many other uncomfortable
encounters whenever he went forth with me
through the night and the mist. Apropos
of this policeman, I will remark that there
are three kinds of human beings to whom
Bashan has a whole-hearted aversion—namely
policemen, monks, and chimney-sweeps. He
cannot tolerate them, and will sally forth
against them with furious barks whenever
they go past the house, or wherever they
may chance to cross his path.</p>

<p>Moreover, winter is that season in which
the world lies most vigilantly and insolently
in ambush against our liberties and our
virtues, and least willingly grants us a
uniform and serene existence, an existence
of seclusion and of quiet preoccupation, and
so it happens that often the city draws me
to itself a second time in one day—in the
evening—when Society demands its rights.
Then, late, at midnight, the last tram deposits
me far out at its penultimate stop.
Or I come jogging along on foot, long after
the last tram has returned to town—I come
wandering <i>distrait</i>, tempered with wine,
smoking, having passed the bourne of natural
fatigue and wrapped in a sense of false
security in relation to all things mundane.
And then it happens that the embodiment
of my own domesticity, as it were, my very
retirement, comes to meet me and salutes
and welcomes me not only without reproach
or touchiness, but with extreme joy, and
re-introduces me to my own fireside—all in
the shape of Bashan himself. It is pitch
dark, and the river goes by with a rushing
sound as I turn into the poplar avenue. A
few steps more and I feel that I am be-capered
and be-switched by paws and tail—and have no
clear idea of what is happening to me.</p>

<p>“Bashan?” I ask of the darkness.</p>

<p>And then the capering and the switching
are intensified to the utmost. They pass
into something dervish- and Berserker-like,
though the silence continues. The very
moment I stand still I feel two homely and
wet and muddy paws upon the lapels of
my overcoat, and there are such violent
snappings and lappings close to my face,
that I bend backward, whilst I pat those
lean shoulders, wet with rain or snow.</p>

<p>Yes, the dear fellow has waited for me
at the tram-stop, well aware of my comings
and goings and doings; he had gone forth
when the hour seemed to have arrived, and
waited for me at the station—waited, perhaps,
a long and weary while in the snow or rain.
And his joy at my arrival is devoid of all
resentment at my cruel faithlessness, even
though I had utterly neglected him to-day
and reduced all his hopes and expectances
to naught. So I am loud in my praise of
him as I pat his shoulders and we turn
towards home. I tell him that he has acted
nobly, and deliver myself of momentous
promises with regard to the day which is
already under way. I assure him (that is
to say not so much him as myself) that we
shall go hunting together to-morrow without
fail, no matter what the weather. Amidst
resolutions such as these, my mood of
universality evaporates, seriousness and
sobriety slink back into my soul, and my
fancy, now full of the hunting-grounds and
their loneliness, is seized by apperceptions
of higher, secret and wondrous obligations.</p>

<p>But I am moved to add further details to
this transcript of Bashan’s character, so that
the willing reader may see it in the <i>n</i>th
degree of vivid verisimilitude. I might
perhaps proceed with more or less skill
by drawing a comparison between Bashan
and the lamented Percy, for a contrariety
more sharply defined than that which distinguished
their respective natures is scarcely
conceivable within one and the same species.
As a basic consideration one must remember
that Bashan enjoys perfect mental health,
whilst Percy, as I have already intimated,
was—as is not uncommon with dogs of blue-blooded
pedigrees—a perfect fool his whole
life long, crazy, a very model of overbred
impossibility. Mention of this has been
made in a more momentous connection, in
a previous chapter.</p>

<p>I would merely mention here as a contrast
Bashan’s simple and popular ways as
these manifest themselves when going for
walks or when making salutations—occasions
upon which the enunciation of his emotions
remains within the bounds of common sense
and a sound heartiness without ever touching
the limits of hysteria—limits which Percy
often transgressed on these occasions and
that in the most disconcerting fashion.</p>

<p>But the whole antithesis between the two
creatures is by no means exhausted in this—for
this antithesis is in truth a mixed and
complicated one. Bashan, you must know,
is somewhat crude, like the common people
themselves, but, like them, also soft and
sentimental, whilst his noble predecessor
combined more delicacy and possibilities of
pain with an incomparably prouder and
firmer spirit, and despite his silliness, far
excelled that old yokel Bashan in the matter
of self-discipline. It is not in defence of an
aristocratic cult of values that I call attention
to this mixture of opposite qualities,
of coarseness and tenderness, of delicacy
and resolution, but purely in the interests
of life and actuality. Bashan, for example,
is just the man for spending even the coldest
winter nights in the open, that is on the
straw behind the coarse burlap curtains of
his kennel. A slight affection of the bladder
prevents him from spending seven hours
uninterruptedly in a locked room without
committing a nuisance—a weakness of his
which caused us to lock him out during the
inhospitable time of the year, setting a
justifiable faith in his robust health. Only
once, after a particularly icy and foggy
night, did he make his appearance with
moustaches and goatee miraculously frosted
and iced and with that jerky, one-syllabic
cough peculiar to dogs—but a few hours,
and lo, he had conquered the cold and was
none the worse for it.</p>

<p>But never would we have dared to expose
the silken-haired Percy to the inclemency
of such a night. On the other hand, Bashan
stands in great fear of even the slightest pain,
and every twinge wrings from him a response,
the whining complaint of which would arouse
aversion, if its naive, folkish quality did not
disarm one and set the springs of gaiety
aflow. Again and again, during his prowlings
in the underwood, I have heard him squeal
aloud—a thorn had chanced to prick him,
or a resilient branch had switched him across
the face, and if he happened to have scratched
his belly a little in vaulting over the fence,
or sprained his foot, I have been treated
to an antique hero’s chorus, a three-legged
limping approach, an uncontrollable wailing
and self-lamentation. And the more sympathetically
I talked to him, the more
insistent his clamour became—though in a
quarter of an hour he would be swooping
and running about as madly as before.</p>

<p>Percy was of a different metal. Percy
would grit his teeth and keep mum. He
feared the rawhide whip just as Bashan fears
it, and unfortunately he got a taste of it
oftener than Bashan; for, first of all, I was
younger and more hot-tempered during
his epoch than I am at present, and secondly,
his heedlessness often assumed a wanton
and sinister aspect which simply clamoured
for chastisement and urged me to it.
When, driven to extremities, I would take
down the whip from the nail, then, it is
true, he would crawl under the table or
bench and make himself small, but never a
howl passed his lips when the blow, and
perhaps yet another, came humming down
upon his back; at most he gave a low moan,
in case the whip bit too hard. But Bully
Bashan begins to shriek and whimper when
I merely raise my arm. In short, he is
without pride or dignity, without self-restraint
or self-discipline. But his activities
seldom call for armed punitive intervention—the
less so since I have long ago ceased
to demand achievements from him which
are contrary to his nature and insistence
upon which might lead to a collision.</p>

<p>Tricks, for instance, I never expect from
him—it would be futile. He is no savant,
no market-place miracle-monger, no poodle-like
valet—no professor—but a hunter-lad,
full of go and vitality. I have already
emphasised the fact that he is a splendid
vaulter. If it be necessary, he will balk
at no obstacle—if it be too high, he will
simply take a running jump and climb over
it, letting himself drop down on the other
side—but take it he will. But the obstacle
must be a <i>real</i> obstacle, that is, not one
under which one may run or crawl; for
then Bashan would consider it sheer insanity
to jump over it. Such obstacles present
themselves in the shape of a wall, a ditch, a
barred gate, a fence without a hole. A
horizontal bar, a stick held out, is no obstacle,
and so, of course, one cannot well jump over
it without bringing oneself into a silly contrariness
to things as well as to one’s reason.
Bashan refuses to do this. He refuses.
Should you attempt to persuade him to jump
over some sham obstacle, you would finally
in your wrath be forced to take him by the
scruff of the neck and to hurl him over it,
barking and yapping. He will hereupon
assume a mien as though he had magnanimously
permitted you to attain your wishes
and will celebrate the result by caperings
and rapturous barks. You may flatter him,
beat him, but here you will encounter a
resistance of sheer reason against the trick
pure and simple which you will never be
able to overcome.</p>

<p>He is not unobliging, gratifying his master
means a great deal to him—he will vault
over a hedge at my wish or command, and
not only from his own impulses, and gladly
will he reap his meed of praise and thanks
for this. But even though you should beat
him half to death, he will not jump over a
pole or a stick, but run under it. He will
beg a hundred times for forgiveness, for
consideration, for mercy, for he fears pain,
fears it, to the point of utter pusillanimity.
But no fear and no pain can force him to
do something which from a physical point
of view would be mere child’s play for him,
but for which all mental capacities are
obviously lacking in him. To demand this
act of him is not to confront him with the
question as to whether he should or should
not jump—this question is already settled
for him in advance, and the command
simply means a clubbing. To demand the
incomprehensible and therefore the impossible
from him is, in his eyes, merely a pretext
for a quarrel, for a disturbance of friendship
and a chance to inflict a whipping, and is
in itself the very inauguration of these things.
This is Bashan’s conception of things, as far
as I can see, and I doubt whether one can
speak of mere ordinary stubbornness in this
connection. Obduracy may finally be
broken, yes, it even demands to be broken,
but Bashan would seal his refusal to perform
a trick or feat with his very life.</p>

<p>A wondrous soul! So friendly and intimate
and yet so alien in certain traits, so
alien that our language is incapable of doing
justice to this canine logic. What relation
has this, for instance, with that terrible
circumstantiality, always so unnerving for
the spectator, with which the meeting, the
acquaintance or the mere recognition of dog
and dog fulfil themselves? My picaroon
forays with Bashan have made me the
witness of hundreds of such meetings, or
rather I should say forced me to be an unwilling,
embarrassed witness. And every
time, as long as the scene lasted, his usually
transparent behaviour became inscrutable
to me—I found it impossible to effect a
sympathetic penetration into the feelings,
laws, and tribal customs which form the
basis of his behaviour. In reality the meeting
in the open of two dogs strange to each
other, belongs to the most poignant, arresting,
and pathetic of conceivable happenings. It
takes place in an atmosphere of daemonry
and strangeness. An inhibition operates
here for which there is no exacter term—the
two cannot pass each other—a terrible
embarrassment prevails.</p>

<p>I need scarcely speak of cases in which
the one party is locked inside some allotment,
behind a fence or a hedge—even then
it is not easy to see what humour the two
may be in, but the affair is comparatively
less ticklish. They scent each other from
vast distances. Bashan suddenly appears
at my side, as though seeking protection,
and gives way to whimperings which proclaim
an indefinite grief and perturbation
of soul, whilst at the same time the stranger,
the prisoner, starts up a furious barking, to
which he seems anxious to give the character
of vigilance energetically announcing itself,
but which now and again impulsively reverts
to tones which resemble those of Bashan’s
yearning, a tearfully jealous, a distressful
whining. We approach the spot, drawing
nearer and nearer. The strange dog has
been awaiting us behind the fence—there
he stands—scolding and lamenting his impotence,
and makes wild leaps against the
fence and pretends—no one can tell just
how much he pretends—that he would
infallibly tear Bashan to pieces, if he could
but reach him. In spite of this, Bashan,
who might easily remain at my side and
walk past, goes towards the fence—he <i>must</i>
go—he would go even contrary to my
orders. Not to go would violate some
immanent law—far more deeply-rooted, more
inviolable than my own prohibition. So
he walks up to the spot and, with a humble
and inscrutable mien, fulfils that act of
sacrifice which, as he well knows, always
brings about a certain pacification and temporary
reconciliation with the other dog—so
long as he too performs the same act,
even though it be in another spot and
accompanied by low growlings and whines.
Then both begin to chase wildly alongside
the fence, the one on this, the other on the
opposite side—dumb and always keeping
parallel to each other. Both simultaneously
face about at the end of the fence and race
back towards the other end, turn about and
race back once more. Suddenly, however,
in the very middle, they remain as if rooted
to the ground, no longer longitudinal to
the fence—but at right angles with it, and
touch noses through the rails. They stand
thus for a considerable time, and then once
more resume their strange and ineffectual
race, shoulder to shoulder on either side
of the fence. Finally, however, my dog
makes use of his liberty and races off.
This is always a terrible moment for the
imprisoned one. This sudden lighting out
is to him something unendurable; it is
villainy unutterable and unparalleled—to
think that the other dog, his racial colleague,
should really think of abandoning him!</p>

<p>So he raves, howls, acts like one possessed,
races up and down his territory, all by
himself, threatens to jump over the fence and
strangle the traitor, and keeps on hurling
the vilest curses after him. Bashan cannot
help hearing all this pother, and he is most
disagreeably affected by it, as his guilty
and diffident air proclaims. Still he refuses
to look back, and jogs easily along. During
this the terrible maledictions to our rear
gradually decline in intensity and slowly
die away into low whinings and thin yowls.</p>

<p>Such is the customary course of events
when one of the parties concerned happens
to be under duress. But the strange contrariety
of things reaches its apex when the
<i>rencontre</i> takes place under equal conditions
and both happen to be free of foot.
It is extremely unpleasant to be obliged to
describe this—really, it is the most oppressive,
embarrassing and ticklish situation conceivable.
However——</p>

<p>Bashan, who has just been blithely gambolling
about, comes to me, simply forcing
himself upon my attention with that peculiar
sniffling and whining which arise from the
very profounds of his nature. These sounds
cannot be interpreted as the expression of
any particular emotion, though I at once
recognise them as an attempt to tell me of
the approach of a strange dog. I peer
sharply about me. No mistake—there he
comes—and it is clear even from afar, as
proclaimed by his cautious and hesitant
advance, that he has become conscious of
the other. My own anxiety is scarcely less
than that of the other two—I have premonitions
that this meeting is going to be
precarious and highly undesirable.</p>

<p>“Go ’way!” I say to Bashan. “What
d’ye mean by clinging to my leg! Can’t
you two carry on negotiations amongst yourselves—and
at a distance?”</p>

<p>I try to push him away with my stick,
for if it should come to a battle of bites,
which—whether there be a reason for it
or not—is extremely probable, it is sure to
take place around my feet and I shall become
the centre of a most unedifying tussle.</p>

<p>“Go ’way!” I repeat hoarsely.</p>

<p>But Bashan does not go ’way. He continues
to cling to me, tightly and helplessly.
Only for a moment does he deign to move
aside to sniff at a tree—an operation which
the stranger, as I observe out of the corner
of my eye, is also performing yonder. The
distance between the two is now only twenty
paces—the tension is fearful. The stranger
has now assumed a crouching position like
a tiger-cat, with head thrust forward, and
in this highwaymanlike pose he awaits
Bashan’s approach, apparently in order to
seize him by the throat at the proper
moment. This, however, does not take
place, nor does Bashan appear to expect it.
At all events he continues to advance straight
towards the lowering one, though with
palpitant hesitancy and an alert though tragic
mien. He would do so—would, in fact, be
<i>forced</i> to do so, even though I were to leave
him and pursue my path, abandoning him
to all the perils of the situation. No matter
how upsetting the <i>rencontre</i> may be, no
thought can be given to evasion or escape.
He goes as one that is under a spell—a ban.
Both are bound to each other by some
secret and tenebrous tie, and neither dares
belie this. We have now approached within
two paces.</p>

<p>And then the other dog gets up quietly,
just as though he had never assumed the
looks or attitude of a lion couchant and stands
there precisely as Bashan stands—both with
hangdog look, miserable and deeply embarrassed
and both incapable of yielding an
inch or of passing each other. They would
like to be free of all this; they turn away
their heads, squint sadly aside. Thus they
shove and slink towards each other, side by
side, tense and full of a troubled watchfulness,
flank to flank, and begin to snuffle at
each other’s hides.</p>

<p>It is during this procedure that the growlings
begin. <i>Sotto voce</i>, I call Bashan by
name and warn him, for this is the fateful
moment which is to decide whether a tussle
and biting-match is to take place, or whether
I am to be spared this calamity. But the
battle of bites, of tooth and claw, is upon
us—in a flash—no one could say how or
why. In a moment both of them are merely
a tangle, a raving, chaotic tumult out of
which arise horrible gutteral cries, as of
dragons of the prime tearing each other.
In order to avert a tragedy I am forced
to interpose my stick, to seize Bashan by
his collar or by the scruff of his neck, and to
hoist him into the air with one arm with his
antagonist hanging to him with locked jaws—or
face whatever other terrors may be awaiting
me—terrors which I am then fated to
feel in every nerve during the greater part
of the walk. But it also happens that the
entire affair may pass off quite uneventfully,
and, as it were, ebb away. Nevertheless, in
both contingencies it is difficult to get away
from the spot. For even if these twain do
not happen to clamp themselves together by
the teeth, they remain fettered by a tenacious
inner bond. In this case things proceed as
follows:—</p>

<p>You imagine that the two dogs have
already passed each other, for they are no
longer hesitating flank to flank, but are
aligned almost in keel formation, the one
with his head turned in one direction, the
other with his in the opposite direction.
They do not see each other; they scarcely
turn their heads, merely squinting towards
the rear, straining the eyeball back as far
as possible. Even though they are already
separated by some short distance, the tenacious,
sinister tie still holds and neither of
them is sure whether the moment of liberation
has arrived. Both would like to move
off, but some inscrutable, conscientious
anxiety prevents them from leaving the
spot. Until at last—at last!—the ban is
broken, and Bashan, redeemed, and with
the air of having just been granted a new
lease of life, goes bounding off.</p>

<p>I mention these things in order to indicate
how strange and alien so close a friend may
appear under certain circumstances—times
when his entire nature reveals itself as something
eerie and obscure. I brood upon this
mystery and find no answer save a shake of
the head. It is only by intuition and not
by reason that I am able to identify myself
with it. Otherwise I am well acquainted
with Bashan’s inner world, and am able to
meet its every manifestation with sympathy
and with cheerfulness—to understand his
play of features, his whole behaviour.</p>

<p>How well, for example, a solitary example,
do I know that chirruping yawn to which
he has recourse whenever he has been disappointed
in the results of a walk. It may
be that the walk was all too short or else
barren of events in a sporting sense—as
sometimes happens when I have begun my
day’s work a little later than usual and
have gone into the open air with Bashan for
a brief quarter of an hour before sitting
down at my desk. He walks beside me then,
and yawns. It is a shameless, impolite,
wide-angle yawning—the yawning of the
beast, of the brute, and it is accompanied
by a whistling, guttural note and by a hurt
and bored look. It says, as clearly as
words:—</p>

<p>“A nice sort of master I’ve got! I went
and fetched him from the bridge last night.
And now he goes and sits behind that there
glass door, and I’ve got to wait till he goes
out, and me a-perishing with impatience.
And then at last when he <i>does</i> go out, he
turns round again and starts back home before
I’ve had a sniff at a single bit o’ game! A
fine sort of master, eh? And what a mean
trick to play on a hound! Why, he ain’t fit
to be called a master at all!”</p>

<p>Such are the sentiments expressed with
rude clarity by these yawns of his—and
there is no mistaking them. I am also aware
that he is perfectly right in cherishing such
sentiments and that in his eyes I am guilty.
And so my hand steals towards his shoulder
for a pat or two, or I proceed to stroke
the top of his skull. But he has no use
for caresses under such circumstances. He
refuses to acknowledge or accept them. He
gives another yawn, and this still more
rudely than before, if that be possible, and
withdraws himself from my conciliatory hand.
He withdraws himself, even though he is
extremely fond of such caresses, in accordance
with his earthy, all too earthy sentimentality,
and in contradistinction to the
impervious Percy. He particularly appreciates
being scratched upon the throat, and
he has acquired a droll but adroit energy
in guiding one’s hand to the proper place
by means of short movements of the head.
That he ignores all tendernesses at present
is due not only to his disillusion and disappointment,
but also to the fact that he has
no interest for such fondlings when in a
state of movement, that is, a state of movement
co-ordinated with mine. He is then
obsessed by a masculine mood and spirit,
and scorns all feminine touches. But an
immediate change takes place as soon as I
sit down. Then his heart expands and he
becomes receptive to all friendly advances,
and his manner of responding to them is full
of rapturous and awkward insistence.</p>

<p>Often, when I chance to be seated on my
chair in the angle of the garden wall or in
the grass with my back against some favourite
tree, reading a book, I am happy to interrupt
my literary occupation in order to speak
and play with Bashan. I repeat—to speak
with him. And what do I find to say? Well,
the conversation is usually limited to repeating
his name to him—his name—those two
syllables which concern him more than all
others, since they designate nothing but
himself, and thus have an electrifying effect
upon his entire being. I thus stir and fire
his consciousness of his ego by abjuring him
in different tones and in different degrees
of emphasis to consider the fact that he is
called Bashan and that he <i>is</i> Bashan. By
keeping this up for a short time I am able
to throw him into a state of veritable ecstasy,
a kind of drunkenness of identity, so that
he begins to rotate upon his own axis and
to send loud barks towards heaven—all out
of sheer inner triumph and the proud compulsion
of his heart. Or we amuse each
other in that I flick him upon the nose,
whilst he snaps at my hand as at a fly.
This forces both of us to laugh, yes, even
Bashan must laugh. This laugh of his—to
which I must instinctively respond, is for
me the most wonderful and touching thing
in the world. It is unutterably moving to
see how his haggard canine cheek and the
corners of his mouth quiver and jerk to
the excitement of the teasing, how the dusky
mien of the dumb creature takes on the
physiognomic expression of human laughter,
or how a troubled, helpless, and melancholy
reflection of this appears and vanishes again
to give way to the stigmata of fear and
embarrassment, and then how it once more
makes its wry appearance. . . .</p>

<p>But it is best to pause here and not involve
myself deeper in detail. I must not allow
my descriptions to exceed the limits which
I have set. I merely wish to show my hero
in all his glory and in his natural elements
and in that position in life in which he is
most himself and which casts the most
favourable light upon his various gifts and
accomplishments—that is to say, the hunt
or chase. I must, however, as a preliminary,
make the reader more closely acquainted
with the scene of these joys—our hunting-grounds—my
landscape along the river.
For there is a strange affinity between this
and the person of Bashan. This strip of
land is as dear to me as it is to him—it is
intimate and full of meaning—like himself.
Therefore, without further ado or novellistic

<div class="chtitle">    THE HUNTING-GROUNDS </div>


<p>In the gardens of our small but spaciously
arranged colony of villas there are huge
trees—ancient giants which tower above the
roofs. They offer a marked contrast to the
tender saplings but recently planted. There
can be no mistaking the fact that these trees
are the original growth—the aboriginal inhabitants
of this region. They are the
pride and beauty of this still youthful
settlement. They have been carefully preserved
and tended—as far as this was
possible. At those points where they happened
to come into conflict with the surveyor’s
lines or with the fences dividing the
various lots or tracts of land, that is to say,
where some mossy, silvery, venerable trunk
happened to be standing precisely on the
lines of demarcation, you will find that the
fence has made a little loop around the tree-trunk
or that a gap has been left in the
concrete of the garden wall. In these
openings the Old Ones now tower, half
privately, half publicly, their naked branches
loaded with snow or bedizened with their
small-leafed, late-sprouting foliage.</p>

<p>These trees are of the species of the ash—a
tree which loves dampness as few others
do. This quality at the same time offers
a very significant commentary upon the
essential peculiarity of our strip of country.
It is not yet so very long ago that human
ingenuity succeeded in turning it into something
capable of cultivation and occupation—possibly
a decade and a half ago—no
longer. Before that it was a wilderness of
swamps—a veritable brooding-place for gnats
and mosquitoes—a waste in which willows,
crippled poplars, and such-like gnarled and
twisted arboreal stuff mirrored itself in stagnant
pools. This region, you must know,
is subject to inundation. A few metres under
the surface there is a strata of water-tight
soil. The ground has therefore always been
swampy and water stood in every hollow.
The draining of this fen was accomplished
by lowering the surface of the river—I have
no head for engineering, but some such
expedient was made use of, with the result
that the water which could not seep downward
was induced to flow off laterally. Hence
there are many subterranean brooks which
pour themselves into the river at different
spots. Solidity has thus been given to the
soil, at least the greater part of it, for if
you happen to know the district as Bashan
and I know it, you would be able to discover
in the thickets down-stream many, a reedy
sinkage which reminds you of pristine conditions.
These are places of silence and
secrecy, the damp coolth of which defies
the hottest summer day, spots in which one
is glad to rest and draw breath for a space.</p>

<p>The region really possesses its own peculiar
character and is to be distinguished at first
glance from the banks of the usual mountain
river with their pine woods and mossy
meadows. It has succeeded in retaining
this original peculiarity even since it has
come into the possession of the real estate
company. Even outside the gardens, the
aboriginal and original vegetation maintains
the upper hand over the imported and the
transplanted. It is true that in the avenues
and parks the horse-chestnut seems to thrive
as well as the swift-growing maple. Even
beeches and all kinds of decorative shrubbery—but
all these, including the alien poplar
which towers and ranges in rows of sterile
masculinity—are not native to the soil. I
said that the ash was an indigenous tree
here—it is to be found everywhere, and it
is of all ages—from giants hundreds of years
old to the soft shoots which, like so many
weeds, sprout in masses from the gravel.
It is the ash and its companions, the silver
poplar and the aspen, the birch and the
willow, both as a tree and a bush, which
give distinctive character to this landscape.
But these are all trees with small leaves, and
this smallness and trimness of the foliage
in conjunction with the frequently gigantic
masses of the trees themselves, at once attract
attention in this neighbourhood. The elm,
however, is an exception, and we find it
spreading its spacious leaves, fretted as by
a jig-saw and shiny and sticky on their
upper surface, to the sun. And everywhere
there are great masses of creeping plants
which weave themselves around the younger
trunks in the woods and in a bewildering way
entangle their leaves with these.</p>

<p>The slender alders form themselves into
small groves in the hollows. The lime is
scarcely to be met with at all, the oak never
appears nor does the fir. Yet there are firs
upon the eastern declivities which form the
frontiers of our territory, for here the soil
changes and with it the vegetation. There
they rear black against the heavens and
peer, sentinel-like, upon us in our lower
levels.</p>

<p>From this bluff to the river is not more
than a hundred metres—I have paced the
distance. It may be that the strip of riverbank
widens, fan-like, a little farther down-stream,
but this divergence is in no way
important. It is, however, remarkable what
a diversity of landscape this limited region
affords—even, though one explore only the
playground which lies along the river, explore
it with restraint and moderation, like Bashan
and myself. Our forays seldom exceed two
hours, counting the advance and the retreat.
The manifold nature of the views, however,
and the fact that one is constantly able to
change one’s walks and to arrange combinations
that are eternally new, without ever
becoming bored with the landscape, is due
to the circumstance that it is divided into
three very different regions or zones. One
may devote oneself separately to any of these
or one may combine them by means of
slanting cross-paths. These three regions
are the region of the river and its immediate
bank on one side, the region of the bluff
on the other, and the region of the forest
in the middle.</p>

<p>The greater part of the breadth is occupied
by the zone of the forest, the willow brakes,
and the shrubbery of the bank—I find
myself hunting for a word which will more
perfectly fix and define this wonderful <i>terrain</i>
than the word wood, and yet I am unable
to find one. There can be no talk of a wood
in the usual sense of the term—a kind of
great pillared grove with moss and strewn
leafage and tree-trunks of fairly uniform
girth. The trees in our hunting-grounds
are of different ages and circumference.
Huge patriarchs of the willow and poplar
families are to be found among them,
especially along the river, though they are
also to be encountered in the inner woods.
Then there are others already full-grown
which might be ten or fifteen years old,
and finally a legion of thin stems—wild
nurseries of nature’s own crop of young
ashes, birches, and elders. These do not,
however, call forth any impression of meagreness,
because, as I have already indicated,
they are all thickly wrapped about with
creepers. These give an air of almost
tropical luxuriance to the whole. Yet I
suspect that these creepers hinder the growth
of their hosts, for during the years I have
lived here, I do not remember having
observed that any of these little stems had
grown perceptibly thicker.</p>

<p>All trees belong to a closely-related species.
The alder is a member of the birch family;
in the last analysis the poplar is nothing
else than a willow. And one might even
say that all of them approach the fundamental
type of the latter. All foresters and
woodmen know that trees are quite ready to
accept a certain adaptation to the character
of the circumjacent vicinity—a certain imitation
or mimicry of the dominant taste in
lines and forms. It is the fantastic, witch-like,
distorted line of the willow which prevails
here—this faithful companion and attendant
of still and of flowing waters, with the crooked
finger, projecting, broom-like, branching
boughs, and it is these features which the
others obviously seek to imitate. The silver
poplar crooks herself wholly in the style of
the willow, and it is often difficult to tell her
from the birch which, seduced by the
<i>genius loci</i>, also frequently affects the most
extravagant crookednesses—though I would
not go so far as to say that this dear and
friendly tree was not to be found, and
numerously found, in exceedingly shapely
specimens. These, when the afternoon light
is fervent and favourable, are even most
enchanting to the eye.</p>

<p>The region knows it as a small silvery
trunk with sparse single leaves in the crown,
as a sweet grown-up limber virgin with
the prettiest of chalky stems and a trim and
languishing way of letting the locks of her
foliage hang. But it also makes its appearance
as a creature of absolutely elephantine
proportions with a waist which no man
could span with his arms and a rind which
has preserved traces of its erstwhile whiteness
only high up towards the top, whilst
near the ground it has become a coarse,
calcined and fissured bark.</p>

<p>As to the soil—this has little resemblance
to that of a forest. It is pebbly, full of clay
and even sand, and no one would dream of
calling it fertile. And yet within limits it
<i>is</i> fertile—even to luxuriance. A tall grass
flourishes upon it, though this often assumes
a dry, sharply angular and meagre character.
In winter it covers the ground like trampled
hay. Sometimes it degenerates into reeds,
whilst in other parts it is soft, thick, and
lush, mixed with hemlock, nettles, colt’s
foot, all manner of creeping, leafy stuff,
high, rocket-like thistles, and young and
tender tree-shoots. It is a favourite hiding-place
for pheasants and quail, and the
vegetation runs in billows against the gnarled
boles of the tree-roots. Out of this chaos of
undergrowth and ground thicket the wild
vine and the wild hop-plant go gyrating up
in spirals, draping broad-leaved garlands
upon the trees and even in winter clinging
to the trunks with tendrils which resemble
hard and unbreakable wire.</p>

<p>This domain is neither forest nor park—it
is an enchanted garden—nothing less. I
will stoutly defend this term—even though
it refers to a poor, limited, and even crippled
bit of nature, the glories of which may be
exhausted with a few simple botanical names.
The ground is undulant; it rises and falls
in regular waves. This feature gives a fine
completeness to the views—the eye is led
into the illimitable even at the sides. Yes,
even if this wood were to stretch for miles
to the right and left, even if it were to be
as broad as it is long, instead of merely
measuring a hundred and some odd paces
from the centre to the extreme edge on
either side, one could not feel more secluded,
more lost, or isolated. Alone the ear is
reminded by the regular and rushing sound
of waters to the west that the river hovers
within a friendly distance, near yet invisible.
There are little gulches filled to the brim
with bushes of elder, common privet, jasmine,
and black elderberry, so that one’s lungs on
steamy June days are almost overcome by
perfume. And then again there are sinkages
in the ground—mere gravel-pits along the
slopes and bottoms of which only a few
willow shoots and a little dry sage manage
to flourish.</p>

<p>All this has not ceased to exert a magic
influence upon me, even though the place,
for many a year, has been as a daily haunt
to me. In some way I am fantastically
moved and touched by all this, for example,
by the massed foliage of the ash-trees, which
reminds me somehow of the contours of
huge bulls. These creeping vines and reedy
thickets, this dampness and this drouth,
this meagre jungle—to sum up my impressions
as a whole—affect me a little like being
transported to the landscape of another
period of the Earth’s growth, even to a
submarine landscape—as though one were
wandering at the bottom of the sea. This
vision has a certain contact with reality, for
water once stood or ran everywhere hereabout,
especially in those seepages which have now
assumed the shape of square meadow-basins
surrounded by nurseries of ash-trees and
serve sheep for drink and pasture. One of
these ponds lies directly behind my house.</p>

<p>My delectable wilderness is criss-crossed
by paths, by strips of trampled grass and
also by pebbly trails. Obviously none of
these were made, they simply grew through
the agency of use. Yet no man could say
by whom these paths have been trodden
into the soil. It is only now and then, and
usually as an unpleasant exception, that
Bashan and I meet any one here. When
such meetings do occur, my companion
comes to a sudden halt in startled surprise
and gives vent to a single muffled bark
which gives a pretty clear expression to my
own feelings in connection with the encounter.
Even on fine sunny afternoons
in the summer, when great numbers of
pedestrians from the city come pouring into
the neighbourhood (it is always a few
degrees cooler here than elsewhere), we two
are able to wander quite undisturbed on the
inner ways. The public is apparently unaware
of these, besides, the river is a great
attraction and draws them mightily. Hugging
its banks as closely as possible, that is,
when there is no flooding, the human river
wanders out into the countryside and then
comes rolling back in the evening. At most
we chance to stumble upon a pair of lovers
kissing in the bushes. With wide, shy, yet
insolent eyes, they regard us from their
bower, as though stubbornly bent on challenging
us, daring us to say anything against
their being here, defying us to give any
open disapproval of their remote and guerilla
love-making—intimations which we silently
answer in the negative by beating a flank
retreat, Bashan with that air of indifference
with which all things that do not bear the
scent of the wild about them affect him,
and I with a perfectly inscrutable and
expressionless face which allows no trace
either of approval or disapproval to be seen.</p>

<p>But these paths are not the only means
of traffic and communication in my domain.
You will find <i>streets</i> there, or—to be more
precise—preparations that may once have
been streets, or were once destined to be
such. It is like this: traces of the path-finding
and path-clearing axe and of a
sanguine spirit of enterprise in the realm of
real estate reveal themselves for quite a
distance beyond the built-up part of the
country and the little villa colony. Some
speculative soul had peered deeply into the
untold possibilities of the future, and had
proceeded upon a bold and audacious plan.
The society which had taken this tract of
territory in hand some ten or fifteen years
before had cherished plans far more magnificent
than those which came to pass, for
originally the colony was not to have been
confined to the handful of villas which now
stand there. Building lots were plentiful,
for more than a mile down-stream everything
had been prepared, and is no doubt still
prepared for possible buyers and for lovers
of a settled suburban manner of life.</p>

<p>The councils of this syndicate had been
dominated by large and lofty ideals. They
had not contented themselves with building
proper jetties along the banks, with the
creation of riverside walks and quays and
with the planting of parks and gardens.
They had gone far beyond all this, the hand
of cultivation had invaded the woods themselves,
had made clearings, piled up gravel,
united the wilderness by means of streets,
a few lengthwise and still more crosswise.
They are well-planned and handsome streets,
or sketches of streets, in coarse macadam,
with the hint of a curb and roomy sidewalks.
On these, however, no one goes walking
but Bashan and myself—he upon the good
and durable leather of his four paws—I upon
hob-nailed boots, because of the macadam.</p>

<p>The villas which should long ago have
risen hospitably along these streets, according
to the calculations and intentions of the
society, have, for the present, refused to
materialise, even though I have set so
excellent an example as to build my own
house in these parts. They have remained
absent, I say, for ten, for fifteen years, and
so it is small wonder that a certain discouragement
has settled down upon the
neighbourhood, and that a disinclination for
further expenditures and for the completion
of that which was so magnificently begun,
should make itself felt in the bosom of the
society.</p>

<p>Everything had progressed admirably up
to a certain point. Things had even gone
so far as the christening of the new streets.
For these thoroughfares without inhabitants
have right and regular names, just like
ordinary or orthodox streets in the city or
in the civilised suburbs. But I would give
much to know what dreamy soul or retrospective
“highbrow” of a speculator had
assigned them. There is a Goethe and a
Schiller, a Lessing and a Heine Street—there
is even an Adalbert Stifter Street upon which
I stroll with particular sympathy and reverence
in my hob-nailed boots. Square stakes
are visible, such as may be seen in at the
corners of the raw and uncompleted streets
in the suburbs where there are no corner
houses. Little blue enamelled shields with
white letters are fastened to these stakes.
These shields, alas, are not in the best
condition. They have stood here far too
long, giving a name to adumbrations of
streets in which no one cares to live, and they
have been singled out to bear the stigmata
of disappointment, fiasco, and arrested
development to which they give public
expression. They are wrapped in an air
of forlorn disquietude and neglect. Nothing
has been done for their upkeep nor for their
renewal, and the weather and the sun have
played havoc with them. The enamel, to
a great extent, has split and cracked off,
the white letters have been eaten away by
rust, so that in place of their smooth and
glittering whiteness there are only brown
spots and gaps with hideous, jagged
edges—disfigurements which tear the image of the
name asunder and often render it illegible.</p>

<p>One of these blue enamelled signboards
imposed a tremendous strain upon my intellect
when I first came hither and penetrated
this region on my tours of exploration. It
was a signboard particularly long in shape
and the word street <i>(strasse)</i> had been
preserved without a break. But of the
actual name which, as I have indicated,
was very long, or rather had been very
long, the letters were nearly all completely
“blinded” or devoured by rust. The
reddish-brownish gaps gave one some idea
of their number, but nothing was decipherable
except the half of a capital S and an e
in the middle, and another e at the end.
This riddle was a little too much for my
astuteness—I was face to face with too many
unknown quantities. So I stood there for
a long time, my hands upon my back,
staring at the long signboard and studying
it closely. And then I gave it up and went
strolling along the rudimentary pavement
with Bashan. But whilst I thought that I
was occupying myself with other things,
this particular thing kept working within
the mnemonic depths of me. My sub-intelligence
kept scenting out the destroyed
name, and suddenly it shot into my consciousness.
I stood still—as in a fright. I
rushed back and once more planted myself
in front of the signboard. I counted and
compared and tested the elements of my
guess. Yes, it fitted, it “worked out!”
We were wandering in the street which had
been called “Shakespeare.”</p>

<p>These signboards befit the streets which
justify their metallic existence, and these
streets the signboards which give them a
local habitation and a name. Both of them
are dreamily and wonderfully lapped in
forgetfulness and decay. They pursue their
way through the wood which they have
invaded—but the wood refuses to rest. It
refuses to leave these streets inviolate for a
decade or more until settlers choose to pitch
their tents or villas here. So the wood
calmly goes to work and makes preparations
to close the streets, for the green things that
grow here have no fear of gravel or macadam—they
are used to it and thrive in it and
on it. So everywhere upon the streets and
upon the pavements the purple-headed
thistles, the blue sage, silvery willow shrubs,
and the green of young ash-tree sprouts
begin to take root and shoot forth.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt—these park-like
streets with the poetic names are running
wild—the jungle is once more devouring
them. Whether one be disposed to lament
the fact or rejoice over it—it is certain that
in another ten years the Goethe, Schiller,
and Heine Streets will no longer be passable,
and will very likely have vanished utterly.
At present, to be sure, there is no cause for
complaint. Surely, from a pictorial and
romantic point of view, there are no lovelier
streets in all the world than precisely these
in precisely their present condition. Nothing
could be more grateful to the soul than to
ramble through this negligence, this incompleteness—that
is, when one is well and
sturdily shod and need not fear the coarse
gravel. It is edification to the spirit to
survey the manifold wild vegetation of the
tract and the groves of tiny-leafed trees
fettered by their soft dampness—sweet
glimpses which frame and shut in these
perspectives. Just such a group of trees
was painted three hundred years ago by
that great master of landscapes—he who
came out of Lorraine. But what am I
saying?—<i>such</i> as he painted? It was this
one—and none other—which he painted.
He was here; he knew the region, and if
that rhapsodical member of the real estate
company who christened the streets in my
park had not so rigidly restricted himself to
literature, then one or the other of these
rust-corroded signs might well cause me to
guess at the name of Claude Lorraine.</p>

<p>I have now described the region of the
central wood. But the sloping land towards
the east also possesses charms which are not
to be despised, at least so far as Bashan and
myself are concerned, and for reasons which
will be revealed later. One might also call
it the zone of the brook, for it is a brook
which gives it an idyllic landscape quality.
With the charm of its banks of forget-me-nots
it forms a counterpart on the hitherside
to the zone of the puissant river yonder—the
roar and rushing turbulence of which
one is still able to hear in this spot—but only
very faintly and softly and only when the
west wind is blowing. There where the
first cross street, running from the avenue
of poplars between the meadow ponds and
the clumps of trees towards the slope,
debouches at the foot of this slope, there is
a path that leads towards the left. This is
used in winter-time as a bob-sled run by
the youth of the region, and slants towards
the lower-lying levels.</p>

<p>Where the run becomes level the brook
begins its course, and it is here that master
and dog love to amble beside it on the
right bank or the left—which again affords
variety—and also to make excursions along
the slope with its variegated configuration.
To the left extend meadows studded with
trees. A country nursery lies not far away
and reveals the back of its farm buildings.
Sheep are usually at pasture here, cropping
the clover. They are under the chairmanship—so
to speak—of a not very clever little
girl in a red frock. This little girl seems to
suffer from a veritable passion to rule and
command. She is constantly crouching low,
propping her hands upon her knees and
shouting with all her might in a cacophonous
voice. And yet she is horribly afraid of
the ram, who takes on huge and majestic
proportions on account of the thickness of
his wool and who refuses to be bullied and
does whatever he pleases.</p>

<p>Whenever Bashan’s appearance causes a
panic among the sheep, the child invariably
raises its hideous outcry, and these panics
occur quite regularly and quite contrary
to Bashan’s intentions—for, if you could
peer into his inmost soul, you would discover
that sheep are a matter of absolute indifference
to him. He treats them like so much
empty air, and by his indifference and his
scrupulous and even contemptuous carefulness
he even seeks to prevent the outbreak
of the dunderheaded hysteria which dominates
their ranks. Though their scent is
certainly strong enough for my own nostrils
(yet not unpleasantly so), it is not the scent
of the wild that emanates from them, and
so Bashan, of course, has not the slightest
interest in hounding them. Nevertheless,
a simple sudden motion on his part, or even
his mere shaggy appearance, is sufficient to
cause the whole herd, which but a moment
ago was peacefully grazing, widely separated
and bleating in the quavering treble of the
lambs and in the deeper contralto and bass
of the ewes and the ram, to go storming
off in a solid mass neck and neck, whilst the
stupid child, crouching low, shouts after
them until her voice cracks and her eyes
pop out of her head. Bashan, however,
looks up at me as much as to say: Judge
for yourself whether <i>I</i> am to blame. Have
<i>I</i> given them any cause for this?</p>

<p>On one occasion, however, something
quite contrary happened, something perverse
and incomprehensible—something still more
extraordinary and unpleasant than the panic.
One of the sheep, quite an ordinary specimen
of its kind, of average size and average
sheepish visage, with a small upward curving
mouth which appeared to smile and gave
an expression of almost mocking stupidity
to its face, seemed to be spellbound and
fascinated by Bashan and came to join him.
It simply followed him—detached itself from
the herd, left the pasture and clung to
Bashan’s heels, quietly smiling in exaggerated
foolishness, and following him whithersoever
he turned. He left the path—the sheep did
likewise; he ran and it followed at a gallop;
he stood still, and it stood still—immediately
behind him and smiling its mysterious Mona
Lisa smile.</p>

<p>Displeasure and embarrassment became
visible in Bashan’s face. The situation into
which he had been plunged was really
ridiculous. There was neither sense nor
significance in it—neither in a good or a
bad sense. The whole thing, confound it—was
simply preposterous—nothing of the
kind had ever happened to him—or to me.
The sheep went farther and farther from
its basis, but this did not seem to trouble it
in the least. It followed the discomfited and
irritated Bashan farther and farther, visibly
determined not to separate from him ever
again, but to follow him whithersoever he
might go. He remained close beside me,
not so much out of fear, since there was no
occasion for this, as out of shame at the
dishonour of the situation in which he found
himself. Finally, as though his patience
were at an end, he stood still, turned his head,
and growled ominously. This caused the
sheep to bleat, and its bleating sounded like
the wicked laughter of a human being, which
so terrified poor Bashan that he ran away
with his tail between his legs—and the sheep
straight after him, with comic jumps and
curvetings.</p>

<p>We were already at a considerable distance
from the herd. In the meantime the half-witted
little girl was screaming as though
she would burst, still crouching and bending
upon her knees and even drawing these up
as high as her face, so that from a distance
she looked like a raving and malformed
gnome. And then a farm-maid, with an
apron over her skirts came running up,
either in answer to the cries of the obsessed
little one or because she had noticed the
happenings from afar. She came running,
I say, with a pitchfork in one hand. With
the other she supported her bodice, which,
I surmise, was unsupported and which was
visibly disposed to shake a trifle too violently
as she ran. She came up panting and at
once proceeded to shy the sheep, which was
slowly pacing along, like Bashan himself,
into the proper direction with the fork,
though without success. The sheep, it is
true, sprang aside with a swift flank movement,
but in an instant it was once more on
Bashan’s trail. Nothing seemed to be able
to induce it to give up.</p>

<p>I then realised that the only thing to do
was to turn tail myself, and so I turned
round. We all retraced our steps, Bashan
at my side, behind him the sheep, and
behind the sheep the maid with the pitchfork,
whilst the child in the red frock kept
on yelling and stamping. It was not enough,
however, that we should go back as far as
the herd—it was necessary to finish the job
and to proceed to the final destination. We
were obliged to enter the farmyard and
then the sheep-stable with the broad sliding-door
which the maid with muscular arm
rolled to one side before us. We thereupon
marched in, and after we were all inside,
we three were forced to make a swift and
adroit escape so as to be able to shove the
stable door to before the very nose of the
beguiled sheep, making it a prisoner. It
was only after this operation had been gone
through that Bashan and I were able to
resume our interrupted promenade amidst
the fervent thanks of the maid. During
the entire walk, however, Bashan persisted
in maintaining a humble and disconsolate
air.</p>

<p>So much for the sheep. Closely adjacent
to the farm buildings on the left there is an
extensive colony of small market-gardens.
These are owned and tended by the clerks
and working men of the city, and are the
source of much joy, exercise, and considerable
supplies of cheap flowers and vegetables.
The gardens have a cemetery-like effect
with their many arbours and summer houses,
built in imitation of tiny chapels and with
their countless small, fenced-in plots. The
whole is enclosed by a wooden fence with
an ornamental gateway. No one, however,
except the small amateur gardeners, is permitted
to have admittance through this
wooden grille. At times I see some bare-armed
man there digging up his little
vegetable garden, a square rod or so in size,
and always it seems to me as though he were
digging his own grave. Beyond these gardens
lie open meadows which are covered with
mole-hills and which extend to the edge of
the central wooded region. Here, in addition
to the mole-hills, there are also great numbers
of field-mice—a fact which must be solemnly
remarked in view of Bashan and his multiform
joy in the chase.</p>

<p>On the other side, that is to say, to the
right, the brook and the slope continue—the
latter, as I have already indicated, in
diverse configuration. At first, covered with
fir-trees, it displays a dusky and sunless
visage. Later it transforms itself to a sand-pit
which warmly refracts the beams of the
sun; still later it converts itself into a gravel-pit,
and then to a cataract of bricks—just
as though a house had been demolished
higher up and the débris hurled down the
slope. This has imposed temporary difficulties
upon the course of the brook. But
the brook rises equal to the occasion; its
waters mount a trifle and spread themselves
out, stained red by the dust of the broken
brick and also discolouring the grass along
the bank. After this they flow the dearer
and the more gaily on their way with
glistenings here and there upon the surface.</p>

<p>I have a great love for brooks, as I have
for all bodies of water—from the ocean to
the smallest, scum-covered puddle. When
I happen to be in the mountains during
the summer and chance to hear the secret
splashing and gossip of such a streamlet, then
I must follow the liquid call, even though it
be distant, and I cannot rest until I have
found its hiding-place. Then, face to face,
I make acquaintance with the talkative
child of the crags and the heights. Beautiful
are the proud torrential brooks which come
down in crystalline thunder between pines
and steep terraces of stone, form green,
ice-cold pools in rocky baths and basins,
and then go plunging to the next step in a
dissolution of snowy foam. But I am also
fond of looking upon the brooks of the
flatland, whether they be shallow, so as
scarcely to cover the polished, silvery, and
slippery pebbles of their beds, or as deep as
little rivers which—protected on both banks
by low, overhanging willows—go shouldering
themselves forward with a vigorous
thrust, flowing more swiftly in the middle
than at the sides.</p>

<p>Who, being free to make his choice,
would not follow the course of the waters
on his wanderings? The attraction which
water exercises upon the normal man is
natural and mystically sympathetic. Man
is a child of water. Our bodies are nine-tenths
water, and during a stage of our
pre-natal development, we even have gills.
As for myself, I gladly confess that the
contemplation of water in every shape and
form is for me the most immediate and
poignant joy in nature—yes, I will even go
so far as to say that true abstractedness,
true self-forgetfulness, the real merging of
my own circumscribed existence in the
universal, is granted to me only when my
eyes lose themselves in some great liquid
mirror. Thus, in the face of the sleeping
or the charging and crashing of the on-rushing
sea, I am like to be transported into
a condition of such profound and organic
dreams, of such a remote absence from myself,
that all sense of time is lost and tedium
becomes a thing without meaning, since
hour upon hour spent in such identification
and communion melt away as though they
were but minutes. But I also love to lean
upon the rail of a bridge that crosses a brook,
and remain fixed to it as with thongs, losing
myself in the vision of the flowing, streaming
and whirling element—quite immune to the
fear or impatience with which I ought to be
filled in view of that other streaming and
flowing that goes on about me—the swift,
fluid flight of time. Such love of the water,
and all that water means, renders the tight
little territory which I inhabit the more
important and precious to me in that it is
surrounded on both sides by water.</p>

<p>The local brook is of the simple and
faithful species. There is nothing very
remarkable about it—its character is based
upon friendly averages. It is of a naiveté as
clear as glass, without subtlety or deception,
without an attempt to simulate depth
by means of murkiness. It is shallow and
dear and quite innocently reveals the fact
that its bottom harbours castaway tin pots
and the carcass of a lace-boot in a coat of
green slime. It is, however, deep enough
to serve as a habitation to pretty, silvery-gray
and extremely nimble little fish, which,
I presume, are minnows and which dart away
in wide zigzag lines at our approach. My
brook widens here and there into ponds
with fine willows along the edges. One
of these willows I always regard lovingly
as I pass by. It grows—I had almost said
she grows—close to the bluff, and thus at
some distance from the water. But it
stretches one of its boughs longingly towards
the brook and has really succeeded in
reaching the flowing water with the silvery
foliage that plumes the tip of this bough.
There it stands, with fay-like fingers wet
in the stream and draws pleasure from the
contact.</p>

<p>It is good to walk here, lightly assailed
by the warm summer wind. The weather
is warm, so it is probable that Bashan will go
wading into the brook to cool his belly—only
his belly, for he has a distinct aversion
to bringing the more elevated parts of his
anatomy in contact with the water. There
he stands, with his ears laid back and an
expression of piety and alertness upon his
face, and lets the water swirl around him
and past him. After this he comes sidling
up to me in order to shake himself—an
operation which, according to his own conviction,
must occur in my immediate
vicinity. The vigour with which he shakes
himself causes a thin spray of water and
mud to fly my way. It is no use warding
him off with flourished stick and intense
objurgations. Under no conditions will he
tolerate any interference with anything that
appears to him natural, inevitable, and
according to the fitness of things.</p>

<p>Farther on the brook, in pursuing its
course towards the setting sun, reaches a
small hamlet which commands a view towards
the north—between the woods and the slope—and
at the entrance to this hamlet lies the
tavern. Here the brook once more broadens
into a pond. The women of the village kneel
at the edge of this and wash their linen. A
little foot-bridge crosses the stream. Should
you venture over you will set foot upon a
road which leads from the village towards
the city, running between the edge of the
wood and the edge of the meadow. Should
you leave this road on the right you would
be able to reach the river in a few steps by
means of a wagon-road that cuts through the
wood.</p>

<p>We are now within the zone of the river.
The river itself lies before us green and
streaked with white and full of liquid roarings.
It is actually only a great mountain
torrent. Its everlasting rushing sound can
be heard with a more or less muffled reverberation
everywhere throughout the region.
Here it swells and crashes overwhelmingly
upon the ears. It might, in fact, serve as
a substitute for the sacred and sounding
onset of the sea—if no sea is to be had.
The ceaseless cry of innumerable land-gulls
intermingles with the voice of the stream.
In autumn and in winter, and even during
the spring, these gulls go circling round and
round the mouths of the overflow-pipes,
filling the air with their screams. Here they
find their food until the season grows milder
and permits them to make their way to the
lakes in the hills—like the wild and half-wild
ducks which also spend the cool and
the cold months in the vicinity of the city,
balance themselves on the waves, permit
themselves to be carried by the current
which turns them round and rocks them at
will, and then just at the moment when
some rapid or whirlpool threatens to engulf
them, fly up with light and vibrant wing
and settle down once more upon the water—a
little farther up-stream.</p>

<p>The region of the river is arranged and
classified as follows:—close to the edge of
the wood there stretches a broad level of
gravel. This is a continuation of the poplar
avenue which I have mentioned so frequently,
and runs, say, for about a kilometre down-stream,
that is to say, to the little ferryman’s
house—of which more anon. Behind this
the thicket comes closer to the river channel.
The purpose of this desert of gravel is clear;
it is the first and most prominent of the
longitudinal streets, and was lavishly planned
by the real estate company as a charming
and picturesque esplanade for elegant turnouts—with
visions of gentlemen on horseback
approaching spick-and-span landaus
and victorias glistening in their enamel and
engaging in delicate badinage with smiling
and “beauteous” ladies reclining at ease
under dainty parasols.</p>

<p>Close to the ferryman’s house there is a
huge signboard in a state of advanced decreptitude.
This proclaims what was to have been
the immediate goal, the temporary termination
of the carriage <i>corso</i>. For there in broad
and blatant letters you may read that this
corner site is for sale for the erection of a
park café and a fashionable refreshment
“establishment.” Well, the purpose remains
unfulfilled, and the building site is empty.</p>

<p>For in place of the park café, with its little
tables, its hurrying waiters, and glass-and-cup
sipping and straw-sucking guests, there is
only the big wooden signboard—aslant—a
resigned, collapsing bid without a bidder,
and the corso itself only a waste of coarsest
gravel, covered with willow bushes and
with blue sage almost as thickly as the
Goethe or Lessing Streets.</p>

<p>Alongside the esplanade, nearer to the
river, there runs a smaller gravel way which
is also overgrown with insurgent shrubbery.
It is characterised by grass mounds which
arise at intervals and from which telegraph-poles
mount into the air. Yet I am fond
of frequenting this road on my walks, first
because of the change, and second because
the gravel permits of clean though somewhat
difficult locomotion, when the clayey
footpath yonder does not appear passable
during days of heavy rain. This footpath,
actually the real promenade, runs for miles
along the river and then finally degenerates
into wild, haphazard trails along the bank.
It is lined along the riverside with saplings,
maple and birch, and on the land side it
is flanked by the mighty primitive inhabitants
of the region—willows, aspens, and
silver poplars—all of them colossal in their
dimensions. The escarpment plunges steeply
and sheerly towards the river-bed. It is
protected by ingenious works of woven
willow-withes and by a concrete armour
along its lower parts against the mounting
flood water which once or twice a year comes
rolling hither—when the snows melt in the
mountains or the rain overdoes itself. Here
and there the slope hospitably offers one
the use of wooden steps, half ladders and
half stairs, by means of which one may,
with a fair degree of comfort, descend into
the actual river-bed, which is usually quite
dry. It is the reserve gravel bed of the
big wild brook, and is about six metres wide.</p>

<p>The stream behaves like all other members
of its family, the small as well as the smallest,
that is to say, according to the weather and
the water conditions in the upper mountain
regions. Sometimes its course will be a
mere green flowing tunnel with the rocks
scarcely covered and with the gulls appearing
to stand stilt-legged on the very surface
itself. And then, again, it will assume a
most formidable character, swelling into a
wide stream, filling its bed with gray watery
fury and tumult, and bearing along in its
headlong course all kinds of unseemly objects
such as old baskets, pieces of wooden crates,
bushes, and dead cats in its circling wrath,
and showing a great disposition to flooding
and to deeds of violence.</p>

<p>The reserve or overflow channel is also
armoured against high water by the same
parallel, slanting, and hurdle-like arrangements
of willow branches. It is covered
with beach-grass and wild oats as well as
with the show-plant of the neighbourhood,
the dry, omnipresent blue sage. It offers
good walking, thanks to the strip of quay
formed of tooled and even stone, which
runs along the extreme limit of the water.
This gives me a further, and in fact favourite,
possibility of adding variety to my promenades.</p>

<p>It is true that the unyielding stone is not
particularly good going, but one is fully
recompensed by the intimate proximity of
the water. Then one is also able now and
then to walk in the <i>sand</i> beside the quay.
Yes, there is real sand there between the
gravel and the beach-grass, sand that is a
trifle mixed with clay and not so sacredly
pure as that of the sea, but nevertheless real
sand that has been washed up. I am thus
able to fancy myself strolling upon a real
strand down there, inscrutably drawing my
foot along the perilous edge of the salt
flood. There is no lack of surgings, even
if there is of surges, nor of the clamour of
gulls, nor of that kind of space-annihilating
monotony which lulls one into a
sort of narcotic absentmindedness. The
level cataracts are rushing and roaring all
around, and halfway to the ferryman’s house—the
voice of a waterfall joins the chorus—from
over yonder where the canal, debouching
at a slant, pours itself into a river. The
body of this fall is arched, smooth, glassy
like that of a fish, and an everlasting boiling
tumult goes on at its base.</p>

<p>It is beautiful here when the sky is blue
and the flat ferry decorated with a pennant
in honour of the weather or some other
festival occasion. There are other boats
in this spot, but the ferry is fastened to a
wire rope which in turn is fastened to another
and thicker wire cable. This is stretched
across the river in such a way as to let a
pulley run along it. The current itself
furnishes the motive power for the ferryboat
and a pressure from the ferryman’s
hand upon the rudder does the rest. The
ferryman lives in the ferry-house with his
wife and child, and this house lies a short
distance from the upper footpath. It has
a little garden and a hen-house, and is
evidently an official dwelling and therefore
rent-free. It is a kind of villa of liliputian
proportions, lightly and whimsically built
with little bays and gables, and appears to
boast of two rooms below and two above.
I love to sit on the bench in front of the
garden close to the upper footpath. Bashan
then squats upon my foot; the hens of
the ferryman amble about me and give their
heads a forward jerk with every step. And
usually the cock comes to perch upon the
back of the bench and lets the green Bersaglieri
feathers of his tail hang down behind,
sitting beside me thus and measuring me
luridly from the side with his red eye.</p>

<p>I watch the traffic on the ferry. It could
scarcely be called strenuous, nor even lively,
for it consummates itself, at large and liberal
intervals. So I find all the more pleasure in
the scene when a man or a woman with a
market-basket appears on the farther bank
and demands to be carried across the river.
For the poetic element in that fine call,
“Ferry ahoy!” remains full of human
captivation as in ancient days, even though
the action fulfils itself, as here, in new and
progressive forms. Double steps of wood
for the coming and the departing traveller
lead down the escarpment on both sides
into the bed of the river and to the landing-places.
And on both sides there is an
electric button affixed to the rail.</p>

<p>A man appears on the other bank, stands
still and peers across the water. No longer,
however, as in former times, does he hollow
his hands into a trumpet and shout through
them. He walks towards the push-button,
stretches out his arms and performs a slight
pressure with his thumb. There is a clear,
thin tinkle in the house of the ferryman.
This is the modern “Ferry ahoy!” and
it is poetic even thus. There stands the
prospective passenger and watches and waits.
And almost at the very moment at which
the bell tinkles, the ferryman comes out of
his little house, just as though he had stood
or sat behind the door, merely waiting for
the signal. The ferryman, I repeat, comes
out—and in his walk there is something
which suggests that he has been set in
motion directly by the pressure upon the
push button—just as one may shoot at a
door in a tiny hut among the targets in the
shooting-galleries. If you chance to make
a bull’s-eye, it flies open and a tiny figure
comes out—say a milkmaid or a soldier.</p>

<p>Without showing the slightest sign of
undue haste the ferryman walks with swinging
arms through his little garden, crosses
the footpath, descends the wooden steps to
the river, pushes off the ferry, and holds
the rudder whilst the pulley runs along the
taut wire, and the boat is driven across by
the current. The boat bumps against the
other bank; the stranger jumps in; upon
reaching the hither bank he hands the
ferryman a nickel coin and leaps up the
wooden steps with alacrity. He has conquered
the river, and turns either to the
right or to the left. Sometimes when the
ferryman is prevented from being at his
post, either through illness or more urgent
household affairs, then his wife or even his
child will come out of the house and fetch
the stranger across. They are able to
perform this office as well as he—even I
could attend to it. The job of the ferryman
is an easy one and requires no special capacity
or training. Surely he is a lucky man, this
ferrymaster, in having such a job and being
able to live in the neat dwarf villa. Any fool
would at once be able to step into his place,
and the knowledge of this keeps him modest
and grateful. On the way back to his
house he greets me very politely (with
<i>Grüss Gott</i>) as I sit there on the wooden
bench between the dog and the rooster.
It is clear that he wishes to remain on a good
footing with every one.</p>

<p>A smell of tar, a wind brushing across the
waters, and a plashing sound against the
wooden sides of the boats. What more
could I desire? Sometimes I am seized by
another memory of home. It comes upon
me when the water is deep and still and
there is a somewhat musty odour in the air,
and then these things take me back to the
Laguna, back to Venice, where I spent so
many years of my youth. And then again
there is storm and there is flood, and the everlasting
rain comes pouring down. Wrapped
in a rubber coat, with wet and streaming
face, I brace myself against the stiff west
wind along the upper way, a wind that
tears the young poplars from their poles
and makes it clear why the trees here incline
away from the west and have crowns which
grow only from one side of the branches.
When we go walking in rains such as these,
Bashan frequently stands still and shakes
himself so that he is the dark centre of a
dull, gray flurry of water. The river at
such times is a different river. Swollen,
murky-yellow, it comes rolling on, wearing
upon its face an ominous catastrophic look.
This storm-flood is full of a lurching, crowding,
tremendous haste, an insensate hurry.
It usurps the entire reserve channel up to
the very edge of the escarpment, and leaps
up against the concrete walls, the protective
works of willow boughs, so that one involuntarily
utters thanks to the wise forethought
which established these defences. The eerie
thing about these flood-waters is that the
river grows quiet, much quieter than usual,
in fact it becomes almost silent. The
customary surface rapids are no longer visible;
the stream rolls too high for these. But the
spots where these rapids were, are to be
recognised by the deeper hollows and the
higher waves, and by the fact that the crests
of these waves curl over backwards and not
forwards—like the waves of the current.
The waterfall no longer plays a part, its
glistening curved body is now flat and
meagre, and the pother at its base has
vanished through the height of the water
level.</p>

<p>So far as Bashan is concerned, his astonishment
at such a change in the aspect of
things is beyond expression. He remains
in a state of constant amazement. He is
unable to realise that the places in which he
has been accustomed to trot and run should
have vanished, should have utterly vanished—think
of it!—and that there should be
nothing there but water—water! In his
fright he scampers up the escarpment in a
kind of panic—away from the plunging,
spattering flood and looks around at me
with waggings of his tail, after which he
casts further dubious glances at the water.
A kind of embarrassment comes upon him—and
he gives way to a trick of his—opening
his mouth obliquely and thrusting his tongue
into the corners—a play of feature which
affects one as being as much human as it is
animal. As a means of expression it is
somewhat unrefined and subservient, but
thoroughly comprehensible. The whole
effect is about the same as would be conveyed
by a rather simple-minded yokel in the face
of an awkward situation, provided he went
so far as to scratch his head as Bashan
scratches his neck.</p>

<p>Having occupied myself in some detail
with the zone of the river, and described the
whole region, I believe that I have succeeded
in giving my readers a picture of it. I
rather like my own description of the place,
or rather the place as presented in my
description, but I like it still better as a
piece of nature. For there is no doubt that
as a piece of living nature, it is still more
diversified and vivid, just as Bashan himself
is in reality warmer, more lively and lovable
than in this counterfeit presentment. I am
attached to this stretch of landscape and
grateful to it, and so I have described it
with something of the meticulosity with
which the old Dutch masters painted. It
is my park and my solitude, and it is for
this reason that I have sought to conjure
it up before the reader’s eye. My thoughts
and my dreams are mingled and intergrown
with its scenes, like the leaves of its creepers
with the stems of its trees.</p>

<p>I have looked upon it at all hours and at
all seasons; in autumn when the chemical
smell of the fading leaves fills the air, when
the white legions of the thistle-down have
all been blown to the winds, when the great
beeches of the <i>Kurgarten</i> spread a rust-coloured
carpet of leaves about them on the
meadows, and when afternoons dripping
with gold merge into theatrically romantic
twilights with the crescent moon swimming
in the skies, with a milky brew of mist
hovering over the levels and the afterglow
of the sunset smouldering through the black
silhouettes of the trees. And also in winter
when all the gravel is covered with snow
and soft and smooth, so that one may walk
upon it in one’s rubber overshoes, and when
the river goes shooting black between the
pale frost-bound shores and the cry of
hundreds of fresh-water gulls fills the air
from morning to evening. Nevertheless the
easiest and most familiar intercourse with
this landscape is during the mild months,
when no special equipment in the way of
defensive clothing is necessary, and one may
go for a quick stroll for a quarter of an hour,
betwixt and between two showers of rain,
and, in passing, bend aside the branch of a
black alder tree and cast a look into the
wandering waves. It is possible that visitors
have been to call upon me, and I have been
left behind, stranded, as it were, within my
own four walls, crushed by conversation,
and with the breath of the strangers apparently
still hanging in the air. It is good then
to go at once and loaf for a little along the
Heine or Schiller Street, to draw a breath
of fresh air and to anoint myself with
Nature. I look up to the heavens, peer
into the green depths of the world of tender
and delicate leaves, my nerves recover themselves
and grow quiet—peace and serenity
return to my spirit.</p>

<p>Bashan is always with me on such forays.
He had not been able to prevent an invasion
of the house by the outer world in the shape
of the visitors, even though he had lifted
up his voice in loud and terrible protest.
But that had done no good, and so he had
stepped aside. And now he is jubilant that
he and I are once more together in the
hunting-grounds. With one ear turned
carelessly inside out, and loping obliquely,
as is the common habit of dogs—that is,
with his hind legs moving not directly
behind his front legs, but somewhat to the
side, he goes trotting on the gravel in front of
me. And suddenly I see that some tremendous
emotion has seized him, body and soul.
His short bobbed tail begins to wave furiously.
His head lunges forward and to one
side, his body stretches and extends itself.
He jumps hither and thither, and the next
moment, with his nose still glued to the
ground, he goes darting off. He has struck
a scent. He is on the spoor of a rabbit.</p>




<div class="titlepagemediumjoined">    THE CHASE </div>




<h2 id="CH5">     CHAPTER V </h2>


<div class="chtitle">      THE CHASE </div>


<p>The region is rich in game, and so we go
a-hunting it. That is to say, Bashan goes
hunting and I look on. In this wise we
hunt: rabbits, quail, field-mice, moles, ducks
and gulls. But we do not by any means
fight shy of bigger game; we also track
pheasants and even deer—whenever such
first-rate quarry—as sometimes happens—strays
into our hunting-grounds. This
always furnishes an exciting spectacle—when
the long-legged, lightly-built animal, the
furtive deer, all yellow against the snow and
with its white-tufted hindquarters bobbing,
goes flying before little old Bashan who is
straining every nerve. I follow the course
of events with the greatest interest and
tension. It is not as if anything were ever
to result from this chase, for that has never
happened and never will happen. But the
lack of tangible results does not in the least
diminish either Bashan’s joy or his passion
for hunting, nor does it in any way minimise
my pleasure. We pursue the chase for its
own sake and not for the sake of prey or
booty or any other utilitarian purpose.</p>

<p>Bashan, as I have said, is the active member.
He does not expect any save a moral support
from me, since no personal and immediate
experience has taught him a more pronounced
and practical manner of co-operation.
I lay particular stress upon the words
“personal” and “immediate,” for it is
more than probable that his ancestors, in
so far as they belonged to the tribe of
setters, were familiar with more actual
methods of hunting. On occasion I have
asked myself whether some memory of
this might not survive in him and whether
this could not be aroused by some accidental
impulse. It is certain that on Bashan’s
plane of existence the life of the individual
is less differentiated from the species than
in our case. Birth and death signify a
far less profound vacillation of the balance
of being; perhaps the inheritances of the
blood are more perfectly preserved, so that
it would merely be an <i>apparent</i> contradiction
to speak of inborn experiences, unconscious
memories which, once aroused, would be
able to confuse the creature in the matter
of its own personal experiences and cause it
to be dissatisfied with these. I once courted
this thought, but then rid myself of it, just
as Bashan had obviously rid himself of the
thoughts of the brutal incident of which he
had been a witness and which gives me
occasion for these deliberations.</p>

<p>When I go forth to hunt with him, it
usually chances to be noon—half-past eleven
or twelve o’clock—sometimes, especially on
very warm summer days, it may even be
late afternoon, say six o’clock or later.
It may be that this is even our second
going-out In any case my mental and
spiritual atmosphere is quite different from
what it was during our first careless stroll
in the morning. The virgin freshness of
the early hour has vanished long since. I
have worried, and have struggled in the
interval with this or that. I have been
forced to grit my teeth and overcome one
difficulty after the other—I have had a
tussle with some person or other. At the
same time I have been obliged to keep
some diffuse and complicated matter firmly
in mind and my head is weary, especially
after a successful mastery of the problem.
Hence this going a-hunting with Bashan
distracts and enlivens me. It infuses me
with new life, putting me into condition
for the rest of the day and for triumph
over the tasks that are still lowering in my
path. It is really largely the impulse of
gratitude which forces me to describe these
hunting trips.</p>

<p>Things, to be sure, are not so neatly
arranged that Bashan and I could go forth
in pursuit of any one special species of the
game which I have mentioned—that we
should, for instance, specialise on rabbits or
ducks. No, on the contrary, we hunt
everything that chances to cross our path—I
had almost said that chances to come
within range of our guns. We need not go
very far in order to strike game. The hunt
may literally begin immediately outside the
garden gate, for there are great numbers
of field-mice and moles in the hollows of
the meadows close behind the house. To
be exact and sportsmanlike—I am aware that
these fur-bearing animals cannot, of course,
be regarded as game in the strict sense of the
term. But their secret, subterranean habits,
especially the nimble craftiness of the mice,
which are not blind o’ day like their excavating
and tunnelling brethren, and often
go gambolling upon the surface, and then
when danger approaches go flicking into
the little black burrow without one’s being
able to distinguish their legs or their movements—these
things work tremendously upon
Bashan’s hunting instincts. These are also
the only animals of the wild which occasionally
become his prey—a field-mouse, a
mole—these are titbits which are not to be
despised in such lean and meagre days as
these—when one often finds nothing more
palatable than a thick barley soup in the
stoneware bowl beside one’s kennel.</p>

<p>I have scarcely taken a dozen steps with
my cane along the poplar avenue, and Bashan
has, as an overture, scarcely got through
with his preliminary leaps and lunges, than
he is seen to be performing the most extraordinary
capricoles towards the right. He
is already gripped by the passion for the
chase, and is blind and deaf to all things
save the exciting but hidden goings-on of
the living things about him. With every
nerve taut and tense, waving his tail, carefully
lifting his feet, he goes slinking through
the grass, sometimes pausing in mid-step,
with one foreleg and one hindleg in air,
then peering with cocked head into the
hollows, an action which causes the flaps of
his erected ears to fall forward on both
sides of his eyes. And then raising both
forepaws, he will suddenly jump forward
and will stare with dumbfounded expression
at a spot where but a moment before
there <i>was</i> something and where now
there is nothing. And then he begins to
dig. . . .</p>

<p>I feel a strong desire to go to him and
await the result, but then we should never
be able to leave the spot Bashan would
expend his entire stock of joy-in-the-chase
right here in this meadow, and this stock is
meant to last him for the entire day. And
so I walk on—untroubled by any thought
that he might not be able to overtake me—even
though he should remain behind for
a long time without having observed in
what direction I had gone. To him my
track and trail are as clear as that of a bit
of game. Should he have lost sight of me,
he is sure, with head lowered between his
forepaws, to come tearing along this trail.
I hear the clinking of his brass license-tag,
his firm gallop behind me—and then he
goes shooting past me and turns with wagging
tail once more to report himself on
duty.</p>

<p>Out yonder, however, in the woods or
in the broad meadows alongside the brook,
I often halt and watch when I catch him
digging for a mouse, even though it should
be late and I in danger of exceeding the
time I have apportioned for my walk. The
passionate devotion with which he goes to
work is so fascinating to observe, his profound
enthusiasm is so contagious, that I
cannot but wish him success with all my
heart, and naturally I also wish to be a witness
of this success. The spot he is attacking
may have made quite an innocent impression
in its outward aspect—it is, let us say, some
mossy little mound at the foot of a birch
and possibly penetrated by its roots. But
did not my Bashan hear the quarry, scent
it, perhaps even see it as it switched away?
He is absolutely certain that his bit of game
is sitting there under the earth in some snug
runlet or burrow; all that is necessary is
to get at it, and so he goes digging away
for all he is worth in absolute devotion to
his task and oblivious to the world. He
proceeds not ragingly, but with a certain
fine deliberation, with the tempered passion
of the real sportsman—it is wonderful to see.
His small, tiger-striped body beneath the
smooth coat of which the ribs align themselves
and the muscles play, is hollowed, is
concave in the middle; his hindquarters,
with the stump of a tail vibrating to quick
time, is erected vertically. His head is
between his forepaws and thrust into the
slant hole he has already dug. With averted
face he continues with the rapid strokes of
his iron claws to tear up the earth more
and more—lumps of sod, pebbles, shreds
of glass, and bits of roots fly all about me.
Sometimes his snortings are heard in the
silence of the fields—that is when he has
succeeded in penetrating some little distance,
and in wedging his snout into the entrance
to the burrow in order, by means of his scent,
to keep check upon the clever, still, and
timid creature within there.</p>

<p>His breathing sounds muffled, he ejects
his breath in a blast in order to be able to
empty his lungs quickly—and to draw in
the delicate, acrid, distant, and yet disguised
odour of the mice. What emotions must
surge through the breast of the little animal
down there when it hears this hollow and
muffled snorting? Well, that is its own
affair, or perhaps God’s affair, who has
decreed that Bashan shall be the enemy and
persecutor of these earth-mice. And then—is
not fear only an intensified feeling for
life? If no Bashan existed the little mouse
would very likely be bored to death. And
what use or purpose would then be served
by its beady-eyed cleverness and its art of
swift mining operations, factors that fairly
well equalise the conditions of the battle,
so that the success of the party upon the
offensive always remains highly problematical,
even improbable. Indeed I feel no
compassion for the mouse; inwardly I
take sides with Bashan, and sometimes I
cannot remain content with the role of a
mere spectator. I get my walking-stick
into play whenever some firmly-bedded
pebble, some tough cord of a root is in his
way and help him to get rid of these obstacles.
Then sometimes, in the midst of his hot and
furious activity, he will throw up his head
and bestow upon me a swift and fervent
glance of gratitude and approval. With
munching jaws and glinting teeth he goes
working his way into the stubborn, fibrous
ground,—tears away clods, throws them
aside, sends his resonant snorts once more
into the depths, and then, fired to renewed
action by the provocative scent,
sets his claws once more into furious
action. . . .</p>

<p>In the great majority of cases this is all
love’s labour lost. With the moist earth
clinging to his nose and sprinkled about
his shoulders, Bashan makes another quick
and superficial survey of the territory
and then gives it up and jogs indifferently
on.</p>

<p>“There was nothing doing, Bashan,” I
remark to him, when he chances to look
at me. “Nothing doing,” I repeat, shaking
my head and raising my brows and my
shoulders, so as to make the message plainer.
But it is not at all necessary to comfort
him; his failure does not depress him for a
moment. To hunt is to hunt, the titbit of
game is the least of all considerations. It
was, take it all in all, a magnificent effort
he thinks—in so far as he still happens to
think of this violent business he has just
been through. For now he is already on
new adventure bent—adventures of which
there is, indeed, no lack in the three zones
of this domain.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, he happens to catch
the mouse. And then something occurs
which never fails to strike me with horror—for
Bashan devours his prey alive, with
hide and hair. Perhaps the unfortunate
creature had not been properly advised by
its instincts of self-preservation and had
chosen a spot for its burrow which was too
soft, too unprotected and too easily excavated.
Perhaps the little creature’s tunnels
had not been sunk deep enough, or it had
been paralysed by fright and prevented from
burrowing to deeper levels. Or it had
perchance lost its head and, crouching a few
inches under the surface with its little beady
eyes popping out of their sockets with horror,
listened to that terrible snorting coming
nearer and nearer. No matter, the iron
claws disinter it, uncover it, fling it into the
air, into the pitiless glare of the day!
Hapless little mouse! you had good cause to
be frightened, and it is well that this immense
and comprehensible fright has already reduced
you to a kind of semi-unconsciousness.
For now the tiny rodent is to be converted
into pap and pulp.</p>

<p>Bashan has caught it by the tail; he
tosses it upon the ground twice or thrice;
a very faint squeak is heard, the last that is
vouchsafed to the god-forsaken little mouse.
And then Bashan snaps it up, and it disappears
between his jaws and the white,
gleaming teeth. He stands there with legs
four square and forepaws braced. His neck
is lowered and thrust forth as he chews—he
catches at the titbit again and again and
throws it into the proper position in his
mouth. The tiny bones are heard to crack,
a shred of fur hangs for a moment from the
corner of his mouth; he draws it in and then
all is over. Bashan then executes a kind of
dance of joy and triumph, circling around
me as I stand leaning on my cane with cold
shudders rushing up and down my spine.
“You’re a fine fellow!” I say to him
in a kind of gruesome recognition of his
victory. “You scoundrel! you murderer!
you cannibal!”</p>

<p>These words cause him to dance still more
wildly, and, one might say, almost to laugh
aloud. So I proceed on my way, somewhat
chilled in the limbs owing to the tragedy
I have just witnessed, and yet inwardly
enlightened by the brutal humour of life.
The thing, after all, is quite in order, in
Nature’s order. A mouselet which had
been ill-advised by its faulty instincts has
simply been converted into pap and pulp.
Nevertheless I am inwardly gratified when
in such instances as the foregoing, it
did not become necessary for me to help
along the natural order of things with my
cane, but remained a simple and passive
spectator.</p>

<p>Startling and even terrifying is it when
some pheasant suddenly bursts from the
thicket in which, sleeping or waking, it had
hoped to remain undiscovered, some coign
of concealment from which Bashan’s delicate
and unobtrusive nose had after a little searching
managed to rouse it. Thumping and
flapping, with frightened and indignant cries
and cacklings, the large, rust-red and long-tailed
bird lifts itself a-wing, and with all
the silly heedlessness of a hen, goes scattering
upon some tree from which it begins to
scold, whilst Bashan, erect against the trunk,
barks up at the fowl, stormily, savagely.
The meaning behind this barking is clear.
It says plainly enough: “Get off! get off
that perch! Tend to business. Fly off, so
I can have my bit o’ fun. Get off—I want
to chase you!” The pheasant cannot,
apparently, resist this powerful voice, and
off it scuds, making its way with heavy
flight through the branches, still cackling
and complaining, whilst Bashan, full of
manly silence, pursues it smartly along the
level ground.</p>

<p>This is sufficient for Bashan’s bliss; his
wish and his will go no farther. What would
have happened had he caught the bird?
Nothing, I assure you, absolutely nothing.
I once saw him with a bird between his
claws. He had probably come upon it
whilst it lay in deep sleep, so that the clumsy
thing had had no time to lift itself from the
ground. On that occasion Bashan had
stood over the fowl, an utterly bewildered
victor, and did not know what to do next.
With one wing raked wide open and with
its head drawn aside to the very limit of its
neck, the pheasant lay in the grass and
screamed, screamed without a single pause—a
passer-by might have thought that some
old woman was being murdered in the
bushes. I hurried up, bent upon preventing
something horrible. But I was soon convinced
that there was nothing to fear.
Bashan’s all-too conspicuous confusion, the
half-curious, half-disgusted mien with which,
head aslant, he looked down upon his
prisoner, assured me of that. This old
wives’ screeching and dinning in his ears,
very likely got upon his nerves—the whole
affair apparently caused him more embarrassment
than triumph. Was it in
victory or in shame that he pulled a
couple of feathers out of his victim’s dress,
very, very cautiously with his mouth,
refraining from all use of his teeth, and
then threw them aside with an angry toss
of his head?</p>

<p>He followed this tribute to his predatory
instincts by taking his paw off his victim
and letting it go free—not out of magnanimity,
to be sure, but simply because the
situation bored him, and because it really
had nothing in common with the stir and
gaiety of the chase. Never had I seen a
more astonished bird! It had closed its
account with life, and for a brief space it
seemed that it no longer knew what use to
make of life, for it lay in the grass as though
dead. It then tottered along the ground
for a bit, swung clumsily upon a tree,
appeared about to fall from it, summoned
its strength, and then with heavily-dragging
feathery raiment went fluttering off into
the distance. It no longer squawked, but
kept its bill shut. Silently the bird flew
across the park, the river, the forest beyond
the river, away, away, as far as its short
wings could carry it. It is certain that this
particular pheasant never returned to this
particular spot.</p>

<p>There are, however, a good many of his
breed in our hunting-grounds, and Bashan
hounds and hunts them in an honourable
sportsmanlike manner and according to the
rules of the game. The only real blood-guilt
that lies heavy upon his head is the devouring
of the field-mice, and this, too, appears as
something incidental and negligible. It is
the scenting-out, the drive, the pursuit,
which serve him as a noble end in themselves—all
who were able to observe him at
this brilliant game would come to the same
conclusion. How beautiful he grows, how
ideal, how perfect to the end and purpose!
It is thus that the awkward and loutish
peasant lad of the hills becomes perfect and
picturesque when you see him standing
amidst the rocks and cliffs as a hunter of the
<i>Gemsbock</i>. All that is noble, genuine, and
fine in Bashan is driven to the surface and
achieves a glorious efflorescence in such
hours as these. That is why he pants for
these hours with such intensity and why he
suffers so poignantly when they pass unused.</p>

<p>Bashan is no toy spaniel; he is the
veritable woodsman and pathfinder, such as
figure heroically in books. A great joy in
himself, in his own existence cries from
every one of the martial, masculine, and
striking poses which he assumes and which
succeed one another with almost cinematographic
rapidity. There are few things
which are able so to refresh my eyes as the
sight of him, as he goes sailing through the
underbrush in a light, feathering trot and
then suddenly stands at gaze, with one paw
daintily raised and bent inward, sagacious,
vigilant, impressive, with all his faculties in
a radiant intensification. And then amidst
all this imposing statuesqueness it is possible
that he may give vent to a sudden squeak,
or yelp, occasioned, very likely, by having
caught his foot in something thorny. But
this too, is all in order with the course of
nature and with the perfection of the picture—this
cheery readiness to be splendidly
simple. It is capable of diminishing his
dignity only as a breath dims a mirror;
the superbness of his carriage is restored
the very next moment.</p>

<p>I look upon him—my Bashan—and I am
reminded of a time during which he lost
all his pride and his gallant poise, and was
once more reduced to that condition of
bodily and mental dejection in which we
first saw him in the kitchen of that tavern
in the mountains, and from which he so
painfully lifted himself to a faith in his
own personality and in life. I do not know
what ailed him—he began to bleed from the
mouth or the nose or the ears—even to-day
I have no clear idea of his particular malady.
But wherever he went in those days, he left
marks of blood behind him—in the grass
of the hunting-grounds, in the straw of his
kennel, on the floor of the house when he
entered it—and yet there was no external
injury anywhere visible. At times his entire
nose seemed to be covered with red paint.
Whenever he sneezed he would send forth
a spray of blood, and then he would step
in the drops and leave brick-red impressions
of his paws wherever he went. Careful
examinations were made, but these led to
no results and thus brought about increased
anxieties. Were his lungs attacked? or
was he afflicted by some mysterious distemper
of which we had never heard?—something
to which his breed was subject?
Since the strange as well as unpleasant
phenomena did not cease after some days, it
was decided that he must go to the Dog’s
Hospital.</p>

<p>Kindly but firmly Bashan’s master imposed
upon him on the day following—it was about
noon—the leathern muzzle—that mask of
stubborn meshes which Bashan loathes above
all things and of which he always seeks to
rid himself by violent shakings of his head
and furious rubbings of his paws. He was
fastened to the braided leash and thus
harnessed was led up the avenue—on the
left-hand side—then through the local park
and a suburban street into the group of
buildings belonging to the High School.
We passed beneath the portal and crossed
the courtyard. We then entered a waiting-room,
against the walls of which sat a number
of persons all of whom, like myself, held a
dog on a leash—dogs of different breeds
and sizes, who regarded one another with
melancholy eyes through their leather
muzzles. There was an old and motherly
dame with her fat and apoplectic pug, a
footman in livery with a tall and snow-white
Russian deerhound, who emitted from time
to time a dry and aristocratic cough; a
countryman with a <i>dachshund</i>—apparently
a case for orthopedic science, since all his
feet were planted upon his body in the most
crooked and distorted manner, and many
others. The attendant at this veterinary
clinic admitted the patients one after the
other into the adjoining consulting-room.
At length the door to this was also opened
for me and Bashan.</p>

<p>The Professor was a man of advanced
age, and was clad in a long, white operating
coat. He wore gold-rimmed spectacles,
his head was crowned with gray
curls and his whole manner was so amiable
and conveyed such an air of wise kindliness
that I would immediately have entrusted
myself and my family to him in
any emergency. Whilst I gave him my
account of things, he smiled paternally
upon his patient, who sat there in front
of him and turned up to him a pair of
humble and trustful eyes.</p>

<p>“He’s got fine eyes,” said the doctor,
without allowing Bashan’s hybrid goatee to
disturb him, and declared that he was ready
to make an investigation at once. Bashan,
quite helpless with astonishment, was now,
with the aid of the attendant, spread upon
the table. It was moving to see how the
old doctor applied the stethoscope to the
breast of the tiger-striped little manikin
and performed his auscultation, just as I
had seen it done in my case more than once.
He listened to the swift workings of the
tiny canine heart, and sounded his entire
organic internal functions from different
points of his exterior. Hereupon, tucking his
stethoscope under his arm, he began to
examine Bashan’s eyes with both hands,
his nose as well as the roof of his mouth, and
then ventured upon delivering a preliminary
prognosis.</p>

<p>The dog, said he, was a trifle nervous and
anæmic, but otherwise in good condition.
It might be epitaksis or hæmathemesis. But
it might also be a case of tracheal or pharyngeal
hemorrhage—this was by no means
precluded. For the present one would be
most inclined to call it a case of hæmoptysis.
It was necessary to keep the animal under
careful observation. I should do best to
leave him here and then call and inquire
again in the course of a week.</p>

<p>Thus instructed, I expressed my thanks
and gave Bashan a farewell pat on the
shoulder. I saw how the attendant led
Bashan across the courtyard towards the
entrance to a building at the rear, and how
Bashan, with a bewildered and anxious expression
on his face, looked back at me.
And yet he should have felt flattered, just as
I could not help feeling flattered by hearing
the Professor declare him to be nervous
and anæmic. No one who had stood at his
cradle would ever have imagined that it was
written in his horoscope that he was one
day to be said to be suffering from two such
fashionable ailments, or that Medical Science
would be called in to deliberate over him
with such gravity and solicitude.</p>

<p>From that day on my walks were to me
what unsalted food is to the palate—they
gave me little pleasure. No silent tumult
of joy burst upon me when I went out—under
way no proud, high, mad helter-skelter
of the chase surrounded me. The
park seemed to me desolate—I was bored.
I did not fail to make inquiries by telephone
during the interval of waiting. The answer,
communicated from some subordinate
quarter, was to the effect that the health
of the patient was as good as could be
expected under the circumstances—circumstances
which, for good reasons or for bad,
one did not trouble to designate more
clearly. As soon as the day arrived on
which I had taken Bashan to the veterinary
institution, and the week was up, I once
more made my way to the place.</p>

<p>Guided by numerous signboards with
inscriptions and pointing hands, liberally
affixed to walls and doors, I managed, without
going astray, to negotiate the door of the
clinical department which sheltered Bashan.
In accordance with the command upon an
enamelled plate on the door, I forbore to
knock, and walked in. The rather large
room in which I found myself gave me the
impression of a wild-beast house in a
menagerie. The atmosphere incidental to
such a house also prevailed here, with the
exception that the odour of the menagerie
seemed to be mingled here with all kinds
of sweetish medicinal vapours—a cloying
and rather disturbing mixture. Cages with
bars were set all around the walls, and nearly
all of them were occupied. Resolute barks
saluted me from one of these. A man,
evidently the keeper, was busy with a rake
and a shovel before the open door of one
of these cages. He was pleased to respond
to my greeting without interrupting his
work, and then left me for the present
entirely to my own impressions.</p>

<p>My first survey of the scene, whilst the
door was still open, had at once revealed to
me the whereabouts of Bashan, and so I
went up to him. He lay behind the bars
of his cage upon some loose stuff which
must have been made of tan-bark or something
similar, and which added its own
peculiar aroma to the odour of the animals
and of the carbolic acid or lysoform. He
lay there like a leopard, though a very
weary, very disinterested and disappointed
leopard. I was shocked by the sullen
indifference with which he greeted my
entrance and advance. He merely gave a
feeble thump or two upon the floor of his
cage with his tail, and only after I had spoken
to him did he deign to raise his head from
his paws, but only to drop it again almost
immediately and to blink moodily to one
side. A stoneware vessel full of water stood
at the back of his cage. Outside, attached
to the bars of his cage, there was a small
wooden frame with a card, partly-printed,
partly hand-written, which contained an
account of Bashan’s name, breed, sex, and
age. Beneath this there was a fever-index
curve.</p>

<p>“Bastard setter,” I read. Name: Bashan.
Male. Two years old. Brought in on
such and such a day and month of the year—to
be observed for occult hemorrhages.
And then followed the curve of Bashan’s
temperature, drawn in ink and showing no
great variations. There were also details in
figures regarding the frequency of Bashan’s
pulse. So his temperature was being taken
and even his pulse counted—nothing was
lacking in this respect. It was his frame of
mind which occasioned me worry.</p>

<p>“Is that one yourn?” asked the attendant
who, implements in hand, had in the meantime
approached me. He was a stocky,
round-bearded and red-cheeked man, wearing
a kind of gardener’s apron, with brown,
somewhat bloodshot eyes, the moist and
honest glances of which had something
astonishingly dog-like in them.</p>

<p>I answered his question in the affirmative,
referred to the order I had received to call
again to-day, to the telephone conversations
I had carried on, and declared that I had
come to see how everything stood. The
man cast a glance at the card. Yes, he said,
the dog was suffering from occult hemorrhages,
and that kind of thing always took
a long time—especially if one didn’t know
where the hemorrhages came from. Well,
wasn’t that always the case? No, one didn’t
know anything about it as yet. But the
dog was there to be observed and he was
being observed. The hemorrhages were
still occurring, were they? Yes, they came
on now and then. And they were being
observed? Yes, most carefully.</p>

<p>“Has he any fever?” I asked, trying to
make something out of the chart hanging
on the bars. No, no fever. The dog had
quite a normal temperature and pulse, about
ninety beats in the minute—that was the
normal number, that was about right, they
ought not to be less, but if they were fewer,
then he would have to be observed still more
sharply. The dog—if it wasn’t for these
here occult hemorrhages, was really in pretty
good condition. Of course he had howled
at first, a full twenty-four hours, but after
that he had got used to things. Of course,
he didn’t eat much, but then he got very
little exercise, and it was also a question of
how much he was accustomed to eat. What
food did they give him? Soup, said the
man. But as he had already remarked, the
dog didn’t eat much of it.</p>

<p>“He has a very depressed look,” I said,
affecting an expert air. Yes, no doubt of
that, said the man, but then that didn’t
really mean much. For it wasn’t very nice
for a dog to have to be cooped up in that
way and be observed. They were all
depressed more or less, that is to say, the
good-natured ones, but there were some as
got mean and nasty. But he couldn’t say
as this here dog had. This dog of mine was
a good-natured sort and wouldn’t think of
biting—even though one were to observe
him till Doomsday. I agreed with what the
man said, though indignation and anxiety
gnawed at my heart. How long, I asked him,
did one think it was necessary to keep
Bashan here? The man cast another glance
at the chart. Another week, he remarked,
would be necessary to observe him properly—that’s
what the Professor had said. I
might come after another week and inquire
again—that would make two weeks in all,
and then I would be able to get exact
information about the dog and about curing
his occult hemorrhages.</p>

<p>I went—after I had made another attempt
to cheer up Bashan’s spirits by talking to
him. But he was as little affected by my
going away as by my coming. He seemed
to be oppressed by a feeling of dark
hopelessness—and contempt. “Since you
have been capable,” his attitude seemed to
declare, “of having me put into this cage, I
expect nothing more from you.” And was
it not in truth enough to make him despair
of all reason and justice? What had he done
that this should happen to him? How came
it that I not only permitted it, but even
took the initial steps? I had meant to
act well by him. He had begun to bleed
from the nose, and though this did not appear
to disturb him in any way, I had nevertheless
thought it fitting that veterinary science
should be consulted, as befitted a dog in
good circumstances, and I had also learned
that he was rather anæmic and nervous—like
the daughter of an earl. How could I
know that such a fate awaited him? How
could I make him understand that he was
having honours and attention bestowed upon
him by being locked behind bars—like a
jaguar—in being deprived of air, sunshine,
and exercise, and instead of being able to
enjoy these blessings, tormented with a
thermometer day after day?</p>

<p>Such were the questions which I put to
myself as I walked home. Whilst I had up
to then only missed Bashan, I now began
to be afflicted with a positive anxiety for
him, for the welfare of his soul, and was
forced to contend with doubt and self-accusatory
thoughts. After all, was it not
mere vanity and egoistic conceit which had
induced me to take him to this canine infirmary?
Besides, was it not possible, that a secret
wish had been the wellspring of this
action, a wish to get rid of him for a time,
a certain ignoble curiosity to free myself
from his incessant watching, and to see how
it would feel to be able to turn calmly to
the right or to the left without bringing
about emotional cataclysms in the animated
world without—emotional tempests whether
of joy or sorrow, or bitter disillusionment?
It was not to be denied—since Bashan’s
internment I was enjoying a definite feeling
of independence such as I had not known
for a long time. When I glanced through the
glass door of my study there was no one
there to annoy me with the spectacle of his
martyrdom of patience. No one came with
paw hesitatingly raised, so that, giving way
to a burst of pitying laughter, I should be
forced to deny my own fixed resolution and
go forth earlier than I had intended. No
one questioned my right to go into the
house or into the park, just as the spirit
moved me. This was a comfortable condition
of things, quieting and full of the charm
of novelty. But as the accustomed incentive
was lacking, I almost ceased to go walking
at all. My health suffered in consequence,
and whilst my condition grew to be remarkably
like that of Bashan in his
cage, I indulged in the moral reflection
that the fetters of sympathy would have
been more conducive to my own comfort
than the egoistic freedom for which I had
panted.</p>

<p>The second week elapsed in good time,
and so, on the day appointed, I and the
bearded attendant stood once more in front
of Bashan’s barred habitation. The inmate
lay upon his side, stretched out in a posture
of absolute indifference upon the tan-bark
of his cage, bits of which flecked his coat.
He was staring backward at the chalky wall
of his prison with eyes that were glassy and
dull. He did not move. His breathing
was scarcely perceptible. Only, from time
to time, his chest—which displayed every
rib—rose in a sob which he breathed forth
with a soft and heartrending tremolo of his
vocal chords. His legs seemed to have grown
too long, his paws huge and unshapely—due
to his terrible emaciation. His coat was
extremely rough and dishevelled and crushed,
and, as already remarked, soiled from wallowing
in the tan-bark. He paid no attention
to me, and it seemed that he would never
again be able to summon up enough energy
to take an interest in anything.</p>

<p>The hemorrhages, said the attendant, had
not quite disappeared—they still happened
now and then. Their origin was not as
yet quite clear, but in any case they were
of a harmless nature. I was free to leave
the dog there for a still longer period of
observation—in order to make quite sure—or
I might take him home with me, where
he would no doubt get rid of the evil—all
in good time. I then drew out the plaited
leather leash from my pocket and said that
I would take Bashan with me. The attendant
thought that would be very sensible.
He opened the barred door and we both
called Bashan by name, alternately and
both together—but he did not stir. He
merely kept staring at the whitewashed
wall opposite. He made no resistance
when I thrust my arm into the cage
and pulled him out by the collar. He
gave a kind of convulsive flounce about
and landed on his legs on the floor.
There he stood with his tail between his
legs, his ears retracted, a very picture of
misery.</p>

<p>I picked him up, gave the attendant a tip,
and left the ward of this canine hospital.
I then proceeded to pay my bill in the office
of the institution. This bill, at seventy-five
pfennigs a day and the veterinary’s fee for
the first examination, amounted to twelve
marks, fifty pfennigs. I then led Bashan
home, clothed in the stern yet sweetish
atmosphere of the clinic which still permeated
my companion’s coat.</p>

<p>He was broken in body and in soul.
Animals are more unrestrained and primitive,
less subject to inhibitions of all kinds,
and therefore in a certain sense more human
in the physical expression of their moods
than we. Forms and figures of speech which
survive among us only in a kind of mental
or moral translation, or as metaphors, are
still true and valid when applied to them.
They live up to the expression in the fullest,
freshest sense of the term—and in this there
is something wonderfully enlivening to the
eye. Bashan, as one would say, “let his
head hang,” or “had a hang-dog look.”
He did actually hang his head—hung it low
like some wrack of a wornout cab-horse
which, with abscesses on its legs and periodical
shivers undulant along its sides, stands
at its post with a hundredweight of woe
pulling its poor nose, swarming with flies,
towards the pavement.</p>

<p>These two weeks, at the veterinary high
school, as I have already said, had reduced
him to the very condition in which I had
first found him in the foot-hills. Perhaps
I ought to say that he was only the shadow
of himself—if this would not be an insult
to the proud and joyous Bashan. The smell
of the dog-hospital which he had brought
with him, vanished in the wash trays, after
several ablutions with soap and hot
water—vanished—all save a few floating and
rebellious whiffs. A bath may be said to exercise
a spiritual influence, may be said to possess
a symbolic significance to us human beings—but
no one would dare to say that the physical
cleansing of poor Bashan, meant the restoration
of his customary spirits. I took him to
the hunting-grounds on the very first day
of his home-coming. But he went slinking
at my heels with silly look and lolling
tongue, and the pheasants were jubilant
over a close season. At home he would
remain lying for days as I had last seen him
stretched out in his cage at the hospital,
and staring with glassy eyes, inwardly limp
and without a trace of his wholesome impatience,
without making a single attempt
to force me to go forth for a walk. On the
contrary I was forced to fetch him from
his berth at the tiny door of his kennel
and to spur him on and up. Even the
wild and indiscriminate way in which he
wolfed his food, reminded me of his sordid
youth.</p>

<p>And then it was a great joy to see how
he found himself again, how his greeting
gradually took on the old, warm-hearted,
playful impetuosity, how, instead of coming
towards me with a sullen limp, he would
once more come storming upon me in
swift response to my morning whistle, so
that he might put his forepaws on my chest
and snap at my face. It was wonderful to
see how the joy in his mere body and in his
senses returned to him in the wide spaces
and the open air—and to observe those
daring and picturesque positions he would
assume, those swift plunging pounces with
drawn-up feet which he would make upon
some tiny creature in the high grass—all
these things came back and refreshed my
eyes. Bashan began to forget. That hateful
incident of his internment, an incident so
absolutely senseless from Bashan’s point of
view, sank into oblivion, unredeemed, to be
sure, unexplained by any clear understanding—something
which, after all, would have
been impossible. But time swallowed it up
and enveloped it, even as time must heal
these things where human beings are concerned,
and so we went on with our lives
as before, whilst the inexpressible thing sank
deeper and deeper into forgetfulness. For
some weeks longer it happened that Bashan
would occasionally sport an incarnadined
nose, then the phenomenon vanished, and
became a thing of the past. And so, after
all, it mattered little whether it had been a
case of epistaksis or of hæmathemesis. . . .</p>

<p>There—I have told the story of the clinic—against
my own better resolution. May
the reader forgive this lengthy digression
and return with me to the chase in the
hunting-grounds which we had interrupted.
Ah, have you ever heard that tearful yowling
with which a dog, mustering his utmost
forces, takes up the pursuit of a rabbit in
flight—that yowling in which fury and bliss,
longing and ecstatic despair mix and mingle?
How often have I heard Bashan give vent
to this! It is a grand passion, desired, sought
for and deliriously enjoyed which goes
ringing through the landscape, and every
time this wild cry comes to my ear from near
or far, I am given a shock of pleasant fright,
and the thrill goes tingling through all my
limbs. Then I hurry forwards, or to the
left or right, rejoicing that Bashan is to get
his money’s worth to-day, and I strive
mightily to bring the chase within my range
of vision. And when this chase goes storming
past me in full and furious career, I
stand banned and tense, even though the
negative outcome of the venture is certain
from the beginning, and I look on whilst
an excited smile draws taut the muscles of
my face.</p>

<p>And what of the rabbit—the timid, the
tricky? He switches his ears through the
air, crocks his head backwards at an angle,
and runs for dear life in long, lunging leaps,
throwing his whitish-yellow scut into the
air. Thus he goes scratching and scudding
in front of Bashan, who is howling inwardly.
And yet the rabbit in the depths of his
fearsome and flighty soul ought to know
that he is in no serious danger and that he
will manage to escape, just as his brothers
and sisters and he himself have always
managed to escape. Not once in all his
life has Bashan managed to catch a single
rabbit, and it is practically beyond the
bounds of possibility that he ever should.
Many dogs, as the old proverb goes, bring
about the death of the rabbit—a clear proof
that a single dog cannot manage it. For the
rabbit is a master of the quick and sudden
turn-about—a feat quite beyond the capacity
of Bashan, and it is this feat which decides
the whole matter. It is an infallible weapon
and an attribute of the animal that is born
to fight with flight—a means of escape which
can be applied at any moment and which it
carries in its instincts in order to put it
into use at precisely that moment when victory
is almost within Bashan’s grasp. And alas, Bashan
is then betrayed and sold.</p>

<p>Here they come shooting diagonally
through the woods, flash across the path on
which I am standing, and then go dashing
towards the river, the rabbit dumb and
bearing his inherited trick in his heart,
Bashan yammering in high and heady tones.
“No howling now!” I say or think to
myself. “You are wasting strength, strength
of lung, strength of breath, which you ought
to be saving up and concentrating—so that
you can grab him!” I am forced to think
thus, because I am on Bashan’s side, because
his passion is infectious—imperatives which
force me to hope fervently that he will
succeed—even at the peril of seeing him
tear the rabbit to pieces before my eyes.
Ah, how he runs! How beautiful it is,
how edifying to see a living creature unfolding
all its forces in some supreme effort.
My dog runs better than this rabbit; his
muscular system is stronger; the distance
between them has visibly diminished—ere
they are lost to sight. I leave the path and
hurry through the park towards the left,
going in the direction of the river-bank. I
emerge upon the gravelly street just in time
to see the mad chase come ravening on
from the right—the hopeful, infinitely
thrilling chase—for Bashan is almost at
the heels of the rabbit. He is silent now;
he is running with his teeth set, the close
proximity of the scent urges him to the
final effort.</p>

<p>“One last plunge, Bashan,” I think, and
would like to shout to him—“just one
more—aim well! keep cool! And beware of
the turnabout!” But these thoughts have
scarcely flashed through my brain than the
“turnabout,” the “hook,” the <i>volte-face</i>,
has taken place—the catastrophe is upon us.
My gallant dog makes the decisive forward
plunge—but . . . at the selfsame moment
there is a short jerk, and with pert and
limber swiftness the rabbit switches aside at
a right angle to the course—and Bashan goes
shooting past the hindquarters of his quarry—shooting
straight ahead, howling, desperate
and with all his feet stemmed as brakes—so
that the dust and gravel go flying. By the
time he has overcome his momentum, flung
himself right about and gained leeway in
the new direction—whilst, I say, he has
done this in agony of soul and with wailings
of woe, the rabbit has won a considerable
handicap towards the woods—yes, he is
even lost to the eyes of his pursuer, for
during the convulsive application of his four
brakes, the pursuer could not see whither
the pursued had turned.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” I think, “it may be
beautiful, but it is surely futile.” The wild
pursuit vanishes in the distances of the park
and in the opposite direction. “There
ought to be more dogs—five or six—a whole
pack of dogs! There ought to be dogs to
cut him off on the flank, dogs to cut him off
ahead, dogs to drive him into a corner, dogs
to be in at the death.” And in my mind’s
eye, in my excitement, I behold a whole
pack of fox-hounds with lolling tongues go
storming upon the rabbit in their midst.</p>

<p>I think these things and dream these
dreams out of a sheer passion for the chase,
for what has the rabbit done to me that I
should wish him to meet with so terrible
an end? It is true that Bashan is closer
to me than the long-eared one, and it is
quite in order that I should share his feelings
and accompany him with my good wishes
for his success. But then the rabbit is also
a warm, furry, breathing bit of our common
life. He has played his trick upon my
hunting dog not out of malice, but out of
the urgent wish to be able to nibble soft
tree-shoots a little longer and to bring forth
young.</p>

<p>Nevertheless my thoughts continue to
weave themselves about the matter and
about. As, for example: “It would, of
course, be quite another matter, if this”—and
I lift and regard the walking-stick in my
hand—“if this cane here were not so useless
and benign an instrument, but a thing of
more serious construction and constitution,
pregnant with lightning and operative at a
distance, by means of which I could come
to the assistance of the gallant Bashan and
hold up the rabbit, so that he would remain
flop upon the spot—after doing a fine <i>salto
mortale.</i> Then there would be no need of
other hounds, and Bashan would have done
his duty if he had merely brought me the
rabbit.”</p>

<p>The way things shape themselves, however,
it is Bashan who sometimes goes
tumbling head over heels when he tries to
meet and counter that damnable quick turn,
and sometimes it is also the rabbit who does
the somersault, though this is a mere trifle
to the latter, something quite in order and
inconsequential and certainly by no means
identified with any feeling of abject misery.
For Bashan, however, it means a severe concussion,
which might some time or other
lead to his breaking his neck.</p>

<p>Often a rabbit-chase comes to an end in
a few minutes, that is to say, when the
rabbit succeeds after a few hot lengths of
running, in ducking into the underbrush
and hiding, or in throwing his pursuer off
his trail by means of feints and quick double
turns, so that the four-legged hunter, sorely
puzzled and uncertain, jumps hither and
thither, whilst I shout bloodthirsty advice
to him and with frantic gesticulations of my
cane try to point out to him the direction
in which I saw the rabbit escape.</p>

<p>Sometimes the hunt extends itself throughout
the length and breadth of the landscape,
so that Bashan’s voice, wildly yowling,
sounds like a hunting-horn ringing through
the region from afar, now nearer and now
farther away, whilst I, awaiting his return,
calmly go my ways. And, great Heavens!
in what a condition he <i>does</i> return! Foam
drips from his jaws, his thighs are lax and
hollow, his ribs flutter, his tongue hangs
long and loose from his maw, inordinately
gaping, something which causes his drunken
and swimming eyes to appear distorted and
slant, Mongolian, the while his breathing
goes like a steam-engine.</p>

<p>“Lie down, Bashan!” I command him,
“take a rest, or you’ll have apoplexy of the
lungs!” I halt so as to give him time to
recover. In winter when there is a cold
frost and I see him pumping the icy air with
hoarse pantings into his overheated interior
and then puffing it forth in the form of
white steam, or else swallowing whole handfuls
of snow in order to cool his thirst, I
grow quite terrified. Nevertheless, whilst
he lies there, gazing up at me with confused
eye, now and again snapping up his dribblings,
I cannot refrain from poking a bit
of fun at him, because of the unalterable
futility of his efforts.</p>

<p>“Bashan! where’s that rabbit! Aren’t
you going to fetch me that rabbit!” Then
he begins to thump the ground with his tail,
and interrupts for a moment whilst I am
speaking the spasmodic pumping machinery
of his sides. He snaps in embarrassment,
for he does not know that my ridicule is
intended merely to conceal from him and
from myself an accretion of shame and
guilty conscience, because I, on my part,
was not man enough to “hold up” the
rabbit—as is the duty of a real master. He
is unaware of all this, and so it is easy for
me to make fun and to put the matter as
though <i>he</i> were in some way to blame. . . .</p>

<p>Strange things sometimes occur during
these hunts. I shall never forget how the
rabbit once ran into my very arms. It
happened along the river, or rather upon the
small and clayey bank above it. Bashan was
in full cry after his quarry and I was approaching
the zone of the river-bank from the
direction of the wood. I broke through the
thistle stalks along the gravel slope and
sprang down the grass-covered declivity on to
the path at the very moment that the rabbit,
with Bashan some fifteen paces behind him,
was coming towards me in long bounds
from the direction of the ferryman’s house,
towards which I was turning. Bunny came
running along the middle of the path straight
towards me. . . .</p>

<p>My first, hunter-like and hostile impulse
was to take advantage of the situation and to
bar his way, driving him, if possible, back
into the jaws of his pursuer, who came on
yelping in poignant joy. There I stood, as
though rooted to the spot, and, slave that I
was to the fever of the chase, I simply
balanced the stick in my hand whilst the
rabbit came nearer and nearer. I knew
that a rabbit’s vision is very poor, that alone
the sense of hearing and the sense of smell
are able to convey warnings to him. He
might therefore possibly mistake me for a
tree as I stood there—it was my plan and
my lively desire that he should do this, and so
succumb to a fatal error, the consequences
of which were not quite clear to me, but of
which I nevertheless thought to make use.
Whether the rabbit really made such an
error during the course of his advance, is
not quite clear. . . . I believe that he
noticed me only at the very last moment,
for what he did was so unexpected that all
my schemes and deliberations were at once
reduced to nothing, and a deep, sudden, and
startling change took place in my state of
mind.</p>

<p>Was the little animal beside itself with
mortal fear? Enough, it leaped upon me,
just like a little dog, ran up my overcoat
with its tiny paws, and, still upright,
struggled to bore itself into the depths of
my chest—the terrible chest of the master of
the chase. With upraised arms and my
body bent backwards, I stood there and
looked down upon the rabbit who, on his
part, looked up at me. We stood thus for
only a second, perhaps it was only the
fraction of a second, but thus and there we
stood. I saw him with such strange, disconcerting
minuteness, saw his long ears,
of which one stood upright, whilst the other
hung down, saw his great, clear, protuberant,
short-sighted eyes, his rough lip, and the
long hairs of his whiskers, the white on his
breast and the little paws. I felt, or seemed
to feel the pounding of his harried little
heart. It was very strange to see him thus
plainly and to have him so close to me, the
little familiar spirit of the place, the secret
throbbing heart of the landscape, this ever
evasive creature which I had seen only for a
few brief moments in its meadows and downs
as it went scudding comically away. And
now in the extremity of its need and helplessness
it was nestling up against me and
clutching my coat, clutching at the breast
of a man—not the man, it seemed to me,
who was Bashan’s master, but the breast
of one who is also the master of the rabbit
and of Bashan and of Bashan’s master.
This lasted, as I have said, only a brief
moment or so, and then the rabbit had
dropped off, had once more taken to his
unequal legs and jumped down the escarpment
to the left, whilst Bashan had now
arrived in his place—Bashan with horrible
hue-and-cry and with all the heady tones of
his frenetic hunting-howls—all of which
suffered swift interruption on his arrival.
For a well-aimed blow of the stick delivered
with malice prepense by the master of the
rabbit, sent him yelping with smarting
hindquarters down the slope to the right,
up which he was forced to climb—with a
limp—before he was once more able, after
considerable delay, to take up the trail of the
no longer visible quarry.</p>

<p>And then finally there is the hunt after
water-fowl to which I must also dedicate
a few lines. This hunt can take place only
during winter and the colder part of the
spring, before the birds migrate from their
quarters near the city to the lakes—the
suburbs here serving them merely as a kind
of emergency halting-place in obedience
to the demands of the stomach. This hunt
is less exciting than the rabbit hunt is likely
to be, but like this it has something that is
attractive both to hunter and to hound,
or rather to the hunter and his master. The
master is captivated by these forays after
the wild fowl chiefly in consideration of the
landscape, since the friendly nearness of the
water is connected with them, but also
because it diverts and edifies him to study
the form of life practised by these swimmers
and flyers, thus emerging a little out of
his own rut and experimenting with
theirs.</p>

<p>The attitude towards life assumed by the
ducks is more amiable, more bourgeois, and
more comfortable than that of the gulls.
Nearly always they appear to be full and
contented, little troubled by the cares of
subsistence—no doubt because they always
chance to find what they seek, and because the
table, so to speak, is always set for them.
For, as I observe, they eat nearly everything—worms,
snails, insects, or even green ooze
from the water, and enjoy vast stretches of
leisure which enable them to sit and sun
themselves on the stones, with bills tucked
comfortably under one wing for a little
siesta or preening and oiling their plumage
so that it does not come into contact with
the water at all, but rather causes this to
pearl off from the surface in a string of
nervous drops. Or you may catch them
going for a mere pleasure ride or swim
upon the racing stream, lifting their pointed
tails into the air, and turning and twisting
and shrugging their shoulders in bland self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>But in the nature of the gulls there is
something wild and hectic, dreary and sad and
monotonous; they are invested with an air
of desperate and hungry depredation. Almost
all day long they go crying around the
waterfall in bevies and in slant transverse
flight, or curving about the place where the
brownish waters pour from the mouths of
the great pipes into the stream. For the
swift, darting plunge for fish which some of
these gulls practise is scarcely sufficiently
rich in results to still their raw and ranging
mass-hunger, and the titbits with which
they are frequently forced to content themselves
as they swoop above the overflows
and carry away mysterious fragments in
their bent beaks, must sometimes be far from
appetising. They do not like the banks of
the river. But when the water is low they
stand and huddle in close crowds upon the
rocks, which are then free of water, and
these they cover with their white feathery
masses—just as the crags and islets of the
northern seas squirm and writhe with untold
numbers of nesting eider-ducks.</p>

<p>When Bashan, barking from the shore
across the intervening flood, threatens their
security, then it is a fine sight to see them
all rise simultaneously into the air with loud
cries and caws. But there is no need of
their feeling themselves menaced; there
is no real danger. For quite apart from
his inborn aversion to water, Bashan harbours
a very wise and entirely justifiable fear of
the current of the river. He knows that his
strength could not possibly cope with this
and that it would infallibly bear him off,
God knows whither or to what distances,
presumably as far as the Danube, where he
would arrive, however, in an extremely
disfigured condition. This is a contingency
of which we have already had ocular evidence
in the shape of bloated cadavers of cats
which were en route to those far-off parts.
He will never venture into the river farther
than the first submerged stones that line
the bank—even though the fierce and ecstatic
lust of the chase should be tugging at his
limbs—even though he should wear a mien
as though he were about to plunge himself
into the waves—yes, the very next moment!
Full confidence, however, may be placed in
his caution, which remains active and vigilant
beneath all this external show of passionate
abandon. There is a distinct purpose behind
all these mimetic onsets, these spectacular
preparations for action—they are empty
threats which in the last analysis are not really
dictated by passion at all, but are calculated
with the utmost <i>sangfroid</i> merely to intimidate
the webfooted foe.</p>

<p>But the gulls, true to their names, are
far too poorly equipped in head and heart to
be capable of mocking his efforts. Bashan
cannot get at them, but he can send his
barks against them, send his voice thundering
across the water. This voice has the effect
of something material—an onset which flutters
them and cows them and which they are
unable to resist for long. True, they make
the attempt to do so; they remain seated,
but an uneasy movement goes through the
writhing mass. They turn their heads, ever
and anon one of them will lift its wings upon
a chance, until suddenly the whole crew,
like a whitish cloud, from the core of
which come bitter and fatalistic caws, goes
rustling and rushing up into the air—with
Bashan jumping about hither and
thither on the stones in order to scare and
scatter them and keep them in motion. For
that is the thing to do—to keep them in
motion—they must not be permitted to rest;
they must fly up-stream and down-stream,
so that he may chase them.</p>

<p>Bashan goes scouring along the banks,
nosing along their entire length, for everywhere
there are ducks at rest, with bills
tucked cunningly and comfortably under
their wings, and wherever he chances to go
they fly up in front of his nose, so that his
progress is like a gay sweeping-clean and
whirling up of the entire strip of sand. They
glide and plump into the water which buoys
and turns them about in security, or they
go flying over his head with bills and necks
outstretched, whilst Bashan, running along
the bank, measures the power of his legs
with that of their pinions.</p>

<p>He is ravished and grateful if they will
but fly, if they will only deign to give
him an opportunity for a bit of glorious
coursing up and down the river. They are
no doubt aware of these wishes of his, and
are even capable of utilising them for their
own benefit. I saw a mother duck with her
brood—it was in the spring, and the river
was already void of birds—this one alone
had remained behind with her young who
were not yet able to fly, and she was guarding
them in a slime-covered puddle which had
been left by the last flood-water and which
filled a depression in the dry bed of the
stream. It was there that Bashan chanced
upon them—I observed the scene from the
upper way. He sprang into the puddle,
sprang into it with barkings and savage
truculent motions, and scattered the family
of ducks in a most deplorable fashion. To
be sure, he did no harm to any member of
this family, but he frightened them all
beyond expression, and the ducklings, flapping
their stumps of wings, plunged wildly
in all directions.</p>

<p>The mother duck, however, was seized by
that maternal heroism which will hurl itself
blindly and full of mad courage even against
the most formidable foe in order to protect
the brood, and which frequently knows how
to bewilder and fluster this foe by a delirious
courage which apparently exceeds the limits
of nature. With every feather ruffled and
with bill horribly agape, the bird fluttered
repeatedly against Bashan’s face in attack
after attack, making one heroic offensive
after another against him, hissing portentously
the while. And actually her wild and
uncompromising aspect brought about a
confused retreat on the part of the enemy,
without, however, inducing him to quit the
field of battle for good, for with a great
hullabaloo and clamour he still persisted
in advancing anew. The duck-mother there-upon
changed her tactics and chose the
part of wisdom since heroism had shown
itself to be impracticable. It is more than
likely that she knew Bashan from some
previous experience, was fully acquainted
with his weaknesses and childish desires. So
she abandoned her little ones—that is, she
<i>apparently</i> abandoned them. She took refuge
in cunning, flew up, flew across the river,
“pursued” by Bashan—pursued, as was his
firm belief—whilst in reality it was she who
led him, led him by the fool’s tether of his
dominant passion. She flew with the stream,
then against it, farther and farther, whilst
Bashan raced beside her, so far down-stream
and away from the puddle with the ducklings
that I lost sight of both the duck and the
dog as I walked on. Later on my good
dolt came back to me, quite winded and
panting furiously. But when we again
passed that puddle, it was empty of its
erstwhile tenants.</p>

<p>Such were the tactics of the mother-duck,
and Bashan was sincerely grateful. But he
abominates those ducks who in the sleek
placidity of their bourgeois-like existence,
refuse to serve him as objects of the hunt,
and who, whenever he comes tearing along,
simply let themselves slip into the water from
the stones along the banks, and then in
ignoble security rock themselves before his
nose, not impressed in the least by his mighty
voice, and not in the least deceived, like the
nervous gulls, by his theatrical lunges towards
the river.</p>

<p>There we stand on the stones, side by side,
Bashan and I, and there, two paces from us,
in insolent security, the duck sways lightly
upon the waves, with her bill pressed in
pretentious dignity against her breast, and
though stormed at by Bashan’s maddened
voice, absolutely undisturbed in her serenity,
soberness, and common sense. She keeps
rowing against the current, so that she
remains approximately in about the same
spot. For all that she is drawn a little down-stream.
Only a yard or two from her there
is a whirlpool, a beautiful foaming cascade
towards which she turns her conceited and
upstanding tail. Bashan barks and braces
his forefeet against the stones, and inwardly
I bark with him, for I cannot forbear sharing
some of his feelings of hatred against the
duck and her cool, insolent, matter-of-factness,
and so I hope that evil may overtake
her.</p>

<p>“Pay at least some attention to our barking,”
is the mental speech I hurl at her,
“and not to the rapids, so that you may be
drawn by accident into the whirlpool and
thus expose yourself to danger and discomfiture
before our eyes.” But this angry hope
of mine is also doomed to remain unfulfilled,
for precisely at the moment when she nears
the edge of the cascade in the stream, the
duck flutters a bit and flies a few yards upstream
and sits down in the water once more—the
shameless hussy!</p>

<p>I am unable to think of the vexation with
which we both contemplate the duck under
these circumstances without recalling to
mind an adventure which I shall recount at
the close. It was attended by a certain
satisfaction for me and my companion, and
yet there was something painful in it, something
disturbing and confusing. Yes, it even
led to a temporary chill in the relationship
between Bashan and myself, and could I
have foreseen this, I would rather have
avoided the spot where this adventure awaited
us.</p>

<p>It was a good distance out and down-stream,
and beyond the ferryman’s house—there
where the wilderness of the river bank
approaches close to the upper road along the
river. We were going along this, I with a
leisurely step, and Bashan, a trifle in front
of me, with an easy and somewhat lop-sided
lope. He had been chasing a rabbit, or, if
you prefer, had permitted himself to be
chased by him. He had also routed out three
or four pheasants and was now graciously
minded to pay a little attention to me, so
that his master might not feel utterly
neglected. A small bevy of ducks with
extended necks and in triangular formation
flew over the river. They were flying pretty
high and closer to the other bank than to
ours, so that we could not consider them
as game at all, so far as hunting purposes
were concerned. They flew in the direction
in which we were walking, without regarding
us or even being aware of our
presence, and we too merely cast a desultory
and intentionally indifferent glance at
them.</p>

<p>It then came to pass that on the farther
bank, which was of the same steepness as
our own, a man came beating out of the
bushes. As soon as he had stepped upon the
scene of action he assumed a pose which
caused both of us, Bashan as well as myself,
to halt and to turn round and face him and
watch what he would do. He was a rather
tall, fine figure of a man, somewhat rough
and ready, so far as his externals were concerned.
He had drooping moustaches and
wore puttees, a small green Alpine hat
which was well pulled over his forehead,
wide, loose trousers which were made of
a kind of hard velveteen or so-called
corduroy or Manchester cloth, and a
jacket to match. This was behung with
all kinds of belts and leather contraptions,
for he carried a <i>rucksack</i> strapped
to his back and a gun which also hung
from a strap. Or it would be more
proper to say that he had carried this, for
scarcely had he come into view, than he
drew the weapon towards him and leaning
his cheek aslant against the butt, raised the
barrel obliquely towards the heavens. He
had set one be-putteed leg in front of the
other, the barrel rested in the hollow of his
extended left hand with the elbow bent
under this—the other elbow, however, that
of the right arm, the hand of which rested
on the trigger, was extended very sharply
towards the side. It revealed his face with
squinting, aiming eye, much foreshortened
and boldly exposed to the clear light of the
skies.</p>

<p>There was something most decidedly
operatic in this apparition of the man as he
stood reared against the skies amidst this
open-air scenery of bushes, river, and
sky. Our intense and respectful regard,
however, endured for only a moment—then
there came the dull, flat report
from over yonder—something which I
had attended with great inner tension and
which therefore caused me to start. A
tiny jet of light, pale in the broad of
day, blazed forth at the same time, and
was followed by a tiny cloudlet of smoke
that puffed after it. The man then inclined
himself forward and once more
his attitude and his action were reminiscent
of the opera. And with the gun
hanging from the strap, which he clutched
in his right fist, he raised his face towards
the skies. Something was going on up
there, whither we too were now staring.
There was a brief, confused scattering—the
triangle of ducks flew apart, a wild,
panic-stricken fluttering ensued, as when a
puff of wind sets loose sails a-snapping, an
attempt at a glide—as of an aeroplane—followed,
then suddenly the body which
had been struck became a mere inanimate
object and fell swift as a stone upon the
surface of the water near the opposite
bank.</p>

<p>This was only the first half of the proceedings.
But I must interrupt my narrative
here in order to turn the living light of
my memory upon Bashan. There are a
number of coined phrases and ready-made
figures of speech which I might use for
describing his behaviour—current terms—terms
which in most cases would be both
valid and appropriate. I might say, for
example, that he was thunderstruck. But
this term does not please me, and I do not
wish to use it. Big words, the big, well-worn
words, are not very suitable for expressing
the extraordinary. One may best
achieve this by intensifying the small words
and forcing them to ascend to the very acme
of their meaning. So I will say no more
than that Bashan <i>started</i> at the report of the
gun and the accompanying phenomena—and
that this starting was the same as that
which is peculiar to him when confronted
with something striking, and that all this
was well known to me though it was now
elevated to the <i>n</i>th degree. It was a start
which flung his whole body backward,
wobbling to right and left, a start which
jerked his head in rash recoil against
his chest and which, in recovering himself,
almost tore his head from his
shoulders, a start which seemed to cry
from every fibre of his being: “What,
what! <i>What</i> was that? Hold! in the
name of a hundred thousand devils! <i>How</i>
was that!”</p>

<p>He listened to—he regarded everything
with a kind of indignation such as extremes
of surprise are apt to cause—drank everything
in, as it were, and there in his heart
of hearts these things were already existing—there,
in some form or other they had
always been—no matter what astounding
novelties may have been sprung upon him
here. Yes, whenever these things came upon
him, causing him to leap to the right and
the left and turn himself half around his own
axis, it always seemed to me as though he
were attempting to catch a glimpse of himself
and inquiring: “What am I? Who
am I? Am I really I?” At the very
moment in which the corpse of the duck
fell upon the water, Bashan made a leap
forward, towards the edge of the escarpment,
as though he wished to go down into
the river-bed and plunge himself into the
water. But then he thought of the current,
clamped the brakes upon this sudden impulse,
grew ashamed, and once more confined
his efforts to staring.</p>

<p>I regarded him with anxiety. After the
fall of the duck, I was of the opinion that
we had seen enough, and proposed that
we should go on. But he had already
sat himself down upon his haunches.
His face, with ears erected to their utmost
extent, was addressed towards the
other bank, and when I said to him:
“Well, Bashan, shall we go on?” he
merely gave a flirt of his head in my
direction, as though one should say, not
without a certain rudeness: “Please do not
disturb me!” and kept on looking. And
so I gave in, crossed my feet, leaned on my
stick, and also went on watching to see what
might now take place.</p>

<p>The duck—one of those very ducks which
had so often in impudent security rocked
itself on the water before our very noses,
was driving on the water—a wreck—no one
could tell which part of the bird was bow
and which stern. The river is quieter here;
the fall is not so great as farther up-stream.
Nevertheless the carcass of the duck had
been seized at once by the current, whirled
about its axis and was beginning to float off.
It was clear that if our good man was not
merely concerned with having made a good
pot-shot and a killing, but also with a more
practical purpose, then he would be obliged
to put his best leg forward. This he did without
losing a moment—everything happened
with immense rapidity. No sooner had the
duck landed in the water than the man
leaped, scrambled, almost tumbled down the
escarpment. He carried the shot-gun in his
outstretched arm, and once more I was
reminded of the opera and the romantic
novel, as he went leaping down over the
stage-like setting of the stone slope—like
some robber chieftain or smuggler bold in
a melodrama. With careful calculation he
kept a little to the right in an oblique direction,
for the drifting duck was being carried
away from him and it was necessary to head
it off. This he actually succeeded in doing
with the butt of his double-barrelled gun—extending
this towards his kill with his body
bent far forward and with his feet in the
water. He managed to halt it in its downward
course. And then carefully and not
without much effort he steered and piloted
it against the stones with the guiding gun-butt
and so drew it ashore.</p>

<p>The job was done and the man drew a
breath of relief. He laid his gun upon the
bank beside him, pulled his <i>rucksack</i> from his
shoulder, stuffed his booty into it, drew the
sack shut by its cords, slung it upon his
shoulders. Then supporting himself on his
gun as on a cane, and thus pleasantly
laden, he climbed complacently up the
loose stone of the slope and made for the
covert.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s got his bit of roast game for
to-morrow,” I thought approvingly, yet not
without envy. “Come, Bashan, let’s go—there’s
really nothing more to see.” But
Bashan simply stood up and turned himself
once around himself, then sat down and
stared after the man, even after he had
already left the scene of action and vanished
among the bushes. I did not again ask him
to come along—I refused to do this as a
matter of principle. He knew where we
were living, and if he thought it reasonable
to sit here still longer and stare,
after everything was over and there was
absolutely nothing more to see, well that
was his own affair. It was a long way
back, and I, for my part, was going to
return. And then at last he gave ear and
came.</p>

<p>During this exceedingly painful journey
homeward, Bashan refrained from all further
inclination to indulge in the sport of the
chase. He did not canter on ahead of me in
a diagonal direction as was his wont when
he was not in the right mood for trailing and
beating-up the game. He walked a little
behind me, keeping regular step and drew
down his mouth in a way which I would be
bound to notice when I turned around to
look at him. This might have been tolerated,
and I was not going to let it ruffle or upset
me—on the contrary, I was disposed to laugh
and shrug my shoulders. But then every
thirty or fifty steps he began to <i>yawn</i>, and
it was this which embittered me. It was this
shameless, wide-angle, rudely bored yawning,
accompanied by a little piping guttural
sound which clearly said: “My God! talk
about a master! Why, he isn’t a master at
all. He’s simply rotten!” This insulting
sound nearly always disturbs me, but this
time it was sufficient to shake our friendship
to its very foundations.</p>

<p>“Go!” I said, “go away! Go to your
master, the man with the thunder-club,
and join up with him. He does not appear
to own a dog, and so he might give you a
job. He may need you in that business of
his. He is, of course, only a plain man in
corduroys and no particular class, but in
your eyes, no doubt, he is the finest gentleman
in the world—a real master for you.
And so I honestly advise you to go and make
up to him—now that he has put a flea in
your ear—to keep the others company.”
(Yes, I went to such extremes as this.)
“We need not inquire whether he has a
hunting permit or not, and it’s quite possible
that you might get into difficulties when you
happen to be caught some fine day whilst
engaged in your shady work, but then that
is your business, and the advice which I have
given you is, as I have already remarked,
most sincere.</p>

<p>“The devil take your hunting,” I went
on, “Did you ever bring me a single
rabbit for our table out of all those which
I permitted you to chase? Is it my fault
that you don’t know how to do a quick turn
and go pounding into the gravel with your
nose like a fool at the very moment you should
be showing your agility? Or have you ever
brought me a pheasant—which would have
been just as welcome in these lean times?
And now you are—yawning! Go to that
fellow with the puttees, I say. You will
soon see whether he is the sort of man who
will scratch your throat and get you to laugh.
I’d be surprised if he can laugh himself. At
best, I am sure, his laugh must be a very
coarse one. Perhaps you are under the
impression that he would call in the aid of
science and permit you to be observed in
case you decide to have occult hemorrhages,
perhaps you are under the delusion that once
you were <i>his</i> dog, you would also have a
chance to be nervous and anæmic. If so,
you had better go to him. And yet it is
possible that you are making a great mistake
with regard to the degree of respect which
this kind of master would display towards
you. There are, for example, certain fine
points and differences for which such gun-bearing
persons have a very sharp nose,
natural merits or demerits—or, to make my
allusions clearer, very awkward questions
regarding pedigree and breed. If I must
express myself with superlative clearness,
then I must say that these are things which
not everybody is disposed to ignore with
that delicacy and humanity to which you
have been accustomed. And should your
husky master—upon your first difference
of opinion with him, reproach you with
that goatee of yours, and call you an
unpleasant name, then think of me and of
the words which I am now addressing to
you. . . .”</p>

<p>It was in such bitter irony that I spoke to
Bashan as he slunk behind me on the way
home, and even though I spoke inwardly and
did not permit my words to be heard, so as
not to appear eccentric, I am nevertheless
convinced that he understood perfectly well
what I meant, and that he was capable of
following at least the main line of my argument.
In short, the quarrel was serious,
and having reached home, I purposely let
the garden gate fall to close behind me and
he was forced to run and clamber over the
fence. Without casting a single glance
behind me, I went into the house, and heard
him give a squeak, as a sign that he had
prodded his belly on one of the pointed
pickets—something which merely produced
a mocking shrug of the shoulders on my
part.</p>

<p>But all this happened long ago—more
than half a year ago. And the same thing
occurred as in the matter of the clinical
interim. Time and oblivion have buried it
deep, and upon the floating surface of these—which
constitute the base of all life,—we
continue to live on. Bashan, to be sure,
appeared to be rather contemplative for a
few days, but he has long ago recovered his
full and undiminished joy in hunting mice,
pheasants, rabbits, and water-fowl, and our
return home means to him merely attendance
upon the next going forth. Whenever
I reach my front door I turn round
and face him once more, and that is the
signal for him to come jumping up the
steps in two great leaps in order that he
may raise himself on his hind legs and
stem his forepaws against the front door,
so that I can pat his shoulder and say
good-bye.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, Bashan,” I remark, “we’ll
go out again—in case I don’t have to make a
trip into the big outside world.” And then
I hurry into the house to rid myself of my
hob-nailed boots, for the soup has been served
and stands smoking on the table.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
