<h2 class="p6"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>During the last year I have spent much time altering
"The Countess Cathleen" and "The Land of Heart's
Desire" that they might be a part of the repertory of
the Abbey Theatre. I had written them before I had
any practical experience, and I knew from the performance
of the one in Dublin in 1899 and of the
other in London in 1894 that they were full of
defects. But in their new shape&mdash;and each play has
been twice played during the winter&mdash;they have given
me some pleasure, and are, I think, easier to play
effectively than my later plays, depending less upon
the players and more upon the producer, both having
been imagined more for variety of stage-picture than
variety of mood in the player. It was, indeed,
the first performance of "The Countess Cathleen,"
when our stage-pictures were made out of poor conventional
scenery and hired costumes, that set me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
writing plays where all would depend upon the
player. The first two scenes are wholly new, and
though I have left the old end in the body of this
book I have given in the notes an end less difficult
to producer and audience, and there are slight
alterations elsewhere in the poem. "The Land of
Heart's Desire," besides some mending in the details,
has been thrown back in time because the metrical
speech would have sounded unreal if spoken in a
country cottage now that we have so many dialect
comedies. The shades of Mrs. Fallan and Mrs.
Dillane and of Dan Bourke and the Tramp would
have seemed too boisterous or too vivid for shades
made cold and distant with the artifice of verse.</p>

<p>I have not again retouched the lyric poems of my
youth, fearing some stupidity in my middle years, but
have changed two or three pages that I always knew
to be wrong in "The Wanderings of Usheen."</p>

<h2 class="p6"><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_THIRD_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_THIRD_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION</h2>


<p>I have added some passages to "The Land of
Heart's Desire," and a new scene of some little
length, besides passages here and there, to "The
Countess Cathleen." The goddess has never come
to me with her hands so full that I have not found
many waste places after I had planted all that she
had brought me. The present version of "The
Countess Cathleen" is not quite the version adopted
by the Irish Literary Theatre a couple of years ago,
for our stage and scenery were capable of little;
and it may differ more from any stage version
I make in future, for it seems that my people of the
waters and my unhappy dead, in the third act, cannot
keep their supernatural essence, but must put on too
much of our mortality, in any ordinary theatre. I am
told that I must abandon a meaning or two and make
my merchants carry away the treasure themselves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
The act was written long ago, when I had seen so
few plays that I took pleasure in stage effects.
Indeed, I am not yet certain that a wealthy theatre
could not shape it to an impressive pageantry, or
that a theatre without any wealth could not lift it out
of pageantry into the mind, with a dim curtain, and
some dimly lighted players, and the beautiful voices
that should be as important in poetical as in musical
drama. The Elizabethan stage was so little imprisoned
in material circumstance that the Elizabethan imagination
was not strained by god or spirit, nor even
by Echo herself&mdash;no, not even when she answered, as
in "The Duchess of Malfi," in clear, loud words
which were not the words that had been spoken to
her. We have made a prison-house of paint and
canvas, where we have as little freedom as under our
own roofs, for there is no freedom in a house that has
been made with hands. All art moves in the cave of
the Chimæra, or in the garden of the Hesperides, or
in the more silent house of the gods, and neither
cave, nor garden, nor house can show itself clearly
but to the mind's eye.</p>

<p>Besides rewriting a lyric or two, I have much
enlarged the note on "The Countess Cathleen," as
there has been some discussion in Ireland about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
origin of the story, but the other notes are as they
have always been. They are short enough, but I do
not think that anybody who knows modern poetry
will find obscurities in this book. In any case, I
must leave my myths and symbols to explain themselves
as the years go by and one poems lights up
another, and the stories that friends, and one friend
in particular, have gathered for me, or that I have
gathered myself in many cottages, find their way into
the light. I would, if I could, add to that majestic
heraldry of the poets, that great and complicated
inheritance of images which written literature has
substituted for the greater and more complex inheritance
of spoken tradition, some new heraldic
images, gathered from the lips of the common people.
Christianity and the old nature faith have lain down
side by side in the cottages, and I would proclaim
that peace as loudly as I can among the kingdoms of
poetry, where there is no peace that is not joyous, no
battle that does not give life instead of death; I may
even try to persuade others, in more sober prose, that
there can be no language more worthy of poetry and
of the meditation of the soul than that which has
been made, or can be made, out of a subtlety of
desire, an emotion of sacrifice, a delight in order, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
are perhaps Christian, and myths and images that
mirror the energies of woods and streams, and of
their wild creatures. Has any part of that majestic
heraldry of the poets had a very different fountain?
Is it not the ritual of the marriage of heaven and
earth?</p>

<p>These details may seem to many unnecessary; but
after all one writes poetry for a few careful readers
and for a few friends, who will not consider such
details unnecessary. When Cimabue had the cry
it was, it seems, worth thinking of those that run;
but to-day, when they can write as well as read, one
can sit with one's companions under the hedgerow
contentedly. If one writes well and has the patience,
somebody will come from among the runners and
read what one has written quickly, and go away
quickly, and write out as much as he can remember
in the language of the highway.</p>

BY THE FIRE</i></p>


<p>
<i>While I wrought out these fitful Danaan rhymes,<br />
My heart would brim with dreams about the times<br />
When we bent down above the fading coals;<br />
And talked of the dark folk, who live in souls<br />
Of passionate men, like bats in the dead trees;<br />
And of the wayward twilight companies,<br />
Who sigh with mingled sorrow and content,<br />
Because their blossoming dreams have never bent<br />
Under the fruit of evil and of good:<br />
And of the embattled flaming multitude<br />
Who rise, wing above wing, flame above flame,<br />
And, like a storm, cry the Ineffable Name,<br />
And with the clashing of their sword blades make<br />
A rapturous music, till the morning break,<br />
And the white hush end all, but the loud beat<br />
Of their long wings, the flash of their white feet.</i><br />

Goodbye; but do not turn your head and look;<br />

<h3><a name="THE_DEATH_OF_CUCHULAIN" id="THE_DEATH_OF_CUCHULAIN"></a>THE DEATH OF CUCHULAIN</h3>


<p>
A man came slowly from the setting sun,<br />
To Forgail's daughter, Emer, in her dun,<br />
And found her dyeing cloth with subtle care,<br />
And said, casting aside his draggled hair:<br />
"I am Aleel, the swineherd, whom you bid<br />
"Go dwell upon the sea cliffs, vapour hid;<br />
"But now my years of watching are no more."<br />
<br />
Then Emer cast the web upon the floor,<br />
And stretching out her arms, red with the dye,<br />
Parted her lips with a loud sudden cry.<br />
<br />
Looking on her, Aleel, the swineherd, said:<br />
"Not any god alive, nor mortal dead,<br />
"Has slain so mighty armies, so great kings,<br />
"Nor won the gold that now Cuchulain brings."<br />
<br />
"Why do you tremble thus from feet to crown?"<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>Aleel, the swineherd, wept and cast him down<br />
Upon the web-heaped floor, and thus his word:<br />
"With him is one sweet-throated like a bird."<br />
<br />
"Who bade you tell these things?" and then she cried<br />
To those about, "Beat him with thongs of hide<br />
"And drive him from the door."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">And thus it was:</span><br />
And where her son, Finmole, on the smooth grass<br />
Was driving cattle, came she with swift feet,<br />
And called out to him, "Son, it is not meet<br />
"That you stay idling here with flocks and herds."<br />
<br />
"I have long waited, mother, for those words:<br />
"But wherefore now?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"There is a man to die;</span><br />
"You have the heaviest arm under the sky."<br />
<br />
"My father dwells among the sea-worn bands,<br />
"And breaks the ridge of battle with his hands."<br />
<br />
"Nay, you are taller than Cuchulain, son."<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>"He is the mightiest man in ship or dun."<br />
<br />
"Nay, he is old and sad with many wars,<br />
"And weary of the crash of battle cars."<br />
<br />
"I only ask what way my journey lies,<br />
"For God, who made you bitter, made you wise."<br />
<br />
"The Red Branch kings a tireless banquet keep,<br />
"Where the sun falls into the Western deep.<br />
"Go there, and dwell on the green forest rim;<br />
"But tell alone your name and house to him<br />
"Whose blade compels, and bid them send you one<br />
"Who has a like vow from their triple dun."<br />
<br />
Between the lavish shelter of a wood<br />
And the gray tide, the Red Branch multitude<br />
Feasted, and with them old Cuchulain dwelt,<br />
And his young dear one close beside him knelt,<br />
And gazed upon the wisdom of his eyes,<br />
More mournful than the depth of starry skies,<br />
And pondered on the wonder of his days;<br />
And all around the harp-string told his praise,<br />
And Concobar, the Red Branch king of kings,<br />
With his own fingers touched the brazen strings.<br />
At last Cuchulain spake, "A young man strays<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>"Driving the deer along the woody ways.<br />
"I often hear him singing to and fro,<br />
"I often hear the sweet sound of his bow,<br />
"Seek out what man he is."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">One went and came.</span><br />
"He bade me let all know he gives his name<br />
"At the sword point, and bade me bring him one<br />
"Who had a like vow from our triple dun."<br />
<br />
"I only of the Red Branch hosted now,"<br />
Cuchulain cried, "have made and keep that vow."<br />
<br />
After short fighting in the leafy shade,<br />
He spake to the young man, "Is there no maid<br />
"Who loves you, no white arms to wrap you round,<br />
"Or do you long for the dim sleepy ground,<br />
"That you come here to meet this ancient sword?"<br />
<br />
"The dooms of men are in God's hidden hoard."<br />
<br />
"Your head a while seemed like a woman's head<br />
"That I loved once."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Again the fighting sped,</span><br />
But now the war rage in Cuchulain woke,<br />
And through the other's shield his long blade broke,<br />
And pierced him.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span><span style="margin-left: 8em;">"Speak before your breath is done."</span><br />
"I am Finmole, mighty Cuchulain's son."<br />
<br />
"I put you from your pain. I can no more."<br />
<br />
While day its burden on to evening bore,<br />
With head bowed on his knees Cuchulain stayed;<br />
Then Concobar sent that sweet-throated maid,<br />
And she, to win him, his gray hair caressed;<br />
In vain her arms, in vain her soft white breast.<br />
Then Concobar, the subtlest of all men,<br />
Ranking his Druids round him ten by ten,<br />
Spake thus, "Cuchulain will dwell there and brood,<br />
"For three days more in dreadful quietude,<br />
"And then arise, and raving slay us all.<br />
"Go, cast on him delusions magical,<br />
"That he might fight the waves of the loud sea."<br />
And ten by ten under a quicken tree,<br />
The Druids chaunted, swaying in their hands<br />
Tall wands of alder, and white quicken wands.<br />
<br />
In three days' time, Cuchulain with a moan<br />
Stood up, and came to the long sands alone:<br />
For four days warred he with the bitter tide;<br />
And the waves flowed above him, and he died.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

Who dreamed that beauty passes like a dream?<br />
For these red lips, with all their mournful pride,<br />
Mournful that no new wonder may betide,<br />
Troy passed away in one high funeral gleam,<br />
And Usna's children died.<br />
<br />
We and the labouring world are passing by:<br />
Amid men's souls, that waver and give place,<br />
Like the pale waters in their wintry race,<br />
Under the passing stars, foam of the sky,<br />
Lives on this lonely face.<br />
<br />
Bow down, archangels, in your dim abode:<br />
Before you were, or any hearts to beat,<br />
Weary and kind one lingered by His seat;<br />
He made the world to be a grassy road<br />
Before her wandering feet.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

Looked down on you from Heaven's door-post<br />
He would his deeds forget.<br />
<br />
Brooding no more upon God's wars<br />
In his Divine homestead,<br />
He would go weave out of the stars<br />
A chaplet for your head.<br />
<br />
And all folk seeing him bow down,<br />
And white stars tell your praise,<br />
Would come at last to God's great town,<br />
Led on by gentle ways;<br />

And God would bid His warfare cease.<br />
Saying all things were well;<br />

A peace of Heaven with Hell.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

While hushed from fear, or loud with hope, a band<br />
With blown, spray-dabbled hair gather at hand.<br />

I call, as they go by me one by one,<br />
<i>Danger no refuge holds; and war no peace,<br />
For him who hears love sing and never cease,<br />
Beside her clean-swept hearth, her quiet shade:<br />
But gather all for whom no love hath made<br />
A woven silence, or but came to cast<br />
A song into the air, and singing past<br />
To smile on the pale dawn; and gather you<br />

God's bell has claimed them by the little cry<br />
Of their sad hearts, that may not live nor die.</i><br />
<br />
Rose of all Roses, Rose of all the World!<br />
You, too, have come where the dim tides are hurled<br />
Upon the wharves of sorrow, and heard ring<br />
The bell that calls us on; the sweet far thing.<br />
Beauty grown sad with its eternity<br />
Made you of us, and of the dim gray sea.<br />
Our long ships loose thought-woven sails and wait,<br />
For God has bid them share an equal fate;<br />
And when at last defeated in His wars,<br />
They have gone down under the same white stars,<br />
We shall no longer hear the little cry<br />
Of our sad hearts, that may not live nor die.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

And chaplet their calm brows with leafage cool,<br />
And how, when fades the sea-strewn rose of day,<br />
A gentle feeling wraps them like a fleece,<br />
And all their trouble dies into its peace:<br />
The tale drove his fine angry mood away.<br />

<p>
Beloved, gaze in thine own heart,<br />
The holy tree is growing there;<br />
From joy the holy branches start,<br />
And all the trembling flowers they bear.<br />
The changing colours of its fruit<br />
Have dowered the stars with merry light;<br />
The surety of its hidden root<br />
Has planted quiet in the night;<br />
The shaking of its leafy head<br />
Has given the waves their melody,<br />
And made my lips and music wed,<br />
Murmuring a wizard song for thee.<br />
There, through bewildered branches, go<br />
Winged Loves borne on in gentle strife,<br />
Tossing and tossing to and fro<br />
The flaming circle of our life.<br />
When looking on their shaken hair,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>And dreaming how they dance and dart,<br />
Thine eyes grow full of tender care:<br />
Beloved, gaze in thine own heart.<br />
<br />
Gaze no more in the bitter glass<br />
The demons, with their subtle guile,<br />
Lift up before us when they pass,<br />
Or only gaze a little while;<br />
For there a fatal image grows,<br />
With broken boughs, and blackened leaves,<br />
And roots half hidden under snows<br />
Driven by a storm that ever grieves.<br />
For all things turn to barrenness<br />
In the dim glass the demons hold,<br />
The glass of outer weariness,<br />
Made when God slept in times of old.<br />
There, through the broken branches, go<br />
The ravens of unresting thought;<br />
Peering and flying to and fro<br />
To see men's souls bartered and bought.<br />
When they are heard upon the wind,<br />
And when they shake their wings; alas!<br />
Thy tender eyes grow all unkind:<br />
Gaze no more in the bitter glass.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

Nor be I any less of them,<br />

Of her, whose history began<br />
Before God made the angelic clan,<br />
Trails all about the written page;<br />
For in the world's first blossoming age<br />
The light fall of her flying feet<br />
Made Ireland's heart begin to beat;<br />
And still the starry candles flare<br />
To help her light foot here and there;<br />
And still the thoughts of Ireland brood<br />

My rhymes more than their rhyming tell<br />
Of the dim wisdoms old and deep,<br />
That God gives unto man in sleep.<br />
For the elemental beings go<br />
About my table to and fro.<br />
In flood and fire and clay and wind,<br />
They huddle from man's pondering mind;<br />
Yet he who treads in austere ways<br />
May surely meet their ancient gaze.<br />
Man ever journeys on with them<br />
After the red-rose-bordered hem.<br />
Ah, faeries, dancing under the moon,<br />
A Druid land, a Druid tune!</i><br />
<br />
<i>While still I may, I write for you<br />
The love I lived, the dream I knew.<br />
From our birthday, until we die,<br />
Is but the winking of an eye;<br />

The mariners of night above,<br />
And all the wizard things that go<br />

and a table; and a crucifix on the wall. The alcove is

facing the audience to the Left, and to the left of this a
bench. Through the door one can see the forest. It is
night, but the moon or a late sunset glimmers through the
trees and carries the eye far off into a vague, mysterious
world.</i> <span class="smcap">MAURTEEN BRUIN</span>, <span class="smcap">SHAWN BRUIN</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">BRIDGET

<p class="actor">MARY</p>

<p class="speech"><span style="margin-left: 12em;">How a Princess Edane,</span><br />
A daughter of a King of Ireland, heard<br />
A voice singing on a May Eve like this,<br />
And followed half awake and half asleep,<br />
Until she came into the Land of Faery,<br />
Where nobody gets old and godly and grave,<br />
Where nobody gets old and crafty and wise,<br />
Where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue.<br />
And she is still there, busied with a dance<br />
Deep in the dewy shadow of a wood,<br />

And he was no judge of a dog or a horse,<br />

<p class="actor">FATHER HART</p>

<p class="speech"><span style="margin-left: 12em;">Put it away, my colleen;</span><br />
God spreads the heavens above us like great wings<br />
And gives a little round of deeds and days,<br />
And then come the wrecked angels and set snares,<br />
And bait them with light hopes and heavy dreams,<br />
Until the heart is puffed with pride and goes<br />
Half shuddering and half joyous from God's peace;<br />
And it was some wrecked angel, blind with tears,<br />
Who flattered Edane's heart with merry words.<br />
My colleen, I have seen some other girls<br />
Restless and ill at ease, but years went by<br />
And they grew like their neighbours and were glad<br />
In minding children, working at the churn,<br />
And gossiping of weddings and of wakes;<br />
For life moves out of a red flare of dreams<br />
Into a common light of common hours,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>Until old age bring the red flare again.</p>

<p class="actor">MAURTEEN</p>

<p class="speech">That's true&mdash;but she's too young to know it's true.</p>

<p class="actor">BRIDGET</p>

<p class="speech">She's old enough to know that it is wrong<br />
To mope and idle.</p>

<p class="actor">MAURTEEN</p>

<p class="speech"><span style="margin-left: 10em;">I've little blame for her;</span><br />
She's dull when my big son is in the fields,<br />
And that and maybe this good woman's tongue<br />
Have driven her to hide among her dreams<br />
Like children from the dark under the bed-clothes.</p>

<p class="actor">BRIDGET</p>

<p class="speech">She'd never do a turn if I were silent.</p>

<p class="actor">MAURTEEN</p>

<p class="speech">And maybe it is natural upon May Eve<br />
To dream of the good people. But tell me, girl,<br />

<p class="actor">MARY</p>

<p class="speech">They have taken away the blessed quicken wood,<br />
They will not bring good luck into the house;<br />
Yet I am glad that I was courteous to them,<br />

<p class="actor">FATHER HART</p>

Yet still she turns her restless head:<br />

Nor seek; for this is also sooth;<br />
To hunger fiercely after truth,<br />
Lest all thy toiling only breeds<br />

Seek, then, for this is also sooth,<br />
No word of theirs&mdash;the cold star-bane<br />
Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,<br />
And dead is all their human truth.<br />
Go gather by the humming-sea<br />
Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,<br />

Sing, then, for this is also sooth.<br />

Buried under the sleepy ground,<br />

His shouting days with mirth were crowned;<br />
And still I dream he treads the lawn,<br />
Walking ghostly in the dew,<br />
Pierced by my glad singing through,<br />

<h3><a name="THE_SAD_SHEPHERD" id="THE_SAD_SHEPHERD"></a>THE SAD SHEPHERD</h3>


<p>
There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,<br />
And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,<br />
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming<br />
And humming sands, where windy surges wend:<br />
And he called loudly to the stars to bend<br />
From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they<br />
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:<br />
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend<br />
Cried out, <i>Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!</i><br />
The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,<br />
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill;<br />
He fled the persecution of her glory<br />
And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,<br />
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening,<br />
But naught they heard, for they are always listening,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.<br />
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,<br />
Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,<br />
And thought, <i>I will my heavy story tell<br />
Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send<br />
Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;<br />
And my own tale again for me shall sing,<br />
And my own whispering words be comforting,<br />
And lo! my ancient burden may depart</i>.<br />
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;<br />
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone<br />
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan<br />
Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>
I passed along the water's edge below the humid trees,<br />
My spirit rocked in evening light, the rushes round my knees,<br />
My spirit rocked in sleep and sighs; and saw the moorfowl pace<br />
All dripping on a grassy slope, and saw them cease to chase<br />
Each other round in circles, and heard the eldest speak:<br />
<i>Who holds the world between His bill and made us strong or weak<br />
Is an undying moorfowl, and He lives beyond the sky.<br />
The rains are from His dripping wing, the moonbeams from His eye.</i><br />
I passed a little further on and heard a lotus talk:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span><i>Who made the world and ruleth it, He hangeth on a stalk,</i><br />
<i>For I am in His image made, and all this tinkling tide<br />
Is but a sliding drop of rain between His petals wide.</i><br />
A little way within the gloom a roebuck raised his eyes<br />
Brimful of starlight, and he said: <i>The Stamper of the Skies,<br />
He is a gentle roebuck; for how else, I pray, could He<br />
Conceive a thing so sad and soft, a gentle thing like me?</i><br />
I passed a little further on and heard a peacock say:<br />
<i>Who made the grass and made the worms and made my feathers gay,<br />
He is a monstrous peacock, and He waveth all the night<br />
His languid tail above us, lit with myriad spots of light.</i></p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

A parrot sways upon a tree,<br />
Raging at his own image in the enamelled sea.<br />
<br />
Here we will moor our lonely ship<br />
And wander ever with woven hands,<br />
Murmuring softly lip to lip,<br />
Along the grass, along the sands,<br />
Murmuring how far away are the unquiet lands:<br />
<br />
How we alone of mortals are<br />
Hid under quiet bows apart,<br />
While our love grows an Indian star,<br />
A meteor of the burning heart,<br />

I sat on cushioned otter skin:<br />
My word was law from Ith to Emen,<br />
And shook at Invar Amargin<br />
The hearts of the world-troubling seamen.<br />
And drove tumult and war away<br />
From girl and boy and man and beast;<br />
The fields grew fatter day by day,<br />
The wild fowl of the air increased;<br />
And every ancient Ollave said,<br />
While he bent down his fading head,<br />
"He drives away the Northern cold."<br />

Crying, the pirates drove his swine<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>To fill their dark-beaked hollow galleys.<br />
I called my battle-breaking men,<br />
And my loud brazen battle-cars<br />
From rolling vale and rivery glen,<br />
And under the blinking of the stars<br />
Fell on the pirates by the deep,<br />
And hurled them in the gulph of sleep:<br />
These hands won many a torque of gold.<br />
<i>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</i><br />
<br />
But slowly, as I shouting slew<br />
And trampled in the bubbling mire,<br />
In my most secret spirit grew<br />
A whirling and a wandering fire:<br />
I stood: keen stars above me shone,<br />
Around me shone keen eyes of men:<br />
I laughed aloud and hurried on<br />
By rocky shore and rushy fen;<br />
I laughed because birds fluttered by,<br />
And starlight gleamed, and clouds flew high,<br />
And rushes waved and waters rolled.<br />
<i>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</i><br />
<br />
And now I wander in the woods<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>When summer gluts the golden bees,<br />
Or in autumnal solitudes<br />
Arise the leopard-coloured trees;<br />

I wander on, and wave my hands,<br />
And sing, and shake my heavy locks.<br />
The gray wolf knows me; by one ear<br />
I lead along the woodland deer;<br />
The hares run by me growing bold.<br />
<i>They will not hush, the leaves a-flutter round me, the beech leaves old.</i><br />
<br />
I came upon a little town,<br />
That slumbered in the harvest moon,<br />
And passed a-tiptoe up and down,<br />
Murmuring, to a fitful tune,<br />
How I have followed, night and day,<br />
A tramping of tremendous feet,<br />
And saw where this old tympan lay,<br />
Deserted on a doorway seat,<br />
And bore it to the woods with me;<br />
Of some unhuman misery<br />
Our married voiced wildly trolled.<br />

Orchil shakes out her long dark hair<br />
That hides away the dying sun<br />
And sheds faint odours through the air:<br />
When my hand passed from wire to wire<br />
It quenched, with sound like falling dew,<br />
The whirling and the wandering fire;<br />
But lift a mournful ulalu,<br />
For the kind wires are torn and still,<br />
And I must wander wood and hill<br />
Through summer's heat and winter's cold.<br />

For he'd died at ninety-four.<br />
<br />
There was no human keening;<br />
The birds from Knocknarea<br />
And the world round Knocknashee<br />
Came keening in that day.<br />
<br />
The young birds and old birds<br />
Came flying, heavy and sad;<br />
Keening in from Tiraragh,<br />

Keening from Inishmurray,<br />

<p>
Come round me, little childer;<br />
There, don't fling stones at me<br />
Because I mutter as I go;<br />
But pity Moll Magee.<br />
<br />
My man was a poor fisher<br />
With shore lines in the say;<br />
My work was saltin' herrings<br />
The whole of the long day.<br />
<br />
And sometimes from the saltin' shed,<br />
I scarce could drag my feet<br />
Under the blessed moonlight,<br />
Along the pebbly street.<br />
<br />
I'd always been but weakly,<br />
And my baby was just born;<br />
A neighbour minded her by day<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>I minded her till morn.<br />
<br />
I lay upon my baby;<br />
Ye little childer dear,<br />
I looked on my cold baby<br />
When the morn grew frosty and clear.<br />
<br />
A weary woman sleeps so hard!<br />
My man grew red and pale,<br />
And gave me money, and bade me go<br />
To my own place, Kinsale.<br />
<br />
He drove me out and shut the door,<br />
And gave his curse to me;<br />
I went away in silence,<br />
No neighbour could I see.<br />
<br />
The windows and the doors were shut,<br />
One star shone faint and green<br />
The little straws were turnin' round<br />
Across the bare boreen.<br />
<br />
I went away in silence:<br />
Beyond old Martin's byre<br />
I saw a kindly neighbour<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>Blowin' her mornin' fire.<br />
<br />
She drew from me my story&mdash;<br />
My money's all used up,<br />
And still, with pityin', scornin' eye,<br />
She gives me bite and sup.<br />
<br />
She says my man will surely come,<br />
And fetch me home agin;<br />
But always, as I'm movin' round,<br />
Without doors or within,<br />
<br />
Pilin' the wood or pilin' the turf,<br />
Or goin' to the well,<br />
I'm thinkin' of my baby<br />
And keenin' to mysel'.<br />
<br />
And sometimes I am sure she knows<br />
When, openin' wide His door,<br />
God lights the stars, His candles,<br />
And looks upon the poor.<br />
<br />
So now, ye little childer,<br />
Ye won't fling stones at me;<br />
But gather with your shinin' looks<br />
And pity Moll Magee.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<p>
"Now lay me in a cushioned chair<br />
"And carry me, you four,<br />
"With cushions here and cushions there,<br />
"To see the world once more.<br />
<br />
"And some one from the stables bring<br />
"My Dermot dear and brown,<br />
"And lead him gently in a ring,<br />
"And gently up and down.<br />
<br />
"Now leave the chair upon the grass:<br />
"Bring hound and huntsman here,<br />
"And I on this strange road will pass,<br />
"Filled full of ancient cheer."<br />
<br />
His eyelids droop, his head falls low,<br />
His old eyes cloud with dreams;<br />
The sun upon all things that grow<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>Pours round in sleepy streams.<br />
<br />
Brown Dermot treads upon the lawn,<br />
And to the armchair goes,<br />
And now the old man's dreams are gone,<br />
He smooths the long brown nose.<br />
<br />
And now moves many a pleasant tongue<br />
Upon his wasted hands,<br />
For leading aged hounds and young<br />
The huntsman near him stands.<br />
<br />
"My huntsman, Rody, blow the horn,<br />
"And make the hills reply."<br />
The huntsman loosens on the morn<br />
A gay and wandering cry.<br />
<br />
A fire is in the old man's eyes,<br />
His fingers move and sway,<br />
And when the wandering music dies<br />
They hear him feebly say,<br />
<br />
"My huntsman, Rody, blow the horn,<br />
"And make the hills reply."<br />
"I cannot blow upon my horn,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>"I can but weep and sigh."<br />
<br />
The servants round his cushioned place<br />
Are with new sorrow wrung;<br />
And hounds are gazing on his face,<br />
Both aged hounds and young.<br />
<br />
One blind hound only lies apart<br />
On the sun-smitten grass;<br />
He holds deep commune with his heart:<br />
The moments pass and pass;<br />
<br />
The blind hound with a mournful din<br />
Lifts slow his wintry head;<br />
The servants bear the body in;<br />
The hounds wail for the dead.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span></p>

<p class="actor">S. PATRIC</p>

<p class="speech">You who are bent, and bald, and blind,<br />
With a heavy heart and a wandering mind,<br />
Have known three centuries, poets sing,<br />
Of dalliance with a demon thing.</p>

<p class="actor">USHEEN</p>

<p class="speech">Sad to remember, sick with years,<br />
The swift innumerable spears,<br />
The horsemen with their floating hair,<br />
And bowls of barley, honey, and wine,<br />
And feet of maidens dancing in tune,<br />
And the white body that lay by mine;<br />
But the tale, though words be lighter than air,<br />
Must live to be old like the wandering moon.<br />
<br />
Caolte, and Conan, and Finn were there,<br />
When we followed a deer with our baying hounds,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>With Bran, Sgeolan, and Lomair,<br />
And passing the Firbolgs' burial mounds,<br />
Came to the cairn-heaped grassy hill<br />
Where passionate Maive is stony still;<br />
And found on the dove-gray edge of the sea<br />
A pearl-pale, high-born lady, who rode<br />
On a horse with bridle of findrinny;<br />
And like a sunset were her lips,<br />
A stormy sunset on doomed ships;<br />
A citron colour gloomed in her hair,<br />
But down to her feet white vesture flowed,<br />
And with the glimmering crimson glowed<br />
Of many a figured embroidery;<br />
And it was bound with a pearl-pale shell<br />
That wavered like the summer streams,<br />
As her soft bosom rose and fell.</p>

<p class="actor">S. PATRIC</p>

<p class="speech">You are still wrecked among heathen dreams.</p>

<p class="actor">USHEEN</p>

<p class="speech">"Why do you wind no horn?" she said.<br />
"And every hero droop his head?<br />
"The hornless deer is not more sad<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>"That many a peaceful moment had,<br />
"More sleek than any granary mouse,<br />
"In his own leafy forest house<br />
"Among the waving fields of fern:<br />
"The hunting of heroes should be glad."<br />
<br />
"O pleasant woman," answered Finn,<br />
"We think on Oscar's pencilled urn,<br />
"And on the heroes lying slain,<br />
On Gavra's raven-covered plain;<br />
"But where are your noble kith and kin,<br />
"And from what country do you ride?"<br />
<br />
"My father and my mother are<br />
"Aengus and Adene, my own name<br />
"Niam, and my country far<br />
"Beyond the tumbling of this tide."<br />
<br />
"What dream came with you that you came<br />
"Through bitter tide on foam wet feet?<br />
"Did your companion wander away<br />
"From where the birds of Aengus wing?"<br />
<br />
She said, with laughter tender and sweet:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>"I have not yet, war-weary king,<br />
"Been spoken of with any one;<br />
"Yet now I choose, for these four feet<br />
"Ran through the foam and ran to this<br />
"That I might have your son to kiss."<br />
<br />
"Were there no better than my son<br />
"That you through all that foam should run?"<br />
<br />
"I loved no man, though kings besought<br />
"Love, till the Danaan poets brought<br />
"Rhyme, that rhymed to Usheen's name,<br />
"And now I am dizzy with the thought<br />
"Of all that wisdom and the fame<br />
"Of battles broken by his hands,<br />
"Of stories builded by his words<br />
"That are like coloured Asian birds<br />
"At evening in their rainless lands."<br />
<br />
O Patric, by your brazen bell,<br />
There was no limb of mine but fell<br />
Into a desperate gulph of love!<br />
"You only will I wed," I cried,<br />
"And I will make a thousand songs,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>"And set your name all names above.<br />
"And captives bound with leathern thongs<br />
"Shall kneel and praise you, one by one,<br />
"At evening in my western dun."<br />
<br />
"O Usheen, mount by me and ride<br />
"To shores by the wash of the tremulous tide,<br />
"Where men have heaped no burial mounds,<br />
"And the days pass by like a wayward tune,<br />
"Where broken faith has never been known,<br />
"And the blushes of first love never have flown;<br />
"And there I will give you a hundred hounds;<br />
"No mightier creatures bay at the moon;<br />
"And a hundred robes of murmuring silk,<br />
"And a hundred calves and a hundred sheep<br />
"Whose long wool whiter than sea froth flows,<br />
"And a hundred spears and a hundred bows,<br />
"And oil and wine and honey and milk,<br />
"And always never-anxious sleep;<br />
"While a hundred youths, mighty of limb,<br />
"But knowing nor tumult nor hate nor strife,<br />
"And a hundred maidens, merry as birds,<br />
"Who when they dance to a fitful measure<br />
"Have a speed like the speed of the salmon herds,<br />
"Shall follow your horn and obey your whim,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>"And you shall know the Danaan leisure:<br />
"And Niam be with you for a wife."<br />
Then she sighed gently, "It grows late,<br />
"Music and love and sleep await,<br />
"Where I would be when the white moon climbs<br />
"The red sun falls, and the world grows dim."<br />
<br />
And then I mounted and she bound me<br />
With her triumphing arms around me,<br />
And whispering to herself enwound me;<br />
But when the horse had felt my weight,<br />
He shook himself and neighed three times:<br />
Caolte, Conan, and Finn came near,<br />
And wept, and raised their lamenting hands,<br />
And bid me stay, with many a tear;<br />
But we rode out from the human lands.<br />
<br />
In what far kingdom do you go,<br />
Ah, Fenians, with the shield and bow?<br />
Or are you phantoms white as snow,<br />
Whose lips had life's most prosperous glow?<br />
O you, with whom in sloping valleys,<br />
Or down the dewy forest alleys,<br />
I chased at morn the flying deer,<br />
With whom I hurled the hurrying spear,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>And heard the foemen's bucklers rattle,<br />
And broke the heaving ranks of battle!<br />
And Bran, Sgeolan, and Lomair,<br />
Where are you with your long rough hair?<br />
You go not where the red deer feeds,<br />
Nor tear the foemen from their steeds.</p>

<p class="actor">S. PATRIC</p>

<p class="speech">Boast not, nor mourn with drooping head<br />
Companions long accurst and dead,<br />
And hounds for centuries dust and air.</p>

<p class="actor">USHEEN</p>

<p class="speech">We galloped over the glossy sea:<br />
I know not if days passed or hours,<br />
And Niam sang continually<br />
Danaan songs, and their dewy showers<br />
Of pensive laughter, unhuman sound,<br />
Lulled weariness, and softly round<br />
My human sorrow her white arms wound.<br />
<br />
We galloped; now a hornless deer<br />
Passed by us, chased by a phantom hound<br />
All pearly white, save one red ear;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>And now a maiden rode like the wind<br />
With an apple of gold in her tossing hand;<br />
And a beautiful young man followed behind<br />
With quenchless gaze and fluttering hair.<br />
<br />
"Were these two born in the Danaan land,<br />
"Or have they breathed the mortal air?"<br />
<br />
"Vex them no longer," Niam said,<br />
And sighing bowed her gentle head,<br />
And sighing laid the pearly tip<br />
Of one long finger on my lip.<br />
<br />
But now the moon like a white rose shone<br />
In the pale west, and the sun's rim sank,<br />
And clouds arrayed their rank on rank<br />
About his fading crimson ball:<br />
The floor of Emen's hosting hall<br />
Was not more level than the sea,<br />
As full of loving phantasy,<br />
And with low murmurs we rode on,<br />
Where many a trumpet-twisted shell<br />
That in immortal silence sleeps<br />
Dreaming of her own melting hues,<br />
Her golds, her ambers, and her blues,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>Pierced with soft light the shallowing deeps.<br />
<br />
But now a wandering land breeze came<br />
And a far sound of feathery quires;<br />
It seemed to blow from the dying flame,<br />
They seemed to sing in the smouldering fires.<br />
The horse towards the music raced,<br />
Neighing along the lifeless waste;<br />
Like sooty fingers, many a tree<br />
Rose ever out of the warm sea;<br />
And they were trembling ceaselessly,<br />
As though they all were beating time,<br />
Upon the centre of the sun,<br />
To that low laughing woodland rhyme.<br />
And, now our wandering hours were done,<br />
We cantered to the shore, and knew<br />
The reason of the trembling trees:<br />
Round every branch the song-birds flew,<br />
Or clung thereon like swarming bees;<br />
While round the shore a million stood<br />
Like drops of frozen rainbow light,<br />
And pondered in a soft vain mood<br />
Upon their shadows in the tide,<br />
And told the purple deeps their pride,<br />
And murmured snatches of delight;<br />
And on the shores were many boats<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>With bending sterns and bending bows.<br />
<br />
And carven figures on their prows<br />
Of bitterns, and fish-eating stoats,<br />
And swans with their exultant throats:<br />
And where the wood and waters meet<br />
We tied the horse in a leafy clump,<br />
And Niam blew three merry notes<br />
Out of a little silver trump;<br />
And then an answering whispering flew<br />
Over the bare and woody land,<br />
A whisper of impetuous feet,<br />
And ever nearer, nearer grew;<br />
And from the woods rushed out a band<br />
Of men and maidens, hand in hand,<br />
And singing, singing altogether;<br />
Their brows were white as fragrant milk,<br />
Their cloaks made out of yellow silk,<br />
And trimmed with many a crimson feather:<br />
And when they saw the cloak I wore<br />
Was dim with mire of a mortal shore,<br />
They fingered it and gazed on me<br />
And laughed like murmurs of the sea;<br />
But Niam with a swift distress<br />
Bid them away and hold their peace;<br />
And when they heard her voice they ran<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>And knelt them, every maid and man<br />
And kissed, as they would never cease,<br />
Her pearl-pale hand and the hem of her dress.<br />
She bade them bring us to the hall<br />
Where Aengus dreams, from sun to sun,<br />
A Druid dream of the end of days<br />
When the stars are to wane and the world be done.<br />
<br />
They led us by long and shadowy ways<br />
Where drops of dew in myriads fall,<br />
And tangled creepers every hour<br />
Blossom in some new crimson flower,<br />
And once a sudden laughter sprang<br />
From all their lips, and once they sang<br />
Together, while the dark woods rang,<br />
And made in all their distant parts,<br />
With boom of bees in honey marts,<br />
A rumour of delighted hearts.<br />
And once a maiden by my side<br />
Gave me a harp, and bid me sing,<br />
And touch the laughing silver string;<br />
But when I sang of human joy<br />
A sorrow wrapped each merry face,<br />
And, Patric! by your beard, they wept,<br />
Until one came, a tearful boy;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>"A sadder creature never stept<br />
"Than this strange human bard," he cried;<br />
And caught the silver harp away,<br />
And, weeping over the white strings, hurled<br />
It down in a leaf-hid, hollow place<br />
That kept dim waters from the sky;<br />
And each one said, with a long, long sigh,<br />
"O saddest harp in all the world,<br />
"Sleep there till the moon and the stars die!"<br />
<br />
And now still sad we came to where<br />
A beautiful young man dreamed within<br />
A house of wattles, clay, and skin;<br />
One hand upheld his beardless chin,<br />
And one a sceptre flashing out<br />
Wild flames of red and gold and blue,<br />
Like to a merry wandering rout<br />
Of dancers leaping in the air;<br />
And men and maidens knelt them there<br />
And showed their eyes with teardrops dim,<br />
And with low murmurs prayed to him,<br />
And kissed the sceptre with red lips,<br />
And touched it with their finger-tips.<br />
<br />
He held that flashing sceptre up.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>"Joy drowns the twilight in the dew,<br />
"And fills with stars night's purple cup,<br />
"And wakes the sluggard seeds of corn,<br />
"And stirs the young kid's budding horn.<br />
"And makes the infant ferns unwrap,<br />
"And for the peewit paints his cap,<br />
"And rolls along the unwieldy sun,<br />
"And makes the little planets run:<br />
"And if joy were not on the earth,<br />
"There were an end of change and birth,<br />
"And earth and heaven and hell would die,<br />
"And in some gloomy barrow lie<br />
"Folded like a frozen fly;<br />
"Then mock at Death and Time with glances<br />
"And wavering arms and wandering dances.<br />
<br />
"Men's hearts of old were drops of flame<br />
"That from the saffron morning came,<br />
"Or drops of silver joy that fell<br />
"Out of the moon's pale twisted shell;<br />
"But now hearts cry that hearts are slaves,<br />
"And toss and turn in narrow caves;<br />
"But here there is nor law nor rule,<br />
"Nor have hands held a weary tool;<br />
"And here there is nor Change nor Death,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>"But only kind and merry breath,<br />
"For joy is God and God is joy."<br />
With one long glance on maid and boy<br />
And the pale blossom of the moon,<br />
He fell into a Druid swoon.<br />
<br />
And in a wild and sudden dance<br />
We mocked at Time and Fate and Chance<br />
And swept out of the wattled hall<br />
And came to where the dewdrops fall<br />
Among the foamdrops of the sea,<br />
And there we hushed the revelry;<br />
And, gathering on our brows a frown,<br />
Bent all our swaying bodies down,<br />
And to the waves that glimmer by<br />
That sloping green De Danaan sod<br />
Sang "God is joy and joy is God.<br />
"And things that have grown sad are wicked,<br />
"And things that fear the dawn of the morrow<br />
"Or the gray wandering osprey Sorrow."<br />
<br />
We danced to where in the winding thicket<br />
The damask roses, bloom on bloom,<br />
Like crimson meteors hang in the gloom,<br />
And bending over them softly said,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>Bending over them in the dance,<br />
With a swift and friendly glance<br />
From dewy eyes: "Upon the dead<br />
"Fall the leaves of other roses,<br />
"On the dead dim earth encloses:<br />
"But never, never on our graves,<br />
"Heaped beside the glimmering waves,<br />
"Shall fall the leaves of damask roses.<br />
"For neither Death nor Change comes near us,<br />
"And all listless hours fear us,<br />
"And we fear no dawning morrow,<br />
"Nor the gray wandering osprey Sorrow."<br />
<br />
The dance wound through the windless woods;<br />
The ever-summered solitudes;<br />
Until the tossing arms grew still<br />
Upon the woody central hill;<br />
And, gathered in a panting band,<br />
We flung on high each waving hand,<br />
And sang unto the starry broods:<br />
In our raised eyes there flashed a glow<br />
Of milky brightness to and fro<br />
As thus our song arose: "You stars,<br />
"Across your wandering ruby cars<br />
"Shake the loose reins: you slaves of God<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>"He rules you with an iron rod,<br />
"He holds you with an iron bond,<br />
"Each one woven to the other,<br />
"Each one woven to his brother<br />
"Like bubbles in a frozen pond;<br />
"But we in a lonely land abide<br />
"Unchainable as the dim tide,<br />
"With hearts that know nor law nor rule,<br />
"And hands that hold no wearisome tool<br />
"Folded in love that fears no morrow,<br />
"Nor the gray wandering osprey Sorrow."<br />
<br />
O Patric! for a hundred years<br />
I chased upon that woody shore<br />
The deer, the badger, and the boar.<br />
O Patric! for a hundred years<br />
At evening on the glimmering sands,<br />
Beside the piled-up hunting spears,<br />
These now outworn and withered hands<br />
Wrestled among the island bands.<br />
O Patric! for a hundred years<br />
We went a-fishing in long boats<br />
With bending sterns and bending bows,<br />
And carven figures on their prows<br />
Of bitterns and fish-eating stoats.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>O Patric! for a hundred years<br />
The gentle Niam was my wife;<br />
But now two things devour my life;<br />
The things that most of all I hate;<br />
Fasting and prayers.</p>

<p class="actor">S. PATRIC</p>

<p class="speech"><span style="margin-left: 10em;">Tell on.</span></p>

<p class="actor">USHEEN</p>

<p class="speech"><span style="margin-left: 15em;">Yes, yes,</span><br />
For these were ancient Usheen's fate<br />
Loosed long ago from heaven's gate,<br />
For his last days to lie in wait.<br />
<br />
When one day by the tide I stood,<br />
I found in that forgetfulness<br />
Of dreamy foam a staff of wood<br />
From some dead warrior's broken lance:<br />
I turned it in my hands; the stains<br />
Of war were on it, and I wept,<br />
Remembering how the Fenians stept<br />
Along the blood-bedabbled plains,<br />
Equal to good or grievous chance:<br />
Thereon young Niam softly came<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>And caught my hands, but spake no word<br />
Save only many times my name,<br />
In murmurs, like a frighted bird.<br />
We passed by woods, and lawns of clover,<br />
And found the horse and bridled him,<br />
For we knew well the old was over.<br />
I heard one say "His eyes grow dim<br />
"With all the ancient sorrow of men";<br />
And wrapped in dreams rode out again<br />
With hoofs of the pale findrinny<br />
Over the glimmering purple sea:<br />
Under the golden evening light.<br />
The immortals moved among the fountains<br />
By rivers and the woods' old night;<br />
Some danced like shadows on the mountains,<br />
Some wandered ever hand in hand,<br />
Or sat in dreams on the pale strand;<br />
Each forehead like an obscure star<br />
Bent down above each hooked knee:<br />
And sang, and with a dreamy gaze<br />
Watched where the sun in a saffron blaze<br />
Was slumbering half in the sea ways;<br />
And, as they sang, the painted birds<br />
Kept time with their bright wings and feet;<br />
Like drops of honey came their words,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>But fainter than a young lamb's bleat.<br />
<br />
"An old man stirs the fire to a blaze,<br />
"In the house of a child, of a friend, of a brother<br />
"He has over-lingered his welcome; the days,<br />
"Grown desolate, whisper and sigh to each other;<br />
"He hears the storm in the chimney above,<br />
"And bends to the fire and shakes with the cold,<br />
"While his heart still dreams of battle and love,<br />
"And the cry of the hounds on the hills of old.<br />
<br />
"But we are apart in the grassy places,<br />
"Where care cannot trouble the least of our days,<br />
"Or the softness of youth be gone from our faces,<br />
"Or love's first tenderness die in our gaze.<br />
"The hare grows old as she plays in the sun<br />
"And gazes around her with eyes of brightness;<br />
"Before the swift things that she dreamed of were done<br />
"She limps along in an aged whiteness;<br />
"A storm of birds in the Asian trees<br />
"Like tulips in the air a-winging,<br />
"And the gentle waves of the summer seas,<br />
"That raise their heads and wander singing.<br />
"Must murmur at last 'Unjust, unjust';<br />
"And 'My speed is a weariness,' falters the mouse<br />
"And the kingfisher turns to a ball of dust,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>"And the roof falls in of his tunnelled house.<br />
<br />
"But the love-dew dims our eyes till the day<br />
"When God shall come from the sea with a sigh<br />
"And bid the stars drop down from the sky,<br />
"And the moon like a pale rose wither away."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span></p>

<p>
Now, man of croziers, shadows called our names<br />
And then away, away, like whirling flames;<br />
And now fled by, mist-covered, without sound,<br />
The youth and lady and the deer and hound;<br />
"Gaze no more on the phantoms," Niam said,<br />
And kissed my eyes, and, swaying her bright head<br />
And her bright body, sang of faery and man<br />
Before God was or my old line began;<br />
Wars shadowy, vast, exultant; faeries of old<br />
Who wedded men with rings of Druid gold;<br />
And how those lovers never turn their eyes<br />
Upon the life that fades and flickers and dies,<br />
But love and kiss on dim shores far away<br />
Rolled round with music of the sighing spray:<br />
But sang no more, as when, like a brown bee<br />
That has drunk full, she crossed the misty sea<br />
With me in her white arms a hundred years<br />
Before this day; for now the fall of tears<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>Troubled her song.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">I do not know if days</span><br />
Or hours passed by, yet hold the morning rays<br />
Shone many times among the glimmering flowers<br />
Woven into her hair, before dark towers<br />
Rose in the darkness, and the white surf gleamed<br />
About them; and the horse of faery screamed<br />
And shivered, knowing the Isle of many Fears,<br />
Nor ceased until white Niam stroked his ears<br />
And named him by sweet names.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">A foaming tide</span><br />
Whitened afar with surge, fan-formed and wide,<br />
Burst from a great door marred by many a blow<br />
From mace and sword and pole-axe, long ago<br />
When gods and giants warred. We rode between<br />
The seaweed-covered pillars, and the green<br />
And surging phosphorus alone gave light<br />
On our dark pathway, till a countless flight<br />
Of moonlit steps glimmered; and left and right<br />
Dark statues glimmered over the pale tide<br />
Upon dark thrones. Between the lids of one<br />
The imaged meteors had flashed and run<br />
And had disported in the stilly jet,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>And the fixed stars had dawned and shone and set,<br />
Since God made Time and Death and Sleep: the other<br />
Stretched his long arm to where, a misty smother,<br />
The stream churned, churned, and churned&mdash;his lips apart,<br />
As though he told his never slumbering heart<br />
Of every foamdrop on its misty way:<br />
Tying the horse to his vast foot that lay<br />
Half in the unvesselled sea, we climbed the stairs<br />
And climbed so long, I thought the last steps were<br />
Hung from the morning star; when these mild words<br />
Fanned the delighted air like wings of birds:<br />
"My brothers spring out of their beds at morn,<br />
"A-murmur like young partridge: with loud horn<br />
"They chase the noontide deer;<br />
"And when the dew-drowned stars hang in the air<br />
"Look to long fishing-lines, or point and pare<br />
"An ash-wood hunting spear.<br />
<br />
"O sigh, O fluttering sigh, be kind to me;<br />
"Flutter along the froth lips of the sea,<br />
"And shores, the froth lips wet:<br />
"And stay a little while, and bid them weep:<br />
"Ah, touch their blue-veined eyelids if they sleep,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>"And shake their coverlet.<br />
<br />
"When you have told how I weep endlessly,<br />
"Flutter along the froth lips of the sea<br />
"And home to me again,<br />
"And in the shadow of my hair lie hid,<br />
"And tell me how you came to one unbid,<br />
"The saddest of all men."<br />
<br />
A maiden with soft eyes like funeral tapers,<br />
And face that seemed wrought out of moonlit vapours,<br />
And a sad mouth, that fear made tremulous<br />
As any ruddy moth, looked down on us;<br />
And she with a wave-rusted chain was tied<br />
To two old eagles, full of ancient pride,<br />
That with dim eyeballs stood on either side.<br />
Few feathers were on their dishevelled wings,<br />
For their dim minds were with the ancient things.<br />
<br />
"I bring deliverance," pearl-pale Niam said.<br />
<br />
"Neither the living, nor the unlabouring dead,<br />
"Nor the high gods who never lived, may fight<br />
"My enemy and hope; demons for fright<br />
"Jabber and scream about him in the night;<br />
"For he is strong and crafty as the seas<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>"That sprang under the Seven Hazel Trees,<br />
"And I must needs endure and hate and weep,<br />
"Until the gods and demons drop asleep,<br />
"Hearing Aed touch the mournful strings of gold."<br />
<br />
"Is he so dreadful?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"Be not over bold,</span><br />
"But flee while you may flee from him."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 19.5em;">Then I:</span><br />
"This demon shall be pierced and drop and die,<br />
"And his loose bulk be thrown in the loud tide."<br />
<br />
"Flee from him," pearl-pale Niam weeping cried,<br />
"For all men flee the demons"; but moved not<br />
My angry, king remembering soul one jot;<br />
There was no mightier soul of Heber's line;<br />
Now it is old and mouse-like: for a sign<br />
I burst the chain: still earless, nerveless, blind,<br />
Wrapped in the things of the unhuman mind,<br />
In some dim memory or ancient mood<br />
Still earless, nerveless, blind, the eagles stood.<br />
<br />
And then we climbed the stair to a high door;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>A hundred horsemen on the basalt floor<br />
Beneath had paced content: we held our way<br />
And stood within: clothed in a misty ray<br />
I saw a foam-white seagull drift and float<br />
Under the roof, and with a straining throat<br />
Shouted, and hailed him: he hung there a star,<br />
For no man's cry shall ever mount so far;<br />
Not even your God could have thrown down that hall;<br />
Stabling His unloosed lightnings in their stall,<br />
He had sat down and sighed with cumbered heart,<br />
As though His hour were come.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">We sought the part</span><br />
That was most distant from the door; green slime<br />
Made the way slippery, and time on time<br />
Showed prints of sea-born scales, while down through it<br />
The captive's journeys to and fro were writ<br />
Like a small river, and, where feet touched, came<br />
A momentary gleam of phosphorus flame.<br />
Under the deepest shadows of the hall<br />
That maiden found a ring hung on the wall,<br />
And in the ring a torch, and with its flare<br />
Making a world about her in the air,<br />
Passed under a dim doorway, out of sight<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>And came again, holding a second light<br />
Burning between her fingers, and in mine<br />
Laid it and sighed: I held a sword whose shine<br />
No centuries could dim: and a word ran<br />
Thereon in Ogham letters, "Mananan";<br />
That sea god's name, who in a deep content<br />
Sprang dripping, and, with captive demons sent<br />
Out of the seven-fold seas, built the dark hall<br />
Rooted in foam and clouds, and cried to all<br />
The mightier masters of a mightier race;<br />
And at his cry there came no milk-pale face<br />
Under a crown of thorns and dark with blood,<br />
But only exultant faces.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Niam stood</span><br />
With bowed head, trembling when the white blade shone,<br />
But she whose hours of tenderness were gone<br />
Had neither hope nor fear. I bade them hide<br />
Under the shadows till the tumults died<br />
Of the loud crashing and earth shaking fight,<br />
Lest they should look upon some dreadful sight;<br />
And thrust the torch between the slimy flags.<br />
A dome made out of endless carven jags,<br />
Where shadowy face flowed into shadowy face,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>Looked down on me; and in the self-same place<br />
I waited hour by hour, and the high dome,<br />
Windowless, pillarless, multitudinous home<br />
Of faces, waited; and the leisured gaze<br />
Was loaded with the memory of days<br />
Buried and mighty. When through the great door<br />
The dawn came in, and glimmered on the floor<br />
With a pale light, I journeyed round the hall<br />
And found a door deep sunken in the wall,<br />
The least of doors; beyond on a dim plain<br />
A little runnel made a bubbling strain,<br />
And on the runnel's stony and bare edge<br />
A husky demon dry as a withered sedge<br />
Swayed, crooning to himself an unknown tongue:<br />
In a sad revelry he sang and swung<br />
Bacchant and mournful, passing to and fro<br />
His hand along the runnel's side, as though<br />
The flowers still grew there: far on the sea's waste<br />
Shaking and waving, vapour vapour chased,<br />
While high frail cloudlets, fed with a green light,<br />
Like drifts of leaves, immovable and bright,<br />
Hung in the passionate dawn. He slowly turned:<br />
A demon's leisure: eyes, first white, now burned<br />
Like wings of kingfishers; and he arose<br />
Barking. We trampled up and down with blows<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>Of sword and brazen battle-axe, while day<br />
Gave to high noon and noon to night gave way;<br />
And when at withering of the sun he knew<br />
The Druid sword of Mananan, he grew<br />
To many shapes; I lunged at the smooth throat<br />
Of a great eel; it changed, and I but smote<br />
A fir-tree roaring in its leafless top;<br />
I held a dripping corpse, with livid chop<br />
And sunken shape, against my face and breast,<br />
When I tore down the tree; but when the west<br />
Surged up in plumy fire, I lunged and drave<br />
Through heart and spine, and cast him in the wave,<br />
Lest Niam shudder.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Full of hope and dread</span><br />
Those two came carrying wine and meat and bread,<br />
And healed my wounds with unguents out of flowers<br />
That feed white moths by some De Danaan shrine;<br />
Then in that hall, lit by the dim sea shine,<br />
We lay on skins of otters, and drank wine,<br />
Brewed by the sea-gods, from huge cups that lay<br />
Upon the lips of sea-gods in their day;<br />
And then on heaped-up skins of otters slept.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>But when the sun once more in saffron stept,<br />
Rolling his flagrant wheel out of the deep,<br />
We sang the loves and angers without sleep,<br />
And all the exultant labours of the strong:<br />
<br />
But now the lying clerics murder song<br />
With barren words and flatteries of the weak.<br />
In what land do the powerless turn the beak<br />
Of ravening Sorrow, or the hand of Wrath?<br />
For all your croziers, they have left the path<br />
And wander in the storms and clinging snows,<br />
Hopeless for ever: ancient Usheen knows,<br />
For he is weak and poor and blind, and lies<br />
On the anvil of the world.</p>

<p class="actor">S. PATRIC</p>

<p class="speech"><span style="margin-left: 13em;">Be still: the skies</span><br />
Are choked with thunder, lightning, and fierce wind,<br />
For God has heard, and speaks His angry mind;<br />
Go cast your body on the stones and pray,<br />
For He has wrought midnight and dawn and day.</p>

<p class="actor">USHEEN</p>

<p class="speech">Saint, do you weep? I hear amid the thunder<br />
The Fenian horses; armour torn asunder;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>Laughter and cries; the armies clash and shock;<br />
All is done now; I see the ravens flock;<br />
Ah, cease, you mournful, laughing Fenian horn!<br />
<br />
We feasted for three days. On the fourth morn<br />
I found, dropping sea foam on the wide stair,<br />
And hung with slime, and whispering in his hair,<br />
That demon dull and unsubduable;<br />
And once more to a day-long battle fell,<br />
And at the sundown threw him in the surge,<br />
To lie until the fourth morn saw emerge<br />
His new healed shape: and for a hundred years<br />
So warred, so feasted, with nor dreams nor fears,<br />
Nor languor nor fatigue: and endless feast,<br />
An endless war.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">The hundred years had ceased;</span><br />
I stood upon the stair: the surges bore<br />
A beech bough to me, and my heart grew sore,<br />
Remembering how I had stood by white-haired Finn<br />
Under a beech at Emen and heard the thin<br />
Outcry of bats.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">And then young Niam came</span><br />
Holding that horse, and sadly called my name;<br />
I mounted, and we passed over the lone<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>And drifting grayness, while this monotone,<br />
Surly and distant, mixed inseparably<br />
Into the clangour of the wind and sea.<br />
<br />
"I hear my soul drop down into decay,<br />
"And Mananan's dark tower, stone by stone,<br />
"Gather sea slime and fall the seaward way,<br />
"And the moon goad the waters night and day,<br />
"That all be overthrown.<br />
<br />
"But till the moon has taken all, I wage<br />
"War on the mightiest men under the skies,<br />
"And they have fallen or fled, age after age:<br />
"Light is man's love, and lighter is man's rage;<br />
"His purpose drifts and dies."<br />
<br />
And then lost Niam murmured, "Love, we go<br />
"To the Island of Forgetfulness, for lo!<br />
"The Islands of Dancing and of Victories<br />
"Are empty of all power."<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">"And which of these</span><br />
"Is the Island of Content?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">"None know," she said;</span><br />
And on my bosom laid her weeping head.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a></span></p>

<p>
Fled foam underneath us, and around us, a wandering and milky smoke,<br />
High as the saddle girth, covering away from our glances the tide;<br />
And those that fled, and that followed, from the foam-pale distance broke;<br />
The immortal desire of immortals we saw in their faces, and sighed.<br />
<br />
I mused on the chase with the Fenians, and Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair,<br />
And never a song sang Niam, and over my finger-tips<br />
Came now the sliding of tears and sweeping of mist-cold hair,<br />
And now the warmth of sighs, and after the quiver of lips.<br />
<br />
Were we days long or hours long in riding, when rolled in a grisly peace,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>An isle lay level before us, with dripping hazel and oak?<br />
And we stood on a sea's edge we saw not; for whiter than new-washed fleece<br />
Fled foam underneath us, and round us, a wandering and milky smoke.<br />
<br />
And we rode on the plains of the sea's edge; the sea's edge barren and gray,<br />
Gray sand on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees,<br />
Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away<br />
Like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the seas.<br />
<br />
But the trees grew taller and closer, immense in their wrinkling bark;<br />
Dropping; a murmurous dropping; old silence and that one sound;<br />
For no live creatures lived there, no weasels moved in the dark:<br />
Long sighs arose in our spirits, beneath us bubbled the ground.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>And the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow night,<br />
For, as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of the world and the sun,<br />
Ceased on our hands and our faces, on hazel and oak leaf, the light,<br />
And the stars were blotted above us, and the whole of the world was one.<br />
<br />
Till the horse gave a whinny; for, cumbrous with stems of the hazel and oak,<br />
A valley flowed down from his hoofs, and there in the long grass lay,<br />
Under the starlight and shadow, a monstrous slumbering folk,<br />
Their naked and gleaming bodies poured out and heaped in the way.<br />
<br />
And by them were arrow and war-axe, arrow and shield and blade;<br />
And dew-blanched horns, in whose hollow a child of three years old<br />
Could sleep on a couch of rushes, and all inwrought and inlaid,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>And more comely than man can make them with bronze and silver and gold.<br />
<br />
And each of the huge white creatures was huger than fourscore men;<br />
The tops of their ears were feathered, their hands were the claws of birds,<br />
And, shaking the plumes of the grasses and the leaves of the mural glen,<br />
The breathing came from those bodies, long-warless, grown whiter than curds.<br />
<br />
The wood was so spacious above them, that He who had stars for His flocks<br />
Could fondle the leaves with His fingers, nor go from His dew-cumbered skies;<br />
So long were they sleeping, the owls had builded their nests in their locks,<br />
Filling the fibrous dimness with long generations of eyes.<br />
<br />
And over the limbs and the valley the slow owls wandered and came,<br />
Now in a place of star-fire, and now in a shadow place wide;<br />
And the chief of the huge white creatures, his knees in the soft star-flame,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>Lay loose in a place of shadow: we drew the reins by his side.<br />
<br />
Golden the nails of his bird-claws, flung loosely along the dim ground;<br />
In one was a branch soft-shining, with bells more many than sighs,<br />
In midst of an old man's bosom; owls ruffling and pacing around,<br />
Sidled their bodies against him, filling the shade with their eyes.<br />
<br />
And my gaze was thronged with the sleepers; no, not since the world began,<br />
In realms where the handsome were many, nor in glamours by demons flung,<br />
Have faces alive with such beauty been known to the salt eye of man,<br />
Yet weary with passions that faded when the seven-fold seas were young.<br />
<br />
And I gazed on the bell-branch, sleep's forebear, far sung by the Sennachies.<br />
I saw how those slumberers, grown weary, there camping in grasses deep,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>Of wars with the wide world and pacing the shores of the wandering seas,<br />
Laid hands on the bell-branch and swayed it, and fed of unhuman sleep.<br />
<br />
Snatching the horn of Niam, I blew a lingering note;<br />
Came sound from those monstrous sleepers, a sound like the stirring of flies.<br />
He, shaking the fold of his lips, and heaving the pillar of his throat,<br />
Watched me with mournful wonder out of the wells of his eyes.<br />
<br />
I cried, "Come out of the shadow, king of the nails of gold!<br />
"And tell of your goodly household and the goodly works of your hands,<br />
"That we may muse in the starlight and talk of the battles of old;<br />
"Your questioner, Usheen, is worthy, he comes from the Fenian lands."<br />
<br />
Half open his eyes were, and held me, dull with the smoke of their dreams;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>His lips moved slowly in answer, no answer out of them came;<br />
Then he swayed in his fingers the bell-branch, slow dropping a sound in faint streams<br />
Softer than snow-flakes in April and piercing the marrow like flame.<br />
<br />
Wrapt in the wave of that music, with weariness more than of earth,<br />
The moil of my centuries filled me; and gone like a sea-covered stone<br />
Were the memories of the whole of my sorrow and the memories of the whole of my mirth,<br />
And a softness came from the starlight and filled me full to the bone.<br />
<br />
In the roots of the grasses, the sorrels, I laid my body as low;<br />
And the pearl-pale Niam lay by me, her brow on the midst of my breast;<br />
And the horse was gone in the distance, and years after years 'gan flow;<br />
Square leaves of the ivy moved over us, binding us down to our rest.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>And, man of the many white croziers, a century there I forgot;<br />
How the fetlocks drip blood in the battle, when the fallen on fallen lie rolled;<br />
How the falconer follows the falcon in the weeds of the heron's plot,<br />
And the names of the demons whose hammers made armour for Conhor of old.<br />
<br />
And, man of the many white croziers, a century there I forgot;<br />
That the spear-shaft is made out of ashwood, the shield out of ozier and hide;<br />
How the hammers spring on the anvil, on the spearhead's burning spot;<br />
How the slow, blue-eyed oxen of Finn low sadly at evening tide.<br />
<br />
But in dreams, mild man of the croziers, driving the dust with their throngs,<br />
Moved round me, of seamen or landsmen, all who are winter tales;<br />
Came by me the kings of the Red Branch, with roaring of laughter and songs,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>Or moved as they moved once, love-making or piercing the tempest with sails.<br />
<br />
Came Blanid, Mac Nessa, tall Fergus who feastward of old time slunk,<br />
Cook Barach, the traitor; and warward, the spittle on his beard never dry,<br />
Dark Balor, as old as a forest, car borne, his mighty head sunk<br />
Helpless, men lifting the lids of his weary and death-making eye.<br />
<br />
And by me, in soft red raiment, the Fenians moved in loud streams,<br />
And Grania, walking and smiling, sewed with her needle of bone,<br />
So lived I and lived not, so wrought I and wrought not, with creatures of dreams,<br />
In a long iron sleep, as a fish in the water goes dumb as a stone.<br />
<br />
At times our slumber was lightened. When the sun was on silver or gold;<br />
When brushed with the wings of the owls, in the dimness they love going by;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>When a glow-worm was green on a grass leaf, lured from his lair in the mould;<br />
Half wakening, we lifted our eyelids, and gazed on the grass with a sigh.<br />
<br />
So watched I when, man of the croziers, at the heel of a century fell,<br />
Weak, in the midst of the meadow, from his miles in the midst of the air,<br />
A starling like them that forgathered 'neath a moon waking white as a shell.<br />
When the Fenians made foray at morning with Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair.<br />
<br />
I awoke: the strange horse without summons out of the distance ran,<br />
Thrusting his nose to my shoulder; he knew in his bosom deep<br />
That once more moved in my bosom the ancient sadness of man,<br />
And that I would leave the immortals, their dimness, their dews dropping sleep.<br />
<br />
O, had you seen beautiful Niam grow white as the waters are white,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>Lord of the croziers, you even had lifted your hands and wept:<br />
But, the bird in my fingers, I mounted, remembering alone that delight<br />
Of twilight and slumber were gone, and that hoofs impatiently stept.<br />
<br />
I cried, "O Niam! O white one! if only a twelve-houred day,<br />
"I must gaze on the beard of Finn, and move where the old men and young<br />
"In the Fenians' dwellings of wattle lean on the chessboards and play,<br />
"Ah, sweet to me now were even bald Conan's slanderous tongue!<br />
<br />
"Like me were some galley forsaken far off in Meridian isle.<br />
"Remembering its long-oared companions, sails turning to thread-bare rags;<br />
"No more to crawl on the seas with long oars mile after mile,<br />
"But to be amid shooting of flies and flowering of rushes and flags."<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>Their motionless eyeballs of spirits grown mild with mysterious thought<br />
Watched her those seamless faces from the valley's glimmering girth;<br />
As she murmured, "O wandering Usheen, the strength of the bell-branch is naught,<br />
"For there moves alive in your fingers the fluttering sadness of earth.<br />
<br />
"Then go through the lands in the saddle and see what the mortals do,<br />
"And softly come to your Niam over the tops of the tide;<br />
"But weep for your Niam, O Usheen, weep; for if only your shoe<br />
"Brush lightly as haymouse earth's pebbles, you will come no more to my side.<br />
<br />
"O flaming lion of the world, O when will you turn to your rest?"<br />
"I saw from a distant saddle; from the earth she made her moan;<br />
"I would die like a small withered leaf in the autumn, for breast unto breast<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>"We shall mingle no more, nor our gazes empty their sweetness lone.<br />
<br />
"In the isles of the farthest seas where only the spirits come.<br />
"Were the winds less soft than the breath of a pigeon who sleeps on her nest,<br />
"Nor lost in the star-fires and odours the sound of the sea's vague drum?<br />
"O flaming lion of the world, O when will you turn to your rest?"<br />
<br />
The wailing grew distant; I rode by the woods of the wrinkling bark,<br />
Where ever is murmurous dropping, old silence and that one sound;<br />
For no live creatures live there, no weasels move in the dark;<br />
In a reverie forgetful of all things, over the bubbling ground.<br />
<br />
And I rode by the plains of the sea's edge, where all is barren and gray,<br />
Gray sands on the green of the grasses and over the dripping trees,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>Dripping and doubling landward, as though they would hasten away,<br />
Like an army of old men lounging for rest from the moan of the seas.<br />
<br />
And the winds made the sands on the sea's edge turning and turning go,<br />
As my mind made the names of the Fenians. Far from the hazel and oak,<br />
I rode away on the surges, where, high as the saddle bow,<br />
Fled foam underneath me, and round me, a wandering and milky smoke.<br />
<br />
Long fled the foam-flakes around me, the winds fled out of the vast,<br />
Snatching the bird in secret; nor knew I, embosomed apart,<br />
When they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast,<br />
For Remembrance, lifting her leanness, keened in the gates of my heart.<br />
<br />
Till fattening the winds of the morning, an odour of new-mown hay<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>Came, and my forehead fell low, and my tears like berries fell down;<br />
Later a sound came, half lost in the sound of a shore far away,<br />
From the great grass-barnacle calling, and later the shore-weeds brown.<br />
<br />
If I were as I once was, the strong hoofs crushing the sand and the shells,<br />
Coming out of the sea as the dawn comes, a chaunt of love on my lips,<br />
Not coughing, my head on my knees, and praying, and wroth with the bells,<br />
I would leave no saint's head on his body from Rachlin to Bera of ships.<br />
<br />
Making way from the kindling surges, I rode on a bridle-path<br />
Much wondering to see upon all hands, of wattles and woodwork made,<br />
Your bell-mounted churches, and guardless the sacred cairn and the rath,<br />
And a small and a feeble populace stooping with mattock and spade.<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>Or weeding or ploughing with faces a-shining with much-toil wet;<br />
While in this place and that place, with bodies unglorious, their chieftains stood,<br />
Awaiting in patience the straw-death, croziered one, caught in your net:<br />
Went the laughter of scorn from my mouth like the roaring of wind in a wood.<br />
<br />
And because I went by them so huge and so speedy with eyes so bright,<br />
Came after the hard gaze of youth, or an old man lifted his head:<br />
And I rode and I rode, and I cried out, "The Fenians hunt wolves in the night,<br />
So sleep thee by daytime." A voice cried, "The Fenians a long time are dead."<br />
<br />
A whitebeard stood hushed on the pathway, the flesh of his face as dried grass,<br />
And in folds round his eyes and his mouth, he sad as a child without milk;<br />
And the dreams of the islands were gone, and I knew how men sorrow and pass,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>And their hound, and their horse, and their love, and their eyes that glimmer like silk.<br />
<br />
And wrapping my face in my hair, I murmured, "In old age they ceased";<br />
And my tears were larger than berries, and I murmured, "Where white clouds lie spread<br />
"On Crevroe or broad Knockfefin, with many of old they feast<br />
"On the floors of the gods." He cried, "No, the gods a long time are dead."<br />
<br />
And lonely and longing for Niam, I shivered and turned me about,<br />
The heart in me longing to leap like a grasshopper into her heart;<br />
I turned and rode to the westward, and followed the sea's old shout<br />
Till I saw where Maive lies sleeping till starlight and midnight part.<br />
<br />
And there at the foot of the mountain, two carried a sack full of sand,<br />
They bore it with staggering and sweating, but fell with their burden at length:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>Leaning down from the gem-studded saddle, I flung it five yards with my hand,<br />
With a sob for men waxing so weakly, a sob for the Fenian's old strength.<br />
<br />
The rest you have heard of, O croziered one; how, when divided the girth,<br />
I fell on the path, and the horse went away like a summer fly;<br />
And my years three hundred fell on me, and I rose, and walked on the earth,<br />
A creeping old man, full of sleep, with the spittle on his beard never dry.<br />
<br />
How the men of the sand-sack showed me a church with its belfry in air;<br />
Sorry place, where for swing of the war-axe in my dim eyes the crozier gleams;<br />
What place have Caolte and Conan, and Bran, Sgeolan, Lomair?<br />
Speak, you too are old with your memories, an old man surrounded with dreams.</p>

<h2 class="p6"><a name="GLOSSARY_AND_NOTES" id="GLOSSARY_AND_NOTES"></a>GLOSSARY AND NOTES</h2>


<p><i>The Pronunciation of the Irish Words.</i>&mdash;When I wrote the
greater number of these poems I had hardly considered the
question seriously. I copied at times somebody's perhaps
fanciful phonetic spelling, and at times the ancient spelling as
I found it in some literal translation, pronouncing the words
always as they were spelt. I do not suppose I would have
defended this system at any time, but I do not yet know what
system to adopt. The modern pronunciation, which is usually
followed by those who spell the words phonetically, is certainly
unlike the pronunciation of the time when classical Irish literature
was written, and, so far as I know, no Irish scholar who
writes in English or French has made that minute examination
of the way the names come into the rhythms and measures of the
old poems which can alone discover the old pronunciation. A
French Celtic scholar gave me the pronunciation of a few names,
and told me that Mr. Whitley Stokes had written something about
the subject in German, but I am ignorant of German. If I ever
learn the old pronunciation, I will revise all these poems, but at
present I can only affirm that I have not treated my Irish names
as badly as the mediæval writers of the stories of King Arthur
treated their Welsh names.</p>

<p><i>Mythological Gods and Heroes.</i>&mdash;I refer the reader for such
names as Balor and Finn and Usheen to Lady Gregory's
"Cuchulain of Muirthemne" and to her "Gods and Fighting
Men."</p>

<p><i>The Ballad of Father Gilligan.</i>&mdash;A tradition among the people
of Castleisland, Kerry.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p><i>The Ballad of Father O'Hart.</i>&mdash;This ballad is founded on
the story of a certain Father O'Hart, priest of Coloony, Sligo,
in the last century, as told by the present priest of Coloony
in his <i>History of Ballisodare and Kilvarnet</i>. The robbery
of the lands of Father O'Hart was a kind of robbery which
occurred but rarely during the penal laws. Catholics, forbidden
to own landed property, evaded the law by giving a Protestant
nominal possession of their estates. There are instances on
record in which poor men were nominal owners of immense
estates.</p>

<p><i>The Ballad of the Foxhunter.</i>&mdash;Founded on an incident, probably
itself a Tipperary tradition, in Kickham's <i>Knockagow</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bell-branch.</i>&mdash;A legendary branch whose shaking casts all men
into a sleep.</p>

<p><i>The Countess Cathleen.</i>&mdash;I found the story of the Countess
Cathleen in what professed to be a collection of Irish folk-lore in
an Irish newspaper some years ago. I wrote to the compiler,
asking about its source, but got no answer, but have since heard
that it was translated from <i>Les Matinées de Timothè Trimm</i> a
good many years ago, and has been drifting about the Irish
press ever since. Léo Lespès gives it as an Irish story, and
though the editor of <i>Folklore</i> has kindly advertised for information,
the only Christian variant I know of is a Donegal tale,
given by Mr. Larminie in his <i>West Irish Folk Tales and
Romances</i>, of a woman who goes to hell for ten years to save
her husband, and stays there another ten, having been granted
permission to carry away as many souls as could cling to her
skirt. Léo Lespès may have added a few details, but I have no
doubt of the essential antiquity of what seems to me the most
impressive form of one of the supreme parables of the world.
The parable came to the Greeks in the sacrifice of Alcestis, but
her sacrifice was less overwhelming, less apparently irremediable.
Léo Lespès tells the story as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ce que je vais vous dire est un récit du carême Irlandais.
Le boiteux, l'aveugle, le paralytique des rues de Dublin ou de
Limerick, vous le diraient mieux que moi, cher lecteur, si vous
alliez le leur demander, un sixpense d'argent à la main.&mdash;Il
n'est pas une jeune fille catholique à laquelle on ne l'ait appris
pendant les jours de préparation à la communion sainte, pas un
berger des bords de la Blackwater qui ne le puisse redire à la
veillée.</p>

<p>Il y a bien longtemps qu'il apparut tout-à-coup dans la vielle
Irlande deux marchands inconnus dont personne n'avait ouï
parler, et qui parlaient néanmoins avec la plus grande perfection
la langue du pays. Leurs cheveux étaient noirs et ferrés avec
de l'or et leurs robes d'une grande magnificence.</p>

<p>Tous deux semblaient avoir le même âge; ils paraissaient
être des hommes de cinquante ans, car leur barbe grisonnait un
peu.</p>

<p>Or, à cette époque, comme aujourd'hui, l'Irlande était pauvre,
car le soleil avait été rare, et des récoltes presque nulles. Les
indigents ne savaient à quel sainte se vouer, et la misère devenait
de plus en plus terrible.</p>

<p>Dans l'hôtellerie où descendirent les marchands fastueux on
chercha à pénétrer leurs desseins: mais ce fut en vain, ils
demeurèrent silencieux et discrets.</p>

<p>Et pendant qu'ils demeurèrent dans l'hôtellerie, ils ne cessèrent
de compter et de recompter des sacs de pièces d'or, dont la vive
clarté s'apercevait à travers les vitres du logis.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, leur dit l'hôtesse un jour, d'où vient que vous êtes
si opulents, et que, venus pour secourir la misère publique, vous
ne fassiez pas de bonnes &#339;uvres?</p>

<p>&mdash;Belle hôtesse, répondit l'un d'eux, nous n'avons pas voulu
aller au-devant d'infortunes honorables, dans la crainte d'être
trompés par des misères fictives: que la douleur frappe à la
porte, nous ouvrirons.</p>

<p>Le lendemain, quand on sut qu'il existait deux opulents
étrangers prêts à prodiguer l'or, la foule assiégea leur logis; mais<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
les figures des gens qui en sortaient étaient bien diverses. Les
uns avaient la fierté dans le regard, les autres portaient la honte
au front. Les deux trafiquants achetaient des âmes pour le
démon. L'âme d'un vieillard valait vingt pièces d'or, pas un
penny de plus; car Satan avait eu le temps d'y former
hypothèque. L'âme d'une épose en valait cinquante quand
elle était jolie, ou cent quand elle était laide. L'âme d'une
jeune fille se payait des prix fous: les fleurs les plus belles et les
plus pures sont les plus chères.</p>

<p>Pendant ce temps, il existait dans la ville un ange de beauté,
la comtesse Ketty O'Connor. Elle était l'idole du peuple, et
la providence des indigents. Dès qu'elle eut appris que des
mécréants profitaient de la misère publique pour dérober des
c&#339;urs à Dieu, elle fit appeler son majordome.</p>

<p>&mdash;Master Patrick, lui dit elle, combien ai-je de pièces d'or
dans mon coffre?</p>

<p>&mdash;Cent mille.</p>

<p>&mdash;Combien de bijoux?</p>

<p>&mdash;Peur autant d'argent.</p>

<p>&mdash;Combien de châteux, de bois et de terres?</p>

<p>&mdash;Pour le double de ces sommes.</p>

<p>&mdash;Eh bien! Patrick, vendez tout ce qui n'est pas or et
apportez-m'en le montant. Je ne veux garder à moi que ce
castel et le champ qui l'entoure.</p>

<p>Deux jours après, les ordres de la pieuse Ketty étaient
exécutés et le trésor était distribué aux pauvres au fur et à mesure
de leurs besoins.</p>

<p>Ceci ne faisait pas le compte, dit la tradition, des commis-voyageurs
du malin esprit, qui ne trouvaient plus d'âmes
à acheter.</p>

<p>Aidés par un valet infâme, ils pénétrèrent dans la retraite de
la noble dame et lui dérobèrent le reste de son trésor ... en
vain lutta-t-elle de toutes ses forces pour sauver le contenu de
son coffre, les larrons diaboliques furent les plus forts. Si Ketty
avait eu les moyens de faire un signe de croix, ajoute la légende<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Irlandaise, elle les eût mis en fuite, mais ses mains étaient
captives&mdash;Le larcin fut effectué. Alors les pauvres sollicitèrent
en vain près de Ketty dépouillée, elle ne pouvait plus secourir
leur misère;&mdash;elle les abandonnait à la tentation. Pourtant il
n'y avait plus que huit jours à passer pour que les grains et lea
fourrages arrivassent en abondance des pays d'Orient. Mais,
huit jours, c'était un siècle: huit jours nécessitaient une somme
immense pour subvenir aux exigences de la disette, et les
pauvres allaient ou expirer dans les angousses de la faim, ou,
reniant les saintes maximes de l'Evangile, vendre à vil prix leur
âme, le plus beau présent de la munificence du Seigneur tout-puissant.</p>

<p>Et Ketty n'avait plus une obole, car elle avait abandonné son
châteux aux malheureux.</p>

<p>Elle passa douze heures dans les larmes et le deuil, arrachant
ses cheveux couleur de soleil et meurtrissant son sein couleur du
lis: puis elle se leva résolue, animée par un vif sentiment de
désespoir.</p>

<p>Elle se rendit chez les marchands d'âmes.</p>

<p>&mdash;Que voulez-vous? dirent ils.</p>

<p>&mdash;Vous achetez des âmes?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oui, un peu malgré vous, n'est ce pas, sainte aux yeux de
saphir?</p>

<p>&mdash;Aujourd'hui je viens vous proposer un marché, reprit
elle.</p>

<p>&mdash;Lequel?</p>

<p>&mdash;J'ai une âme a vendre; mais elle est chère.</p>

<p>&mdash;Qu'importe si elle est précieuse? l'âme, comme le diamant,
s'apprécie à sa blancheur.</p>

<p>&mdash;C'est la mienne, dit Ketty.</p>

<p>Les deux envoyés de Satan tressaillirent. Leurs griffes
s'allongèrent sous leurs gants de cuir; leurs yeux gris étincelèrent&mdash;l'âme,
pure, immaculée, virginale de Ketty!... c'était
une acquisition inappréciable.</p>

<p>&mdash;Gentille dame, combien voulez-vous?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p>&mdash;Cent cinquante mille écus d'or.</p>

<p>&mdash;C'est fait, dirent les marchands: et ils tendirent à
Ketty un parchemin cacheté de noir, qu'elle signa en frissonnant.</p>

<p>La somme lui fut comptée.</p>

<p>Des qu'elle fut rentrée, elle dit au majordome:</p>

<p>&mdash;Tenez, distribuez ceci. Avec la somme que je vous donne
les pauvres attendront la huitaine nécessaire et pas une de leurs
âmes ne sera livrée au démon.</p>

<p>Puis elle s'enferma et recommanda qu'on ne vint pas la
déranger.</p>

<p>Trois jours se passèrent; elle n'appela pas; elle ne sortit
pas.</p>

<p>Quand on ouvrit sa porte, on la trouva raide et froide: elle
était morte de douleur.</p>

<p>Mais la vente de cette âme si adorable dans sa charité fut
déclarée nulle par le Seigneur: car elle avait sauvé ses concitoyens
de la morte éternelle.</p>

<p>Après la huitaine, des vaisseaux nombreux amenèrent à
l'Irlande affamée d'immenses provisions de grains.</p>

<p>La famine n'était plus possible. Quant aux marchands, ils
disparurent de leur hôtellerie, sans qu'on sût jamais ce qu'ils
étaient devenus.</p>

<p>Toutefois, les pêcheurs de la Blackwater prétendent qu'ils
sont enchainés dans une prison souterraine par ordre de
Lucifer jusqu'au moment où ils pourront livrer l'âme de Ketty
qui leur a échappé. Je vous dis la légende telle que je la sais.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mais les pauvres l'ont raconté d'âge en âge et les enfants de
Cork et de Dublin chantent encore la ballade dont voici les
derniers couplets:&mdash;</p>

<p>
Pour sauver les pauvres qu'elle aime<br />
Ketty donna<br />
Son esprit, sa croyance même:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>Satan paya<br />
Cette âme au dévoûment sublime,<br />
En écus d'or,<br />
Disons pour racheter son crime,<br />
<i>Confiteor</i>.<br />
<br />
Mais l'ange qui se fit coupable<br />
Par charité<br />
Au séjour d'amour ineffable<br />
Est remonté.<br />
Satan vaincu n'eut pas de prise<br />
Sur ce c&#339;ur d'or;<br />
Chantons sous la nef de l'église,<br />
<i>Confiteor</i>.</p>

<p>N'est ce pas que ce récit, né de l'imagination des poètes
catholiques de la verte Erin, est une véritable récit de carême?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i>The Countess Cathleen</i> was acted in Dublin in 1899, with
Mr. Marcus St. John and Mr. Trevor Lowe as the First and
Second Demon, Mr. Valentine Grace as Shemus Rua, Master
Charles Sefton as Teig, Madame San Carola as Mary, Miss
Florence Farr as Aleel, Miss Anna Mather as Oona, Mr.
Charles Holmes as the Herdsman, Mr. Jack Wilcox as the
Gardener, Mr. Walford as a Peasant, Miss Dorothy Paget as a
Spirit, Miss M. Kelly as a Peasant Woman, Mr. T.E. Wilkinson
as a Servant, and Miss May Whitty as The Countess
Kathleen. They had to face a very vehement opposition stirred
up by a politician and a newspaper, the one accusing me in a
pamphlet, the other in long articles day after day, of blasphemy
because of the language of the demons or of Shemus Rua, and
because I made a woman sell her soul and yet escape damnation,
and of a lack of patriotism because I made Irish men and
women, who, it seems, never did such a thing, sell theirs. The
politician or the newspaper persuaded some forty Catholic
students to sign a protest against the play, and a Cardinal, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
avowed that he had not read it, to make another, and both
politician and newspaper made such obvious appeals to the
audience to break the peace, that a score or so of police were sent
to the theatre to see that they did not. I had, however, no
reason to regret the result, for the stalls, containing almost all
that was distinguished in Dublin, and a gallery of artisans alike
insisted on the freedom of literature.</p>

<p>After the performance in 1899 I added the love scene between
Aleel and the Countess, and in this new form the play was
revived in New York by Miss Wycherley as well as being
played a good deal in England and America by amateurs.
Now at last I have made a complete revision to make it
suitable for performance at the Abbey Theatre. The first two
scenes are almost wholly new, and throughout the play I have
added or left out such passages as a stage experience of some
years showed me encumbered the action; the play in its first
form having been written before I knew anything of the theatre.
I have left the old end, however, in the version printed in the
body of this book, because the change for dramatic purposes
has been made for no better reason than that audiences&mdash;even
at the Abbey Theatre&mdash;are almost ignorant of Irish mythology&mdash;or
because a shallow stage made the elaborate vision of armed
angels upon a mountain-side impossible. The new end is
particularly suited to the Abbey stage, where the stage platform
can be brought out in front of the proscenium and have a flight
of steps at one side up which the Angel comes, crossing towards
the back of the stage at the opposite side. The principal lighting
is from two arc lights in the balcony which throw their
lights into the faces of the players, making footlights unnecessary.
The room at Shemus Rua's house is suggested by a great grey
curtain&mdash;a colour which becomes full of rich tints under the
stream of light from the arcs. The two or more arches in the third
scene permit the use of a gauze. The short front scene before
the last is just long enough when played with incidental music
to allow the scene set behind it to be changed. The play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
when played without interval in this way lasts a little over
an hour.</p>

<p>The play was performed at the Abbey Theatre for the first
time on December 14, 1911, Miss Maire O'Neill taking the part
of the Countess, and the last scene from the going out of the
Merchants was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Down by the Salley Gardens.</i>&mdash;An extension of three lines
sung to me by an old woman at Ballisodare.</p>

<p><i>Findrinny (Findruine).</i>&mdash;A kind of white bronze.</p>

<p><i>Finvarra (Finbar).</i>&mdash;The king of the faeries of Connaught.</p>

<p><i>Hell.</i>&mdash;In the older Irish books Hell is always cold, and it
may be because the Fomoroh, or evil powers, ruled over the
north and the winter. Christianity adopted as far as possible
the Pagan symbolism in Ireland as elsewhere, and Irish poets,
when they spoke of "the cold flagstone of Hell," may have
repeated Pagan symbolism. The folk-tales, and Keating in his
description of Hell, make use, however, of the ordinary symbolism
of fire.</p>

<p><i>The Lamentation of the Pensioner.</i>&mdash;This poem is little more
than a translation into verse of the very words of an old Wicklow
peasant. Fret means doom or destiny.</p>

<p><i>The Land of Heart's Desire.</i>&mdash;This little play was produced
at the Avenue Theatre in the spring of 1894, with the following
cast:&mdash;Maurteen Bruin, Mr. James Welch; Shawn Bruin,
Mr. A.E.W. Mason; Father Hart, Mr. G.R. Foss;
Bridget Bruin, Miss Charlotte Morland; Maire Bruin, Miss
Winifred Fraser; A Faery Child, Miss Dorothy Paget. It
ran for a little over six weeks. It was revived in America
in 1901, when it was taken on tour by Mrs. Lemoyne.
It has been played two or three times professionally since
then in America and a great many times in England and
America by amateurs. Till lately it was not part of the
repertory of the Abbey Theatre, for I had grown to dislike
it without knowing what I disliked in it. This winter, however,
I have made many revisions and now it plays well
enough to give me pleasure. It is printed in this book in
the new form, which was acted for the first time on February<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
22, 1912, at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. At the Abbey
Theatre, where the platform of the stage comes out in front
of the curtain, the curtain falls before the priest's last words.
He remains outside the curtain and the words are spoken to
the audience like an epilogue.</p>

<p><i>The Meditation of the Old Fisherman.</i>&mdash;This poem is founded
upon some things a fisherman said to me when out fishing in
Sligo Bay.</p>

<p><i>Northern Cold.</i>&mdash;The Fomor, the powers of death and
darkness and cold and evil, came from the north.</p>

<p><i>Nuala.</i>&mdash;The wife of Finvarra.</p>

<p><i>Rose.</i>&mdash;The rose is a favourite symbol with the Irish poets,
and has given a name to several poems both Gaelic and English,
and is used in love poems, in addresses to Ireland like Mr.
Aubrey de Vere's poem telling how "The little black rose shall
be red at last," and in religious poems, like the old Gaelic one
which speaks of "the Rose of Friday," meaning the Rose of
Austerity.</p>

<p><i>Salley.</i>&mdash;Willow.</p>

<p><i>Seven Hazel-trees.</i>&mdash;There was once a well overshadowed by
seven sacred hazel-trees, in the midst of Ireland. A certain
woman plucked their fruit, and seven rivers arose out of the well
and swept her away. In my poems this well is the source of all
the waters of this world, which are therefore seven-fold.</p>

<p><i>The Wanderings of Usheen.</i>&mdash;The poem is founded upon the
middle Irish dialogues of S. Patric and Usheen and a certain
Gaelic poem of the last century. The events it describes, like
the events in most of the poems in this volume, are supposed
to have taken place rather in the indefinite period, made up of
many periods, described by the folk-tales, than in any particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
century; it therefore, like the later Fenian stories themselves,
mixes much that is mediæval with much that is ancient. The
Gaelic poems do not make Usheen go to more than one island,
but a story in <i>Silva Gadelica</i> describes "four paradises," an island
to the north, an island to the west, an island to the south, and
Adam's paradise in the east.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
