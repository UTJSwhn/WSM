<h2>TRANSLATORS' PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The story which is here first presented in an
English form, is one of Herr Björnson's best
works. In the original, it has already attained a
very wide circulation throughout Northern Europe,
and is there generally recognized as one of the
truest and most beautiful representations of Norwegian
life. At the present time, when there is among
us a constantly increasing interest in all things pertaining
to the Scandinavian nations, this work possesses
great claims to attention, not only through its
intrinsic merits, but also from the fact that it is one
of the very few works which can, in the fullest
sense, be termed Norwegian. During the long
political union of Norway with Denmark, Norwegian
literature was so deeply imbued by Danish
thought and feeling, that it could not be considered
national. After those political changes in 1814,
which placed Norway among the free nations, she
strove to take an independent position; and she produced
several gifted writers who endeavored to create
a national literature; but she had for many years<a class="pagenum" name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv" title="[Pg iv]"></a>
no great works unimpressed with the old Danish
stamp. Not till 1857, when a young and comparatively
unknown writer published a book called
"Synnove Solbakken," can the distinct literary
life of Norway be considered to have commenced.
That young writer was Björnstjerne Björnson. Since
the appearance of "Synnove Solbakken," he has produced
the present story, a few other short sketches,
and several dramatic works. All these productions
are, both in subject and style, thoroughly representative
of the grand old nation whence they sprang;
and they are, moreover, so full of original poetic
beauty and descriptive power, that they have
stamped their author as one of the greatest writers
in Northern Europe.</p>

<p>While presenting this work from one who so well
deserves to be known and honored by all, we very
much wish we could also present a sketch of his
history. But, so far as we have been able to ascertain,
there is very little material; for, happily, Herr
Björnson is yet young, and in the midst of his literary
career; and therefore only a small part of his
life-story can yet be told. We have, however, obtained
a few interesting details, principally from a
little sketch in the Danish of Herr Clemens Petersen.</p>

<p>Herr Björnson is the son of a clergyman; and
was born in 1832, at Kvikne, a lonely parish on the
Dovre Fjeld. In his earliest years, he was so far
from being marked by any unusual degree of mental
development, that he was even regarded as<a class="pagenum" name="Page_v" id="Page_v" title="[Pg v]"></a>
"stupid:" he seems to have been at that time merely
a strong-limbed, happy, playful little fellow. Whenever
he was at home, he constantly made the quiet
parsonage a scene of confusion and uproar through
his wild play. "Things," says Herr Petersen,
"which had within the memory of man never been
moved, were flung down; chairs and tables spun
round; and all the girls and boys in the place ran
about with him in noisy play; while his mother
used to clasp her hands in fright, and declare he
must soon be sent off to sea." When, in his twelfth
year, he went to school, he appears to have been
just as little characterized by any unusual mental
development, and just as much by physical activity.
He was placed on the lowest form to learn with the
little boys. But when he got out-doors into the
playground, he was at once among the leaders, and
feared nobody: on one occasion he soundly thrashed
the strongest boy in the whole school. Although,
however, no one else at this time saw any promise
of his future greatness, he had himself a presentiment
of it: deep in the heart of the rough Norwegian
school-boy, who seemed to think of little but
play, was hidden a purpose to become an author,
and even the greatest of all authors.</p>

<p>At the University, Herr Björnson was as little distinguished
by intellectual attainments as at school;
and he never passed the second part of his examination.
He seems, indeed, never to have been a very
earnest student of any writings save those "manuscripts
of God" contained in the great volumes of<a class="pagenum" name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi" title="[Pg vi]"></a>
Nature and human society. <em>These</em>, few have studied
more earnestly, or translated with greater force
and beauty.</p>

<p>While studying at the University, Herr Björnson's
literary purposes still remained; and during this
time he produced his first drama, "Valburg," though
he had then never read one dramatic work through,
or been at a theatre more than twice in his life. He
sent "Valburg" to the managers of the theatre at
Christiana; and it was accepted. But as soon as he
had been to the theatre a few times, he decided that,
in its present state, it was not a fit medium for the
expression of his inner life; and he therefore took
his piece back before it had been played. For a
while afterwards, he devoted a great part of his
time to dramatic criticism. He attacked some of
the prevalent errors in theatrical affairs with so
much force and boldness that he greatly exasperated
the orthodox actors and managers, and thus brought
down much annoyance upon himself. His criticisms
were, however, the means of greatly improving
the Norwegian drama, especially by partly
releasing it from the undue Danish influence which
prevented it from becoming truly national.</p>

<p>Herr Björnson subsequently abandoned his dramatic
criticism, left Christiana, and returned to his
father's home in the country. Here he assiduously
devoted himself to literary work, but without very
satisfactory tangible results. Next, he went back
to Christiana, and employed himself in writing for
various periodicals, where he inserted a series of<a class="pagenum" name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii" title="[Pg vii]"></a>
short sketches which, although far inferior to his
subsequent and more mature productions, bore
strong indications of genius, and attracted much
attention. But, meanwhile, their noble young author
lived a sad and weary life&mdash;depressed by the
fear that his best hopes would never be realized&mdash;harassed
by pecuniary difficulties, and tormented
by the most cruel persecution. Next, he went to
Upsala, where he still employed himself upon periodical
literature, and had an interval of comparative
quiet and happiness. Thence, he travelled to Hamburg,
and afterwards to Copenhagen. Here he
remained half a year, living a quiet, studious life,
and associating with some of the most eminent men
in the city. "Those days," said he, "were the best
I ever had." Certainly, they were very fruitful
ones. In them he produced one complete work,
parts of several others, and the first half of "Synnove
Solbakken," the tale which was destined to
place him in the foremost rank of Scandinavian
writers. It is a remarkable fact that shortly before
he left Copenhagen with all this heap of wealth, he
had passed through a crisis of such miserable depression
that he was just about to abandon literary
labor for ever, through a sense of utter unfitness to
perform it.</p>

<p>From Copenhagen, Herr Björnson returned to
Norway, and was for two years manager of the
theatre at Bergen, occupying most of the time in
the training of actors. Thence he went, with his
young wife, again to Christiana, where he for some<a class="pagenum" name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii" title="[Pg viii]"></a>
months edited <i lang="no">Aftenbladet</i>, one of the leading Norwegian
journals.</p>

<p>Relative to Herr Björnson's subsequent life and
labors, there is but very little available information.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of our own part in the following pages, we have
but to say we have earnestly endeavored to deal
faithfully and reverently with Herr Björnson's work,
and to render nearly every passage as fully and literally
as the construction of the two languages permits.
The only exceptions are two very short, and
comparatively very unimportant passages, which we
have ventured to omit, because we believed they
would render the book less acceptable to English
readers.</p>

<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I.<br />
<span class="italic">HOW THE CLIFF WAS CLAD.</span></h2>


<p>Between two cliffs lay a deep ravine, with a full
stream rolling heavily through it over boulders and
rough ground. It was high and steep, and one side was
bare, save at the foot, where clustered a thick, fresh
wood, so close to the stream that the mist from the water
lay upon the foliage in spring and autumn. The trees
stood looking upwards and forwards, unable to move
either way.</p>

<p>"What if we were to clothe the Cliff?" said the Juniper
one day to the foreign Oak that stood next him.
The Oak looked down to find out who was speaking,
and then looked up again without answering a word.
The Stream worked so hard that it grew white; the
Northwind rushed through the ravine, and shrieked in
the fissures; and the bare Cliff hung heavily over and
felt cold. "What if we were to clothe the Cliff?" said
the Juniper to the Fir on the other side. "Well, if anybody
is to do it, I suppose we must," replied the Fir,
stroking his beard; "what dost thou think?" he added,
looking over to the Birch. "In God's name, let us
clothe it," answered the Birch, glancing timidly towards
the Cliff, which hung over her so heavily that she felt as
if she could scarcely breathe. And thus, although they<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" id="Page_12" title="[Pg 12]"></a>
were but three, they agreed to clothe the Cliff. The
Juniper went first.</p>

<p>When they had gone a little way they met the Heather.
The Juniper seemed as though he meant to pass her by.
"Nay, let us take the Heather with us," said the Fir.
So on went the Heather. Soon the Juniper began to
slip. "Lay hold on me," said the Heather. The Juniper
did so, and where there was only a little crevice the
Heather put in one finger, and where she had got in one
finger the Juniper put in his whole hand. They crawled
and climbed, the Fir heavily behind with the Birch. "It
is a work of charity," said the Birch.</p>

<p>But the Cliff began to ponder what little things these
could be that came clambering up it. And when it had
thought over this a few hundred years, it sent down a
little Brook to see about it. It was just spring flood,
and the Brook rushed on till she met the Heather.
"Dear, dear Heather, canst thou not let me pass? I
am so little," said the Brook. The Heather, being very
busy, only raised herself a little, and worked on. The
Brook slipped under her, and ran onwards. "Dear,
dear Juniper, canst thou not let me pass? I am so
little," said the Brook. The Juniper glanced sharply
at her; but as the Heather had let her pass, he thought
he might do so as well. The Brook slipped under
him, and ran on till she came where the Fir stood
panting on a crag. "Dear, dear Fir, canst thou not
let me pass? I am so little," the Brook said, fondly
kissing the Fir on his foot. The Fir felt bashful and
let her pass. But the Birch made way before the
Brook asked. "He, he, he," laughed the Brook, as
she grew larger. "Ha, ha, ha," laughed the Brook
again, pushing Heather and Juniper, Fir and Birch,
forwards and backwards, up and down on the great<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" id="Page_13" title="[Pg 13]"></a>
crags. The Cliff sat for many hundred years after,
pondering whether it did not smile a little that day.</p>

<p>It was clear the Cliff did not wish to be clad. The
Heather felt so vexed that she turned green again, and
then she went on. "Never mind; take courage!" said
the Heather.</p>

<p>The Juniper sat up to look at the Heather, and at
last he rose to his feet. He scratched his head a moment,
and then he too went on again, and clutched
so firmly, that he thought the Cliff could not help
feeling it. "If thou wilt not take me, then I will take
thee," said he. The Fir bent his toes a little to feel if
they were whole, lifted one foot, which he found all
right, then the other, which was all right too, and then
both feet. He first examined the path he had come,
then where he had been lying, and at last where he
had to go. Then he strode onwards, just as though
he had never fallen. The Birch had been splashed
very badly, but now she got up and made herself tidy.
And so they went rapidly on, upwards and sidewards,
in sunshine and rain. "But what in the world is all
this?" said the Cliff, when the summer sun shone, the
dew-drops glittered, the birds sang, the wood-mouse
squeaked, the hare bounded, and the weasel hid and
screamed among the trees.</p>

<p>Then the day came when the Heather could peep
over the Cliff's edge. "Oh, dear me!" said she, and
over she went. "What is it the Heather sees, dear?"
said the Juniper, and came forwards till he, too, could
peep over. "Dear me!" he cried, and over he went.
"What's the matter with the Juniper to-day?" said the
Fir, taking long strides in the hot sun. Soon he, too,
by standing on tiptoes could peep over. "Ah!"&mdash;every
branch and prickle stood on end with astonishment. He<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" id="Page_14" title="[Pg 14]"></a>
strode onwards, and over he went. "What is it they all
see, and not I?" said the Birch, lifting up her skirts, and
tripping after. "Ah!" said she, putting her head over,
"there is a whole forest, both of Fir and Heather, and
Juniper and Birch, waiting for us on the plain;" and her
leaves trembled in the sunshine till the dew-drops fell.
"This comes of reaching forwards," said the Juniper.</p>

<span class="italic">A CLOUDY DAWN.</span></h2>


<p>Arne was born upon the mountain plain.</p>

<p>His mother's name was Margit, and she was the
only child at the farm, Kampen. In her eighteenth year
she once stayed too long at a dancing party. The friends
she came with had left, and then she thought the way
homewards would be just the same whether she stayed
over another dance or not. So it came to pass that she
was still sitting there when the fiddler, Nils, the tailor,
laid aside his violin and asked another man to play. He
then took out the prettiest girl to dance, his feet keeping
as exact time as the music to a song, while with his bootheel
he kicked off the hat of the tallest man there. "Ho!"
he said.</p>

<p>As Margit walked home that night, the moonbeams
played upon the snow with such strange beauty, that
after she had gone up to her bedchamber she felt she
must look out at them once more. She took off her
bodice, but remained standing with it in her hand. Then
she felt chilly, undressed herself hastily, and crouched
far down beneath the fur coverlet. That night she
dreamed of a great red cow which had gone astray in
the corn-fields. She wished to drive it out, but however
much she tried, she could not move from the spot; and
the cow stood quietly, and went on eating till it grew
plump and satisfied, from time to time looking over to
her with its large, mild eyes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" id="Page_16" title="[Pg 16]"></a>
The next time there was a dance in the parish, Margit
was there. She sat listening to the music, and cared
little for the dancing that night; and she was glad somebody
else, too, cared no more for it than she did. But
when it grew later the fiddler, Nils, the tailor, rose, and
wished to dance. He went straight over and took out
Margit, and before she well knew what she was doing
she danced with him.</p>

<p>Soon the weather turned warmer, and there was no
more dancing. That spring Margit took so much care
of a little sick lamb, that her mother thought her quite
foolish. "It's only a lamb, after all," said the mother.
"Yes; but it's sick," answered Margit.</p>

<p>It was a long time since Margit had been to church;
somebody must stay at home, she used to say, and she
would rather let the mother go. One Sunday, however,
later in the summer, the weather seemed so fine that the
hay might very well be left over that day and night, the
mother said, and she thought both of them might go.
Margit had nothing to say against it, and she went to
dress herself. But when they had gone far enough to
hear the church bells, she suddenly burst into tears.
The mother grew deadly pale; yet they went on to
church, heard the sermon and prayers, sang all the
hymns, and let the last sound of the bells die away before
they left. But when they were seated at home again,
the mother took Margit's face between her hands, and
said, "Keep back nothing from me, my child!"</p>

<p>When another winter came Margit did not dance.
But Nils, the tailor, played and drank more than ever,
and always danced with the prettiest girl at every party.
People then said, in fact, he might have had any one of
the first girls in the parish for his wife if he chose; and
some even said that Eli Böen had himself made an offer<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" id="Page_17" title="[Pg 17]"></a>
for his daughter, Birgit, who had quite fallen in love
with him.</p>

<p>But just at that time an infant born at Kampen was
baptized, and received the name, Arne; but Nils, the
tailor, was said to be its father.</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day, Nils went to a large
wedding-party; and there he got drunk. He would not
play, but danced all the time, and seemed as if he could
hardly bear to have any one on the floor save himself.
But when he asked Birgit Böen to dance, she refused.
He gave a short, forced, laugh, turned on his heel and
asked the first girl at hand. She was a little dark girl
who had been sitting looking at him, but now when he
spoke to her, she turned pale and drew back. He looked
down, leaned slightly over her, and whispered, "Won't
you dance with <em>me</em>, Kari?" She did not answer. He
repeated his question, and then she replied, also in a
whisper, "That dance might go further than I wished."
He drew back slowly; but when he reached the middle
of the room, he made a quick turn, and danced the <i>halling</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
alone, while the rest looked on in silence.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he went away into the barn, lay down,
and wept.</p>

<p>Margit stayed at home with little Arne. When she
heard how Nils rushed from dancing-party to dancing-party,
she looked at the child and wept, but then she
looked at him once more and was happy. The first
name she taught him to say was, father; but this she
dared not do when the mother, or the grandmother, as
she was now called, was near; and so it came to pass
that the little one called the grandmother, "Father."<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" id="Page_18" title="[Pg 18]"></a>
Margit took great pains to break him of this, and thus
she caused an early thoughtfulness in him. He was but
a little fellow when he learned that Nils, the tailor, was
his father; and just when he came to the age when
children most love strange, romantic things, he also
learned what sort of man Nils was. But the grandmother
had strictly forbidden the very mention of his
name; her mind was set only upon extending Kampen
and making it their own property, so that Margit and
the boy might be independent. Taking advantage of
the landowner's poverty, she bought the place, paid off
part of the purchase-money every year, and managed
her farm like a man; for she had been a widow fourteen
years. Under her care, Kampen had been extended till
it could now feed four cows, sixteen sheep, and a horse
of which she was joint owner.</p>

<p>Meantime, Nils, the tailor, continued to go about working
in the parish; but he had less to do than formerly,
partly because he was less attentive to his trade, and
partly because he was not so well liked. Then he took
to going out oftener to play the fiddle at parties; this
gave him more opportunities for drinking, and thus came
more fighting and miserable days.</p>

<p>One winter day, when Arne was about six years old,
he was playing on the bed, where he had set up the
coverlet for a boat-sail, while he sat steering with a ladle.
The grandmother sat in the room spinning, busy with
her own thoughts, and every now and then nodding, as
though in affirmation of her own conclusions. Then the
boy knew she was taking no notice of him; and so he
sang, just as he had learned it, a wild, rough song about
Nils, the tailor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>This was all the boy sang; but there were two verses
more which the mother had never taught him. The
grandmother knew these last verses only too well; and
she remembered them all the better because the boy did
not sing them. She said nothing to him, however, but
to the mother, she said, "If you think it well to teach
him the first verses, don't forget to teach him the last
ones, too."</p>

<p>Nils, the tailor, was so broken down by his drinking,
that he was not like the same man; and people began to
say he would soon be utterly ruined.</p>

<p>About this time a wedding was celebrated in the neighborhood,
and two American gentlemen, who were visiting
near, came to witness it, as they wished to see the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" id="Page_20" title="[Pg 20]"></a>
customs of the country. Nils played; and the two
gentlemen each gave a dollar for him, and then asked
for the <i>halling</i>. But no one came forward to dance it;
and several begged Nils himself to come: "After all, he
was still the best dancer," they said. He refused; but
their request became still more urgent, and at last all in
the room joined in it. This was just what he wanted;
and at once he handed his fiddle to another man, took
off his jacket and cap, and stepped smilingly into the
middle of the room. They all came round to look at
him, just as they used to do in his better days, and this
gave him back his old strength. They crowded closely
together, those farthest back standing on tables and
benches. Several of the girls stood higher than all the
rest; and the foremost of them&mdash;a tall girl, with bright
auburn hair, blue eyes, deeply set under a high forehead,
and thin lips, which often smiled and then drew a little
to one side&mdash;was Birgit Böen: Nils caught her eye as
he glanced upwards at the beam. The music struck up;
a deep silence ensued; and he began. He squatted on
the floor, and hopped sidewards in time with the music;
swung from one side to another, crossed, and uncrossed
his legs under him several times; sprang up again, and
stood as though he were going to take a leap; but then
shirked it, and went on hopping sidewards as before.
The fiddle was skilfully played, and the tune became
more and more exciting. Nils gradually threw his head
backwarder, and then suddenly kicked the beam, scattering
the dust from the ceiling down upon the people
below. They laughed and shouted round him, and the
girls stood almost breathless. The sound of the violin
rose high above the noise, stimulating him by still wilder
notes, and he did not resist their influence. He bent
forward; hopped in time with the music; stood up as<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" id="Page_21" title="[Pg 21]"></a>
though he were going to take a leap, but shirked it,
swung from one side to the other as before; and just
when he looked as if he had not the least thought of
leaping, leaped up and kicked the beam again and again.
Next he turned somersaults forwards and backwards,
coming upon his feet firmly, and standing up quite
straight each time. Then he suddenly left off; and the
tune, after running through some wild variations, died
away in one long, deep note on the bass. The crowd
dispersed, and an animated conversation in loud tones
followed the silence. Nils leaned against the wall; and
the American gentlemen, with their interpreter, went
over to him, each giving him five dollars. Once more
all were silent.</p>

<p>The Americans said a few words aside to their interpreter,
who then asked Nils whether he would go with
them as their servant. "Where?" Nils asked, while
the people crowded round as closely as possible. "Out
into the world," was the answer. "When?" Nils asked,
as he looked round him with a bright face; his eyes fell
on Birgit Böen, and he did not take them off again. "In
a week's time when they come back here," answered the
interpreter. "Well, perhaps I may then be ready," said
Nils, weighing his ten dollars, and trembling so violently,
that a man on whose shoulder he was resting one arm,
asked him to sit down.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing," he answered, and he took a few
faltering steps across the floor, then, some firmer ones,
turned round, and asked for a springing-dance.</p>

<p>The girls stood foremost in the circle. He looked
slowly round, and then went straight over to one in a
dark colored skirt: it was Birgit Böen. He stretched
forth his hand, and she gave both hers; but he drew
back with a laugh, took out a girl who stood next, and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" id="Page_22" title="[Pg 22]"></a>
danced off gaily. Birgit's face and neck flushed crimson;
and in a moment a tall, mild-looking man, who was
standing behind her, took her hand and danced away
with her just after Nils. He saw them, and whether
purposely or not, pushed against them so violently that
they both fell heavily to the floor. Loud cries and laughter
were heard all round. Birgit rose, went aside, and
cried bitterly.</p>

<p>Her partner rose more slowly, and went straight over
to Nils, who was still dancing: "You must stop a little,"
he said. Nils did not hear; so the other man laid hold
on his arm. He tore himself away, looked at the man,
and said with a smile, "I don't know you."</p>

<p>"P'r'aps not; but now I'll let you know who I am,"
said the man, giving him a blow just over one eye. Nils
was quite unprepared for this, and fell heavily on the
sharp edge of the fireplace. He tried to rise, but he
could not: his spine was broken.</p>

<p>At Kampen, a change had taken place. Of late the
grandmother had become more infirm, and as she felt
her strength failing, she took greater pains than ever to
save money to pay off the remaining debt upon the farm.
"Then you and the boy," she used to say to Margit,
"will be comfortably off. And mind, if ever you bring
anybody into the place to ruin it for you, I shall turn in
my grave." In harvest-time, she had the great satisfaction
of going up to the late landowner's house with the
last of the money due to him; and happy she felt when,
seated once more in the porch at home, she could at last
say, "Now it's done." But in that same hour she was
seized with her last illness; she went to bed at once,
and rose no more. Margit had her buried in the churchyard,
and a nice headstone was set over her, inscribed
with her name and age, and a verse from one of Kingo's<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" id="Page_23" title="[Pg 23]"></a>
hymns. A fortnight after her burial, her black Sunday
gown was made into a suit of clothes for the boy; and
when he was dressed in them he became as grave as
even the grandmother herself. He went of his own
accord and took up the book with clasps and large print
from which she used to read and sing every Sunday; he
opened it, and there he found her spectacles. These he
had never been allowed to touch while she was living;
now he took them out half fearfully, placed them over
his nose, and looked down through them into the book.
All became hazy. "How strange this is," he thought;
"it was through them grandmother could read God's
word!" He held them high up against the light to see
what was the matter, and&mdash;the spectacles dropped on
the floor, broken in twenty pieces.</p>

<p>He was much frightened, and when at the same moment
the door opened, he felt as if it must be the grandmother
herself who was coming in. But it was the
mother, and behind her came six men, who, with much
stamping and noise, brought in a litter which they placed
in the middle of the room. The door was left open so
long after them, that the room grew quite cold.</p>

<p>On the litter lay a man with a pale face and dark hair.
The mother walked to and fro and wept. "Be careful
how you lay him on the bed," she said imploringly,
helping them herself. But all the while the men were
moving him, something grated beneath their feet. "Ah,
that's only grandmother's spectacles," the boy thought;
but he said nothing.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III.<br />
<span class="italic">SEEING AN OLD LOVE.</span></h2>


<p>It was, as we have said before, just harvest-time. A
week after the day when Nils had been carried into
Margit Kampen's house, the American gentlemen sent
him word to get ready to go with them. He was just
then lying writhing under a violent attack of pain; and,
clenching his teeth, he cried, "Let them go to the devil!"
Margit remained waiting, as if she had not received any
answer; he noticed this, and after a while he repeated,
faintly and slowly, "Let them&mdash;go."</p>

<p>As the winter advanced, he recovered so far as to be
able to get up, though his health was broken for life.
The first day he could get up he took his fiddle and tuned
it; but it excited him so much that he had to go to bed
again. He talked very little, but was gentle and kind,
and soon he began to read with Arne, and to take in
work. Still he never went out; and he did not talk to
those who came to see him. At first Margit used to tell
him the news of the parish, but it made him gloomy,
and so she soon left off.</p>

<p>When spring came he and Margit often sat longer than
usual talking together after supper, when Arne had been
sent to bed. Later in the season the banns of marriage
were published for them, and then they were quietly
married.</p>

<p>He worked on the farm, and managed wisely and
steadily; and Margit said to Arne, "He is industrious,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" id="Page_25" title="[Pg 25]"></a>
as well as pleasant; now you must be obedient and kind,
and do your best for him."</p>

<p>Margit had even in the midst of her trouble remained
tolerably stout. She had rosy cheeks, large eyes, surrounded
by dark circles which made them seem still
larger, full lips, and a round face; and she looked
healthy and strong, although she really had not much
strength. Now, she looked better than ever; and she
always sang at her work, just as she used to do.</p>

<p>Then one Sunday afternoon, the father and son went
out to see how things were getting on in the fields. Arne
ran about, shooting with a bow and arrows, which the
father had himself made for him. Thus, they went on
straight towards the road which led past the church, and
down to the place which was called the broad valley.
When they came there, Nils sat down on a stone and
fell into a reverie, while Arne went on shooting, and
running for his arrows along the road in the direction of
the church. "Only not too far away," Nils said. Just
as Arne was at the height of his play, he stopped, listening,
and called out, "Father, I hear music." Nils, too,
listened; and they heard the sound of violins, sometimes
drowned by loud, wild shouts, while above all rose the
rattling of wheels, and the trampling of horses' hoofs:
it was a bridal train coming home from the church.
"Come here, lad," the father said, in a tone which made
Arne feel he must come quickly. The father had risen
hastily, and now stood hidden behind a large tree. Arne
followed till the father called out, "Not here, but go
yonder!" Then the boy ran behind an elm-copse. The
train of carriages had already turned the corner of the
birch-wood; the horses, white with foam, galloping at a
furious rate, while drunken people shouted and hallooed.
The father and Arne counted the carriages one after<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" id="Page_26" title="[Pg 26]"></a>
another: there were fourteen. In the first, two fiddlers
were sitting; and the wedding tune sounded merrily
through the clear air: a lad stood behind driving. In
the next carriage sat the bride, with her crown and
ornaments glittering in the sunshine. She was tall, and
when she smiled her mouth drew a little to one side;
with her sat a mild-looking man, dressed in blue. Then
came the rest of the carriages, the men sitting on the
women's laps, and little boys behind; drunken men
riding six together in a one-horse carriage; while in the
last sat the purveyor of the feast, with a cask of brandy
in his arms. They drove rapidly past Nils and Arne,
shouting and singing down the hill; while behind them
the breeze bore upwards, through a cloud of dust, the
sound of the violins, the cries, and the rattling of the
wheels, at first loud, then fainter and fainter, till at last
it died away in the distance. Nils remained standing
motionless till he heard a little rustling behind him; then
he turned round: it was Arne stealing forth from his
hiding-place.</p>

<p>"Who was it, father?" he asked; but then he started
back a little, for Nils' face had an evil look. The boy
stood silently, waiting for an answer; but he got none;
and at last, becoming impatient, he ventured to ask,
"Are we going now?" Nils was still standing motionless,
looking dreamily in the direction where the bridal
train had gone; then he collected himself, and walked
homewards. Arne followed, and once more began to
shoot and to run after his arrows. "Don't trample down
the meadow," said Nils abruptly. The boy let the arrow
lie and came back; but soon he forgot the warning, and,
while the father once more stood still, he lay down to
make somersaults. "Don't trample down the meadow,
I say," repeated Nils, seizing his arm and snatching him<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" id="Page_27" title="[Pg 27]"></a>
up by it almost violently enough to sprain it. Then the
boy went on silently behind him.</p>

<p>At the door Margit stood waiting for them. She had
just come from the cow-house, where it seemed she had
been working hard, for her hair was rough, her linen
soiled, and her dress untidy; but she stood in the doorway
smiling. "Red-side has calved," she said; "and
never in all my life did I see such a great calf." Away
rushed Arne.</p>

<p>"I think you might make yourself a little tidy of
a Sunday," said Nils as he went past her into the
room.</p>

<p>"Yes, now the work's done, there'll be time for dressing,"
answered Margit, following him: and she began
to dress, singing meanwhile. Margit now sang very
well, though sometimes her voice was a little hoarse.</p>

<p>"Leave off that screaming," said Nils, throwing himself
upon the bed. Margit left off. Then the boy came
bustling in, all out of breath. "The calf, the calf's got
red marks on each side and a spot on the forehead, just
like his mother."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, boy!" cried Nils, putting down
one of his feet from the bed, and stamping on the floor.
"The deuce is in that bustling boy," he growled out,
drawing up his foot again.</p>

<p>"You can see very well father's out of spirits to-day,"
the mother said to Arne, by way of warning. "Shouldn't
you like some strong coffee with treacle?" she then said,
turning to Nils, trying to drive away his ill-temper.
Coffee with treacle had been a favorite drink with the
grandmother and Margit, and Arne liked it too. But
Nils never liked it, though he used to take it with the
others. "Shouldn't you like some strong coffee with
treacle?" Margit asked again, for he did not answer<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" id="Page_28" title="[Pg 28]"></a>
the first time. Now, he raised himself on his elbows,
and cried in a loud, harsh voice, "Do you think I'll guzzle
that filthy stuff?"</p>

<p>Margit was thunder-struck; and she went out, taking
the boy with her.</p>

<p>They had several things to do out-doors, and they did
not come in till supper-time; then Nils had gone. Arne
was sent out into the field to call him, but could not find
him anywhere. They waited till the supper was nearly
cold; but Nils had not come even when it was finished.
Then Margit grew fidgety, sent Arne to bed, and sat
down, waiting. A little past midnight Nils came home.
"Where have you been, dear?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That's no business of yours," he answered, seating
himself slowly on the bench. He was drunk.</p>

<p>From that time he often went out into the parish; and
he was always drunk when he came back. "I can't bear
stopping at home with you," he once said when he came
in. She gently tried to plead her cause; but he stamped
on the floor, and bade her be silent. Was he drunk,
then it was her fault; was he wicked, that was her fault,
too; had he become a cripple and an unlucky man for
all his life, then, again, she and that cursed boy of hers
were the cause of it. "Why were you always dangling
after me?" he said, blubbering. "What harm had I
done you?"</p>

<p>"God help and bless me!" Margit answered, "was it
I that ran after you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that you did," he cried, raising himself; and,
still blubbering, he continued, "Now, at last, it has turned
out just as you would have it: I drag along here day
after day&mdash;every day looking on my own grave. But
I might have lived in splendor with the first girl in the
parish; I might have travelled as far as the sun; if you<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" id="Page_29" title="[Pg 29]"></a>
and that cursed boy of yours hadn't put yourselves in my
way."</p>

<p>Again she tried to defend herself: "It isn't the boy's
fault, at any rate."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, or I'll strike you!" and he did
strike her.</p>

<p>The next day, when he had slept himself sober, he felt
ashamed, and would especially be kind to the boy. But
he was soon drunk again; and then he beat Margit. At
last he beat her almost every time he was drunk; Arne
then cried and fretted, and so he beat him, too; but often
he was so miserable afterwards that he felt obliged to go
out again and take some more spirits. At this time, too,
he began once more to set his mind on going to dancing-parties.
He played at them just as he used to do before
his illness; and he took Arne with him to carry the
fiddle-case. At these parties the child saw and heard
much which was not good for him; and the mother often
wept because he was taken there: still she dared not say
anything to the father about it. But to the child she
often imploringly said, with many caresses, "Keep close
to God, and don't learn anything wicked." But at the
dancing-parties there was very much to amuse him, while
at home with the mother there was very little; and so he
turned more and more away from her to the father: she
saw it, but was silent. He learned many songs at these
parties, and he used to sing them to the father, who felt
amused, and laughed now and then at them. This flattered
the boy so much that he set himself to learn as
many songs as he could; and soon he found out what it
was that the father liked, and that made him laugh.
When there was nothing of this kind in the songs, the
boy would himself put something in as well as he could;
and thus he early acquired facility in setting words to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" id="Page_30" title="[Pg 30]"></a>
music. But lampoons and disgusting stories about people
who had risen to wealth and influence, were the things
which the father liked best, and which the boy sang.</p>

<p>The mother always wished him to go with her in the
cow-house to tend the cattle in the evening. He used to
find all sorts of excuses to avoid going; but it was of no
use; she was resolved he should go. There she talked
to him about God and good things, and generally ended
by pressing him to her heart, imploring him, with many
tears, not to become a bad man.</p>

<p>She helped him, too, in his reading-lessons. He was
extremely quick in learning; and the father felt proud of
him, and told him&mdash;especially when he was drunk&mdash;that
he had <em>his</em> cleverness.</p>

<p>At dancing-parties, when the father was drunk, he used
often to ask Arne to sing to the people; and then he
would sing song after song, amidst their loud laughter
and applause. This pleased him even more than it
pleased his father; and at last he used to sing songs without
number. Some anxious mothers who heard this,
came to Margit and told her about it, because the subjects
of the songs were not such as they ought to have been.
Then she called the boy to her side, and forbade him, in
the name of God and all that was good, to sing such
songs any more. And now it seemed to him that she
was always opposed to what gave him pleasure; and, for
the first time in his life, he told the father what she had
said; and when he was again drunk she had to suffer for
it severely: till then he had not spoken of it. Then
Arne saw clearly how wrong a thing he had done, and
in the depths of his soul he asked God and her to forgive
him; but he could not ask it in words. She continued
to show him the same kindness as before, and it pierced
his heart.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" id="Page_31" title="[Pg 31]"></a>
Once, however, in spite of all, he again wronged her.
He had a talent for mimicking people, especially in their
speaking and singing; and one evening, while he was
amusing the father in this way, the mother entered, and,
when she was going away, the father took it into his head
to ask him to mimic her. At first he refused; but the
father, who lay on the bed laughing till he shook, insisted
upon his doing it. "She's gone," the boy thought, "and
can't hear me;" and he mimicked her singing, just as it
was when her voice was hoarse and obstructed by tears.
The father laughed till the boy grew quite frightened
and at once left off. Then the mother came in from the
kitchen, looked at Arne long and mournfully, went over
to the shelf, took down a milk-dish and carried it away.</p>

<p>He felt burning hot all over: she had heard it all. He
jumped down from the table where he had been sitting,
went out, threw himself on the ground, and wished to
hide himself for ever in the earth. He could not rest,
and he rose and went farther from the house. Passing
by the barn, he there saw his mother sitting, making a
new fine shirt for him. It was her usual habit to sing a
hymn while sewing: now, however, she was silent.
Then Arne could bear it no longer; he threw himself on
the grass at her feet, looked up in her face, and wept and
sobbed bitterly. Margit let fall her work, and took his
head between her hands.</p>

<p>"Poor Arne!" she said, putting her face down to his.
He did not try to say a word, but wept as he had never
wept before. "I knew you were good at heart," she said,
stroking his head.</p>

<p>"Mother, you mustn't refuse what I am now going to
ask," were the first words he was able to utter.</p>

<p>"You know I never do refuse you," answered she.</p>

<p>He tried to stop his tears, and then, with his face still<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" id="Page_32" title="[Pg 32]"></a>
in her lap, he stammered out, "Do sing a little for me,
mother."</p>

<p>"You know I can't do it," she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Sing something for me, mother," implored the boy;
"or I shall never have courage to look you in the face
again." She went on stroking his hair, but was silent.
"Do sing, mother dear," he implored again; "or I shall
go far away, and never come back any more." Though
he was now almost fifteen years old, he lay there with his
head in his mother's lap, and she began to sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>She sang some more verses. Arne lay still; a blessed
peace came over him, and under its soothing influence he
slept. The last word he heard distinctly was, "Christ;"
it transported him into regions of light; and he fancied
that he listened to a chorus of voices, but his mother's
voice was clearer than all. Sweeter tones he had never
heard, and he prayed to be allowed to sing in like manner;
and then at once he began, gently and softly, and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" id="Page_33" title="[Pg 33]"></a>
still more softly, until his bliss became rapture, and then
suddenly all disappeared. He awoke, looked about him,
listened attentively, but heard nothing save the little rivulet
which flowed past the barn with a low and constant
murmur. The mother was gone; but she had placed the
half-made shirt and his jacket under his head.</p>

<span class="italic">THE UNLAMENTED DEATH.</span></h2>


<p>When now the time of year came for the cattle to
be sent into the wood, Arne wished to go to tend
them. But the father opposed him: indeed, he had never
gone before, though he was now in his fifteenth year.
But he pleaded so well, that his wish was at last complied
with; and so during the spring, summer, and autumn, he
passed the whole day alone in the wood, and only came
home to sleep.</p>

<p>He took his books up there, and read, carved letters in
the bark of the trees, thought, longed, and sang. But
when in the evening he came home and found the father
often drunk and beating the mother, cursing her and the
whole parish, and saying how once he might have gone
far away, then a longing for travelling arose in the lad's
mind. There was no comfort for him at home; and his
books made his thoughts travel; nay, it seemed sometimes
as if the very breeze bore them on its wings far
away.</p>

<p>Then, about midsummer, he met with Christian, the
Captain's eldest son, who one day came to the wood with
the servant boy, to catch the horses, and to ride them
home. He was a few years older than Arne, light-hearted
and jolly, restless in mind, but nevertheless strong
in purpose; he spoke fast and abruptly, and generally
about two things at once; shot birds in their flight; rode
bare-backed horses; went fly-fishing; and altogether<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" id="Page_35" title="[Pg 35]"></a>
seemed to Arne the paragon of perfection. He, too, had
set his mind upon travelling, and he talked to Arne about
foreign countries till they shone like fairy-lands. He
found out Arne's love for reading, and he carried up to
him all the books he had read himself; on Sundays he
taught him geography from maps: and during the whole
of that summer Arne read till he became pale and thin.</p>

<p>Even when the winter came, he was permitted to read
at home; partly because he was going to be confirmed
the next year, and partly because he always knew how
to manage with his father. He also began to go to
school; but while there it seemed to him he never got on
so well as when he shut his eyes and thought over the
things in his books at home: and he no longer had any
companions among the boys of the parish.</p>

<p>The father's bodily infirmity, as well as his passion for
drinking, increased with his years; and he treated his
wife worse and worse. And while Arne sat at home trying
to amuse him, and often, merely to keep peace for the
mother, telling things which he now despised, a hatred
of his father grew up in his heart. But there he kept it
secretly, just as he kept his love for his mother. Even
when he happened to meet Christian, he said nothing to
him about home affairs; but all their talk ran upon their
books and their intended travels. But often when, after
those wide roaming conversations, he was returning home
alone, thinking of what he perhaps would have to see
when he arrived there, he wept and prayed that God
would take care he might soon be allowed to go away.</p>

<p>In the summer he and Christian were confirmed: and
soon afterwards the latter carried out his purpose of travelling.
At last, he prevailed upon his father to let him
be a sailor; and he went far away; first giving Arne his
books, and promising to write often to him.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" id="Page_36" title="[Pg 36]"></a>
Then Arne was left alone.</p>

<p>About this time a wish to make songs awoke again in
his mind; and now he no longer patched old songs, but
made new ones for himself, and said in them whatever
most pained him.</p>

<p>But soon his heart became too heavy to let him make
songs any more. He lay sleepless whole nights, feeling
that he could not bear to stay at home any longer, and
that he must go far away, find out Christian, and&mdash;not
say a word about it to any one. But when he thought of
the mother, and what would become of her, he could
scarcely look her in the face; and his love made him
linger still.</p>

<p>One evening when it was growing late, Arne sat reading:
indeed, when he felt more sad than usual he always
took refuge in his books; little understanding that they
only increased his burden. The father had gone to a
wedding party, but was expected home that evening;
the mother, weary and afraid of him, had gone to bed.
Then Arne was startled by the sound of a heavy fall in
the passage, and of something hard pushing against the
door. It was the father, just coming home.</p>

<p>"Is it you, my clever boy?" he muttered; "come and
help your father to get up." Arne helped him up, and
brought him to the bench; then carried in the violin-case
after him, and shut the door. "Well, look at me, you
clever boy; I don't look very handsome now; Nils, the
tailor's no longer the man he used to be. One thing I&mdash;tell&mdash;you&mdash;you
shall never drink spirits; they're&mdash;the
devil, the world, and the flesh.... 'God resisteth the
proud, but giveth grace to the humble.' ... Oh dear!
oh dear!&mdash;How far gone I am!"</p>

<p>He sat silent for a while, and then sang in a tearful
voice,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" id="Page_37" title="[Pg 37]"></a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Merciful Lord, I come to Thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help, if there can be help for me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though by the mire of sin defiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm still Thine own dear ransomed child."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"'Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come
under my roof; but speak the word only....'" He
threw himself forward, hid his face in his hands, and
sobbed violently. Then, after lying thus a long while,
he said, word for word out of the Scriptures, just as he
had learned it more than twenty years ago, "'But he
answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the house of Israel. Then came she and worshipped
him, saying, Lord, help me. But he answered and said,
It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it
to dogs. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat
of the crumbs which fall from their master's table.'"</p>

<p>Then he was silent, and his weeping became subdued
and calm.</p>

<p>The mother had been long awake, without looking up;
but now when she heard him weeping thus like one who
is saved, she raised herself on her elbows, and gazed
earnestly at him.</p>

<p>But scarcely did Nils perceive her before he called out,
"Are you looking up, you ugly vixen! I suppose you
would like to see what a state you have brought me to.
Well, so I look, just so!" ... He rose; and she hid
herself under the fur coverlet. "Nay, don't hide, I'm
sure to find you," he said, stretching out his right hand
and fumbling with his forefinger on the bed-clothes,
"Tickle, tickle," he said, turning aside the fur coverlet,
and putting his forefinger on her throat.</p>

<p>"Father!" cried Arne.</p>

<p>"How shrivelled and thin you've become already,
there's no depth of flesh here!" She writhed beneath<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" id="Page_38" title="[Pg 38]"></a>
his touch, and seized his hand with both hers, but could
not free herself.</p>

<p>"Father!" repeated Arne.</p>

<p>"Well at last you're roused. How she wriggles, the
ugly thing! Can't you scream to make believe I am
beating you? Tickle, tickle! I only want to take away
your breath."</p>

<p>"Father!" Arne said once more, running to the corner
of the room, and snatching up an axe which stood
there.</p>

<p>"Is it only out of perverseness, you don't scream? you
had better beware; for I've taken such a strange fancy
into my head. Tickle, tickle! Now I think I shall
soon get rid of that screaming of yours."</p>

<p>"Father!" Arne shouted, rushing towards him with
the axe uplifted.</p>

<p>But before Arne could reach him, he started up with
a piercing cry, laid his hand upon his heart, and fell
heavily down. "Jesus Christ!" he muttered, and then
lay quite still.</p>

<p>Arne stood as if rooted in the ground, and gradually
lowered the axe. He grew dizzy and bewildered, and
scarcely knew where he was. Then the mother began
to move to and fro in the bed, and to breathe heavily, as
if oppressed by some great weight lying upon her. Arne
saw that she needed help; but yet he felt unable to render
it. At last she raised herself a little, and saw the
father lying stretched on the floor, and Arne standing
beside him with the axe.</p>

<p>"Merciful Lord, what have you done?" she cried,
springing out of the bed, putting on her skirt and coming
nearer.</p>

<p>"He fell down himself," said Arne, at last regaining
power to speak.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" id="Page_39" title="[Pg 39]"></a>
"Arne, Arne, I don't believe you," said the mother in
a stern reproachful voice: "now Jesus help you!" And
she threw herself upon the dead man with loud wailing.</p>

<p>But the boy awoke from his stupor, dropped the axe
and fell down on his knees: "As true as I hope for
mercy from God, I've not done it. I almost thought of
doing it; I was so bewildered; but then he fell down
himself; and here I've been standing ever since."</p>

<p>The mother looked at him, and believed him. "Then
our Lord has been here Himself," she said quietly, sitting
down on the floor and gazing before her.</p>

<p>Nils lay quite stiff, with open eyes and mouth, and
hands drawn near together, as though he had at the last
moment tried to fold them, but had been unable to do so.
The first thing the mother now did was to fold them.
"Let us look closer at him," she said then, going over to
the fireplace, where the fire was almost out. Arne followed
her, for he felt afraid of standing alone. She gave
him a lighted fir-splinter to hold; then she once more
went over to the dead body and stood by one side of it,
while the son stood at the other, letting the light fall
upon it.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's quite gone," she said; and then, after a
little while, she continued, "and gone in an evil hour,
I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Arne's hands trembled so much that the burning ashes
of the splinter fell upon the father's clothes and set them
on fire; but the boy did not perceive it, neither did the
mother at first, for she was weeping. But soon she
became aware of it through the bad smell, and she cried
out in fear. When now the boy looked, it seemed to
him as though the father himself was burning, and he
dropped the splinter upon him, sinking down in a swoon.
Up and down, and round and round, the room moved<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" id="Page_40" title="[Pg 40]"></a>
with him; the table moved, the bed moved; the axe
hewed; the father rose and came to him; and then all
of them came rolling upon him. Then he felt as if a
soft cooling breeze passed over his face; and he cried out
and awoke. The first thing he did was to look at the
father, to assure himself that he still lay quietly.</p>

<p>And a feeling of inexpressible happiness came over the
boy's mind when he saw that the father was dead&mdash;really
dead; and he rose as though he were entering upon a
new life.</p>

<p>The mother had extinguished the burning clothes, and
began to lay out the body. She made the bed, and then
said to Arne, "Take hold of your father, you're so strong,
and help me to lay him nicely." They laid him on the
bed, and Margit shut his eyes and mouth, stretched his
limbs, and folded his hands once more.</p>

<p>Then they both stood looking at him. It was only a
little past midnight, and they had to stay there with him
till morning. Arne made a good fire, and the mother
sat down by it. While sitting there, she looked back
upon the many miserable days she had passed with Nils,
and she thanked God for taking him away. "But still
I had some happy days with him, too," she said after a
while.</p>

<p>Arne took a seat opposite her; and, turning to him,
she went on, "And to think that he should have such an
end as this! even if he has not lived as he ought, truly
he has suffered for it." She wept, looked over to the
dead man, and continued, "But now God grant I may be
repaid for all I have gone through with him. Arne,
you must remember it was for your sake I suffered it all."
The boy began to weep too. "Therefore, you must
never leave me," she sobbed; "you are now my only
comfort."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" id="Page_41" title="[Pg 41]"></a>
"I never will leave you; that I promise before God,"
the boy said, as earnestly as if he had thought of saying
it for years. He felt a longing to go over to her; yet he
could not.</p>

<p>She grew calmer, and, looking kindly over at the dead
man, she said, "After all, there was a great deal of good
in him; but the world dealt hardly by him.... But
now he's gone to our Lord, and He'll be kinder to him,
I'm sure." Then, as if she had been following out this
thought within herself, she added, "We must pray for
him. If I could, I would sing over him; but you, Arne,
have such a fine voice, you must go and sing to your
father."</p>

<p>Arne fetched the hymn-book and lighted a fir-splinter;
and, holding it in one hand and the book in the other,
he went to the head of the bed and sang in a clear voice
Kingo's 127th hymn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Regard us again in mercy, O God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn Thou aside Thy terrible rod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That now in Thy wrath laid on us we see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To chasten us sore for sin against Thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<span class="italic">"HE HAD IN HIS MIND A SONG."</span></h2>


<p>Arne was now in his twentieth year. Yet he continued
tending the cattle upon the mountains in
the summer, while in the winter he remained at home
studying.</p>

<p>About this time the clergyman sent a message, asking
him to become the parish schoolmaster, and saying his
gifts and knowledge might thus be made useful to his
neighbors. Arne sent no answer; but the next day,
while he was driving his flock, he made the following
verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O, my pet lamb, lift your head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though a stony path you tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over all the lonely fells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only follow still your bells.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, my pet lamb, walk with care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest you spoil your wool, beware:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother now must soon be sewing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New lamb-skins, for summer's going.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O, my pet lamb, try to grow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fat and fine where'er you go:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know you not, my little sweeting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spring-lamb is dainty eating?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One day he happened to overhear a conversation between
his mother and the late owner of the place: they
were at odds about the horse of which they were joint-owners.
"I must wait and hear what Arne says," interposed<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" id="Page_43" title="[Pg 43]"></a>
the mother. "That sluggard!" the man exclaimed;
"he would like the horse to ramble about in the wood,
just as he does himself." Then the mother became silent,
though before she had been pleading her cause well.</p>

<p>Arne flushed crimson. That his mother had to bear
people's jeers on his account, never before occurred to
him, and, "Perhaps she had borne many," he thought.
"But why had she not told him of it?" he thought
again.</p>

<p>He turned the matter over, and then it came into his
mind that the mother scarcely ever talked to him at all.
But, then, he scarcely ever talked to her either. But,
after all, whom did he talk much to?</p>

<p>Often on Sundays, when he was sitting quietly at home,
he would have liked to read the sermon to his mother,
whose eyes were weak, for she had wept too much in her
time. Still, he did not read it. Often, too, on weekdays,
when she was sitting down, and he thought the time
might hang heavy, he would have liked to offer to read
some of his own books to her: still, he did not.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind," thought he: "I'll soon leave off
tending the cattle on the mountains; and then I'll be
more with mother." He let this resolve ripen within him
for several days: meanwhile he drove his cattle far about
in the wood, and made the following verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The vale is full of trouble, but here sweet Peace may reign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within this quiet forest no bailiffs may distrain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None fight, like all in the vale, in the <span class="sic">Blessèd</span> Church's name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still if a church were here, perhaps 'twould be just the same.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here all are at peace&mdash;true, the hawk is rather unkind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear he is looking now the plumpest sparrow to find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fear yon eagle is coming to rob the kid of his breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still if he lived very long he might be tired to death.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" id="Page_44" title="[Pg 44]"></a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The woodman fells one tree, and another rots away:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The red fox killed the lambkin at sunset yesterday;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the wolf killed the fox; and the wolf, too, had to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Arne shot him down to-day before the dew was dry.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back I'll go to the valley: the forest is just as bad&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must take heed, however, or thinking will drive me mad&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a boy in my dreams, though where I cannot tell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I know he had killed his father, and I think it was in hell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then he went home and told the mother she might send
for a lad to tend the cattle on the mountains; and that he
would himself manage the farm: and so it was arranged.
But the mother was constantly hovering about him, warning
him not to work too hard. Then, too, she used to
get him such nice meals that he often felt quite ashamed
to take them; yet he said nothing.</p>

<p>He had in his mind a song having for its burden,
"Over the mountains high;" but he never could complete
it, principally because he always tried to bring
the burden in every alternate line; so afterwards he gave
this up.</p>

<p>But several of his songs became known, and were
much liked; and many people, especially those who had
known him from his childhood, were fond of talking to
him. But he was shy to all whom he did not know, and
he thought ill of them, mainly because he fancied they
thought ill of him.</p>

<p>In the next field to his own worked a middle-aged man
named Opplands-Knut, who used sometimes to sing, but
always the same song. After Arne had heard him singing
it for several months, he thought he would ask him
whether he did not know any others. "No," Knut answered.
Then after a few more days, when he was
again singing his song, Arne asked him, "How came
you to learn that one song?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" id="Page_45" title="[Pg 45]"></a>
"Ah! it happened thus&mdash;&mdash;" and then he said no
more.</p>

<p>Arne went away from him straight indoors; and there
he found his mother weeping; a thing he had not seen
her do ever since the father's death. He turned back
again, just as though he did not notice it; but he felt the
mother was looking sorrowfully after him, and he was
obliged to stop.</p>

<p>"What are you crying for, mother?" he asked. She
did not answer, and all was silent in the room. Then
his words came back to him again, and he felt they had
not been spoken so kindly as they ought; and once more,
in a gentler tone, he asked, "What are you crying for,
mother?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I hardly know," she said, weeping still more.
He stood silent a while; but at last mustered courage to
say, "Still, there must be some reason why you are
crying."</p>

<p>Again there was silence; but although the mother had
not said one word of blame, he felt he was very guilty
towards her. "Well it just came over me," she said after
a while; and in a few moments she added, "but
really, I'm very happy;" and then she began weeping
again.</p>

<p>Arne hurried out, away to the ravine; and while he
sat there looking into it, he, too, began weeping. "If I
only knew what I am crying for," he said.</p>

<p>Then he heard Opplands-Knut singing in the fields
above him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ingerid Sletten of Willow-pool<br /></span>

<span class="i2">But, ah! her looking was all in vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cap had mouldered away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Arne listened, and the words seemed to him like music
playing far away over the mountains. He went up to
Knut and asked him, "Have you a mother?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have you a father?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no; no father."</p>

<p>"Is it long since they died?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; it's long since."</p>

<p>"You haven't many, I dare say, who love you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no; not many."</p>

<p>"Have you any here at all?"</p>

<p>"No; not here."</p>

<p>"But away in your own place?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" id="Page_47" title="[Pg 47]"></a>
"Ah, no; not there either."</p>

<p>"Haven't you any at all then who love you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no; I haven't any."</p>

<p>But Arne walked away with his heart so full of love to
his mother that it seemed as if it would burst; and all
around him grew bright. He felt he must go in again,
if only for the sake of looking at her. As he walked on
the thought struck him, "What if I were to lose her?"
He stopped suddenly. "Almighty God, what would
then become of me?"</p>

<p>Then he felt as if some dreadful accident was happening
at home, and he hurried onwards, cold drops bursting
from his brow, and his feet hardly touching the ground.
He threw open the outer door, and came at once into an
atmosphere of peace. Then he gently opened the door
of the inner room. The mother had gone to bed, and
lay sleeping as calmly as a child, with the moonbeams
shining full on her face.</p>


<hr class="chapbreak" />

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI.<br />
<span class="italic">STRANGE TALES.</span></h2>


<p>A few days after, the mother and son agreed on
going together to the wedding of some relations in
one of the neighboring places. The mother had not
been to a party ever since she was a girl; and both she
and Arne knew but very little of the people living around,
save their names.</p>

<p>Arne felt uncomfortable at this party, however, for he
fancied everybody was staring at him: and once, as he
was passing through the passage, he believed he heard
something said about him, the mere thought of which
made every drop of blood rush into his face.</p>

<p>He kept going about looking after the man who had
said it, and at last he took a seat next him.</p>

<p>When they were at dinner, the man said, "Well, now,
I shall tell you a story which proves nothing can be
buried so deeply that it won't one day be brought to
light;" and Arne fancied he looked at him all the time
he was saying this. He was an ugly-looking man, with
scanty red hair, hanging about a wide, round forehead,
small, deep-set eyes, a little snub-nose, and a large mouth,
with pale out-turned lips, which showed both his gums
when he laughed. His hands were resting on the table;
they were large and coarse, but the wrists were slender.
He had a fierce look; and he spoke quickly, but with
difficulty. The people called him "Bragger;" and Arne
knew that in bygone days, Nils, the tailor, had treated
him badly.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the man, "there is indeed, a great<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" id="Page_49" title="[Pg 49]"></a>
deal of sin in the world; and it sits nearer to us than we
think.... But never mind; I'll tell you now of a foul
deed. Those of you who are old will remember Alf&mdash;Alf,
the pedlar. 'I'll call again,' Alf used to say: and
he has left that saying behind him. When he had struck
a bargain&mdash;and what a fellow for trade he was!&mdash;he
would take up his bundle, and say, 'I'll call again.' A
devil of a fellow, proud fellow, brave fellow, was he, Alf,
the pedlar!</p>

<p>"Well he and Big Lazy-bones, Big Lazy-bones&mdash;well,
you know Big Lazy-bones?&mdash;big he was, and lazy he
was, too. He took a fancy to a coal-black horse that Alf,
the pedlar, used to drive, and had trained to hop like a
summer frog. And almost before Big Lazy-bones knew
what he was about, he paid fifty dollars for this horse!
Then Big Lazy-bones, tall as he was, got into a carriage,
meaning to drive about like a king with his fifty-dollar-horse;
but, though he whipped and swore like a devil,
the horse kept running against all the doors and windows;
for it was stone-blind!</p>

<p>"Afterwards, whenever Alf and Big Lazy-bones came
across each other, they used to quarrel and fight about
this horse like two dogs. Big Lazy-bones said he would
have his money back; but he could not get a farthing of
it: and Alf drubbed him till the bristles flew. 'I'll call
again,' said Alf. A devil of a fellow, proud fellow, brave
fellow that Alf&mdash;Alf, the pedlar!</p>

<p>"Well, after that some years passed away without his
being seen again.</p>

<p>"Then, in about ten years or so, a call for him was
published on the church-hill,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for a great fortune had<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" id="Page_50" title="[Pg 50]"></a>
been left him. Big Lazy-bones stood listening. 'Ah,'
said he, 'I well knew it must be money, and not men,
that called out for Alf, the pedlar.'</p>

<p>"Now, there was a good deal of talk one way and
another about Alf; and at last it seemed to be pretty
clearly made out that he had been seen for the last time
on <em>this</em> side of the ledge, and not on the other. Well,
you remember the road over the ledge&mdash;the old road?</p>

<p>"Of late, Big Lazy-bones had got quite a great man,
and he owned both houses and land. Then, too, he had
taken to being religious; and that, everybody knew, he
didn't take to for nothing&mdash;nobody does. People began
to whisper about these things.</p>

<p>"Just at this time the road over the ledge had to be
altered. Folks in bygone days had a great fancy for
going straight onwards; and so the old road ran straight
over the ledge; but now-a-days we like to have things
smooth and easy; and so the new road was made to run
down along the river. While they were making it, there
was digging and mining enough to bring down the whole
mountain about their ears; and the magistrates and all
the officers who have to do with that sort of thing were
there. One day while the men were digging deep in the
stony ground, one of them took up something which he
thought was a stone; but it turned out to be the bones of
a man's hand instead; and a wonderfully strong hand it
seemed to be, for the man who got it fell flat down
directly. That man was Big Lazy-bones. The magistrate
was just strolling about round there, and they
fetched him to the place; and then all the bones belonging
to a whole man were dug out. The Doctor, too, was
fetched; and he put them all together so cleverly that
nothing was wanting but the flesh. And then it struck
some of the people that the skeleton was just about the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" id="Page_51" title="[Pg 51]"></a>
same size and make as Alf, the pedlar. 'I'll call again,'
Alf used to say.</p>

<p>"And then it struck somebody else, that it was a very
queer thing a dead hand should have made a great fellow
like Big Lazy-bones fall flat down like that: and the
magistrate accused him straight of having had more to
do with that dead hand than he ought&mdash;of course, when
nobody else was by. But then Big Lazy-bones foreswore
it with such fearful oaths that the magistrate turned quite
giddy. 'Well,' said the magistrate, 'if you didn't do it,
I dare say you're a fellow, now, who would not mind
sleeping with the skeleton to-night?'&mdash;'No; I shouldn't
mind a bit,&mdash;not I,' said Big Lazy-bones. So the Doctor
tied the joints of the skeleton together, and laid it in
one of the beds in the barracks; and put another bed
close by it for Big Lazy-bones. The magistrate wrapped
himself in his cloak, and lay down close to the door outside.
When night came on, and Big Lazy-bones had to
go in to his bedfellow, the door shut behind him as
though of itself, and he stood in the dark. But then Big
Lazy-bones set off singing psalms, for he had a mighty
voice. 'Why are you singing psalms?' the magistrate
asked from outside the wall. 'May be the bells were
never tolled for him,' answered Big Lazy-bones. Then
he began praying out loud, as earnestly as ever he
could. 'Why are you praying?' asked the magistrate
from outside the wall. 'No doubt, he has been a
great sinner,' answered Big Lazy-bones. Then a time
after, all got so still that the magistrate might have gone
to sleep. But then came a shrieking that made the very
barracks shake: 'I'll call again!'&mdash;Then came a hellish
noise and crash: 'Out with that fifty dollars of mine!'
roared Big Lazy-bones: and the shrieking and crashing
came again. Then the magistrate burst open the door;<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" id="Page_52" title="[Pg 52]"></a>
the people rushed in with poles and firebrands; and
there lay Big Lazy-bones on the floor, with the skeleton
on the top of him."</p>

<p>There was a deep silence all round the table. At last
a man who was lighting his clay-pipe said, "Didn't he
go mad from that very time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did."</p>

<p>Arne fancied everybody was looking at him, and he
dared not raise his eyes. "I say, as I said before," continued
the man who had told the tale, "nothing can be
buried so deeply that it won't one day be brought to
light."</p>

<p>"Well, now I'll tell you about a son who beat his own
father," said a fair stout man with a round face. Arne
no longer knew where he was sitting.</p>

<p>"This son was a great fellow, almost a giant, belonging
to a tall family in Hardanger; and he was always at
odds with somebody or other. He and his father were
always quarrelling about the yearly allowance; and so
he had no peace either at home or out.</p>

<p>"This made him grow more and more wicked;
and the father persecuted him. 'I won't be put down
by anybody,' the son said. 'Yes, you'll be put down by
me so long as I live,' the father answered. 'If you don't
hold your tongue,' said the son, rising, 'I'll strike you.'&mdash;'Well,
do if you dare; and never in this world will
you have luck again,' answered the father, rising also.&mdash;'Do
you mean to say that?' said the son; and he rushed
upon him and knocked him down. But the father didn't
try to help himself: he folded his arms and let the son do
just as he liked with him. Then he knocked him about,
rolled him over and over, and dragged him towards the
door by his white hair. 'I'll have peace in my own
house, at any rate,' said he. But when they had come<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" id="Page_53" title="[Pg 53]"></a>
to the door, the father raised himself a little and cried
out, 'Not beyond the door, for so far I dragged my own
father.' The son didn't heed it, but dragged the old
man's head over the threshold. 'Not beyond the door, I
say!' And the old man rose, knocked down the son and
beat him as one would beat a child."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's a sad story," several said. Then Arne
fancied he heard some one saying, "It's a wicked thing
to strike one's father;" and he rose, turning deadly pale.</p>

<p>"Now I'll tell <em>you</em> something," he said; but he hardly
knew what he was going to say: words seemed flying
around him like large snowflakes. "I'll catch them at
random," he said and began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A troll once met a lad walking along the road weeping.
'Whom are you most afraid of?' asked the troll,
'yourself or others?' Now, the boy was weeping because
he had dreamed last night he had killed his wicked
father; and so he answered, 'I'm most afraid of myself.'&mdash;'Then
fear yourself no longer, and never weep again;
for henceforward you shall only have strife with others.'
And the troll went his way. But the first whom the lad
met jeered at him; and so the lad jeered at him again.
The second he met beat him; and so he beat him again.
The third he met tried to kill him; and so the lad killed
him. Then all the people spoke ill of the lad; and so
he spoke ill again of all the people. They shut the doors
against him, and kept all their things away from him; so
he stole what he wanted; and he even took his night's
rest by stealth. As now they wouldn't let him come to
do anything good, he only did what was bad; and all
that was bad in other people, they let him suffer for.
And the people in the place wept because of the mischief
done by the lad; but he did not weep himself, for
he could not. Then all the people met together and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" id="Page_54" title="[Pg 54]"></a>
said, 'Let's go and drown him, for with him we drown
all the evil that is in the place.' So they drowned him
forthwith; but afterwards they thought the well where he
was drowned gave forth a mighty odor.</p>

<p>"The lad himself didn't at all know he had done anything
wrong; and so after his death he came drifting in
to our Lord. There, sitting on a bench, he saw his
father, whom he had not killed, after all; and opposite
the father, on another bench, sat the one whom he had
jeered at, the one he had beaten, the one he had killed,
and all those whom he had stolen from, and those whom
he had otherwise wronged.</p>

<p>"'Whom are you afraid of,' our Lord asked, 'of your
father, or of those on the long bench?' The lad pointed
to the long bench.</p>

<p>"'Sit down then by your father,' said our Lord; and
the lad went to sit down. But then the father fell down
from the bench with a large axe-cut in his neck. In his
seat, came one in the likeness of the lad himself, but with
a thin and ghastly pale face; another with a drunkard's
face, matted hair, and drooping limbs; and one more
with an insane face, torn clothes, and frightful laughter.</p>

<p>"'So it might have happened to you,' said our Lord.</p>

<p>"'Do you think so?' said the boy, catching hold of the
Lord's coat.</p>

<p>"Then both the benches fell down from heaven; but the
boy remained standing near the Lord rejoicing.</p>

<p>"'Remember this when you awake,' said our Lord;
and the boy awoke.</p>

<p>"The boy who dreamed so is I; those who tempted
him by thinking him bad are you. I am no longer afraid
of myself, but I am afraid of you. Do not force me to
evil; for it is uncertain if I get hold of the Lord's coat."</p>

<p>He ran out: the men looked at each other.</p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII.<br />
<span class="italic">THE SOLILOQUY IN THE BARN.</span></h2>


<p>On the evening of the day after this, Arne was lying
in a barn belonging to the same house. For the
first time in his life he had become drunk, and he had
been lying there for the last twenty-four hours. Now he
sat up, resting upon his elbows, and talked with himself:</p>

<p>"... Everything I look at turns to cowardice. It
was cowardice that hindered me from running away
while a boy; cowardice that made me listen to father
more than to mother; cowardice also made me sing the
wicked songs to him. I began tending the cattle through
cowardice,&mdash;to read&mdash;well, that, too, was through cowardice:
I wished to get away from myself. When,
though a grown up lad, yet I didn't help mother against
father&mdash;cowardice; that I didn't that night&mdash;ugh!&mdash;cowardice!
I might perhaps have waited till she was
killed! ... I couldn't bear to stay at home afterwards&mdash;cowardice;
still I didn't go away&mdash;cowardice; I did
nothing, I tended cattle ... cowardice. 'Tis true I
promised mother to stay at home; still I should have
been cowardly enough to break my promise if I hadn't
been afraid of mixing among people. For I'm afraid of
people, mainly because I think they see how bad I am;
and because I'm afraid of them, I speak ill of them&mdash;a
curse upon my cowardice! I make songs through cowardice.
I'm afraid of thinking bravely about my own
affairs, and so I turn aside and think about other people's;
and making verses is just that.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" id="Page_56" title="[Pg 56]"></a>
"I've cause enough to weep till the hills turned to
lakes, but instead of that I say to myself, 'Hush, hush,'
and begin rocking. And even my songs are cowardly;
for if they were bold they would be better. I'm afraid
of strong thoughts; afraid of anything that's strong;
and if ever I rise into it, it's in a passion, and passion is
cowardice. I'm more clever and know more than I
seem; I'm better than my words, but my cowardice
makes me afraid of showing myself in my true colors.
Shame upon me! I drank that spirits through cowardice;
I wanted to deaden my pain&mdash;shame upon me! I
felt miserable all the while I was drinking it, yet I drank;
drank my father's heart's-blood, and still I drank! In
fact there's no end to my cowardice; and the most cowardly
thing is, that I can sit and tell myself all this!</p>

<p>"... Kill myself? Oh, no! I am a vast deal too
cowardly for that. Then, too, I believe a little in God ... yes,
I believe in God. I would fain go to Him;
but cowardice keeps me from going: it would be such a
great change that a coward shrinks from it. But if I
were to put forth what power I have? Almighty God,
if I tried? Thou wouldst cure me in such a way as my
milky spirit can bear; wouldst lead me gently; for I
have no bones in me, nor even gristle&mdash;nothing but jelly.
If I tried ... with good, gentle books,&mdash;I'm afraid of
the strong ones&mdash;; with pleasant tales, stories, all that is
mild, and then a sermon every Sunday, and a prayer
every evening. If I tried to clear a field within me for
religion; and worked in good earnest, for one cannot sow
in laziness. If I tried; dear mild God of my childhood,
if I tried!"</p>

<p>But then the barn-door was opened, and the mother
came rushing across the floor. Her face was deadly
pale, though the perspiration dropped from it like great<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" id="Page_57" title="[Pg 57]"></a>
tears. For the last twenty-four hours she had been rushing
hither and thither, seeking her son, calling his name,
and scarcely pausing even to listen, until now when he
answered from the barn. Then she gave a loud cry,
jumped upon the hay-mow more lightly than a boy, and
threw herself upon Arne's breast....</p>

<p>...&nbsp;"Arne, Arne are you here? At last I've found
you; I've been looking for you ever since yesterday; I've
been looking for you all night long! Poor, poor Arne!
I saw they worried you, and I wanted to come to speak
to you and comfort you, but really I'm always afraid!"
... "Arne, I saw you drinking spirits! Almighty God,
may I never see it again! Arne, I saw you drinking
spirits." It was some minutes before she was able to
speak again. "Christ have mercy upon you, my boy, I
saw you drinking spirits! ... You were gone all at
once, drunk and crushed by grief as you were! I ran
all over the place; I went far into the fields; but I
couldn't find you: I looked in every copse; I questioned
everybody; I came here, too; but you didn't answer....
Arne, Arne, I went along the river; but it seemed
nowhere to be deep enough...." She pressed herself
closer to him.</p>

<p>"Then it came into my mind all at once that you might
have gone home; and I'm sure I was only a quarter of
an hour going there. I opened the outer-door and looked
in every room; and then, for the first time, I remembered
that the house had been locked up, and I myself had the
key; and that you could not have come in, after all.
Arne, last night I looked all along both sides of the road:
I dared not go to the edge of the ravine.... I don't
know how it was I came here again; nobody told me;
it must have been the Lord himself who put it into my
mind that you might be here!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" id="Page_58" title="[Pg 58]"></a>
She paused and lay for a while with her head upon his
breast.</p>

<p>He tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>"Arne, you'll never drink spirits again, I'm sure?"</p>

<p>"No; you may be sure I never will."</p>

<p>"I believe they were very hard upon you? they were,
weren't they?"</p>

<p>"No; it was I who was <em>cowardly</em>," he answered, laying
a great stress upon the word.</p>

<p>"I can't understand how they could behave badly
to you. But, tell me, what did they do? you never
will tell me anything;" and once more she began weeping.</p>

<p>"But you never tell me anything, either," he said in a
low gentle voice.</p>

<p>"Yet you're the most in fault, Arne: I've been so long
used to be silent through your father; you ought to have
led me on a little.&mdash;Good Lord! we've only each other;
and we've suffered so much together."</p>

<p>"Well, we must try to manage better," Arne whispered.</p>

<p>...&nbsp;"Next Sunday I'll read the sermon to you."</p>

<p>"God bless you for it."&nbsp;...</p>

<p>"Arne!"</p>

<p>"Well!"</p>

<p>"There's something I must tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, mother, tell me it."</p>

<p>"I've greatly sinned against you; I've done something
very wrong."</p>

<p>"You, mother?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have; but I couldn't help doing it. Arne,
you must forgive me."</p>

<p>"But I'm sure you've never done anything wrong to
me."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" id="Page_59" title="[Pg 59]"></a>
"Indeed, I have: and my very love to you made me
do it. But you must forgive me; will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will."</p>

<p>"And then another time I'll tell you all about it ...
but you must forgive me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, yes."</p>

<p>"And don't you see the reason why I couldn't talk
much to you was, that I had this on my mind? I've
sinned against you."</p>

<p>"Pray don't talk so, mother!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad I've said what I have."</p>

<p>"And, mother, we'll talk more together, we two."</p>

<p>"Yes, that we will; and then you'll read the sermon
to me?"</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"Poor Arne; God bless you!"</p>

<p>"I think we both had better go home now."</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll both go home."</p>

<p>"You're looking all round, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes; your father once lay weeping in this barn."</p>

<p>"Father?" asked Arne, growing deadly pale.</p>

<p>"Poor Nils! It was the day you were christened."</p>

<p>"You're looking all round, Arne?"</p>

<p>Arne when a child had not cared much for fairy-tales;
but now he began to love them, and they led him to the
sagas and old ballads. He also read sermons and other
religious books; and he was gentle and kind to all
around him. But in his mind arose a strange deep longing:
he made no more songs; but walked often alone,
not knowing what was within him.</p>

<p>Many of the places around, which formerly he had not
even noticed, now appeared to him wondrously beautiful.
At the time he and his schoolfellows had to go to the
Clergyman to be prepared for confirmation, they used to
play near a lake lying just below the parsonage, and
called the Swart-water because it lay deep and dark
between the mountains. He now often thought of this
place; and one evening he went thither.</p>

<p>He sat down behind a grove close to the parsonage,
which was built on a steep hill-side, rising high above
till it became a mountain. High mountains rose likewise
on the opposite shore, so that broad deep shadows
fell upon both sides of the lake, but in the middle ran a
stripe of bright silvery water. It was a calm evening
near sunset, and not a sound was heard save the tinkling
of the cattle-bells from the opposite shore. Arne at first<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" id="Page_62" title="[Pg 62]"></a>
did not look straight before him, but downwards along
the lake, where the sun was sprinkling burning red ere
it sank to rest. There, at the end, the mountains gave
way, and between them lay a long low valley, against
which the lake beat; but they seemed to run gradually
towards each other, and to hold the valley in a great
swing. Houses lay thickly scattered all along, the smoke
rose and curled away, the fields lay green and reeking,
and boats laden with hay were anchored by the shore.
Arne saw many people going to and fro, but he heard no
noise. Thence his eye went along the shore towards
God's dark wood upon the mountain-sides. Through it,
man had made his way, and its course was indicated by
a winding stripe of dust. This, Arne's eye followed to
opposite where he was sitting: there, the wood ended,
the mountains opened, and houses lay scattered all over
the valley. They were nearer and looked larger than
those in the other valley; and they were red-painted,
and their large windows glowed in the sunbeams. The
fields and meadows stood in strong light, and the smallest
child playing in them was clearly seen; glittering white
sands lay dry upon the shore, and some dogs and puppies
were running there. But suddenly all became sunless
and gloomy: the houses looked dark red, the meadows
dull green, the sand greyish white, and the children little
clumps: a cloud of mist had risen over the mountains,
taking away the sunlight. Arne looked down into the
water, and there he found all once more: the fields lay
rocking, the wood silently drew near, the houses stood
looking down, the doors were open, and children went
out and in. Fairy-tales and childish things came rushing
into his mind, as little fishes come to a bait, swim
away, come once more and play round, and again swim
away.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" id="Page_63" title="[Pg 63]"></a>
"Let's sit down here till your mother comes; I suppose
the Clergyman's lady will have finished sometime or
other." Arne was startled: some one had been sitting
a little way behind him.</p>

<p>"If I might but stay this one night more," said an imploring
voice, half smothered by tears: it seemed to be
that of a girl not quite grown up.</p>

<p>"Now don't cry any more; it's wrong to cry because
you're going home to your mother," was slowly said by
a gentle voice, which was evidently that of a man.</p>

<p>"It's not that, I am crying for."</p>

<p>"Why, then, are you crying?"</p>

<p>"Because I shall not live any longer with Mathilde."</p>

<p>This was the name of the Clergyman's only daughter;
and Arne remembered that a peasant-girl had been
brought up with her.</p>

<p>"Still, that couldn't go on for ever."</p>

<p>"Well, but only one day more father, dear!" and the
girl began sobbing.</p>

<p>"No, it's better we take you home now; perhaps, indeed,
it's already too late."</p>

<p>"Too late! Why too late? did ever anybody hear
such a thing?"</p>

<p>"You were born a peasant, and a peasant you shall be;
we can't afford to keep a lady."</p>

<p>"But I might remain a peasant all the same if I stayed
there."</p>

<p>"Of that you can't judge."</p>

<p>"I've always worn my peasant's dress."</p>

<p>"Clothes have nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>"I've spun, and woven, and done cooking."</p>

<p>"Neither is <em>that</em> the thing."</p>

<p>"I can speak just as you and mother speak."</p>

<p>"It's not that either."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" id="Page_64" title="[Pg 64]"></a>
"Well, then, I really don't know what it is," the girl
said, laughing.</p>

<p>"Time will show; but I'm afraid you've already got
too many thoughts."</p>

<p>"Thoughts, thoughts! so you always say; I have no
thoughts;" and she wept.</p>

<p>"Ah, you're a wind-mill, that you are."</p>

<p>"The Clergyman never said that."</p>

<p>"No; but now <em>I</em> say it."</p>

<p>"Wind-mill? who ever heard such a thing? I won't
be a wind-mill."</p>

<p>"What <em>will</em> you be then?"</p>

<p>"What will I be? who ever heard of such a thing?
nothing, I will be."</p>

<p>"Well, be nothing, then."</p>

<p>Now the girl laughed; but after a while she said
gravely, "It's wrong of you to say I'm nothing."</p>

<p>"Dear me, when you said so yourself!"</p>

<p>"Nay; I won't be nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, then, be everything."</p>

<p>Again she laughed; but after a while she said in a sad
tone, "The Clergyman never used to make a fool of me
in this way."</p>

<p>"No; but he <em>did</em> make a fool of you."</p>

<p>"The Clergyman? well, you've never been so kind to
me as he was."</p>

<p>"No; and if I had I should have spoiled you."</p>

<p>"Well, sour milk can never become sweet."</p>

<p>"It may when it is boiled to whey."</p>

<p>She laughed aloud. "Here comes your mother."
Then the girl again became grave.</p>

<p>"Such a long-winded woman as that Clergyman's
lady, I never met with in all my live-long days," interposed
a sharp quick voice. "Now, make haste,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" id="Page_65" title="[Pg 65]"></a>
Baard; get up and push off the boat, or we sha'n't get
home to-night. The lady wished me to take care that
Eli's feet were kept dry. Dear me, she must attend to
that herself! Then she said Eli must take a walk every
morning for the sake of her health! Did ever anybody
hear such stuff! Well, get up, Baard, and push off the
boat; I have to make the dough this evening."</p>

<p>"The chest hasn't come yet," he said, without rising.</p>

<p>"But the chest isn't to come; it's to be left there till
next Sunday. Well, Eli, get up; take your bundle, and
come on. Now, get up, Baard."</p>

<p>Away she went, followed by the girl.</p>

<p>"Come on, come on!" Arne then heard the same
voice say from the shore below.</p>

<p>"Have you looked after the plug in the boat?" Baard
asked, still without rising.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's put in;" and then Arne heard her drive it
in with a scoop.</p>

<p>"But do get up, Baard; I suppose we're not going to
stay here all night? Get up, Baard!"</p>

<p>"I'm waiting for the chest."</p>

<p>"But bless you, dear, haven't I told you it's to be left
there till next Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Here it comes," Baard said, as the rattling of a cart
was heard.</p>

<p>"Why, I said it was to be left till next Sunday."</p>

<p>"I said we were to take it with us."</p>

<p>Away went the wife to the cart, and carried the bundle
and other small things down into the boat. Then Baard
rose, went up, and took down the chest himself.</p>

<p>But a girl with streaming hair, and a straw bonnet
came running after the cart: it was the Clergyman's
daughter. "Eli, Eli!" she cried while still at a distance.</p>

<p>"Mathilde, Mathilde," was answered; and the two<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" id="Page_66" title="[Pg 66]"></a>
girls ran towards each other. They met on the hill,
embraced each other and wept. Then Mathilde took
out something which she had set down on the grass: it
was a bird in a cage.</p>

<p>"You shall have Narrifas," she said; "mamma wishes
you to have it too; you shall have Narrifas ... you
really shall&mdash;and then you'll think of me&mdash;and very
often row over to me;" and again they wept much.</p>

<p>"Eli, come, Eli! don't keep standing there!" Arne
heard the mother say from the shore below.</p>

<p>"But I'll go with you," said Mathilde.</p>

<p>"Oh, do, do!" and, with their arms round each other's
neck, they ran down to the landing-place.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Arne saw the boat on the water, Eli
standing high in the stern, holding the bird-cage, and
waving her hand; while Mathilde sat alone on the stones
of the landing-place weeping.</p>

<p>She remained sitting there watching the boat as long
as it was on the water; and so did Arne. The distance
across the lake to the red houses was but short; the boat
soon passed into the dark shadows, and he saw it come
ashore. Then he saw in the water the reflections of the
three who had just landed, and in it he followed them on
their way to the red houses till they reached the finest of
them; there he saw them go in; the mother first, next,
the father, and last, the daughter. But soon the daughter
came out again, and seated herself before the storehouse;
perhaps to look across to the parsonage, over which the
sun was laying its last rays. But Mathilde had already
gone, and it was only Arne who was sitting there looking
at Eli in the water. "I wonder whether she sees me,"
he thought....</p>

<p>He rose and went away. The sun had set, but the
summer night was light and the sky clear blue. The<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" id="Page_67" title="[Pg 67]"></a>
mist from the lake and the valleys rose, and lay along
the mountain-sides, but their peaks were left clear, and
stood looking over to each other. He went higher: the
water lay black and deep below; the distant valley
shortened and drew nearer the lake; the mountains
came nearer the eye and gathered in clumps; the sky
itself was lower; and all things became friendly and
familiar.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Arne had of late been happier, both when at home and
when out among people. In the winter, when he had
not work enough on his own place, he went out in the
parish and did carpentry; but every Saturday night he
came home to the mother; and went with her to church
on Sunday, or read the sermon to her; and then returned
in the evening to his place of work. But soon, through
going more among people, his wish to travel awoke
within him again; and just after his merriest moods, he
would often lie trying to finish his song, "Over the mountains
high," and altering it for about the twentieth time.
He often thought of Christian, who seemed to have so<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" id="Page_70" title="[Pg 70]"></a>
utterly forgotten him, and who, in spite of his promise,
had not sent him even a single letter. Once, the remembrance
of Christian came upon him so powerfully that he
thoughtlessly spoke of him to the mother; she gave no
answer, but turned away and went out.</p>

<p>There was living in the parish a jolly man named Ejnar
Aasen. When he was twenty years old he broke his leg,
and from that time he had walked with the support of a
stick; but wherever he appeared limping along on that
stick, there was always merriment going on. The man
was rich, and he used the greater part of his wealth in
doing good; but he did it all so quietly that few people
knew anything about it. There was a large nut-wood
on his property; and on one of the brightest mornings in
harvest-time, he always had a nutting-party of merry girls
at his house, where he had abundance of good cheer for
them all day, and a dance in the evening. He was the
godfather of most of the girls; for he was the godfather
of half of the parish. All the children called him Godfather,
and from them everybody else had learned to call
him so, too.</p>

<p>He and Arne knew each other well; and he liked Arne
for the sake of his songs. Now he invited him to the
nutting-party; but Arne declined: he was not used to
girls' company, he said. "Then you had better get used
to it," answered Godfather.</p>

<p>So Arne came to the party, and was nearly the only
young man among the many girls. Such fun as was
there, Arne had never seen before in all his life; and one
thing which especially astonished him was, that the girls
laughed for nothing at all: if three laughed, then five
would laugh just because those three laughed. Altogether,
they behaved as if they had lived with each other
all their lives; and yet there were several of them who<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" id="Page_71" title="[Pg 71]"></a>
had never met before that very day. When they caught
the bough which they jumped after, they laughed, and
when they did not catch it they laughed also; when they
did not find any nuts, they laughed because they found
none; and when they did find some, they also laughed.
They fought for the nutting-hook: those who got it
laughed, and those who did not get it laughed also.
Godfather limped after them, trying to beat them with
his stick, and making all the mischief he was good for;
those he hit, laughed because he hit them, and those he
missed, laughed because he missed them. But the whole
lot laughed at Arne because he was so grave; and when
at last he could not help laughing, they all laughed again
because he laughed.</p>

<p>Then the whole party seated themselves on a large hill;
the girls in a circle, and Godfather in the middle. The
sun was scorching hot, but they did not care the least for
it, but sat cracking nuts, giving Godfather the kernels,
and throwing the shells and husks at each other. Godfather
'sh 'shed at them, and, as far as he could reach,
beat them with his stick; for he wanted to make them be
quiet and tell tales. But to stop their noise seemed just
about as easy as to stop a carriage running down a hill.
Godfather began to tell a tale, however. At first many
of them would not listen; they knew his stories already;
but soon they all listened attentively; and before they
thought of it, they set off tale-telling themselves at full
gallop. Though they had just been so noisy, their tales,
to Arne's great surprise, were very earnest: they ran
principally upon love.</p>

<p>"You, Aasa, know a good tale, I remember from last
year," said Godfather, turning to a plump girl with a
round, good-natured face, who sat plaiting the hair of a
younger sister, whose head lay in her lap.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" id="Page_72" title="[Pg 72]"></a>
"But perhaps several know it already," answered
Aasa.</p>

<p>"Never mind, tell it," they begged.</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll tell it without any more persuading,"
she answered; and then, plaiting her sister's hair all the
while, she told and sang:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was once a grown-up lad who tended cattle,
and who often drove them upwards near a broad stream.
On one side was a high steep cliff, jutting out so far over
the stream that when he was upon it he could talk to any
one on the opposite side; and all day he could see a girl
over there tending cattle, but he couldn't go to her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Now, tell me thy name, thou girl that art sitting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up there with thy sheep, so busily knitting,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he asked over and over for many days, till one day at last
there came an answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My name floats about like a duck in wet weather;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come over, thou boy in the cap of brown leather.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"This left the lad no wiser than he was before; and he
thought he wouldn't mind her any further. This, however,
was much more easily thought than done, for drive
his cattle whichever way he would, it always, somehow
or other, led to that same high steep cliff. Then the lad
grew frightened; and he called over to her&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Well, who is your father, and where are you biding?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the road to the church I have ne'er seen you riding.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The lad asked this because he half believed she was
a huldre.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" id="Page_73" title="[Pg 73]"></a></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My house is burned down, and my father is drowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the road to the church-hill I never have found.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"This again left the lad no wiser than he was before.
In the daytime he kept hovering about the cliff; and at
night he dreamed she danced with him, and lashed him
with a big cow's tail whenever he tried to catch her.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" id="Page_74" title="[Pg 74]"></a>
Soon he could neither sleep nor work; and altogether
the lad got in a very poor way. Then once more he
called from the cliff&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If thou art a huldre, then pray do not spell me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou art a maiden, then hasten to tell me.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But there came no answer; and so he was sure she
was a huldre. He gave up tending cattle; but it was all
the same; wherever he went, and whatever he did, he
was all the while thinking of the beautiful huldre who
blew on the horn. Soon he could bear it no longer; and
one moonlight evening when all were asleep, he stole
away into the forest, which stood there all dark at the
bottom, but with its tree-tops bright in the moonbeams.
He sat down on the cliff, and called&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Run forward, my huldre; my love has o'ercome me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My life is a burden; no longer hide from me.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The lad looked and looked; but she didn't appear.
Then he heard something moving behind him; he turned
round and saw a big black bear, which came forward,
squatted on the ground and looked at him. But he ran
away from the cliff and through the forest as fast as his
legs could carry him: if the bear followed him, he didn't
know, for he didn't turn round till he lay safely in bed.</p>

<p>"'It was one of her herd,' the lad thought; 'it isn't
worth while to go there any more;' and he didn't go.</p>

<p>"Then, one day, while he was chopping wood, a girl
came across the yard who was the living picture of the
huldre: but when she drew nearer, he saw it wasn't she.
Over this he pondered much. Then he saw the girl
coming back, and again while she was at a distance she
seemed to be the huldre, and he ran to meet her; but as
soon as he came near, he saw it wasn't she.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" id="Page_75" title="[Pg 75]"></a>
"After this, wherever the lad was&mdash;at church at
dances, or any other parties&mdash;the girl was, too; and still
when at a distance she seemed to be the huldre, and
when near she was somebody else. Then he asked her
whether she was the huldre or not, but she only laughed
at him. 'One may as well leap into it as creep into it,'
the lad thought; and so he married the girl.</p>

<p>"But the lad had hardly done this before he ceased to
like the girl: when he was away from her he longed for
her; but when he was with her he yearned for some one
he did not see. So the lad behaved very badly to his
wife; but she suffered in silence.</p>

<p>"Then one day when he was out looking for his
horses, he came again to the cliff; and he sat down and
called out&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Like fairy moonlight, to me thou seemest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Midsummer-fires, from afar thou gleamest.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"He felt that it did him good to sit there; and afterwards
he went whenever things were wrong at home.
His wife wept when he was gone.</p>

<p>"But one day when he was sitting there, he saw the
huldre sitting all alive on the other side blowing her horn.
He called over&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Ah, dear, art thou come! all around thee is shining!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, blow now again! I am sitting here pining.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Then she answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Away from thy mind the dreams I am blowing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy rye is all rotting for want of mowing.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But then the lad felt frightened and went home again.
Ere long, however, he grew so tired of his wife that he
was obliged to go to the forest again, and he sat down on
the cliff. Then was sung over to him<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" id="Page_76" title="[Pg 76]"></a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I dreamed thou wast here; ho, hasten to bind me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No; not over there, but behind you will find me.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The lad jumped up and looked around him, and
caught a glimpse of a green petticoat just slipping away
between the shrubs. He followed, and it came to a hunting
all through the forest. So swift-footed as that huldre,
no human creature could be: he flung steel over her
again and again, but still she ran on just as well as ever.
But soon the lad saw, by her pace, that she was beginning
to grow tired, though he saw, too, by her shape,
that she could be no other than the huldre. 'Now,' he
thought, you'll be mine easily;' and he caught hold on
her so suddenly and roughly that they both fell, and rolled
down the hills a long way before they could stop themselves.
Then the huldre laughed till it seemed to the lad
the mountains sang again. He took her upon his knee;
and so beautiful she was, that never in all his life he had
seen any one like her: exactly like her, he thought his
wife should have been. 'Ah, who are you who are so
beautiful?' he asked, stroking her cheek. She blushed
rosy red. 'I'm your wife,' she answered."</p>

<p>The girls laughed much at that tale, and ridiculed the
lad. But Godfather asked Arne if he had listened well
to it.</p>

<p>"Well, now I'll tell you something," said a little girl
with a little round face, and a very little nose:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Once there was a little lad who wished very much
to woo a little girl. They were both grown up; but
yet they were very little. And the lad couldn't in any
way muster courage to ask her to have him. He kept
close to her when they came home from church; but,
somehow or other, their chat was always about the
weather. He went over to her at the dancing-parties,
and nearly danced her to death; but still he couldn't<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" id="Page_77" title="[Pg 77]"></a>
bring himself to say what he wanted. 'You must learn
to write,' he said to himself; 'then you'll manage matters.'
And the lad set to writing; but he thought it could
never be done well enough; and so he wrote a whole
year round before he dared do his letter. Now, the thing
was to get it given to her without anybody seeing. He
waited till one day when they were standing all by themselves
behind the church. 'I've got a letter for you,'
said the lad. 'But I can't read writing,' the girl answered.</p>

<p>"And there the lad stood.</p>

<p>"Then he went to service at the girl's father's house;
and he used to keep hovering round her all day long.
Once he had nearly brought himself to speak; in fact,
he had already opened his mouth; but then a big fly flew
in it. 'Well, I hope, at any rate, nobody else will come
to take her away,' the lad thought; but nobody came to
take her, because she was so very little.</p>

<p>"By-and-by, however, some one <em>did</em> come, and he,
too, was little. The lad could see very well what he
wanted; and when he and the girl went up-stairs together,
the lad placed himself at the key-hole. Then he
who was inside made his offer. 'Bad luck to me, I, codfish,
who didn't make haste!' the lad thought. He who
was inside kissed the girl just on her lips&mdash;&mdash;. 'No
doubt that tasted nice,' the lad thought. But he who was
inside took the girl on his lap. 'Oh, dear me! what a
world this is!' the lad said, and began crying. Then the
girl heard him and went to the door. 'What do you
want, you nasty boy?' said she, 'why can't you leave
me alone?'&mdash;'I? I only wanted to ask you to have me
for your bridesman.'&mdash;'No; that, my brother's going to
be,' the girl answered, banging the door to.</p>

<p>"And there the lad stood."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" id="Page_78" title="[Pg 78]"></a>
The girls laughed very much at this tale, and afterwards
pelted each other with husks.</p>

<p>Then Godfather wished Eli Böen to tell something.</p>

<p>"What, then, must it be?"</p>

<p>"Well, she might tell what she had told him on the
hill, the last time he came to see her parents, when she
gave him the new garters. Eli laughed very much; and
it was some time before she would tell it: however, she
did at last,&mdash;</p>

<p>"A lad and a girl were once walking together on a
road. 'Ah, look at that thrush that follows us!' the girl
said. 'It follows <em>me</em>,' said the lad. 'It's just as likely
to be <em>me</em>,' the girl answered. 'That, we'll soon find out,'
said the lad; 'you go that way, while I go this, and we'll
meet up yonder.' They did so. 'Well, didn't it follow
me?' the lad asked, when they met. 'No; it followed
me,' answered the girl. 'Then, there must be two.'
They went together again for some distance, but then
there was only one thrush; and the lad thought it flew
on his side, but the girl thought it flew on hers. 'Devil
a bit, I care for that thrush,' said the lad. 'Nor do I,'
answered the girl.</p>

<p>"But no sooner had they said this, than the thrush
flew away. 'It was on <em>your</em> side, it was,' said the lad.
'Thank you,' answered the girl; 'but I clearly saw it
was on <em>your</em> side.&mdash;But see! there it comes again!'
'Indeed, it's on <em>my</em> side,' the lad exclaimed. Then the
girl got angry: 'Ah, well, I wish I may never stir if I
go with you any longer!' and she went away.</p>

<p>"Then the thrush, too, left the lad; and he felt so dull
that he called out to the girl, 'Is the thrush with you?'&mdash;'No;
isn't it with you?'&mdash;'Ah, no; you must come
here again, and then perhaps it will follow you.'</p>

<p>"The girl came; and she and the lad walked on together,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" id="Page_79" title="[Pg 79]"></a>
hand in hand. 'Quitt, quitt, quitt, quitt!' sounded
on the girl's side; 'quitt, quitt, quitt, quitt!' sounded on
the lad's side; 'quitt, quitt, quitt, quitt!' sounded on
every side; and when they looked there were a hundred
thousand million thrushes all round them. 'Ah, how
nice this is!' said the girl, looking up at the lad. 'Ah,
God bless you!' said he, and kissed her."</p>

<p>All the girls thought this was such a nice tale.</p>

<p>Then Godfather said they must tell what they had
dreamed last night, and he would decide who had
dreamed the nicest things.</p>

<p>"Tell what they had dreamed! No; impossible!"</p>

<p>And then there was no end of tittering and whispering.
But soon one after another began to think she had such a
nice dream last night; and then others thought it could
not possibly be so nice as what they had dreamed; and
at last they all got a great mind for telling their dreams.
Yet they must not be told aloud, but to one only, and
that one must by no means be Godfather. Arne had all
this time been sitting quietly a little lower down the hill,
and so the girls thought they dared tell their dreams to
him.</p>

<p>Then Arne seated himself under a hazel-bush; and
Aasa, the girl who had told the first tale, came over to
him. She hesitated a while, but then began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I dreamed I was standing by a large lake. Then I
saw one walking on the water, and it was one whose
name I will not say. He stepped into a large water-lily,
and sat there singing. But I launched out upon one of
the large leaves of the lily which lay floating on the
water; for on it I would row over to him. But no
sooner had I come upon the leaf than it began to sink
with me, and I became much frightened, and I wept.
Then he came rowing along in the water-lily, and lifted<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" id="Page_80" title="[Pg 80]"></a>
me up to him; and we rowed all over the whole lake.
Wasn't that a nice dream?"</p>

<p>Next came the little girl who had told the tale about
the little lad,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I dreamed I had caught a little bird, and I was so
pleased with it, and I thought I wouldn't let it loose till I
came home in our room. But there I dared not let it
loose, for I was afraid father and mother might tell me to
let it go again. So I took it up-stairs; but I could not
let it loose there, either, for the cat was lurking about.
Then I didn't know what in the world to do; yet I took
it into the barn. Dear me, there were so many cracks, I
was afraid it might go away! Well, then I went down
again into the yard; and there, it seemed to me some one
was standing whose name I will not say. He stood
playing with a big, big dog. 'I would rather play with
that bird of yours,' he said, and drew very near to me.
But then it seemed to me I began running away; and
both he and the big dog ran after me all round the yard;
but then mother opened the front door, pulled me hastily
in, and banged the door after me. The lad, however,
stood laughing outside, with his face against the window-pane.
'Look, here's the bird,' he said; and, only think,
he had my bird out there! Wasn't that a beautiful
dream?"</p>

<p>Then came the girl who had told about the thrushes&mdash;Eli,
they called her. She was laughing so much that she
could not speak for some time; but at last she began,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had been looking forward with very much pleasure
to our nutting in the wood to-day; and so last night I
dreamed I was sitting here on the hill. The sun shone
brightly; and I had my lap full of nuts. But there came
a little squirrel among them, and it sat on its hind-legs
and ate them all up. Wasn't that a funny dream?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" id="Page_81" title="[Pg 81]"></a>
Afterwards some more dreams were told him; and
then the girls would have him say which was the nicest.
Of course, he must have plenty of time for consideration;
and meanwhile Godfather and the whole flock went
down to the house, leaving Arne to follow. They skipped
down the hill, and when they came to the plain went all
in a row singing towards the house.</p>

<p>Arne sat alone on the hill, listening to the singing.
Strong sunlight fell on the group of girls, and their white
bodices shone bright, as they went dancing over the
meadows, every now and then clasping each other round
the waist; while Godfather limped behind, threatening
them with a stick because they trod down his hay. Arne
thought no more of the dreams, and soon he no longer
looked after the girls. His thoughts went floating far
away beyond the valley, like the fine air-threads, while
he remained behind on the hill, spinning; and before he
was aware of it he had woven a close web of sadness.
More than ever, he longed to go away.</p>

<p>"Why stay any longer?" he said to himself; "surely,
I've been lingering long enough now!" He promised
himself that he would speak to the mother about it as
soon as he reached home, however it might turn out.</p>

<p>With greater force than ever, his thoughts turned to
his song, "Over the mountains high;" and never before
had the words come so swiftly, or linked themselves into
rhyme so easily; they seemed almost like girls sitting in
a circle on the brow of a hill. He had a piece of paper
with him, and placing it upon his knee, he wrote down
the verses as they came. When he had finished the song,
he rose like one freed from a burden. He felt unwilling
to see any one, and went homewards by the way through
the wood, though he knew he should then have to walk
during the night. The first time he stopped to rest on<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" id="Page_82" title="[Pg 82]"></a>
the way, he put his hand to his pocket to take out the
song, intending to sing it aloud to himself through the
wood; but he found he had left it behind at the place
where it was composed.</p>

<p>One of the girls went on the hill to look for him; she
did not find him, but she found his song.</p>

<span class="italic">LOOSENING THE WEATHER-VANE.</span></h2>


<p>To speak to the mother about going away, was more
easily thought of than done. He spoke again
about Christian, and those letters which had never come;
but then the mother went away, and for days afterwards
he thought her eyes looked red and swollen. He noticed,
too, that she then got nicer food for him than usual; and
this gave him another sign of her state of mind with
regard to him.</p>

<p>One day he went to cut fagots in a wood which bordered
upon another belonging to the parsonage, and
through which the road ran. Just where he was going
to cut his fagots, people used to come in autumn to
gather whortleberries. He had laid aside his axe to
take off his jacket, and was just going to begin work,
when two girls came walking along with a basket to
gather berries. He used generally to hide himself rather
than meet girls, and he did so now.</p>

<p>"Ah! only see what a lot of berries! Eli, Eli!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I see!"</p>

<p>"Well, but, then, don't go any farther; here are many
basketfuls."</p>

<p>"I thought I heard a rustling among the trees!"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!"</p>

<p>The girls rushed towards each other, clasped each other
round the waist, and for a little while stood still, scarcely
drawing breath. "It's nothing, I dare say; come, let's
go on picking."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" id="Page_84" title="[Pg 84]"></a>
"Well, so we will."</p>

<p>And they went on.</p>

<p>"It was nice you came to the parsonage to-day, Eli.
Haven't you anything to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I've been to see Godfather."</p>

<p>"Well, you've told me that; but haven't you anything
to tell me about <em>him</em>&mdash;you know who?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I have!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Eli, have you! make haste and tell me!"
"He has been there again."</p>

<p>"Nonsense?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, he has: father and mother pretended to know
nothing of it; but I went up-stairs and hid myself."</p>

<p>"Well, what then? did he come after you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I believe father told him where I was; he's
always so tiresome now."</p>

<p>"And so he came there?&mdash;Sit down, sit down; here,
near me. Well, and then he came?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but he didn't say much, for he was so bashful."</p>

<p>"Tell me what he said, every word; pray, every
word!"</p>

<p>"'Are you afraid of me?' he said. 'Why should
I be afraid?' I answered. 'You know what I want
to say to you,' he said, sitting down beside me on the
chest."</p>

<p>"Beside you!"</p>

<p>"And he took me round my waist."</p>

<p>"Round your waist; nonsense!"</p>

<p>"I wished very much to get loose again; but he
wouldn't let me. 'Dear Eli,' he said&mdash;&mdash;" She
laughed, and the other one laughed, too.</p>

<p>"Well? well?"</p>

<p>"'Will you be my wife?' Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" id="Page_85" title="[Pg 85]"></a>
"Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>And then both laughed together, "Ha, ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>At last the laughing came to an end, and they were
both quiet for a while. Then the one who had first
spoken asked in a low voice, "Wasn't it strange he took
you round your waist?"</p>

<p>Either the other girl did not answer that question, or
she answered in so low a voice that it could not be heard;
perhaps she only answered by a smile.</p>

<p>"Didn't your father or your mother say anything afterwards?"
asked the first girl, after a pause.</p>

<p>"Father came up and looked at me; but I turned away
from him because he laughed at me."</p>

<p>"And your mother?"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't say anything; but she wasn't so strict
as usual."</p>

<p>"Well, you've done with him, I think?"</p>

<p>"Of course!"</p>

<p>Then there was again silence awhile.</p>

<p>"Was it thus he took you round your waist?"</p>

<p>"No; thus."</p>

<p>"Well, then;&mdash;it was thus...."</p>

<p>"Eli?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Do you think there will ever be anybody come in that
way to me?"</p>

<p>"Of course, there will!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Ah, Eli? If he took me round the
waist?" She hid her face.</p>

<p>Then they laughed again; and there was much whispering
and tittering.</p>

<p>Soon the girls went away; they had not seen either
Arne or the axe and jacket, and he was glad of it.</p>

<p>A few days after, he gave Opplands-Knut a little farm<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" id="Page_86" title="[Pg 86]"></a>
on Kampen. "You shall not be lonely any longer,"
Arne said.</p>

<p>That winter Arne went to the parsonage for some time
to do carpentry; and both the girls were often there together.
When Arne saw them, he often wondered who
it might be that now came to woo Eli Böen.</p>

<p>One day he had to drive for the clergyman's daughter
and Eli; he could not understand a word they said,
though he had very quick ears. Sometimes Mathilde
spoke to him; and then Eli always laughed and hid her
face. Mathilde asked him if it was true that he could
make verses. "No," he said quickly; then they both
laughed; and chattered and laughed again. He felt
vexed; and afterwards when he met them seemed not to
take any notice of them.</p>

<p>Once he was sitting in the servants' hall while a dance
was going on, and Mathilde and Eli both came to see it.
They stood together in a corner, disputing about something;
Eli would not do it, but Mathilde would, and she
at last gained her point. Then they both came over to
Arne, courtesied, and asked him if he could dance. He
said he could not; and then both turned aside and ran
away, laughing. In fact, they were always laughing,
Arne thought; and he became brave. But soon after, he
got the clergyman's foster-son, a boy of about twelve, to
teach him to dance, when no one was by.</p>

<p>Eli had a little brother of the same age as the clergyman's
foster-son. These two boys were playfellows;
and Arne made sledges, snow-shoes and snares for them;
and often talked to them about their sisters, especially
about Eli. One day Eli's brother brought Arne a message
that he ought to make his hair a little smoother.
"Who said that?"</p>

<p>"Eli did; but she told me not to say it was she."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" id="Page_87" title="[Pg 87]"></a>
A few days after, Arne sent word that Eli ought to
laugh a little less. The boy brought back word that
Arne ought by all means to laugh a little more.</p>

<p>Eli's brother once asked Arne to give him something
that he had written. He complied, without thinking any
more about the matter. But in a few days after, the boy,
thinking to please Arne, told him that Eli and Mathilde
liked his writing very much.</p>

<p>"Where, then, have they seen any of it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was for them, I asked for some of it the
other day."</p>

<p>Then Arne asked the boys to bring him something
their sisters had written. They did so; and he corrected
the errors in the writing with his carpenter's pencil, and
asked the boys to lay it in some place where their sisters
might easily find it. Soon after, he found the paper in
his jacket pocket; and at the foot was written, "Corrected
by a conceited fellow."</p>

<p>The next day, Arne completed his work at the parsonage,
and returned home. So gentle as he was that winter,
the mother had never seen him, since that sad time
just after the father's death. He read the sermon to her,
accompanied her to church, and was in every way very
kind. But she knew only too well that one great reason
for his increased kindness was, that he meant to go away
when spring came. Then one day a message came from
Böen, asking him to go there to do carpentry.</p>

<p>Arne started, and, apparently without thinking of what
he said, replied that he would come. But no sooner had
the messenger left than the mother said, "You may well
be astonished! From Böen?"</p>

<p>"Well, is there anything strange in that?" Arne asked,
without looking at her.</p>

<p>"From Böen!" the mother exclaimed once more.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" id="Page_88" title="[Pg 88]"></a>
"And, why not from Böen, as well as any other place?"
he answered, looking up a little.</p>

<p>"From Böen and Birgit Böen!&mdash;Baard, who made
your father a cripple, and all only for Birgit's sake!"</p>

<p>"What do you say?" exclaimed Arne; "was that
Baard Böen?"</p>

<p>Mother and son stood looking at each other. The
whole of the father's life seemed unrolled before them,
and at that moment they saw the black thread which had
always run through it. Then they began talking about
those grand days of his, when old Eli Böen had himself
offered him his daughter Birgit, and he had refused her:
they passed on through his life till the day when his spine
had been broken; and they both agreed that Baard's fault
was the less. Still, it was he who had made the father a
cripple; he, it was.</p>

<p>"Have I not even yet done with father?" Arne
thought; and determined at the same moment that he
would go to Böen.</p>

<p>As he went walking, with his saw on his shoulder, over
the ice towards Böen, it seemed to him a beautiful place.
The dwelling-house always seemed as if it was fresh
painted; and&mdash;perhaps because he felt a little cold&mdash;it
just then looked to him very sheltered and comfortable.
He did not, however, go straight in, but went round by
the cattle-house, where a flock of thick-haired goats
stood in the snow, gnawing the bark off some fir twigs.
A shepherd's dog ran backwards and forwards on the
barn steps, barking as if the devil was coming to the
house; but when Arne went to him, he wagged his tail
and allowed himself to be patted. The kitchen door at
the upper end of the house was often opened, and Arne
looked over there every time; but he saw no one except
the milkmaid, carrying some pails, or the cook, throwing<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" id="Page_89" title="[Pg 89]"></a>
something to the goats. In the barn the threshers were
hard at work; and to the left, in front of the woodshed,
a lad stood chopping fagots, with many piles of them
behind him.</p>

<p>Arne laid away his saw and went into the kitchen:
the floor was strewed with white sand and chopped
juniper leaves; copper kettles shone on the walls;
china and earthenware stood in rows upon the shelves;
and the servants were preparing the dinner. Arne
asked for Baard. "Step into the sitting-room," said
one of the servants, pointing to an inner door with a
brass knob. He went in: the room was brightly painted&mdash;the
ceiling, with clusters of roses; the cupboards, with
red, and the names of the owners in black letters; the
bedstead, also with red, bordered with blue stripes.
Beside the stove, a broad-shouldered, mild-looking man,
with long light hair, sat hooping some tubs; and at the
large table, a slender, tall woman, in a close-fitting dress
and linen cap, sat sorting some corn into two heaps: no
one else was in the room.</p>

<p>"Good day, and a blessing on the work," said Arne,
taking off his cap. Both looked up; and the man smiled
and asked who it was. "I am he who has come to do
carpentry."</p>

<p>The man smiled still more, and said, while he leaned
forward again to his work, "Oh, all right, Arne Kampen."</p>

<p>"Arne Kampen?" exclaimed the wife, staring down
at the floor. The man looked up quickly, and said, smiling
once more, "A son of Nils, the tailor;" and then he
began working again.</p>

<p>Soon the wife rose, went to the shelf, turned from it to
the cupboard, once more turned away, and, while rummaging
for something in the table drawer, she asked,
without looking up, "Is <em>he</em> going to work <em>here</em>?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" id="Page_90" title="[Pg 90]"></a>
"Yes, that he is," the husband answered, also without
looking up.</p>

<p>"Nobody has asked you to sit down, it seems," he
added, turning to Arne, who then took a seat. The wife
went out, and the husband continued working: and so
Arne asked whether he, too, might begin. "We'll have
dinner first."</p>

<p>The wife did not return; but next time the door opened,
it was Eli who entered. At first, she appeared not to see
Arne, but when he rose to meet her she turned half round
and gave him her hand; yet she did not look at him.
They exchanged a few words, while the father worked on.
Eli was slender and upright, her hands were small, with
round wrists, her hair was braided, and she wore a dress
with a close-fitting bodice. She laid the table for dinner:
the laborers dined in the next room; but Arne, with the
family.</p>

<p>"Isn't your mother coming?" asked the husband.</p>

<p>"No; she's up-stairs, weighing wool."</p>

<p>"Have you asked her to come?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but she says she won't have anything."</p>

<p>There was silence for a while.</p>

<p>"But it's cold up-stairs."</p>

<p>"She wouldn't let me make a fire."</p>

<p>After dinner, Arne began to work; and in the evening
he again sat with the family. The wife and Eli sewed,
while the husband employed himself in some trifling
work, and Arne helped him. They worked on in silence
above an hour; for Eli, who seemed to be the one who
usually did the talking, now said nothing. Arne thought
with dismay how often it was just so in his own home;
and yet he had never felt it till now. At last, Eli seemed
to think she had been silent quite long enough, and, after
drawing a deep breath, she burst out laughing. Then<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" id="Page_91" title="[Pg 91]"></a>
the father laughed; and Arne felt it was ridiculous and
began, too. Afterwards they talked about several things,
soon the conversation was principally between Arne and
Eli, the father now and then putting in a word edgewise.
But once after Arne had been speaking at some length,
he looked up, and his eyes met those of the mother, Birgit,
who had laid down her work, and sat gazing at him.
Then she went on with her work again; but the next
word he spoke made her look up once more.</p>

<p>Bedtime drew near, and they all went to their own
rooms. Arne thought he would take notice of the dream
he had the first night in a fresh place; but he could see
no meaning in it. During the whole day he had talked
very little with the husband; yet now in the night he
dreamed of no one in the house but him. The last thing
was, that Baard was sitting playing at cards with Nils,
the tailor. The latter looked very pale and angry; but
Baard was smiling, and he took all the tricks.</p>

<p>Arne stayed at Böen several days; and a great deal was
done, but very little said. Not only the people in the
parlor, but also the servants, the housemen, everybody
about the place, even the women, were silent. In the
yard was an old dog which barked whenever a stranger
came near; but if any of the people belonging to the
place heard him, they always said "Hush!" and then he
went away, growling, and lay down. At Arne's own
home was a large weather-vane, and here was one still
larger which he particularly noticed because it did not
turn. It shook whenever the wind was high, as though
it wished to turn; and Arne stood looking at it so long
that he felt at last he must climb up to unloose it. It was
not frozen fast, as he thought: but a stick was fixed
against it to prevent it from turning. He took the stick out
and threw it down; Baard was just passing below, and it
struck him.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" id="Page_92" title="[Pg 92]"></a>
"What are you doing?" said he, looking up.</p>

<p>"I'm loosening the vane."</p>

<p>"Leave it alone; it makes a wailing noise when it
turns."</p>

<p>"Well, I think even that's better than silence," said
Arne, seating himself astride on the ridge of the roof.
Baard looked up at Arne, and Arne down at Baard.
Then Baard smiled and said, "He who must wail when
he speaks had better he silent."</p>

<p>Words sometimes haunt us long after they were uttered,
especially when they were last words. So Baard's words
followed Arne as he came down from the roof in the cold,
and they were still with him when he went into the sitting-room
in the evening. It was twilight; and Eli stood
at the window, looking away over the ice which lay
bright in the moonlight. Arne went to the other window,
and looked out also. Indoors it was warm and
quiet; outdoors it was cold, and a sharp wind swept
through the vale, bending the branches of the trees, and
making their shadows creep trembling on the snow. A
light shone over from the parsonage, then vanished, then
appeared again, taking various shapes and colors, as a
distant light always seems to do when one looks at it long
and intently. Opposite, the mountain stood dark, with
deep shadow at its foot, where a thousand fairy tales
hovered; but with its snowy upper plains bright in the
moonlight. The stars were shining, and northern lights
were flickering in one quarter of the sky, but they did not
spread. A little way from the window, down towards
the water, stood some trees, whose shadows kept stealing
over to each other; but the tall ash stood alone, writing
on the snow.</p>

<p>All was silent, save now and then, when a long wailing
sound was heard. "What's that?" asked Arne.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" id="Page_93" title="[Pg 93]"></a>
"It's the weather-vane," said Eli; and after a little
while she added in a lower tone, as if to herself, "it must
have come unfastened."</p>

<p>But Arne had been like one who wished to speak and
could not. Now he said, "Do you remember that tale
about the thrushes?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It was you who told it, indeed. It was a nice tale."</p>

<p>"I often think there's something that sings when all is
still," she said, in a voice so soft and low that he felt as if
he heard it now for the first time.</p>

<p>"It is the good within our own souls," he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him as if she thought that answer meant
too much; and they both stood silent a few moments.
Then she asked, while she wrote with her finger on the
window-pane, "Have you made any songs lately?"</p>

<p>He blushed; but she did not see it, and so she asked
once more, "How do you manage to make songs?"</p>

<p>"Should you like to know?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes;&mdash;I should."</p>

<p>"I store up the thoughts that other people let slip."</p>

<p>She was silent for a long while; perhaps thinking she
might have had some thoughts fit for songs, but had let
them slip.</p>

<p>"How strange it is," she said, at last, as though to herself,
and beginning to write again on the window-pane.</p>

<p>"I made a song the first time I had seen you."</p>

<p>"Where was that?"</p>

<p>"Behind the parsonage, that evening you went away
from there;&mdash;I saw you in the water."</p>

<p>She laughed, and was quiet for a while.</p>

<p>"Let me hear that song."</p>

<p>Arne had never done such a thing before, but he
repeated the song now:<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" id="Page_94" title="[Pg 94]"></a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fair Venevill bounded on lithesome feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her lover to meet," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Eli listened attentively, and stood silent long after he
had finished. At last she exclaimed, "Ah, what a pity
for her!"</p>

<p>"I feel as if I had not made that song myself," he said;
and then stood like her, thinking over it.</p>

<p>"But that won't be my fate, I hope," she said, after a
pause.</p>

<p>"No; I was thinking rather of myself."</p>

<p>"Will it be your fate, then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I felt so then."</p>

<p>"How strange." She wrote on the panes again.</p>

<p>The next day, when Arne came into the room to dinner,
he went over to the window. Outdoors it was dull
and foggy, but indoors, warm and comfortable; and on
the window-pane was written with a finger, "Arne, Arne,
Arne," and nothing but "Arne," over and over again:
it was at that window, Eli stood the evening before.</p>

<span class="italic">ELI'S SICKNESS.</span></h2>


<p>Next day, Arne came into the room and said he had
heard in the yard that the clergyman's daughter,
Mathilde, had just gone to the town; as she thought, for
a few days, but as her parents intended, for a year or two.
Eli had heard nothing of this before, and now she fell
down fainting. Arne had never seen any one faint, and
he was much frightened. He ran for the maids; they
ran for the parents, who came hurrying in; and there
was a disturbance all over the house, and the dog barked
on the barn steps. Soon after, when Arne came in
again, the mother was kneeling at the bedside, while the
father supported Eli's drooping head. The maids were
running about&mdash;one for water, another for hartshorn
which was in the cupboard, while a third unfastened her
jacket.</p>

<p>"God help you!" the mother said; "I see it was
wrong in us not to tell her; it was you, Baard, who
would have it so; God help you!" Baard did not answer.
"I wished to tell her, indeed; but nothing's to be
as I wish; God help you! You're always so harsh with
her, Baard; you don't understand her; you don't know
what it is to love anybody, you don't." Baard did not
answer. "She isn't like some others who can bear sorrow;
it quite puts her down, poor slight thing, as she is.
Wake up, my child, and we'll be kind to you! wake up,
Eli, my own darling, and don't grieve us so."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" id="Page_96" title="[Pg 96]"></a>
"You always either talk too much or too little," Baard
said, at last, looking over to Arne, as though he did not
wish him to hear such things, but to leave the room. As,
however, the maid-servants stayed, Arne thought he, too,
might stay; but he went over to the window. Soon the
sick girl revived so far as to be able to look round and
recognize those about her; but then also memory returned,
and she called wildly for Mathilde, went into
hysterics, and sobbed till it was painful to be in the room.
The mother tried to soothe her, and the father sat down
where she could see him; but she pushed them both
from her.</p>

<p>"Go away!" she cried; "I don't like you; go
away!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Eli, how can you say you don't like your own
parents?" exclaimed the mother.</p>

<p>"No! you're unkind to me, and you take away every
pleasure from me!"</p>

<p>"Eli, Eli! don't say such hard things," said the mother,
imploringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother," she exclaimed; "now I <em>must</em> say it!
Yes, mother; you wish to marry me to that bad man;
and I won't have him! You shut me up here, where
I'm never happy save when I'm going out! And you
take away Mathilde from me; the only one in the world
I love and long for! Oh, God, what will become of me,
now Mathilde is gone!"</p>

<p>"But you haven't been much with her lately," Baard
said.</p>

<p>"What did that matter, so long as I could look over to
her from that window," the poor girl answered, weeping
in a childlike way that Arne had never before seen in
any one.</p>

<p>"Why, you couldn't see her there," said Baard.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" id="Page_97" title="[Pg 97]"></a>
"Still, I saw the house," she answered; and the
mother added passionately, "You don't understand such
things, you don't." Then Baard said nothing more.</p>

<p>"Now, I can never again go to the window," said Eli.
"When I rose in the morning, I went there; in the evening
I sat there in the moonlight: I went there when I
could go to no one else. Mathilde! Mathilde?" She
writhed in the bed, and went again into hysterics. Baard
sat down on a stool a little way from the bed, and continued
looking at her.</p>

<p>But Eli did not recover so soon as they expected.
Towards evening they saw she would have a serious
illness, which had probably been coming upon her for
some time; and Arne was called to assist in carrying her
up-stairs to her room. She lay quiet and unconscious,
looking very pale. The mother sat by the side of her
bed, the father stood at the foot, looking at her: afterwards
he went to his work. So did Arne; but that
night before he went to sleep, he prayed for her; prayed
that she who was so young and fair might be happy in
this world, and that no one might bar away joy from
her.</p>

<p>The next day when Arne came in, he found the father
and mother sitting talking together: the mother had been
weeping. Arne asked how Eli was; both expected the
other to give an answer, and so for some time none was
given, but at last the father said, "Well, she's very bad
to-day."</p>

<p>Afterwards Arne heard that she had been raving all
night, or, as the father said, "talking foolery." She had
a violent fever, knew no one, and would not eat, and
the parents were deliberating whether they should send
for a doctor. When afterwards they both went to the
sick-room, leaving Arne behind, he felt as if life and<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" id="Page_98" title="[Pg 98]"></a>
death were struggling together up there, but he was kept
outside.</p>

<p>In a few days, however, Eli became a little better.
But once when the father was tending her, she took it
into her head to have Narrifas, the bird which Mathilde
had given her, set beside the bed. Then Baard told her
that&mdash;as was really the case&mdash;in the confusion the bird
had been forgotten, and was starved. The mother was
just coming in as Baard was saying this, and while yet
standing in the doorway, she cried out, "Oh, dear me,
what a monster you are, Baard, to tell it to that poor
little thing! See, she's fainting again; God forgive
you!" When Eli revived she again asked for the bird;
said its death was a bad omen for Mathilde; and wished
to go to her: then she fainted again. Baard stood looking
on till she grew so much worse that he wanted to
help, too, in tending her; but the mother pushed him
away, and said she would do all herself. Then Baard
gave a long sad look at both of them, put his cap straight
with both hands, turned aside and went out.</p>

<p>Soon after, the Clergyman and his wife came; for the
fever heightened, and grew so violent that they did not
know whether it would turn to life or death. The
Clergyman as well as his wife spoke to Baard about Eli,
and hinted that he was too harsh with her; but when
they heard what he had told her about the bird, the
Clergyman plainly told him it was very rough, and said
he would have her taken to his own house as soon as she
was well enough to be moved. The Clergyman's wife
would scarcely look at Baard; she wept, and went to sit
with the sick one; then sent for the doctor, and came
several times a day to carry out his directions. Baard
went wandering restlessly about from one place to another
in the yard, going oftenest to those places where<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" id="Page_99" title="[Pg 99]"></a>
he could be alone. There he would stand still by the
hour together; then, put his cap straight and work again
a little.</p>

<p>The mother did not speak to him, and they scarcely
looked at each other. He used to go and see Eli several
times in the day; he took off his shoes before he went
up-stairs, left his cap outside, and opened the door
cautiously. When he came in, Birgit would turn her
head, but take no notice of him, and then sit just as
before, stooping forwards, with her head on her hands,
looking at Eli, who lay still and pale, unconscious of all
that was passing around her. Baard would stand awhile
at the foot of the bed and look at them both, but say
nothing: once when Eli moved as though she were
waking, he stole away directly as quietly as he had
come.</p>

<p>Arne often thought words had been exchanged between
man and wife and parents and child which had been long
gathering, and would be long remembered. He longed
to go away, though he wished to know before he went
what would be the end of Eli's illness; but then he
thought he might always hear about her even after he
had left; and so he went to Baard telling him he wished
to go home: the work which he came to do was completed.
Baard was sitting outdoors on a chopping-block,
scratching in the snow with a stick: Arne recognized
the stick: it was the one which had fastened the weather-vane.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it isn't worth your while to stay here
now; yet I feel as if I don't like you to go away, either,"
said Baard, without looking up. He said no more;
neither did Arne; but after a while he walked away to
do some work, taking for granted that he was to remain
at Böen.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" id="Page_100" title="[Pg 100]"></a>
Some time after, when he was called to dinner, he
saw Baard still sitting on the block. He went over to
him, and asked how Eli was.</p>

<p>"I think she's very bad to-day," Baard said.</p>

<p>"I see the mother's weeping."</p>

<p>Arne felt as if somebody asked him to sit down, and
he seated himself opposite Baard on the end of a felled
tree.</p>

<p>"I've often thought of your father lately," Baard said
so unexpectedly that Arne did not know how to answer.</p>

<p>"You know, I suppose, what was between us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, as may be expected, only one half
of the story, and think I'm greatly to blame."</p>

<p>"You have, I dare say, settled that affair with your
God, as surely as my father has done so," Arne said,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"Well, some people might think so," Baard answered.
"When I found this stick, I felt it was so strange that
you should come here and unloose the weather-vane. As
well now as later, I thought." He had taken off his cap,
and sat silently looking at it.</p>

<p>"I was about fourteen years old when I became acquainted
with your father, and he was of the same age.
He was very wild, and he couldn't bear any one to be
above him in anything. So he always had a grudge
against me because I stood first, and he, second, when
we were confirmed. He often offered to fight me, but
we never came to it; most likely because neither of us
felt sure who would beat. And a strange thing it is,
that although he fought every day, no accident came
from it; while the first time I did, it turned out as badly
as could be; but, it's true, I had been wanting to fight
long enough.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" id="Page_101" title="[Pg 101]"></a>
"Nils fluttered about all the girls, and they, about him.
There was only one I would have, and her he took away
from me at every dance, at every wedding, and at every
party; it was she who is now my wife.... Often, as I
sat there, I felt a great mind to try my strength upon him
for this thing; but I was afraid I should lose, and I knew
if I did, I should lose her, too. Then, when everybody
had gone, I would lift the weights he had lifted, and kick
the beam he had kicked; but the next time he took the
girl from me, I was afraid to meddle with him, although
once, when he was flirting with her just in my face, I
went up to a tall fellow who stood by and threw him
against the beam, as if in fun. And Nils grew pale, too,
when he saw it.</p>

<p>"Even if he had been kind to her; but he was false to
her again and again. I almost believe, too, she loved
him all the more every time. Then the last thing happened.
I thought now it must either break or bear.
The Lord, too, would not have him going about any
longer; and so he fell a little more heavily than I meant
him to do. I never saw him afterwards."</p>

<p>They sat silent for a while; then Baard went on:</p>

<p>"I once more made my offer. She said neither yes
nor no; but I thought she would like me better afterwards.
So we were married. The wedding was kept
down in the valley, at the house of one of her aunts,
whose property she inherited. We had plenty when
we started, and it has now increased. Our estates lay
side by side, and when we married they were thrown
into one, as I always, from a boy, thought they might be.
But many other things didn't turn out as I expected."
He was silent for several minutes; and Arne thought he
wept; but he did not.</p>

<p>"In the beginning of our married life, she was quiet<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" id="Page_102" title="[Pg 102]"></a>
and very sad. I had nothing to say to comfort her, and
so I was silent. Afterwards, she began sometimes to
take to these fidgeting ways which you have, I dare say,
noticed in her; yet it was a change, and so I said nothing
then, either. But one really happy day, I haven't
known ever since I was married, and that's now twenty
years...."</p>

<p>He broke the stick in two pieces; and then sat for a
while looking at them.</p>

<p>"When Eli grew bigger, I thought she would be
happier among strangers than at home. It was seldom
I wished to carry out my own will in anything, and
whenever I did, it generally turned out badly; so it was
in this case. The mother longed after her child, though
only the lake lay between them; and afterwards I saw,
too, that Eli's training at the parsonage was in some ways
not the right thing for her; but then it was too late: now
I think she likes neither father nor mother."</p>

<p>He had taken off his cap again; and now his long hair
hung down over his eyes; he stroked it back with both
hands, and put on his cap as if he were going away; but
when, as he was about to rise, he turned towards the
house, he checked himself and added, while looking up
at the bed-room window<span class="corr" title="was ,">.</span></p>

<p>"I thought it better that she and Mathilde shouldn't
see each other to say good-bye: that, too, was wrong. I
told her the wee bird was dead; for it was my fault, and
so I thought it better to confess; but that again was
wrong. And so it is with everything: I've always meant
to do for the best, but it has always turned out for the
worst; and now things have come to such a pass that
both wife and daughter speak ill of me, and I'm going
here lonely."</p>

<p>A servant-girl called out to them that the dinner was<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" id="Page_103" title="[Pg 103]"></a>
becoming cold. Baard rose. "I hear the horses neighing;
I think somebody has forgotten them," he said, and
went away to the stable to give them some hay.</p>

<p>Arne rose, too; he felt as if he hardly knew whether
Baard had been speaking or not.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII.<br />
<span class="italic">A GLIMPSE OF SPRING.</span></h2>


<p>Eli felt very weak after the illness. The mother
watched by her night and day, and never came
down-stairs; the father came up as usual, with his boots
off, and leaving his cap outside the door. Arne still
remained at the house. He and the father used to sit
together in the evening; and Arne began to like him
much, for Baard was a well-informed, deep-thinking
man, though he seemed afraid of saying what he knew.
In his own way, he, too, enjoyed Arne's company, for
Arne helped his thoughts and told him of things which
were new to him.</p>

<p>Eli soon began to sit up part of the day, and as she
recovered, she often took little fancies into her head.
Thus, one evening when Arne was sitting in the room
below, singing songs in a clear, loud voice, the mother
came down with a message from Eli, asking him if he
would go up-stairs and sing to her, that she might also
hear the words. It seemed as if he had been singing to
Eli all the time, for when the mother spoke he turned
red, and rose as if he would deny having done so, though
no one charged him with it. He soon collected himself,
however, and replied evasively, that he could sing so very
little. The mother said it did not seem so when he was
alone.</p>

<p>Arne yielded and went. He had not seen Eli since the
day he helped to carry her up-stairs; he thought she<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" id="Page_105" title="[Pg 105]"></a>
must be much altered, and he felt half afraid to see her.
But when he gently opened the door and went in, he
found the room quite dark, and he could see no one. He
stopped at the door-way.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" Eli asked in a clear, low voice.</p>

<p>"It's Arne Kampen," he said in a gentle, guarded tone,
so that his words might fall softly.</p>

<p>"It was very kind of you to come."</p>

<p>"How are you, Eli?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, I'm much better now."</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, Arne?" she added after a while,
and Arne felt his way to a chair at the foot of the bed.
"It did me good to hear you singing; won't you sing a
little to me up here?"</p>

<p>"If I only knew anything you would like."</p>

<p>She was silent a while: then she said, "Sing a hymn."
And he sang one: it was the confirmation hymn. When
he had finished he heard her weeping, and so he was
afraid to sing again; but in a little while she said, "Sing
one more." And he sang another: it was the one which
is generally sung while the catechumens are standing in
the aisle.</p>

<p>"How many things I've thought over while I've been
lying here," Eli said. He did not know what to answer;
and he heard her weeping again in the dark. A clock
that was ticking on the wall warned for striking, and
then struck. Eli breathed deeply several times, as if she
would lighten her breast, and then she said, "One knows
so little; I knew neither father nor mother. I haven't
been kind to them; and now it seems so sad to hear that
hymn."</p>

<p>When we talk in the darkness, we speak more faithfully
than when we see each other's face; and we also
say more.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" id="Page_106" title="[Pg 106]"></a>
"It does one good to hear you talk so," Arne replied,
just remembering what she had said when she was taken
ill.</p>

<p>She understood what he meant. "If now this had not
happened to me," she went on, "God only knows how
long I might have gone before I found mother."</p>

<p>"She has talked matters over with you lately, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, every day; she has done hardly anything else."</p>

<p>"Then, I'm sure you've heard many things."</p>

<p>"You may well say so."</p>

<p>"I think she spoke of my father?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"She remembers him still?"</p>

<p>"She remembers him."</p>

<p>"He wasn't kind to her."</p>

<p>"Poor mother!"</p>

<p>"Yet he was worst to himself."</p>

<p>They were silent; and Arne had thoughts which he
could not utter. Eli was the first to link their words
again.</p>

<p>"You are said to be like your father."</p>

<p>"People say so," he replied evasively.</p>

<p>She did not notice the tone of his voice, and so, after a
while she returned to the subject. "Could he, too, make
songs?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Sing a song to me ... one that you've made yourself."</p>

<p>"I have none," he said; for it was not his custom to
confess he had himself composed the songs he sang.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you have; and I'm sure, too, you'll sing one
of them when I ask you."</p>

<p>What he had never done for any one else, he now did
for her, as he sang the following song,<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" id="Page_107" title="[Pg 107]"></a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Tree's early leaf-buds were bursting their brown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Shall I take them away?' said the Frost, sweeping down.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">'No; leave them alone<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Till the blossoms have grown,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prayed the tree, while he trembled from rootlet to crown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Tree bore his blossoms, and all the birds sung:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Shall I take them away?' said the Wind, as he swung.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">'No; leave them alone<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Till the berries have grown,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the Tree, while his leaflets quivering hung.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Tree bore his fruit in the Midsummer glow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the girl, 'May I gather thy berries or no?'<br /></span>
<span class="i8">'Yes; all thou canst see;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Take them; all are for thee,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the Tree, while he bent down his laden boughs low."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That song nearly took her breath away. He, too,
remained silent after it, as though he had sung more
than he could say.</p>

<p>Darkness has a strong influence over those who are
sitting in it and dare not speak: they are never so near
each other as then. If she only turned on the pillow, or
moved her hand on the blanket, or breathed a little more
heavily, he heard it.</p>

<p>"Arne, couldn't you teach me to make songs?"</p>

<p>"Did you never try?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, these last few days; but I can't manage
it."</p>

<p>"What, then, did you wish to have in them?"</p>

<p>"Something about my mother, who loved your father
so dearly."</p>

<p>"That's a sad subject."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed it is; and I have wept over it."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't search for subjects; they come of
themselves."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" id="Page_108" title="[Pg 108]"></a>
"How do they come?"</p>

<p>"Just as other dear things come&mdash;unexpectedly."</p>

<p>They were both silent. "I wonder, Arne, you're longing
to go away; you who have such a world of beauty
within yourself."</p>

<p>"Do <em>you</em> know I am longing?"</p>

<p><span class="corr" title='" removed'></span>She did not answer, but lay still a few moments as if
in thought.</p>

<p>"Arne, you mustn't go away," she said; and the words
came warm to his heart.</p>

<p>"Well, sometimes I have less mind to go."</p>

<p>"Your mother must love you much, I'm sure. I must
see your mother."</p>

<p>"Go over to Kampen, when you're well again."</p>

<p>And all at once, he fancied her sitting in the bright
room at Kampen, looking out on the mountains; his
chest began to heave, and the blood rushed to his face.</p>

<p>"It's warm in here," he said, rising.</p>

<p>She heard him rise. "Are you going, Arne?" He
sat down again.</p>

<p>"You must come over to see us oftener; mother's so
fond of you."</p>

<p>"I should like to come myself, too; ... but still I
must have some errand."</p>

<p>Eli lay silent for a while, as if she was turning over
something in her mind. "I believe," she said, "mother
has something to ask you about."&nbsp;...</p>

<p>They both felt the room was becoming very hot; he
wiped his brow, and he heard her rise in the bed. No
sound could be heard either in the room or down-stairs,
save the ticking of the clock on the wall. There was no
moon, and the darkness was deep; when he looked
through the green window, it seemed to him as if he was
looking into a wood; when he looked towards Eli he<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" id="Page_109" title="[Pg 109]"></a>
could see nothing, but his thoughts went over to her, and
then his heart throbbed till he could himself hear its beating.
Before his eyes flickered bright sparks; in his ears
came a rushing sound; still faster throbbed his heart:
he felt he must rise or say something. But then she
exclaimed,</p>

<p>"How I wish it were summer!"</p>

<p>"That it were summer?" And he heard again the
sound of the cattle-bells, the horn from the mountains,
and the singing from the valleys; and saw the fresh
green foliage, the Swart-water glittering in the sunbeams,
the houses rocking in it, and Eli coming out and sitting
on the shore, just as she did that evening. "If it were
summer," she said, "and I were sitting on the hill, I
think I could sing a song."</p>

<p>He smiled gladly, and asked, "What would it be
about?"</p>

<p>"About something bright; about&mdash;well, I hardly
know what myself."&nbsp;...</p>

<p>"Tell me, Eli!" He rose in glad excitement; but, on
second thoughts, sat down again.</p>

<p>"No; not for all the world!" she said, laughing.</p>

<p>"I sang to you when you asked me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you did; but I can't tell you this; no!
no!"</p>

<p>"Eli, do you think I would laugh at the little verse you
have made?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think you would, Arne; but it isn't anything
I've made myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's by somebody else then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, you can surely say it to me."</p>

<p>"No, no, I can't; don't ask me again, Arne!"</p>

<p>The last words were almost inaudible; it seemed as if
she had hidden her head under the bedclothes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" id="Page_110" title="[Pg 110]"></a>
"Eli, now you're not kind to me as I was to you," he
said, rising.</p>

<p>"But, Arne, there's a difference ... you don't understand
me ... but it was ... I don't know ... another
time ... don't be offended with me, Arne! don't go
away from me!" She began to weep.</p>

<p>"Eli, what's the matter?" It came over him like sunshine.
"Are you ill?" Though he asked, he did not
believe she was. She still wept; he felt he must draw
nearer or go quite away. "Eli." He listened. "Eli."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She checked her weeping. But he did not know what
to say more, and was silent.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she whispered, half turning
towards him.</p>

<p>"It's something&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice trembled, and he stopped.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"You mustn't refuse ... I would ask you...."</p>

<p>"Is it the song?"</p>

<p>"No ... Eli, I wish so much...." He heard her
breathing fast and deeply ... "I wish so much ...
to hold one of your hands."</p>

<p>She did not answer; he listened intently&mdash;drew nearer,
and clasped a warm little hand which lay on the coverlet.</p>

<p>Then steps were heard coming up-stairs; they came
nearer and nearer; the door was opened; and Arne
unclasped his hand. It was the mother, who came in
with a light. "I think you're sitting too long in the
dark," she said, putting the candlestick on the table.
But neither Eli nor Arne could bear the light; she turned
her face to the pillow, and he shaded his eyes with his
hand. "Well, it pains a little at first, but it soon passes
off," said the mother.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" id="Page_111" title="[Pg 111]"></a>
Arne looked on the floor for something which he had
not dropped, and then went down-stairs.</p>

<p>The next day, he heard that Eli intended to come down
in the afternoon. He put his tools together, and said
good-bye. When she came down he had gone.</p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII.<br />
<span class="italic">MARGIT CONSULTS THE CLERGYMAN.</span></h2>


<p>Up between the mountains, the spring comes late.
The post, who in winter passes along the high-road
thrice a week, in April passes only once; and the
highlanders know then that outside, the snow is shovelled
away, the ice broken, the steamers are running, and the
plough is struck into the earth. Here, the snow still lies
six feet deep; the cattle low in their stalls; the birds
arrive, but feel cold and hide themselves. Occasionally
some traveller arrives, saying he has left his carriage
down in the valley; he brings flowers, which he examines;
he picked them by the wayside. The people
watch the advance of the season, talk over their matters,
and look up at the sun and round about, to see how much
he is able to do each day. They scatter ashes on the
snow, and think of those who are now picking flowers.</p>

<p>It was at this time of year, old Margit Kampen went
one day to the parsonage, and asked whether she might
speak to "father." She was invited into the study, where
the clergyman,&mdash;a slender, fair-haired, gentle-looking
man, with large eyes and spectacles,&mdash;received her kindly,
recognized her, and asked her to sit down.</p>

<p>"Is there something the matter with Arne again?" he
inquired, as if Arne had often been a subject of conversation
between them.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, yes! I haven't anything wrong to say
about him; but yet it's so sad," said Margit, looking
deeply grieved.</p>

<p>"Has that longing come back again!"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" id="Page_113" title="[Pg 113]"></a>
"Worse than ever. I can hardly think he'll even stay
with me till spring comes up here."</p>

<p>"But he has promised never to go away from you."</p>

<p>"That's true; but, dear me! he must now be his own
master; and if his mind's set upon going away, go, he
must. But whatever will become of me then?"</p>

<p>"Well, after all, I don't think he will leave you."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps not; but still, if he isn't happy at
home? am I then to have it upon my conscience that I
stand in his way? Sometimes I feel as if I ought even to
ask him to leave."</p>

<p>"How do you know he is longing now, more than
ever?"</p>

<p>"Oh,&mdash;by many things. Since the middle of the
winter, he hasn't worked out in the parish a single
day; but he has been to the town three times, and has
stayed a long while each time. He scarcely ever talks
now while he is at work, but he often used to do. He'll
sit for hours alone at the little up-stairs window, looking
towards the ravine, and away over the mountains; he'll
sit there all Sunday afternoon, and often when it's moonlight
he sits there till late in the night."</p>

<p>"Does he never read to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, he reads and sings to me every Sunday;
but he seems rather in a hurry, save now and then
when he gives almost too much of the thing."</p>

<p>"Does he never talk over matters with you then?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes; but it's so seldom that I sit and weep
alone between whiles. Then I dare say he notices it, for
he begins talking, but it's only about trifles; never about
anything serious."</p>

<p>The Clergyman walked up and down the room; then
he stopped and asked, "But why, then, don't you talk to
him about his matters?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" id="Page_114" title="[Pg 114]"></a>
For a long while she gave no answer; she sighed
several times, looked downwards and sideways, doubled
up her handkerchief, and at last said, "I've come here to
speak to you, father, about something that's a great
burden on my mind."</p>

<p>"Speak freely; it will relieve you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it will; for I've borne it alone now
these many years, and it grows heavier each year."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, my good Margit?"</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then she said, "I've greatly
sinned against my son."</p>

<p>She began weeping. The Clergyman came close to
her; "Confess it," he said; "and we will pray together
that it may be forgiven."</p>

<p>Margit sobbed and wiped her eyes, but began weeping
again when she tried to speak. The Clergyman tried to
comfort her, saying she could not have done anything
very sinful, she doubtless was too hard upon herself, and
so on. But Margit continued weeping, and could not
begin her confession till the Clergyman seated himself
by her side, and spoke still more encouragingly to her.
Then after a while she began, "The boy was ill-used
when a child; and so he got this mind for travelling.
Then he met with Christian&mdash;he who has grown so rich
over there where they dig gold. Christian gave him so
many books that he got quite a scholar; they used to
sit together in the long evenings; and when Christian
went away Arne wanted to go after him. But just at
that time, the father died, and the lad promised never to
leave me. But I was like a hen that's got a duck's egg
to brood; when my duckling had burst his shell, he
would go out on the wide water, and I was left on the
bank, calling after him. If he didn't go away himself,
yet his heart went away in his songs, and every morning
I expected to find his bed empty.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" id="Page_115" title="[Pg 115]"></a>
"Then a letter from foreign parts came for him, and I
felt sure it must be from Christian. God forgive me, but
I kept it back! I thought there would be no more, but
another came; and, as I had kept the first, I thought I
must keep the second, too. But, dear me! it seemed as
if they would burn a hole through the box where I had
put them; and my thoughts were there from as soon as I
opened my eyes in the morning till late at night when I
shut them. And then,&mdash;did you ever hear of anything
worse!&mdash;a third letter came. I held it in my hand a
quarter of an hour; I kept it in my bosom three days,
weighing in my mind whether I should give it to him or
put it with the others; but then I thought perhaps it
would lure him away from me, and so I couldn't help
putting it with the others. But now I felt miserable
every day, not only about the letters in the box, but also
for fear another might come. I was afraid of everybody
who came to the house; when we were sitting together
inside, I trembled whenever I heard the door go, for fear
it might be somebody with a letter, and then he might
get it. When he was away in the parish, I went about at
home thinking he might perhaps get a letter while there,
and then it would tell him about those that had already
come. When I saw him coming home, I used to look at
his face while he was yet a long way off, and, oh, dear!
how happy I felt when he smiled; for then I knew he
had got no letter. He had grown so handsome; like his
father, only fairer, and more gentle-looking. And, then,
he had such a voice; when he sat at the door in the
evening-sun, singing towards the mountain ridge, and
listening to the echo, I felt that live without him. I never
could. If I only saw him, or knew he was somewhere
near, and he seemed pretty happy, and would only give
me a word now and then, I wanted nothing more on
earth, and I wouldn't have shed one tear less.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" id="Page_116" title="[Pg 116]"></a>
"But just when he seemed to be getting on better with
people, and felt happier among them, there came a message
from the post-office that a fourth letter had come;
and in it were two hundred dollars! I thought I should
have fell flat down where I stood: what could I do?
The letter, I might get rid of, 'twas true; but the money?
For two or three nights I couldn't sleep for it; a little
while I left it up-stairs, then, in the cellar behind a barrel,
and once I was so overdone that I laid it in the window
so that he might find it. But when I heard him coming,
I took it back again. At last, however, I found a way:
I gave him the money and told him it had been put out
at interest in my mother's lifetime. He laid it out upon
the land, just as I thought he would; and so it wasn't
wasted. But that same harvest-time, when he was sitting
at home one evening, he began talking about Christian,
and wondering why he had so clean forgotten him.</p>

<p>"Now again the wound opened, and the money burned
me so that I was obliged to go out of the room. I had
sinned, and yet my sin had answered no end. Since
then, I have hardly dared to look into his eyes, blessed as
they are.</p>

<p>"The mother who has sinned against her own child is
the most miserable of all mothers; ... and yet I did it
only out of love.... And so, I dare say, I shall be punished
accordingly by the loss of what I love most. For
since the middle of the winter, he has again taken to
singing the tune that he used to sing when he was longing
to go away; he has sung it ever since he was a lad,
and whenever I hear it I grow pale. Then I feel I could
give up all for him; and only see this." She took from
her bosom a piece of paper, unfolded it and gave it to
the Clergyman. "He now and then writes something
here; I think it's some words to that tune.... I brought<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" id="Page_117" title="[Pg 117]"></a>
it with me; for I can't myself read such small writing
... will you look and see if there isn't something written
about his going away...."</p>

<p>There was only one whole verse on the paper. For
the second verse, there were only a few half-finished lines,
as if the song was one he had forgotten, and was now
coming into his memory again, line by line. The first
verse ran thus,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What shall I see if I ever go<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Over the mountains high?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I can see but the peaks of snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowning the cliffs where the pine trees grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Waiting and longing to rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearer the beckoning skies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Is there anything about his going away?" asked Margit.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is about that," replied the Clergyman, putting
the paper down.</p>

<p>"Wasn't I sure of it! Ah me! I knew the tune!"
She sat with folded hands, looking intently and anxiously
into the Clergyman's face, while tear after tear fell down
her cheeks.</p>

<p>The Clergyman knew no more what to do in the matter
than she did. "Well, I think the lad must be left
alone in this case," he said. "Life can't be made different
for his sake; but what he will find in it must depend
upon himself; now, it seems, he wishes to go away in
search of life's good."</p>

<p>"But isn't that just what the old crone did?"</p>

<p>"The old crone?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she who went away to fetch the sunshine, instead
of making windows in the wall to let it in."</p>

<p>The Clergyman was much astonished at Margit's
words, and so he had been before, when she came speak<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" id="Page_118" title="[Pg 118]"></a>
to him on this subject; but, indeed, she had thought of
hardly anything else for eight years.</p>

<p>"Do you think he'll go away? what am I to do? and
the money? and the letters?" All these questions
crowded upon her at once.</p>

<p>"Well, as to the letters, that wasn't quite right. Keeping
back what belonged to your son, can't be justified.
But it was still worse to make a fellow Christian appear
in a bad light when he didn't deserve it; and especially
as he was one whom Arne was so fond of, and who loved
him so dearly in return. But we will pray God to forgive
you; we will both pray."</p>

<p>Margit still sat with her hands folded, and her head
bent down.</p>

<p>"How I should pray him to forgive me, if I only knew
he would stay!" she said: surely, she was confounding
our Lord with Arne. The Clergyman, however, appeared
as if he did not notice it.</p>

<p>"Do you intend to confess it to him directly?" he
asked.</p>

<p>She looked down, and said in a low voice, "I should
much like to wait a little if I dared."</p>

<p>The Clergyman turned aside with a smile, and asked,
"Don't you believe your sin becomes greater, the longer
you delay confessing it?"</p>

<p>She pulled her handkerchief about with both hands,
folded it into a very small square, and tried to fold it into
a still smaller one, but could not.</p>

<p>"If I confess about the letters, I'm afraid he'll go
away."</p>

<p>"Then, you dare not rely upon our Lord?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I do, indeed," she said hurriedly; and then
she added in a low voice, "but still, if he were to go
away from me?"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" id="Page_119" title="[Pg 119]"></a>
"Then, I see you are more afraid of his going away
than of continuing to sin?"</p>

<p>Margit had unfolded her handkerchief again; and now
she put it to her eyes, for she began weeping. The Clergyman
remained for a while looking at her silently; then
he went on, "Why, then, did you tell me all this, if it
was not to lead to anything?" He waited long, but she
did not answer. "Perhaps you thought your sin would
become less when you had confessed it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," she said, almost in a whisper, while her
head bent still lower upon her breast.</p>

<p>The Clergyman smiled and rose. "Well, well, my
good Margit, take courage; I hope all will yet turn out
for the best."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she asked, looking up; and a sad
smile passed over her tear-marked face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; I believe God will no longer try you.
You will have joy in your old age, I am sure."</p>

<p>"If I might only keep the joy I have!" she said; and
the Clergyman thought she seemed unable to fancy any
greater happiness than living in that constant anxiety.
He smiled and filled his pipe.</p>

<p>"If we had but a little girl, now, who could take hold
on him, then I'm sure he would stay."</p>

<p>"You may be sure I've thought of that," she said,
shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Well, there's Eli Böen; she might be one who would
please him."</p>

<p>"You may be sure I've thought of that." She rocked
the upper part of her body backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>"If we could contrive that they might oftener see each
other here at the parsonage?"</p>

<p>"You may be sure I've thought of that!" She
clapped her hands and looked at the Clergyman with a<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" id="Page_120" title="[Pg 120]"></a>
smile all over her face. He stopped while he was lighting
his pipe.</p>

<p>"Perhaps this, after all, was what brought you here
to-day?"</p>

<p>She looked down, put two fingers into the folded
handkerchief, and pulled out one corner of it.</p>

<p>"Ah, well, God help me, perhaps it was this I wanted."</p>

<p>The Clergyman walked up and down, and smiled.
"Perhaps, too, you came for the same thing the last time
you were here?"</p>

<p>She pulled out the corner of the handkerchief still
farther, and hesitated awhile. "Well, as you ask me,
perhaps I did&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>The Clergyman went on smoking. "Then, too, it was
to carry this point that you confessed at last the thing you
had on your conscience."</p>

<p>She spread out the handkerchief to fold it up smoothly
again. "No; ah, no; that weighed so heavily upon me,
I felt I must tell it to you, father."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my dear Margit, we will talk no more
about it."</p>

<p>Then, while he was walking up and down, he suddenly
added, "Do you think you would of yourself have come
out to me with this wish of yours?"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;I had already come out with so much, that I
dare say this, too, would have come out at last."</p>

<p>The Clergyman laughed, but he did not tell her what
he thought. After a while he stood still. "Well, we
will manage this matter for you, Margit," he said.</p>

<p>"God bless you for it!" She rose to go, for she understood
he had now said all he wished to say.</p>

<p>"And we will look after them a little."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to thank you enough," she said,
taking his hand and courtesying.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" id="Page_121" title="[Pg 121]"></a>
"God be with you!" he replied.</p>

<p>She wiped her eyes with the handkerchief, went towards
the door, courtesied again, and said, "Good bye,"
while she slowly opened and shut it. But so lightly as
she went towards Kampen that day, she had not gone for
many, many years. When she had come far enough to
see the thick smoke curling up cheerfully from the chimney,
she blessed the house, the whole place, the Clergyman
and Arne,&mdash;and remembered they were going to
have her favorite dish, smoked ham, for dinner.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV.<br />
<span class="italic">FINDING A LOST SONG.</span></h2>


<p>Kampen was a beautiful place. It was situated in
the middle of a plain, bordered on the one side by
a ravine, and on the other, by the high-road; just beyond
the road was a thick wood, with a mountain ridge rising
behind it, while high above all stood blue mountains
crowned with snow. On the other side of the ravine
also was a wide range of mountains, running round the
Swart-water on the side where Böen was situated: it
grew higher as it ran towards Kampen, but then turned
suddenly sidewards, forming the broad valley called the
Lower-tract, which began here, for Kampen was the last
place in the Upper-tract.</p>

<p>The front door of the dwelling-house opened towards
the road, which was about two thousand paces off, and a
path with leafy birch-trees on both sides led thither. In
front of the house was a little garden, which Arne managed
according to the rules given in his books. The cattle-houses
and barns were nearly all new-built, and stood to
the left hand, forming a square. The house was two
stories high, and was painted red, with white window-frames
and doors; the roof was of turf with many small
plants growing upon it, and on the ridge was a vane-spindle,
where turned an iron cock with a high raised
tail.</p>

<p>Spring had come to the mountain-tracts. It was Sunday
morning; the weather was mild and calm, but the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" id="Page_123" title="[Pg 123]"></a>
air was somewhat heavy, and the mist lay low on the
forest, though Margit said it would rise later in the day.
Arne had read the sermon, and sung the hymns to his
mother, and he felt better for them himself. Now he
stood ready dressed to go to the parsonage. When he
opened the door the fresh smell of the leaves met him;
the garden lay dewy and bright in the morning breeze,
but from the ravine sounded the roaring of the waterfall,
now in lower, then again in louder booms, till all around
seemed to tremble.</p>

<p>Arne walked upwards. As he went farther from the
fall, its booming became less awful, and soon it lay over
the landscape like the deep tones of an organ.</p>

<p>"God be with him wherever he goes!" the mother
said, opening the window and looking after him till he
disappeared behind the shrubs. The mist had gradually
risen, the sun shone bright, the fields and garden became
full of fresh life, and the things Arne had sown and
tended grew and sent up odor and gladness to his
mother. "Spring is beautiful to those who have had a
long winter," she said, looking away over the fields, as
if in thought.</p>

<p>Arne had no positive errand at the parsonage, but he
thought he might go there to ask about the newspapers
which he shared with the Clergyman. Recently he had
read the names of several Norwegians who had been
successful in gold digging in America, and among them
was Christian. His relations had long since left the
place, but Arne had lately heard a rumor that they expected
him to come home soon. About this, also, Arne
thought he might hear at the parsonage; and if Christian
had already returned, he would go down and see him
between spring and hay-harvest. These thoughts occupied
his mind till he came far enough to see the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" id="Page_124" title="[Pg 124]"></a>
Swart-water and Böen on the other side. There, too,
the mist had risen, but it lay lingering on the mountain-sides,
while their peaks rose clear above, and the sunbeams
played on the plain; on the right hand, the
shadow of the wood darkened the water, but before
the houses the lake had strewed its white sand on the
flat shore. All at once, Arne fancied himself in the red-painted
house with the white doors and windows, which
he had taken as a model for his own. He did not think of
those first gloomy days he had passed there, but only
of that summer they both saw&mdash;he and Eli&mdash;up beside
her sick-bed. He had not been there since; nor would
he have gone for the whole world. If his thoughts but
touched on that time, he turned crimson; yet he thought
of it many times a day; and if anything could have driven
him away from the parish, it was this.</p>

<p>He strode onwards, as if to flee from his thoughts; but
the farther he went, the nearer he came to Böen, and
the more he looked at it. The mist had disappeared, the
sky shone bright between the frame of mountains, the
birds floated in the sunny air, calling to each other, and
the fields laughed with millions of flowers; here no
thundering waterfall bowed the gladness to submissive
awe, but full of life it gambolled and sang without check
or pause.</p>

<p>Arne walked till he became glowing hot; then he
threw himself down on the grass beneath the shadow of
a hill and looked towards Böen, but he soon turned away
again to avoid seeing it. Then he heard a song above
him, so wonderfully clear as he had never heard a song
before. It came floating over the meadows, mingled
with the chattering of the birds, and he had scarcely
recognized the tune ere he recognized the words also:
the tune was the one he loved better than any; the words<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" id="Page_125" title="[Pg 125]"></a>
were those he had borne in his mind ever since he was a
boy, and had forgotten that same day they were brought
forth. He sprang up as if he would catch them, but
then stopped and listened while verse after verse came
streaming down to him:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Arne stood listening till the sound of the last verse, the
last words died away; then he heard the birds sing and
play again, but he dared not move. Yet he must find
out who had been singing, and he lifted his foot and
walked on, so carefully that he did not hear the grass
rustle. A little butterfly settled on a flower at his feet,
flew up and settled a little way before him, flew up and
settled again, and so on all over the hill. But soon he
came to a thick bush and stopped; for a bird flew out
of it with a frightened "quitt, quitt!" and rushed away
over the sloping hill-side. Then she who was sitting
there looked up; Arne stooped low down, his heart
throbbed till he heard its beats, he held his breath,
and was afraid to stir a leaf; for it was Eli whom he
saw.</p>

<p>After a long while he ventured to look up again; he<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" id="Page_127" title="[Pg 127]"></a>
wished to draw nearer, but he thought the bird perhaps
had its nest under the bush, and he was afraid he might
tread on it. Then he peeped between the leaves as they
blew aside and closed again. The sun shone full upon
her. She wore a close-fitting black dress with long
white sleeves, and a straw hat like those worn by boys.
In her lap a book was lying with a heap of wild flowers
upon it; her right hand was listlessly playing with them
as if she were in thought, and her left supported her
head. She was looking away towards the place where
the bird had flown, and she seemed as if she had been
weeping.</p>

<p>Anything more beautiful, Arne had never seen or
dreamed of in all his life; the sun, too, had spread its
gold over her and the place; and the song still hovered
round her, so that Arne thought, breathed&mdash;nay, even his
heart beat, in time with it. It seemed so strange that the
song which bore all his longing, <em>he</em> had forgotten, but <em>she</em>
had found.</p>

<p>A tawny wasp flew round her in circles many times,
till at last she saw it and frightened it away with a
flower-stalk, which she put up as often as it came before
her. Then she took up the book and opened it, but she
soon closed it again, sat as before, and began to hum
another song. He could hear it was "The Tree's early
leaf-buds," though she often made mistakes, as if she did
not quite remember either the words or the tune. The
verse she knew best was the last one, and so she often
repeated it; but she sang it thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Tree bore his berries, so mellow and red:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'May I gather thy berries?' a sweet maiden said.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Yes; all thou canst see;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Take them; all are for thee.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the Tree&mdash;trala&mdash;lala, trala, lala&mdash;said."<br /></span>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" id="Page_128" title="[Pg 128]"></a></div></div>

<p>Then she suddenly sprang up, scattering all the flowers
around her, and sang till the tune trembled through the
air, and might have been heard at Böen. Arne had
thought of coming forwards when she began singing;
he was just about to do so when she jumped up; then he
felt he <em>must</em> come, but she went away. Should he call?
No,&mdash;yes! No!&mdash;There she skipped over the hillocks
singing; here her hat fell off, there she took it up again;
here she picked a flower, there she stood deep in the
highest grass.</p>

<p>"Shall I call? She's looking up here!"</p>

<p>He stooped down. It was a long while ere he ventured
to peep out again; at first he only raised his head;
he could not see her: he rose to his knees; still he could
not see her: he stood upright; no she was gone. He
thought himself a miserable fellow; and some of the
tales he had heard at the nutting-party came into his
mind.</p>

<p>Now he would not go to the parsonage. He would
not have the newspapers; would not know anything
about Christian. He would not go home; he would go
nowhere; he would do nothing.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, I am so unhappy!" he said.</p>

<p>He sprang up again and sang "The Tree's early leaf-buds"
till the mountains resounded.</p>

<p>Then he sat down where she had been sitting, and
took up the flowers she had picked, but he flung them
away again down the hill on every side. Then he wept.
It was long since he had done so; this struck him, and
made him weep still more. He would go far away, that
he would; no, he would not go away! He thought he was
very unhappy; but when he asked himself why, he could
hardly tell. He looked round. It was a lovely day; and
the Sabbath rest lay over all. The lake was without a<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" id="Page_129" title="[Pg 129]"></a>
ripple; from the houses the curling smoke had begun to
rise; the partridges one after another had ceased calling,
and though the little birds continued their twittering, they
went towards the shade of the wood; the dewdrops were
gone, and the grass looked grave; not a breath of wind
stirred the drooping leaves; and the sun was near the
meridian. Almost before he knew, he found himself
seated putting together a little song; a sweet tune offered
itself for it; and while his heart was strangely full of
gentle feelings, the tune went and came till words linked
themselves to it and begged to be sung, if only for once.</p>

<p>He sang them gently, sitting where Eli had sat:</p>

<span class="italic">SOMEBODY'S FUTURE HOME.</span></h2>


<p>"Good bye," said Margit at the Clergyman's door.
It was a Sunday evening in advancing summer-time;
the Clergyman had returned from church, and
Margit had been sitting with him till now, when it was
seven o'clock. "Good bye, Margit," said the Clergyman.
She hurried down the door-steps and into the yard; for
she had seen Eli Böen playing there with her brother and
the Clergyman's son.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said Margit, stopping; "and God
bless you all."</p>

<p>"Good evening," answered Eli. She blushed crimson
and wanted to leave off the game; the boys begged her
to keep on, but she persuaded them to let her go for that
evening.</p>

<p>"I almost think I know you," said Margit.</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"Isn't it Eli Böen?"</p>

<p>Yes, it was.</p>

<p>"Dear me! you're Eli Böen; yes, now I see you're
like your mother."</p>

<p>Eli's auburn hair had come unfastened, and hung down
over her neck and shoulders; she was hot and as red as
a cherry, her bosom fluttered up and down, and she could
scarcely speak, but laughed because she was so out of
breath.</p>

<p>"Well, young folks should be merry," said Margit, feeling<a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" id="Page_132" title="[Pg 132]"></a>
happy as she looked at her. "P'r'aps you don't know
me?"</p>

<p>If Margit had not been her senior, Eli would probably
have asked her name, but now she only said she did not
remember having seen her before.</p>

<p>"No; I dare say not: old folks don't go out much.
But my son, p'r'aps you know a little&mdash;Arne Kampen;
I'm his mother," said Margit, with a stolen glance at Eli,
who suddenly looked grave and breathed slowly. "I'm
pretty sure he worked at Böen once."</p>

<p>Yes, Eli thought he did.</p>

<p>"It's a fine evening; we turned our hay this morning,
and got it in before I came away; it's good weather
indeed for everything."</p>

<p>"There will be a good hay-harvest this year," Eli
suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, you may well say that; everything's getting on
well at Böen, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"We have got in all our hay."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I dare say you have; your folks work well,
and they have plenty of help. Are you going home to-night?"</p>

<p>No, she was not.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you go a little way with me? I so seldom
have anybody to talk to; and it will be all the same to
you, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Eli excused herself, saying she had not her jacket on.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a shame to ask such a thing the first time
of seeing anybody; but one must put up with old folks'
ways."</p>

<p>Eli said she would go; she would only fetch her jacket
first.</p>

<p>It was a close-fitting jacket, which when fastened
looked like a dress with a bodice; but now she fastened<a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" id="Page_133" title="[Pg 133]"></a>
only two of the lower hooks, because she was so hot.
Her fine linen bodice had a little turned-down collar,
and was fastened with a silver stud in the shape of a bird
with spread wings. Just such a one, Nils, the tailor,
wore the first time Margit danced with him.</p>

<p>"A pretty stud," she said, looking at it.</p>

<p>"Mother gave it me."</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought so," Margit said, helping her with the
jacket.</p>

<p>They walked onwards over the fields. The hay was
lying in heaps; and Margit took up a handful, smelled
it, and thought it was very good. She asked about the
cattle at the parsonage, and this led her to ask also about
the live stock at Böen, and then she told how much they
had at Kampen. "The farm has improved very much
these last few years, and it can still be made twice as
large. He keeps twelve milch-cows now, and he could
keep several more, but he reads so many books and
manages according to them, and so he will have the cows
fed in such a first-rate way."</p>

<p>Eli, as might be expected, said nothing to all this; and
Margit then asked her age. She was above twenty.</p>

<p>"Have you helped in the house-work? Not much, I
dare say&mdash;you look so spruce."</p>

<p>Yes, she had helped a good deal, especially of late.</p>

<p>"Well, it's best to use one's self to do a little of everything;
when one gets a large house of one's own, there's
a great deal to be done. But, of course, when one finds
good help already in the house before her, why, it doesn't
matter so much."</p>

<p>Now Eli thought she must go back; for they had gone
a long way beyond the grounds of the parsonage.</p>

<p>"It still wants some hours to sunset; it would be kind
it you would chat a little longer with me." And Eli
went on.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" id="Page_134" title="[Pg 134]"></a>
Then Margit began to talk about Arne. "I don't
know if you know much of him. He could teach you
something about everything, he could; dear me, what a
deal he has read!"</p>

<p>Eli owned she knew he had read a great deal.</p>

<p>"Yes; and that's only the least thing that can be said
of him; but the way he has behaved to his mother all
his days, that's something more, that is. If the old saying
is true, that he who's good to his mother is good to
his wife, the one Arne chooses won't have much to complain
of."</p>

<p>Eli asked why they had painted the house before them
with grey paint.</p>

<p>"Ah, I suppose they had no other; I only wish Arne
may sometime be rewarded for all his kindness to his
mother. When he has a wife, she ought to be kind-hearted
as well as a good scholar. What are you looking
for, child?"</p>

<p>"I only dropped a little twig I had."</p>

<p>"Dear me! I think of a many things, you may be sure,
while I sit alone in yonder wood. If ever he takes home
a wife who brings blessings to house and man, then I
know many a poor soul will be glad that day."</p>

<p>They were both silent, and walked on without looking
at each other; but soon Eli stopped.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"One of my shoe-strings has come down."</p>

<p>Margit waited a long while till at last the string was
tied.</p>

<p>"He has such queer ways," she began again; "he got
cowed while he was a child, and so he has got into the
way of thinking over everything by himself, and those
sort of folks haven't courage to come forward."</p>

<p>Now Eli must indeed go back, but Margit said that<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" id="Page_135" title="[Pg 135]"></a>
Kampen was only half a mile off; indeed, not so far, and
that Eli must see it, as too she was so near. But Eli
thought it would be late that day.</p>

<p>"There'll be sure to be somebody to bring you home."</p>

<p>"No, no," Eli answered quickly, and would go back.</p>

<p>"Arne's not at home, it's true," said Margit; "but
there's sure to be somebody else about;" and Eli had
now less objection to it.</p>

<p>"If only I shall not be too late," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, if we stand here much longer talking about it,
it may be too late, I dare say." And they went on.
"Being brought up at the Clergyman's, you've read a
great deal, I dare say?"</p>

<p>Yes, she had.</p>

<p>"It'll be of good use when you have a husband who
knows less."</p>

<p>No; that, Eli thought she would never have.</p>

<p>"Well, no; p'r'aps, after all, it isn't the best thing;
but still folks about here haven't much learning."</p>

<p>Eli asked if it was Kampen, she could see straight
before her.</p>

<p>"No; that's Gransetren, the next place to the wood;
when we come farther up you'll see Kampen. It's a
pleasant place to live at, is Kampen, you may be sure; it
seems a little out of the way, it's true; but that doesn't
matter much, after all."</p>

<p>Eli asked what made the smoke that rose from the
wood.</p>

<p>"It comes from a houseman's cottage, belonging to
Kampen: a man named Opplands-Knut lives there. He
went about lonely till Arne gave him that piece of
land to clear. Poor Arne! he knows what it is to be
lonely."</p>

<p>Soon they came far enough to see Kampen.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" id="Page_136" title="[Pg 136]"></a>
"Is that Kampen?" asked Eli, standing still and
pointing.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," said the mother; and she, too, stood still.
The sun shone full in their faces, and they shaded their
eyes as they looked down over the plain. In the middle
of it stood the red-painted house with its white window-frames;
rich green cornfields lay between the pale new-mown
meadows, where some of the hay was already set
in stacks; near the cow-house, all was life and stir; the
cows, sheep and goats were coming home; their bells
tinkled, the dogs barked, and the milkmaids called; while
high above all, rose the grand tune of the waterfall from
the ravine. The farther Eli went, the more this filled her
ears, till at last it seemed quite awful to her; it whizzed
and roared through her head, her heart throbbed violently,
and she became bewildered and dizzy, and then
felt so subdued that she unconsciously began to walk with
such small timid steps that Margit begged her to come
on a little faster. She started. "I never heard anything
like that fall," she said; "I'm quite frightened."</p>

<p>"You'll soon get used to it; and at last you'll even
miss it."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Well, you'll see." And Margit smiled.</p>

<p>"Come, now, we'll first look at the cattle," she said,
turning downwards from the road, into the path. "Those
trees on each side, Nils planted; he wanted to have
everything nice, did Nils; and so does Arne; look,
there's the garden he has laid out."</p>

<p>"Oh, how pretty!" exclaimed Eli, going quickly
towards the garden fence.</p>

<p>"We'll look at that by-and-by," said Margit; "now
we must go over to look at the creatures before they're
locked in&mdash;" But Eli did not hear, for all her mind was<a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" id="Page_137" title="[Pg 137]"></a>
turned to the garden. She stood looking at it till Margit
called her once more; as she came along, she gave a furtive
glance through the windows; but she could see no
one inside.</p>

<p>They both went upon the barn steps and looked down
at the cows, as they passed lowing into the cattle-house.
Margit named them one by one to Eli, and told her how
much milk each gave, and which would calve in the summer,
and which would not. The sheep were counted and
penned in; they were of a large foreign breed, raised
from two lambs which Arne had got from the South.
"He aims at all such things," said Margit, "though one
wouldn't think it of him." Then they went into the
barn, and looked at some hay which had been brought in,
and Eli had to smell it; "for such hay isn't to be found
everywhere," Margit said. She pointed from the barn-hatch
to the fields, and told what kind of seed was sown
on them, and how much of each kind. "No less than
three fields are new-cleared, and now, this first year,
they're set with potatoes, just for the sake of the ground;
over there, too, the land's new-cleared, but I suppose that
soil's different, for there he has sown barley; but then he
has strewed burnt turf over it for manure, for he attends
to all such things. Well, she that comes here will find
things in good order, I'm sure." Now they went out
towards the dwelling-house; and Eli, who had answered
nothing to all that Margit had told her about other things,
when they passed the garden asked if she might go into
it; and when she got leave to go, she begged to pick a
flower or two. Away in one corner was a little garden-seat;
she went over and sat down upon it&mdash;perhaps only
to try it, for she rose directly.</p>

<p>"Now we must make haste, else we shall be too late,"
said Margit, as she stood at the house-door. Then they<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" id="Page_138" title="[Pg 138]"></a>
went in. Margit asked if Eli would not take some
refreshment, as this was the first time she had been at
Kampen; but Eli turned red and quickly refused. Then
they looked round the room, which was the one Arne
and the mother generally used in the day-time; it was
not very large, but cosy and pleasant, with windows looking
out on the road. There were a clock and a stove;
and on the wall hung Nils' fiddle, old and dark, but with
new strings; beside it hung some guns belonging to
Arne, English fishing-tackle and other rare things, which
the mother took down and showed to Eli, who looked at
them and touched them. The room was without painting,
for this Arne did not like; neither was there any in
the large pretty room which looked towards the ravine,
with the green mountains on the other side, and the blue
peaks in the background. But the two smaller rooms in
the wing were both painted; for in them the mother
would live when she became old, and Arne brought a
wife into the house: Margit was very fond of painting,
and so in these rooms the ceilings were painted with
roses, and her name was painted on the cupboards, the
bedsteads, and on all reasonable and unreasonable places;
for it was Arne himself who had done it. They went
into the kitchen, the store-room, and the bake-house;
and now they had only to go into the up-stairs rooms;
"all the best things were there," the mother said.</p>

<p>These were comfortable rooms, corresponding with
those below, but they were new and not yet taken into
use, save one which looked towards the ravine. In them
hung and stood all sorts of household things not in every-day
use. Here hung a lot of fur coverlets and other bedclothes;
and the mother took hold of them and lifted
them; so did Eli, who looked at all of them with
pleasure, examined some of them twice, and asked<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" id="Page_139" title="[Pg 139]"></a>
questions about them, growing all the while more interested.</p>

<p>"Now we'll find the key of Arne's room," said the
mother, taking it from under a chest where it was hidden.
They went into the room; it looked towards the ravine;
and once more the awful booming of the waterfall met
their ears, for the window was open. They could see
the spray rising between the cliffs, but not the fall itself,
save in one place farther up, where a huge fragment of
rock had fallen into it just where the torrent came in full
force to take its last leap into the depths below. The
upper side of this fragment was covered with fresh sod;
and a few pine-cones had dug themselves into it, and
had grown up to trees, rooted into the crevices. The wind
had shaken and twisted them; and the fall had dashed
against them, so that they had not a sprig lower than
eight feet from their roots: they were gnarled and bent;
yet they stood, rising high between the rocky walls.
When Eli looked out from the window, these trees first
caught her eye; next, she saw the snowy peaks rising far
beyond behind the green mountains. Then her eyes
passed over the quiet fertile fields back to the room; and
the first thing she saw there was a large bookshelf.
There were so many books on it that she scarcely believed
the Clergyman had more. Beneath it was a cupboard,
where Arne kept his money. The mother said
money had been left to them twice already, and if everything
went right they would have some more. "But,
after all, money's not the best thing in the world; he may
get what's better still," she added.</p>

<p>There were many little things in the cupboard which
were amusing to see, and Eli looked at them all, happy
as a child. Then the mother showed her a large chest
where Arne's clothes lay, and they, too, were taken out<a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" id="Page_140" title="[Pg 140]"></a>
and looked at. Margit patted Eli on the shoulder.
"I've never seen you till to-day, and yet I'm already so
fond of you, my child," she said, looking affectionately
into her eyes. Eli had scarcely time to feel a little bashful,
before Margit pulled her by the hand and said in a
low voice, "Look at that little red chest; there's something
very choice in that, you may be sure."</p>

<p>Eli glanced towards the chest: it was a little square
one, which she thought she would very much like to
have.</p>

<p>"He doesn't want me to know what's in that chest,"
the mother whispered; "and he always hides the key."
She went to some clothes that hung on the wall, took
down a velvet waistcoat, looked in the pocket, and there
found the key.</p>

<p>"Now come and look," she whispered; and they went
gently, and knelt down before the chest. As soon as the
mother opened it, so sweet an odor met them that Eli
clapped her hands even before she had seen anything.
On the top was spread a handkerchief, which the mother
took away. "Here, look," she whispered, taking out a
fine black silk neckerchief such as men do not wear. "It
looks just as if it was meant for a girl," the mother said.
Eli spread it upon her lap and looked at it, but did not say
a word. "Here's one more," the mother said. Eli could
not help taking it up; and then the mother insisted upon
trying it on her, though Eli drew back and held her head
down. She did not know what she would not have given
for such a neckerchief; but she thought of something more
than that. They folded them up again, but slowly.</p>

<p>"Now, look here," the mother said, taking out some
handsome ribands. "Everything seems as if it was for
a girl." Eli blushed crimson, but she said nothing.
"There's some more things yet," said the mother, taking<a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" id="Page_141" title="[Pg 141]"></a>
out some fine black cloth for a dress; "it's fine, I dare
say," she added, holding it up to the light. Eli's hands
trembled, her chest heaved, she felt the blood rushing to
her head, and she would fain have turned away, but that
she could not well do.</p>

<p>"He has bought something every time he has been to
town," continued the mother. Eli could scarcely bear it
any longer; she looked from one thing to another in the
chest, and then again at the cloth, and her face burned.
The next thing the mother took out was wrapped in
paper; they unwrapped it, and found a small pair of
shoes. Anything like them, they had never seen, and
the mother wondered how they could be made. Eli said
nothing; but when she touched the shoes her fingers left
warm marks on them. "I'm hot, I think," she whispered.
The mother put all the things carefully together.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it seem just as if he had bought them all,
one after another, for somebody he was afraid to give
them to?" she said, looking at Eli. "He has kept them
here in this chest&mdash;so long." She laid them all in the
chest again, just as they were before. "Now we'll see
what's here in the compartment," she said, opening the
lid carefully, as if she were now going to show Eli something
specially beautiful.</p>

<p>When Eli looked she saw first a broad buckle for a
waistband, next, two gold rings tied together, and a
hymn-book bound in velvet and with silver clasps; but
then she saw nothing more, for on the silver of the book
she had seen graven in small letters, "Eli Baardsdatter
Böen."</p>

<p>The mother wished her to look at something else; she
got no answer, but saw tear after tear dropping down
upon the silk neckerchief and spreading over it. She<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" id="Page_142" title="[Pg 142]"></a>
put down the <i>sylgje</i><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> which she had in her hand, shut
the lid, turned round and drew Eli to her. Then the
daughter wept upon her breast, and the mother wept
over her, without either of them saying any more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A little while after, Eli walked by herself in the garden,
while the mother was in the kitchen preparing
something nice for supper; for now Arne would soon be
at home. Then she came out in the garden to Eli, who
sat tracing names on the sand with a stick. When she
saw Margit, she smoothed the sand down over them,
looked up and smiled; but she had been weeping.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to cry about, my child," said Margit,
caressing her; "supper's ready now; and here comes
Arne," she added, as a black figure appeared on the road
between the shrubs.</p>

<p>Eli stole in, and the mother followed her. The supper-table
was nicely spread with dried meat, cakes and cream
porridge; Eli did not look at it, however, but went away
to a corner near the clock and sat down on a chair close
to the wall, trembling at every sound. The mother
stood by the table. Firm steps were heard on the flagstones,
and a short, light step in the passage, the door
was gently opened, and Arne came in.</p>

<p>The first thing he saw was Eli in the corner; he left
hold on the door and stood still. This made Eli feel yet
more confused; she rose, but then felt sorry she had done
so, and turned aside towards the wall.</p>

<p>"Are you here?" said Arne, blushing crimson.</p>

<p>She held her hand before her face, as one does when
the sun shines into the eyes.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" id="Page_143" title="[Pg 143]"></a>
"How did you come here?" he asked, advancing a
few steps.</p>

<p>She put her hand down again, and turned a little towards
him, but then bent her head and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Why do you weep, Eli?" he asked, coming to her.
She did not answer, but wept still more.</p>

<p>"God bless you, Eli!" he said, laying his arm round
her. She leant her head upon his breast, and he whispered
something down to her; she did not answer, but
clasped her hands round his neck.</p>

<p>They stood thus for a long while; and not a sound was
heard, save that of the fall which still gave its eternal
warning, though distant and subdued. Then some one
over against the table was heard weeping; Arne looked
up: it was the mother; but he had not noticed her till
then. "Now, I'm sure you won't go away from me,
Arne," she said, coming across the floor to him; and she
wept much, but it did her good, she said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Later, when they had supped and said good-bye to the
mother, Eli and Arne walked together along the road to
the parsonage. It was one of those light summer nights
when all things seem to whisper and crowd together, as
if in fear. Even he who has from childhood been accustomed
to such nights, feels strangely influenced by them,
and goes about as if expecting something to happen:
light is there, but not life. Often the sky is tinged with
blood-red, and looks out between the pale clouds like an
eye that has watched. One seems to hear a whispering
all around, but it comes only from one's own brain, which
is over-excited. Man shrinks, feels his own littleness,
and thinks of his God.</p>

<p>Those two who were walking here also kept close to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" id="Page_144" title="[Pg 144]"></a>
each other; they felt as if they had too much happiness,
and they feared it might be taken from them.</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe it," Arne said.</p>

<p>"I feel almost the same," said Eli, looking dreamily
before her.</p>

<p>"<em>Yet it's true</em>," he said, laying stress on each word;
"now I am no longer going about only thinking; for
once I have done something."</p>

<p>He paused a few moments, and then laughed, but not
gladly. "No, it was not I," he said; "it was mother
who did it."</p>

<p>He seemed to have continued this thought, for after a
while he said, "Up to this day I have done nothing; not
taken my part in anything. I have looked on ... and
listened."</p>

<p>He went on a little farther, and then said warmly,
"God be thanked that I have got through in this way;
... now people will not have to see many things which
would not have been as they ought...." Then after a
while he added, "But if some one had not helped me,
perhaps I should have gone on alone for ever." He was
silent.</p>

<p>"What do you think father will say, dear?" asked Eli,
who had been busy with her own thoughts.</p>

<p>"I am going over to Böen early to-morrow morning,"
said Arne;&mdash;"<em>that</em>, at any rate, I must do myself," he
added, determining he would now be cheerful and brave,
and never think of sad things again; no, never! "And,
Eli, it was you who found my song in the nut-wood?"
She laughed. "And the tune I had made it for, you got
hold of, too."</p>

<p>"I took the one which suited it," she said, looking
down. He smiled joyfully and bent his face down to
hers.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" id="Page_145" title="[Pg 145]"></a>
"But the other song you did not know?"</p>

<p>"Which?" she asked looking up....</p>

<p>"Eli ... you mustn't be angry with me ... but one
day this spring ... yes, I couldn't help it, I heard you
singing on the parsonage-hill."</p>

<p>She blushed and looked down, but then she laughed.
"Then, after all, you have been served just right," she
said.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it was; nay, it wasn't my fault; it was your
mother ... well ... another time...."</p>

<p>"Nay; tell it me now."</p>

<p>She would not;&mdash;then he stopped and exclaimed,
"Surely, you haven't been up-stairs?" He was so grave
that she felt frightened, and looked down.</p>

<p>"Mother has perhaps found the key to that little
chest?" he added in a gentle tone.</p>

<p>She hesitated, looked up and smiled, but it seemed as
if only to keep back her tears; then he laid his arm
round her neck and drew her still closer to him. He
trembled, lights seemed flickering before his eyes, his
head burned, he bent over her and his lips sought hers,
but could hardly find them; he staggered, withdrew his
arm, and turned aside, afraid to look at her. The clouds
had taken such strange shapes; there was one straight
before him which looked like a goat with two great
horns, and standing on its hind legs; and there was the
nose of an old woman with her hair tangled; and there
was the picture of a big man, which was set slantwise,
and then was suddenly rent.... But just over the mountain
the sky was blue and clear; the cliff stood gloomy,
while the lake lay quietly beneath it, afraid to move; pale
and misty it lay, forsaken both by sun and moon, but the
wood went down to it, full of love just as before. Some<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" id="Page_146" title="[Pg 146]"></a>
birds woke and twittered half in sleep; answers came
over from one copse and then from another, but there was
no danger at hand, and they slept once more ... there
was peace all around. Arne felt its blessedness lying
over him as it lay over the evening.</p>

<p>"Thou great, thou Almighty God!" he said, so that
he heard the words himself, and he folded his hands, but
went a little before Eli that she might not see it.</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI.<br />
<span class="italic">THE DOUBLE WEDDING.</span></h2>


<p>It was in the end of harvest-time, and the corn was
being carried. It was a bright day; there had been
rain in the night and earlier in morning, but now the
air was clear and mild as in summer-time. It was
Saturday; yet many boats were steering over the Swart-water
towards the church; the men, in their white shirt-sleeves,
sat rowing, while the women, with light-colored
kerchiefs on their heads, sat in the stern and the forepart.
But still more boats were steering towards Böen, in readiness
to go out thence in procession; for to-day Baard
Böen kept the wedding of his daughter, Eli, and Arne
Nilsson Kampen.</p>

<p>The doors were all open, people went in and out,
children with pieces of cake in their hands stood in the
yard, fidgety about their new clothes, and looking distantly
at each other; an old woman sat lonely and weeping
on the steps of the storehouse: it was Margit Kampen.
She wore a large silver ring, with several small
rings fastened to the upper plate; and now and then she
looked at it: Nils gave it her on their wedding-day, and
she had never worn it since.</p>

<p>The purveyor of the feast and the two young brides-men&mdash;the
Clergyman's son and Eli's brother&mdash;went
about in the rooms offering refreshments to the wedding-guests
as they arrived. Up-stairs in Eli's room, were the
Clergyman's lady, the bride and Mathilde, who had come<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" id="Page_148" title="[Pg 148]"></a>
from town only to put on her bridal-dress and ornaments,
for this they had promised each other from childhood.
Arne was dressed in a fine cloth suit, round jacket, black
hat, and a collar that Eli had made; and he was in one
of the down-stairs rooms, standing at the window where
she wrote "Arne." It was open, and he leant upon the
sill, looking away over the calm water towards the distant
bight and the church.</p>

<p>Outside in the passage, two met as they came from
doing their part in the day's duties. The one came from
the stepping-stones on the shore, where he had been
arranging the church-boats; he wore a round black
jacket of fine cloth, and blue frieze trousers, off which
the dye came, making his hands blue; his white collar
looked well against his fair face and long light hair; his
high forehead was calm, and a quiet smile lay round his
lips. It was Baard. She whom he met had just come
from the kitchen, dressed ready to go to church. She
was tall and upright, and came through the door somewhat
hurriedly, but with a firm step; when she met Baard
she stopped, and her mouth drew to one side. It was
Birgit, the wife. Each had something to say to the other,
but neither could find words for it. Baard was even
more embarrassed than she; he smiled more and more,
and at last turned towards the staircase, saying as he
began to step up, "Perhaps you'll come too." And she
went up after him. Here, up-stairs, was no one but
themselves; yet Baard locked the door after them, and he
was a long while about it. When at last he turned round,
Birgit stood looking out from the window, perhaps to
avoid looking in the room. Baard took from his breast-pocket
a little silver cup, and a little bottle of wine, and
poured out some for her. But she would not take any,
though he told her it was wine the Clergyman had sent<a class="pagenum" name="Page_149" id="Page_149" title="[Pg 149]"></a>
them. Then he drank some himself, but offered it to her
several times while he was drinking. He corked the
bottle, put it again into his pocket with the cup, and sat
down on a chest.</p>

<p>He breathed deeply several times, looked down and
said, "I'm so happy-to-day; and I thought I must speak
freely with you; it's a long while since I did so."</p>

<p>Birgit stood leaning with one hand upon the window-sill.
Baard went on, "I've been thinking about Nils, the
tailor, to-day; he separated us two; I thought it wouldn't
go beyond our wedding, but it has gone farther. To-day,
a son of his, well-taught and handsome, is taken into our
family, and we have given him our only daughter. What
now, if we, Birgit, were to keep our wedding once again,
and keep it so that we can never more be separated?"</p>

<p>His voice trembled, and he gave a little cough. Birgit
laid her head down upon her arm, but said nothing.
Baard waited long, but he got no answer, and he had
himself nothing more to say. He looked up and grew
very pale, for she did not even turn her head. Then he
rose.</p>

<p>At the same moment came a gentle knock at the door,
and a soft voice asked, "Are you coming now, mother?"
It was Eli. Birgit raised her head, and, looking towards
the door, she saw Baard's pale face. "Are you coming
now, mother?" was asked once more.</p>

<p>"Yes, now I am coming," said Birgit in a broken
voice, while she gave her hand to Baard, and burst into a
violent flood of tears.</p>

<p>The two hands pressed each other; they were both
toilworn now, but they clasped as firmly as if they had
sought each other for twenty years. They were still
locked together, when Baard and Birgit went to the door;
and afterwards when the bridal train went down to the<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" id="Page_150" title="[Pg 150]"></a>
stepping-stones on the shore, and Arne gave his hand to
Eli, Baard looked at them, and, against all custom, took
Birgit by the hand and followed them with a bright
smile.</p>

<p>But Margit Kampen went behind them lonely.</p>

<p>Baard was quite overjoyed that day. While he was
talking with the rowers, one of them, who sat looking at
the mountains behind, said how strange it was that even
such a steep cliff could be clad. "Ah, whether it wishes
to be, or not, it must," said Baard, looking all along the
train till his eyes rested on the bridal pair and his wife.</p>

<p>"Who could have foretold this twenty years ago?"
said he.</p>

<h3>LONDON MORNING POST.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"It includes specimens of all the great masters in the art
of Poetry, selected with the matured judgment of a man concentrated
on obtaining insight into the feelings and tastes of
childhood, and desirous to awaken its finest impulses, to cultivate
its keenest sensibilities."</p></blockquote>


<h3>CINCINNATI GAZETTE.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"The University Press at Cambridge has turned out many
wonderful specimens of the art, but in exquisite finish it has
never equalled the evidence of its skill which now lies before us.
The text, compared with the average specimens of modern books,
shines out with as bright a contrast as an Elzevir by the side of
one of its dingy and bleared contemporaries. In the quality
of its paper, in its vignettes and head-pieces, the size of its
pages, in every feature that can gratify the eye, indeed, the
'Garland' could hardly bear improvement. Similar in its general
getting up to the much-admired Golden Treasury of English
Songs and Lyrics, issued by the same publishers a few months
since, it excels, we think, in the perfection of various minor
details."</p></blockquote>


<h3>NEW YORK WORLD.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"It is a beautiful book,&mdash;the most beautiful in some respects
that has been published for years; going over a large number of
poets and wide range of themes as none but a poet could have
done. A choice cabinet of precious jewels, or better still, a
dainty wreath of blossoms,&mdash;'The Children's Garland.'"</p></blockquote>


<h3>BOSTON TRANSCRIPT.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"It is in all respects a delicious volume, and will be as great a
favorite with the elder as with the younger members of every
family into which it penetrates. Some of the best poems in the
English language are included in the selections. Paper, printing,
and binding,&mdash;indeed, all the elements entering into the mechanical
execution of the book,&mdash;offer to the view nothing wherein
the most fastidious eye can detect a blemish."</p></blockquote>


<h3>SPRINGFIELD REPUBLICAN.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"It is almost too dainty a book to be touched, and yet it is sure
to be well thumbed whenever it falls into the hands of a lover of
genuine poetry."</p></blockquote>

<h3>BOSTON POST.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"Gentlemen, prepare to smile. Here is an interest for a minute
or a dull day. Mark Lemon gives us the result of his recondite
searches and seizures in the regions of infinite jest. Like
all good jesters, he has the quality of sound philosophy in him,
and of reason also, for he discriminates closely, and serves up his
wit with a deal of refinement in it."</p></blockquote>


<h3>HARTFORD PRESS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"So exquisitely is the book printed, that every jest in it shines
like a new gold dollar. It is the apotheosis of jokes....
There is jollity enough in it to keep the whole American press
good humored."</p></blockquote>


<h3>PROVIDENCE JOURNAL.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"Mark Lemon, who helps to flavor Punch, has gathered this
volume of anecdotes, this parcel of sharp and witty sayings, and
we have no fear in declaring that the reader will find it a book of
some wisdom and much amusement. By this single 'Lemon'
we judge of the rest."</p></blockquote>


<h3>CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"This little volume is a very agreeable provocative of mirth,
and as such, it will be useful in driving dull care away."</p></blockquote>


<h3>ST. JOHN'S GLOBE.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"It contains many old jokes, which like good wine become
all the better for age, and many new and fugitive ones which until
now never had a local habitation and a name."</p></blockquote>


<h3>CHICAGO JOURNAL.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"For a fireside we can imagine nothing more diverting or
more likely to be laughed over during the intervals of labor or
study."</p></blockquote>

supernatural being that dwells in the forests and mountains,
called Huldre or Hulla. She appears like a beautiful woman,
and is usually clad in a blue petticoat and a white snood; but
unfortunately has a long tail, which she anxiously tries to conceal
when she is among people. She is fond of cattle, particularly
brindled, of which she possesses a beautiful and thriving
stock. They are without horns. She was once at a merrymaking,
where every one was desirous of dancing with the
handsome, strange damsel; but in the midst of the mirth, a
young man, who had just begun a dance with her, happened to
cast his eye on her tail. Immediately guessing whom he had
got for a partner, he was not a little terrified; but, collecting
himself, and unwilling to betray her, he merely said to her when
the dance was over, 'Fair maid, you will lose your garter.' She
instantly vanished, but afterwards rewarded the silent and considerate
youth with beautiful presents and a good breed of cattle.
The idea entertained of this being is not everywhere the same,
but varies considerably in different parts of Norway. In some
places she is described as a handsome female when seen in front,
but is hollow behind, or else blue; while in others she is known
by the name of Skogmerte, and is said to be blue, but clad in a
green petticoat, and probably corresponds to the Swedish <span class="sic">Skogsnyfoor</span>.
Her song&mdash;a sound often heard among the mountains&mdash;is
said to be hollow and mournful, differing therein from the
music of the subterranean beings, which is described by earwitnesses
as cheerful and fascinating. But she is not everywhere
regarded as a solitary wood nymph. Huldremen and
Huldrefolk are also spoken of, who live together in the mountains,
and are almost identical with the subterranean people. In
Hardanger the Huldre people are always clad in green, but their
cattle are blue, and may be taken when a grown-up person casts
his belt over them. They give abundance of milk. The Huldres
take possession of the forsaken pasture-spots in the mountains,
and invite people into their mounds, where delightful
music is to be heard."&mdash;<i>Thorpe's Northern Mythology.</i></p></div>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
